(5) Relief under this section is not limited to cases of actual or imminent infringement of the guaranteed rights and freedoms, but may, if the court thinks it proper to do so, be given in cases in which there is a reasonable probability of infringement, or in which an action that a person reasonably desires to take is inhibited by the likelihood of, or a reasonable fear of, an infringement.

This can lead to poor emotional health and well-being and to contribute to high risk behaviours, which put their health in jeopardy. Across the region there is an alarming trend towards elevated HIV epidemics among MSM and transgender people. A 2008 study by the Commission on AIDS in Asia predicted that by the year 2020 nearly half of all new HIV infections in Asia would be amongst MSM. In 2012, a report by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) found that in some areas of Asia up to 49 percent of the transgender population were believed to be living with HIV. Available data in Bhutan states that HIV prevalence is very low, below 0.01 percent in the general population, however, there is emerging evidence suggesting that MSM and transgender people are engaging in high levels of HIV-risk behaviours. Furthermore, while the National Strategic Plan-II of Bhutan emphasizes prevention interventions that target MSM, transgender people and other key affected populations there are no specific services (prevention, treatment, care and support) being provided to reduce the vulnerability to HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. It is therefore my pleasure to introduce the Formative Assessment on Stigma and Discrimination Impacting Universal Access to HIV and Health Services for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Bhutan. This is the first ever study to assess the barriers for MSM and transgender people in Bhutan to access health services. It not only makes an effort to identify the level of stigma and discrimination against these groups but also assesses the strengths, limitations and needs of the health services dealing with their sexual health. The study sets out a set of concrete recommendations aimed at addressing the issues that have been identified. Despite the limitations of being able to interview only a small number of MSM and transgender people in the study, a wealth of valuable information has been obtained that will be of immense help for the Ministry of Health and all stakeholders involved in developing better and more inclusive programmes to reach these marginalized groups in Bhutan. This study is an outcome of the collaboration between the Ministry of Health and the UNDP and I would like to take the opportunity to thank both UNDP Bhutan and UNDP Bangkok Regional Hub for their support throughout the study period.

Ethics Board of Health SAMAN South Asia MSM and AIDS Network STI Sexually Transmitted Infections UNAIDS Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS UNDP United Nations Development Programme WHO World Health Organization 7 Executive Summary Executive Summary Background Bhutan has maintained an HIV prevalence below 0.01percent with 297 reported cases as of November 2012. However, increased incidence of sexually transmitted infections in the country remains a major concern for the National AIDS Control Programme. In addition, various surveys on sexual behaviour among sexually active men and women revealed that a significant proportion of male respondents reported same-sex sexual behaviour. The National Strategic Plan-II in Bhutan emphasizes prevention interventions that target MSM, transgender people, and other key affected populations. While the HIV prevalence for MSM and transgender people in Bhutan is still unknown, there is evidence suggesting that there is a high level of HIV-risk behaviours for MSM and transgender people, with no specific services (prevention, treatment, care and support) being provided to reduce these HIV and STI-risk behaviours. A review on legal environments, human rights and HIV responses among men who have sex with men and transgender people in Asia and the Pacific revealed that male-to-male sex is criminalized in 19 out 48 countries of the Asia Pacific region, including Bhutan. It is expected that MSM and transgender people in Bhutan are facing some degree of social discrimination that may increase their HIV-risk behaviours and limit their access to health services. In this context, the National AIDS Control was interested in conducting a formative assessment to assess the barriers for MSM and transgender people to access services, particularly the level of stigma and discrimination perceived by MSM and transgender people and in health care settings. The UNDP Bangkok Regional Hub and UNDP Bhutan provided technical assistance to the NACP to design and conduct this formative assessment that was implemented from January to April 2013. Methods \u2022 Objectives and populations: this formative assessment was aimed at identifying recommendations to develop interventions to reduce social discrimination against MSM and transgender people in Bhutan, and to increase the use of prevention, care and support, and treatment services for these populations. The specific objectives of this formative assessment were: i) to identify level of stigma and discrimination towards MSM, transgender people, and people living with HIV among health care providers in the health care system in Bhutan; ii) to assess strengths, limitations, and needs of health services in dealing with and managing sexual health for MSM and transgender people; iii) to describe social networks of MSM and transgender people; iv) to identify key barriers for accessing health services for MSM and transgender people; v) to describe level of stigma and discrimination experienced by MSM and transgender people in their daily life and when accessing services support and care, and treatment services, particularly for HIV testing and STI screening; and vi) to identify recommendations to reduce stigma and discrimination and implement interventions reaching MSM and transgender people, including youth. \u2022 Design: a cross sectional design with mixed methods (qualitative and quantitative) was used for this formative assessment. The data were collected between January and April 2013 among four distinct populations: health care providers in six selected districts (Thimphu, Sarpang, Samdrupjongkhar, Wangdue, Chukha, and Bumthang), MSM and transgender people in two cities (Thimphu and Phuntsholing), and national stakeholders. \u2022 Data collection procedures and sample size: a structured questionnaire, which included closed-ended and ordered scale questions, was used for health care providers. All in-depth interviews with MSM, transgender people, and health care providers, and key informant interviews with district health officers, were conducted using topics guide. Qualitative interviews were semi-structured using open-ended probing questions and anecdotes to enhance the collection of the qualitative data. Topics discussed during the consultation with stakeholders included the presentation and discussion of the preliminary findings of the formative assessment and the priority interventions for men who have sex with men and transgender people to improve access to relevant services.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3822cbe5-899e-4c2a-b29a-bad34ebe7230": {"__data__": {"id_": "3822cbe5-899e-4c2a-b29a-bad34ebe7230", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Formative Assessment on Stigma and Discrimination Impacting Universal Access to HIV and Health Services for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Bhutan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4db393154a39147c506b4e3e954619e28b0998493b3bd748258b73c65357174b"}, "2": {"node_id": "c37b6bd2-bc53-467c-9b63-9f40b5f70db6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2403fd017a848c044210d51e7df26b0f66b9be57a4cfee40c999590f1d1e32e8"}}, "hash": "9225662257977882d803748f65420a59ca44e4bd1bcd93201b02fb6d33a4f2b4", "text": "8 Formative Assessment on Stigma and Discrimination Impacting Universal Access to HIV and Health Services for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Bhutan \u2022 In-depth interviews with MSM and transgender people: given the social context in Bhutan, it was expected that the number of MSM and transgender people who would be willing to participate to this formative assessment would be limited.

Based on most recent human resources data, 887 health staffs in the 6 selected districts were enumerated and expected to complete the questionnaire (take all approach). \u2022 In-depth interviews with health care providers: in Bhutan, the majority of the HIV care and support and treatment services and centralized in Thimphu. Health care providers working directly on HIV care and support, and treatment were targeted for IDIs. Up to 15 health care providers (doctors, nurses, health assistants, laboratory technicians, and HIV counsellors) were contacted for IDIs. \u2022 Key informant interviews with district health officers: District health officer in each selected district (6 districts) were asked to participate to key informant interviews. A total of 6 district health officers were contacted for the interview. \u2022 Consultation with stakeholders: about 30 stakeholders including NACP, UNDP programme manager (focal point on HIV/AIDS), INGOs and NGOs working on HIV, District Health Officers, and lawyers/policy makers were invited to participate to the consultation \u2022 Data analysis: \u2022 Structured questionnaire: the team identified two major biases during data management: the unit non- response and item non-response. For the former bias, weights inversely proportional to the probability of response were calculated and then standardized for a weighted analysis. For the latter bias, multiple imputations (m = 10) using imputation by chained equations to compensate for missing values, was performed. Frequency for binary and categorical variables, and measures of central tendency for continuous variables were used for the descriptive analysis. Relationships between binary and or categorical variables related either to socio-demographic or professional characteristics were examined by computing the Pearson\u2019s chi-squared test with a 2-sided level of significance of \u03b1 = 0.05. After reversing code, each item of the Likert-scales was analyzed by computing the proportion of each score and the measures of central tendency including mode and quartiles. The Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient was computed to assess the reliability of each Likert-scale. Factor analysis (principal factor) was used for assessing the validity of the scales and for identifying underlying factors. To explore factors associated to \u201cmisconceptions about homosexuality\u201d and \u201chomophobia\u201d, multivariable quantile regression models for the lower (25th percentile) and upper quantile (75th percentile) were fitted. \u2022 In-depth and key informant interviews: qualitative data from were manually analyzed using thematic analysis methods. All in-depth interviews and few of the key informant interviews were conducted in native language (Dzongkha). Following the transcription, the recurring themes were grouped under the predefined topics described in the respective topic guides. After grouping, a summarized theme was developed. Themes were then listed, compared and contrasted by using the method of constant comparison. \u2022 Ethical considerations: the protocol, including tools and consent forms, was reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics Board of Health of Ministry of Health in Bhutan (REBH Approval 2012/033). Informed consent was obtained from all the participants of the formative assessment, except for the stakeholders participating to the consultation. The interviews were anonymous and no name or any other identifiers were collected. The interviews took place in the location where privacy was respected. 9 Executive Summary Key Findings \u2022 Key characteristics of participants: \u2022 In-depth interviews with MSM and transgender people: in total, 6 MSM and 9 transgender people were recruited for the study using both the chain referral and opportunity sampling techniques in the two pre- identified cities of Phuntsholing and Thimphu. The age of the participants ranged from 20-32 years old for MSM, and from 20-26 years old for transgender people. All transgender participants were single, and 2 out of 6 MSM reported being in a long-term relationship with a male partner. \u2022 In depth interviews with health care providers: twenty health care providers currently providing STI/HIV care and treatment were interviewed along with one assistant district health officer (ADHO) and four district officers (DHO).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f29deb5-13fd-4e0a-a186-0beff7e2ecc3": {"__data__": {"id_": "4f29deb5-13fd-4e0a-a186-0beff7e2ecc3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Formative Assessment on Stigma and Discrimination Impacting Universal Access to HIV and Health Services for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Bhutan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c7d81bef678926873c3e1ff4e65ecce5cbc6298f9017be21f8f8cbe4085d6039"}, "2": {"node_id": "92426652-a9c6-4415-9d5a-42df9e67752f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9cba36e2af4121c4d32c28735a91b3e5dd9a7f96a6cfd947930d4faa17c2d3bd"}}, "hash": "531e2d47131d10c020ce9dba3157fa7a4ff3fdd8708cf2422bc88f83d91560ad", "text": "Of the total 20 HCPs, almost one third (seven) were medical doctors and thirteen were health assistants (HA) and assistant clinical officers (ACO).

In addition, among those who sent back the questionnaire, other category of health staff (4 percent) such as ward staff and x-ray technician completed the questionnaire and were classified in the category \u201cother\u201d, and some of the respondents (2 percent) did not mention their function. Using non-adjusted data, the mean age of the participants was 32.4 years olds (versus 31.5 years old with adjusted data) with a minimum and maximum of 20 and 54, respectively. About half of them (45.5 percent) were between 20 and 29 years old. Half of the respondents (50.7 percent) were male (versus 46.4 percent with adjusted data). \u2022 Social and sexual networks of MSM and transgender people Although MSM and transgender people respondents admitted connections with other MSM and transgender people peers, it seemed that they are not organized in networks, but rather in small groups and not really connected to each other. The respondents also revealed locations where MSM and transgender people could discreetly find sexual partners. These locations, as per their description, were not exclusive for these populations. Private parties seemed to be the most common opportunity where MSM socialized with their peers. Virtual interactions, facilitated by international social media (dating websites for \u201cgay\u201d), were also reported by MSM in Bhutan. MSM reported that they were more involved in bisexual behaviours and same-sex sexual behaviour tended to be diffused into the general population, whereas transgender people reported having exclusively male partners. A few MSM respondents mentioned traveling to cities in the region (e.g. Bangkok) for various purposes including meeting with sexual partners as well. Only one MSM and none of transgender people interviewed mentioned commercial male partners (either selling or buying sex services). Their sexual networks seem to include casual and regular male partners only. However, few anecdotes were collected during the design of the formative assessment, bringing to the attention of the team that male sex workers are also operating in Bhutan and mainly serving tourists. \u2022 Stigma and discrimination towards MSM and transgender people Transgender people, unlike MSM, were more likely to be open about their sexuality with their relatives and close friends and appeared to be less isolated. MSM reported strategies for coping with stigma and discrimination from their family and close friends. These strategies included bisexual behaviour, although they reported only being sexually attracted by same sex, to show off they were fitting to the norms of society. Additionally, they tended avoiding social contact with other MSM in public and did not disclose their sexual orientation to health care providers even when they had concerns about their sexual health. These findings suggest a certain level of internalized homophobia (self-stigma) among these populations in Bhutan, particularly for MSM. They also expressed the pressure of the law criminalizing same-sex sexual behaviours in Bhutan. Although nobody has been prosecuted under this law, MSM perceived it as a sword of Damocles, impacting their 10 Formative Assessment on Stigma and Discrimination Impacting Universal Access to HIV and Health Services for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Bhutan relationships with their relatives and close friends, and their health seeking behaviours (e.g., going abroad to access health services), as they still fear to be reported to local authorities and prosecuted. It is noteworthy that transgender respondents were not aware of this law. \u2022 Access to health services for MSM and transgender people While access to health services was not perceived as an issue either for MSM or transgender people, the access to proper health services (i.e. good quality of care and treatment) was described as a critical problem. MSM, as a coping strategy, did not disclose their sexual orientation to their health care providers. For transgender people, even if their gender identity could be more obvious, health care providers did not ask questions about their sexual orientation and behaviours, and transgender people do not talk about it as well. Both MSM and transgender people realized that the lack of disclosure to health care providers could affect the provision of appropriate services. A significant proportion of health care providers also revealed their level of discomfort in discussing sexuality with their clients suggesting that their communication with their client is impaired, particularly with MSM and transgender people. In addition, MSM and transgender people revealed a lack of trust in the health system in Bhutan, particularly the respect of the confidentiality and the privacy of the clients when consulting with health care providers. \u2022 Attitudes of health care providers towards MSM and transgender people Although the majority of health care", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8b515bd0-8239-41ae-b89f-2d090c46eec1": {"__data__": {"id_": "8b515bd0-8239-41ae-b89f-2d090c46eec1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Formative Assessment on Stigma and Discrimination Impacting Universal Access to HIV and Health Services for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Bhutan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d6242f57e2586af59c98778b28e3b9424eeb83ad0e6155277403d4d968fdf37f"}}, "hash": "d6242f57e2586af59c98778b28e3b9424eeb83ad0e6155277403d4d968fdf37f", "text": "providers were in agreement or strong agreement that MSM and transgender people should receive the same level of attention and care, the formative assessment identified a significant level of homophobia, misconceptions about homosexuality, and value-driven stigma that may impact the quality of care provided to these groups. Notably, the level of stigma towards PLHIV was found to be lower and not correlated with value-driven stigma, suggesting that health care providers were more judgmental towards key populations with HIV. The analysis also identified a significant and positive correlation between homophobia and misconceptions about homosexuality. Age of respondents was also found negatively correlated with homophobia and stigma towards PLHIV, and sex of respondents (men vs. women) was positively correlated with misconceptions about homosexuality. In addition, sex of respondents was found as a critical factor for misconceptions about homosexuality in the quantile regression for the lower quantile and persisting for the upper quantile. These findings suggest that male health care providers were more likely to have misconceptions about homosexuality compared to female. However, this association was found neither in our model for homophobia nor when exploring the correlation between these two variables. Similar patterns were found for acquaintance with MSM and transgender people. While this latter factor was found significant in the model for misconceptions about homosexuality, it was not for the model for homophobia. Respondents who reported acquaintance with MSM and transgender people were found with a lower index score in the lower and upper quantile for misconceptions about homosexuality suggesting that the acquaintance with MSM and transgender people had a significant impact in reducing misconceptions about homosexuality. Health care providers who self-reported having a good level of understanding MSM and transgender health issues were found with a lower index score in all our models either for misconceptions about homosexuality or for homophobia in the lower quantile and persisting in the upper quantile. These findings validate that health care providers with a good understanding of these issues have fewer misconceptions and may be less likely homophobic. It also suggests that if the knowledge and skills of health care providers were increased, the level of homophobia and misconceptions about homosexuality among health care providers would likely decrease. \u2022 Limitations of the formative assessment There were critical limitations for this formative assessment. The first limitation was the small number of MSM and transgender people recruited for in-depth interviews. This occurred due to the difficulty in reaching and convincing enough MSM and transgender people to participate and reach the point of data saturation. While we found that some findings were consistent with the literature, we found some difficulties in interpreting other findings such as the social and sexual networks MSM and transgender people. In addition, the low response rate from health care providers (38 percent), despite multiple efforts for increasing the response rate during the follow-up, posed another critical limitation for the analysis of the study. The low response rate was also combined with item non-response (missing values) in the returned questionnaires. Both issues i.e., unit and item non-response resulted in a complex analysis to minimize these biases: weighted analysis on 11 Executive Summary imputed data. Therefore, it is not possible to generalize the findings of this formative research to the entire populations surveyed. The last limitations were related to the Likert-scales used in the questionnaire for health care providers. Although the different scales were pre-tested for the understanding of the items/questions, the team, due to time constraint did not assess the internal consistency of each scale prior to the data collection. While the scales on homosexuality and stigma towards PLHIV were found with a good and acceptable Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient (0.86 and 0.71, respectively), the scale related to attitude towards HIV-related health practices was found with a mediocre coefficient (0.62). Despite an item-test and factor analysis, it was not possible to improve the coefficient for internal consistency. Therefore, only a descriptive analysis was conducted for this scale. In addition, due to the lack of understanding and confusion between the terms \u201cMSM\u201d and \u201ctransgender people\u201d identified among potential participants during the design of the formative assessment and the absence of these translated terms in Dzongkha, the team used in the questionnaire, which was self- administered, a more generic terminology related to behaviour rather than gender identity. For example, in the self-administered questionnaire, it has been decided to assess \u201chomophobia\u201d encompassing attitude towards MSM and transgender people, rather to assess \u201chomophobia\u201d and \u201ctransphobia\u201d respectively. Therefore, it was not possible to assess the difference between the level of homophobia and transphobia that may be different.

We found that transgender people and particularly MSM did not disclose their sexual orientation either to their in-group or out-group circles, including health care providers, due to the their fears of stigma and discrimination. Despite the fact that the existing law criminalizing same-sex sexual behaviour has never been used in Bhutan, MSM, who were more aware of this law compared to transgender people, revealed concerns and fears of being reported to local authorities and prosecuted if they disclose their sexual orientation. They do not trust the health system or health care providers to maintain the confidentiality of their clients. The findings also underlined the feelings of isolation amongst MSM and the non-existence of MSM and transgender organizations or networks. The absence of targeted prevention services and lack of availability of commodities (e.g. condoms and water-based lubricants) also pose a problem for these populations. The formative assessment also found a significant level of homophobia, misconceptions about homosexuality, and value-driven stigma amongst health care providers\u2014in contrast to lower levels of stigma towards PLHIV in general. Health care providers also lack experience and skills in dealing with and managing MSM and transgender clients. They also reported few opportunities to build their capacity either on HIV and AIDS or on male sexual health and to be involved in planning and designing interventions targeted to reduce HIV new infections in Bhutan. Because of the invisibility and also the denial of MSM and transgender people in their country, health care providers do not consider MSM and transgender people as a public health priority. The following recommendations, which include strategies and key activities, were identified during the consultation with stakeholders and revised based on the final findings of the formative assessment. Recommendations for the National AIDS Control Programme: 1. Create an enabling environment for key populations by developing a long-term strategy to reduce stigma and discrimination, to support and sustain the implementation of targeted interventions, and ultimately increase access to prevention, STI, VCT, care and treatment, and legal services for key populations \u2022 Review existing laws and corresponding policies to create a supportive environment for social change and safer behaviours. Policies regarding same-sex sexual behaviour must be addressed directly and comprehensively to promote non-discriminatory attitudes towards key populations, removing potential legal sanctions \u2022 Review policies to support positive attitudes and professional ethics of health care providers towards key populations and encourage compliance with ethical guidelines and standards of care and the protection of the rights of clients to increase access to services (prevention, STI, VCT, and care, support and treatment services) for these populations 12 Formative Assessment on Stigma and Discrimination Impacting Universal Access to HIV and Health Services for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Bhutan \u2022 Review strategies and mechanisms for policy makers, health care providers, ethics committee members and researchers to develop guidelines for obtaining waivers for parental consent to provide care and to research underage (< 18 years old) key populations \u2022 Develop an awareness raising campaign amongst policy makers and parliamentarians on key populations issues in the country, and advocate for the implementation of supportive laws and policies to protect the rights of these populations to access health, legal, and social services. For the latter activity, establish strategic links with global, regional, and sub-regional MSM and transgender networks for possible technical assistance on advocacy and policy \u2022 Develop modules and implement workshops to sensitize health care providers, counsellors, researchers, ethics committee members, journalists, and key media agencies on key populations issues and their professional responsibilities regarding these populations \u2022 Develop interactive campaigns using above the line communication reaching broadly community to address stigma and discrimination towards key populations, and encourage dialogue and community solutions 2. Increase safer sexual and health seeking behaviours among MSM and transgender populations \u2022 Establish a sub-technical working group for MSM and transgender people that includes key stakeholders but as well MSM and transgender representatives, and establish linkages with global, regional, and sub-regional MSM and transgender networks for possible technical assistance on programme development \u2022 Mainstream sexuality and prevention of high-risk sexual practices such as unprotected anal sex practice into any existing prevention programme reaching key populations, including youth and male populations such as taxi-drivers, truck-drivers and uniformed services \u2022 Mobilize existing individuals and groups of MSM and transgender people to set-up peer-support groups in each targeted district. The formation of these support-groups is a first step before the establishment of networks and CBOs for these populations.

Although, it will be more relevant to conduct these surveys directly amongst MSM and transgender people, the absence of established and significant MSM and transgender people networks and the unmarked and diffused same-sex behaviors in Bhutan challenge the implementation of a random sampling approach that is required for these surveys. However, the implementation of these surveys may be considered at later stage. \u2022 Establish strategic linkages with universities in the region to support the development of social science research for building evidence base for HIV prevention programme among MSM and transgender people in Bhutan such as exploration of social and sexual networks, norms, value structures, social and sexual modes of engagement, and understanding of sexuality and sexual health among MSM and transgender people, including youth. 14 Formative Assessment on Stigma and Discrimination Impacting Universal Access to HIV and Health Services for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Bhutan 1. Background and Rationale HIV prevalence and incidence among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender people is increasing in most countries worldwide [1,2]. The levels of HIV prevalence in these countries are substantially higher compared to estimates of the general adult population [1]. In Asia, where HIV counselling and testing uptake among these populations together with the use of HIV care, support and treatment services is already low [3], the level of HIV counseling and testing uptake is much lower in the countries where male-to-male sex", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9ec2da56-97ed-4c52-90a3-064af1880c0e": {"__data__": {"id_": "9ec2da56-97ed-4c52-90a3-064af1880c0e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Formative Assessment on Stigma and Discrimination Impacting Universal Access to HIV and Health Services for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Bhutan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7245946688f0049429a206caa54992ab3a40767fff29a7cf2c2a9748486579b2"}}, "hash": "7245946688f0049429a206caa54992ab3a40767fff29a7cf2c2a9748486579b2", "text": "is criminalized [4]. Bhutan has maintained an HIV prevalence below 0.01 percent with total reported cases of 297 as of November 2012 [5]. However, increased incidence of sexually transmitted infections in the country remains a major concern for the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP). The Bhutan Annual Health Bulletin (2012) described a significant increase of STI incidence from 19 per 10,000 people in 2008 to 26 0/000 in 2009 [6]. Various surveys, which were conducted to study sexual behaviour among sexually active men and women, identified a significant proportion of male also reporting same-sex sexual behaviour. For instance, the General Population Survey in 2006 showed that 1.7 percent of all men in urban areas (2.3 percent of married men in urban areas) reported same-sex sexual behaviour in the past year [7]. The rapid assessment of Sexual Behaviour Network in Thimphu between October 2009 and January 2010 found that 2 percent of men reported that their first sexual partner was of the same sex [8]. Another study in 2009, the National Baseline Assessment among drug users, showed that 3 percent of male drug users reported \u201cever had sex\u2019 with a male partner [9]. It calls for a review of Article 213 of the Penal Code of Bhutan and the use of new guiding principles, many of which promote enabling environments for MSM. The imperative of ensuring universal access and equity in health service delivery were echoed in the remarks of Nima Wangdi, the Honorable Secretary for the Ministry of Health, at the Bhutan National Stakeholders Meeting on Advocacy and HIV Prevention Among MSM and Transgender People in May 2012 [10]. While the HIV prevalence for MSM and transgender people in Bhutan is still not known, there are evidences suggesting that there are high level of HIV-risk behaviours for MSM and transgender people, with no specific services (prevention, care and support, and treatment) being provided to reduce these HIV and STI-risk behaviours [10]. A review on legal environments, human rights and HIV responses among men who have sex with men and transgender people in Asia and the Pacific revealed that male-to-male sex is criminalized in 19 out 48 countries of the Asia Pacific region, including Bhutan. These repressive legal environments marginalize MSM and transgender people and contribute to low access to services [4]. Given the current absence of organized MSM and transgender people groups/networks or community response in Bhutan, as compared to neighboring countries such as Bangladesh, Nepal, and India [11], and consequently the challenges in reaching these populations, it is reasonable to expect that MSM and transgender people in Bhutan are facing some degree of social discrimination that may increase their HIV-risk behaviours and limit their access to relevant health services. Published reviews demonstrated that internalized homophobia, perceived stigma and discrimination have a significant negative impact on both mental and physical health [12\u201315]. In addition, several studies have shown that MSM who experience higher levels of social discrimination are also more likely to engage in risky sexual behaviour, resulting in increased vulnerability to HIV [16\u201318]. In this context, the National AIDS Control was interested in conducting a formative assessment to assess the barriers for MSM and transgender people to access services, particularly the level of stigma and discrimination perceived by MSM and transgender people and in health care settings. The UNDP Regional Centre and UNDP Bhutan provided technical assistance to the NACP to design and conduct this formative assessment that was implemented from January to April 2013. 15 2. Goal & Specific Objectives 2. Goal and Specific Objectives This formative assessment was aimed at identifying recommendations to develop interventions to reduce social discrimination against MSM and transgender people in Bhutan, and to increase the use of prevention, care and support, and treatment services for these populations. The specific objectives of this formative assessment were: \u2022 To identify level of stigma and discrimination towards MSM, transgender people, and people living with HIV among health care providers in the health care system in Bhutan \u2022 To assess strengths, limitations, and needs of health services in dealing with and managing sexual health for MSM and transgender people \u2022 To describe social networks of MSM and transgender people \u2022 To identify key barriers for accessing health services for MSM and transgender people \u2022 To describe level of stigma and discrimination experienced by MSM and transgender people in their daily life and when accessing services support & care, and treatment services, particularly for HIV testing and STI screening \u2022 To identify recommendations to reduce stigma and discrimination and implement interventions reaching MSM and transgender people, including youth 16 Formative Assessment on Stigma and Discrimination", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a89900e1-b6a6-4d53-8bf5-889f8847c58c": {"__data__": {"id_": "a89900e1-b6a6-4d53-8bf5-889f8847c58c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Formative Assessment on Stigma and Discrimination Impacting Universal Access to HIV and Health Services for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Bhutan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "366560cff5cae422e7ff244af2f10bf342f7e0ef3a9482e3f14dd8ba8fcdfef2"}, "3": {"node_id": "96ae5166-c431-4da9-b44d-ff6d8616aba8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7787f67f3ecc57fc5a4393410ca543cdac6b22a98abadfec52bd9d316fe61828"}}, "hash": "d09737bcc579f24e412fe4d8bb3592f9d6ca2feac837c8bd51f458496ce1b94d", "text": "Impacting Universal Access to HIV and Health Services for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Bhutan 3. Methods 3.1 Study design A cross sectional design with mixed methods (qualitative and quantitative) was used for this formative assessment. The data were collected between January and April 2013 3.2 Study population and eligibility criteria This formative assessment research involved four distinct populations: health care providers, men who have sex with men, transgender people, and stakeholders 3.2.1 Health care providers Male and female health care providers from six selected districts (Thimphu, Sarpang, Samdrupjongkhar, Wangdue, Chukha, and Bumthang) were interviewed either through quantitative or qualitative methods. These districts were selected based on their population size and the number of reported HIV cases. In addition, the recent MSM and transgender people size estimation and mapping were also conducted in these districts. \u2022 Quantitative: \u2022 Doctors, nurses, health assistants, laboratory technicians, and HIV counsellors currently working in the health system in 6 districts in Bhutan and who were more likely to be in contact with MSM and transgender patients/clients, were contacted to complete a structured questionnaire \u2022 Qualitative: \u2022 Health care providers working directly with HIV and STIs in these selected districts were recruited to participate in-depth interview \u2022 The District Health Officer in each selected district was recruited to participate in key informant interviews 3.2.2 Men who have sex with men Bhutanese men self-reporting anal or oral sex with another man in the past year, aged 18 years old or more*, and living in the selected districts for at least one year were recruited for in-depth interviews. MSM were recruited in Thimphu and Phuntsholing cities where the estimated number of MSM was estimated higher. MSM reporting age less than 18 years old were excluded from the formative assessment. 3.2.3 Transgender people Bhutanese biological males self-identifying as a \u201ctransgender\u201d or \u201cwoman\u201d, self-reporting anal or oral sex with a man in the past year, aged 18 years old or more\u2020, and living in the selected cities for at least one year were recruited for in-depth interviews. Transgender participants were also recruited in Thimphu and Phuntsholing cities. Transgender people reporting age less than 18 years old were excluded from the formative assessment. No transgender men participated in this study. * Due to the constraints of the ethical guidelines of the REBH i.e., asking parental or guardian consent to interview underage participants, the team decided to recruit participants aged 18 years old or above. However, during the design of the formative assessment and the consultation with stakeholders it has been brought to the attention of the team the existence of underage MSM and transgender people in Bhutan \u2020 Ibid. 17 3. Methods 3.2.4 Stakeholders Stakeholders including NACP, UN family programme manager (focal point on HIV/AIDS), INGOs and NGOs working on HIV, District Health Officers, and lawyers/policy makers were invited to participate to the consultation. 3.3 Operational definitions The following operational definitions were used during the formative assessment \u2022 Fear of HIV transmission through casual contact with people living with HIV (i.e., contact that would not lead to transmission) and through common health care related practices, resulting avoidance of contact with them \u2022 Value-driven stigma: assumptions and judgments made about how people living with HIV had contracted HIV, which are manifested in stigmatizing attitudes \u2022 Homophobia: irrational fear, hatred, discrimination against people who are same-sex attracted, or who are perceived to be same-sex attracted. Through informal discussions with heath care providers, MSM, and transgender people in Bhutan held during the design of the formative assessment, the team identified a lack of understanding and confusion between the terms MSM and transgender, and the absence of these terms in Dzongkha language. Therefore, in the self-administered questionnaire, it has been decided to assess \u201chomophobia\u201d encompassing attitude towards MSM and transgender people, rather to assess \u201chomophobia\u201d and \u201ctransphobia\u201d respectively. \u2022 Internalized homophobia: refers to negative attitudes and feelings that MSM and transgender people have towards themselves because of their sexuality. Internalized homophobia is also termed as self-stigma.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "96ae5166-c431-4da9-b44d-ff6d8616aba8": {"__data__": {"id_": "96ae5166-c431-4da9-b44d-ff6d8616aba8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Formative Assessment on Stigma and Discrimination Impacting Universal Access to HIV and Health Services for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Bhutan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "366560cff5cae422e7ff244af2f10bf342f7e0ef3a9482e3f14dd8ba8fcdfef2"}, "2": {"node_id": "a89900e1-b6a6-4d53-8bf5-889f8847c58c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d09737bcc579f24e412fe4d8bb3592f9d6ca2feac837c8bd51f458496ce1b94d"}}, "hash": "7787f67f3ecc57fc5a4393410ca543cdac6b22a98abadfec52bd9d316fe61828", "text": "Internalized homophobia is also termed as self-stigma. \u2022 Enacted stigma: experiences of discrimination related to being MSM or transgender people such as being discriminated in health settings or at workplace, not willing to access services due to fears of being discriminated, being physically harassed and verbally abused, and being excluded from social gathering 3.4 Data collection procedures Different methods and instruments were developed according to the objectives and populations surveyed as indicated in table 1. 3.4.1 Questionnaire with health care providers A structured questionnaire including closed-ended questions and ordered scale (Likert Scale) was used for health care providers.

Likert scale related to attitude towards people living with HIV and attitude towards health care related practices (sections 5 & 6 of the questionnaire) were adapted from a research on HIV Stigma index in India. The internal consistency reliability for this index was 0.74 (Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient) [21]. The scale related on attitude towards homosexual was adapted from a study which showed a high level of internal consistency (Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient = 0.93), but also a good test-retest reliability (r = 0.71) [22]. These scales were slightly adapted for Bhutan and field-tested to assess the level of understanding of the items. All the items were rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 to 5: \u201cstrongly agree\u201d, \u201cagree\u201d, \u201cno opinion\u201d, \u201cdisagree\u201d, and \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d.

Up to 15 health care providers (doctors, nurses, health assistants, laboratory technicians, and HIV counsellors) were contacted for IDIs. This sample size was expected to be enough to identify meta-themes and obtain data saturation [24\u201326]. \u2022 Key informant interviews The District health officer in each selected district (6 districts) was asked to partake in key informant interviews. A total of 6 district health officers were contacted for the interview. 3.5.2 MSM and Transgender people Given the social context in Bhutan, it was expected that the number of MSM and transgender people, who will be willing to participate to this formative assessment, would be limited. This was confirmed during field visits for the preparation of the formative assessment. It also explains why the investigators did not plan to conduct a quantitative survey with random sampling for these populations. However, it was planned to recruit 10 MSM and 10 transgender people in two selected cities of Thimphu and Phuntsholing (total of 20 MSM and 20 transgender people) to participate to IDIs. These cities were selected based on the preliminary findings of the size estimation exercise that was implemented by another team during the preparation of this formative assessment. This sample size for each concerned population will be enough to identify meta-themes and obtain data saturation [24\u201326]. \u00a7 Communication with Human Resources Department at Ministry of Health, Thimphu, Bhutan, on the 2nd of November 2012 \u00b6 BHU I is considered as a small hospital (below the district hospital in the referral system) staffed with medical doctors and including in- patient service, whereas BHU II is only staffed with health assistants and provides basic health services, including prevention (assimilated to health center). 20 Formative Assessment on Stigma and Discrimination Impacting Universal Access to HIV and Health Services for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Bhutan 3.5.3 Stakeholders Up to 30 stakeholders including NACP, UN family programme manager (focal point on HIV/AIDS), INGOs and NGOs working on HIV, District Health Officers, and lawyers/policy makers were be invited to participate to the consultation. 3.6 Recruitment of participants 3.6.1 Health care providers for the self-administrated questionnaire In each selected district, the District Health Officers were contacted by the NACP through a formal letter issued by the MoH, and a follow-up telecommunication to explain the purpose and the objectives of the formative assessment and obtain their collaboration for the distribution and collection of the questionnaires. During the implementation of the formative assessment, the recruitment strategy was modified to accommodate the poor response rate from the districts due to limited human resource and time constraints as reported by the DHOs. In Thimphu district, the HISC focal person was selected to distribute to and collect the questionnaires from health facilities. One team member of the formative assessment from Thimphu HISC was sent out to collect the questionnaires from the rest of the selected districts. In each district the DHO was contacted to identify health facilities where the questionnaires were not distributed and collected. The focal person then obtained permission from the health facility management for distributing and collecting the questionnaires. The completed questionnaires were collected in the sealed envelopes that were later opened and complied according to district code.

The formative team was divided into two groups with one member from the community in each group. The team then followed the chain-referral sampling technique.

These \u201cseeds\u201d were interviewed and provided with the telephone number of the interviewer to set up an appointment with the referred peer. If the refereed peers did not contact the interviewers, the \u201cseeds\u201d were then re-contacted to reefer new peers. With regard to the opportunity sampling technique, the formative assessment team used the preliminary data of the mapping exercise to identify locations where MSM and transgender people gather in the two selected districts. \u201cGay websites\u201d were also used to identify and recruit potential participants. In these identified physical and virtual locations, the team approached MSM and transgender people to assess the possibility to involve them in the formative assessment. The \u201crecruiter\u201d from the transgender community worked with the interviewers to identify potential participants and build the relationship before starting the interview. Once agreed, the \u201crecruiter\u201d made the necessary arrangements for the interview. 21 3. Methods 3.7 Data management and analysis 3.7.1 Structured questionnaire Two different data clerks using Microsoft Access performed double data entry. Dataset comparison for the validation of data entry was done with Epidata.** After correcting discrepancies and solving inconsistencies, the final dataset was exported to STATA 11\u2020\u2020 for data management and analysis. The team identified two major biases during data management: the unit non-response (respondents who did not answer to the questionnaire), and item non-response (respondents who did not answer to one or more questions i.e., missing value). For minimizing these biases, the following procedures were applied before the analysis: \u2013 The unit non-response: handled by calculating and applying a weight unit inversely proportional to the probability of response. Standardized weights were then calculated for a weighted analysis. \u2013 The item non-response: multiple imputation [27] using imputation by chained equations [28,29] to compensate for missing values, was performed. Prior to conduct the multiple imputation, the patterns of missing values were explored among the variables related to socio-demographic and professional characteristics of the respondents, and then the variables (or items) of the Likert scales: 4 percent of the respondents had no missing values, 88 percent had missing values for 1-10 variables, and 8 percent for more than 10 variables out of 74 variables. To explore the types of missing data, the correlation between missingness on key variables with other variables were assessed. Overall, the majority of the correlations between these variables (correlation matrix) were found from small to moderate suggesting a most at random (MAR) type of missing data. As the fraction of missing information was moderate, 10 imputations (m =10) were performed. Variables, including dependent and independent variables, were used for the imputation, except the variable on \u201creported sexual orientation\u201d and \u201cMSM or transgender acquaintances\u201d. For the latter, the missing values were re-coded as no-answer, leaving the variables with no need for imputation. Frequency for binary and categorical variables, and measures of central tendency for continuous variables were used for the descriptive analysis. Relationships between binary and or categorical variables related to socio- demographic and professional characteristics were examined by computing the Pearson\u2019s chi-squared test with a 2-sided level of significance of \u03b1 = 0.05. Likert-scales: after reversing code, each item of the Likert-scale was analyzed by computing the proportion of each score and the measures of central tendency including mode and quartiles. The Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient was computed to assess the reliability of each Likert- scale. Factor analysis (principal factor) was used for assessing the validity of the scales and for identifying underlying factors. Prior to conduct the factor analysis, the determinant of the matrix of correlation was assessed with the Bartlett\u2019s test for sphericity and the sampling adequacy with the Kaiser-Meyer Olkin (KMO) measure [30,31].", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a7e83356-481c-49f8-9052-13493a168e86": {"__data__": {"id_": "a7e83356-481c-49f8-9052-13493a168e86", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Formative Assessment on Stigma and Discrimination Impacting Universal Access to HIV and Health Services for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Bhutan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7bc4b1c940cacef4cda422727b0683b03a25f41f7e70272898a55c447be0b9c4"}, "2": {"node_id": "9323a79b-f375-46e0-811f-500a8ee2ccdd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f1d473618b5fb9c64830a67420a7f81ecc5a2111c514ab71427960828dc4ac17"}}, "hash": "dd361f592e011ccaf797ff3cb2051f67697887d1dd802298ffa0da96acc04985", "text": "These measures allowed the appropriate usage of the factor analysis by assessing whether there were sufficient correlations within the correlation matrix for proceeding with the factor analysis.

This analysis did not include the exploration of factors associated with other underlying factors extracted through the factor analysis (\u201cstigma towards PLHIV\u201d and \u201cvalue-driven stigma\u201d) as it is assumed that existing explanatory variables may be too limited to give a meaningful interpretation. Before fitting the model, categorical variables with small cells were dichotomized, such as education, function of healthcare providers, basic HIV knowledge, fears of HIV infection through occupational exposure, comfort in discussing sexuality, and level of understanding MSM and transgender health issues. Continuous variables were transformed by 10 years for \u201cage\u201d and by 5 years for \u201cnumber of years working as health care provider\u201d, but kept as continuous variable. Binary variables with small cells such as religion were not explored. Variables related to the index of the other underlying factors (\u201cstigma towards PLHIV\u201d and \u201cvalue-driven stigma\u201d) were kept without any transformation. A first selection of the explanatory variables (or independent variables) was done through bivariate analysis using quantile regression for each selected quantile (lower and upper quantiles). Variables with a p-value < 0.350 were then entered into a multivariable quantile regression using backward stepwise model selection procedure for each selected quantile. The goodness of fit of each model was assessed through the calculation of R-squared and a visual method with a graph of observed values and predicted responses. 3.7.2 In-depth and key informant interviews Qualitative data from the in-depth interviews and key informant interviews were manually analyzed using thematic analysis methods. All in-depth interviews and few of the key informant interviews were conducted in native language. Both in-depth interviews and key informant interviews were tape recorded with the consent of the interviewee. The recordings were then transcribed verbatim from the native language (Dzongkha) and translated into English. During transcription, all personal identifiers were removed and an interview code was assigned to protect confidentiality of the respondent. The research coordinators checked the accuracy of the transcription by randomly choosing about 20 percent of the transcripts and comparing them with the respective audiotapes. Following the transcription, the recurring themes were grouped under the predefined topics. After grouping, a summarized theme, which retained original illustrative quotes to minimize translator biases, was developed. Themes were then listed, compared and contrasted by using the method of constant comparison. Constant comparison is a process through which each piece of data is compared and contrasted with other data to build a conceptual understanding of the categories within the phenomenon of interest. Finally the resulted summarized themes and all representative quotes were drawn from the interviews for the report. 3.7.3 Consultation After data collection and preliminary analysis a consultation with key stakeholders (NACP, UN family focal points on HIV/AIDS, INGOs and NGOs working on HIV, District Health Officers, and lawyers/policy makers) was organized. During this consultation, the preliminary findings of the formative assessment were presented and discussed. Participants were split-up in small groups to discuss the findings and provide inputs and recommendations. These inputs and recommendations were then organized by theme. 3.8 Ethical considerations The protocol, including tools and consent forms, was reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics Board of Health of Ministry of Health in Bhutan (REBH Approval 2012/033).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1ef2f11c-0caf-48b8-b846-aee45657e5b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "1ef2f11c-0caf-48b8-b846-aee45657e5b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Formative Assessment on Stigma and Discrimination Impacting Universal Access to HIV and Health Services for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Bhutan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "470a83a0f83610f6b4fa9410b50986d08a33b3e8066cc14b12b8453529116910"}, "2": {"node_id": "6b44a8ed-12c6-4d53-b303-f3362eb86729", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "363073cd5ce98c42142743405bc48c96039c60646f9a44a3115d1a372c9c78a0"}}, "hash": "b02908de151c79e1506a7a6e44b9b743b7a7cdb93e65c9c913bea0d35d12e564", "text": "Informed consent was obtained through face-to-face contact between the interviewer and the participants partaking in-depth and key informant interviews, and self- administered (included in the questionnaire) for health care providers involved in the quantitative survey.

All transgender participants were currently single, and 2 out of 6 MSM reported being in a long-term relationship with a male partner. The study found a difference in level of education and monthly income between the two sub-populations. Almost all the MSM interviewed were employed, and all had an undergraduate degree, except for one who had recently completed the 12th grade and was waiting for college admission. The monthly income for MSM ranged from Nu 10,000 to Nu 20,000 (~185 to 470 USD), whereas for transgender participants it ranged from Nu 4,000 to Nu 10, 000 (~74 to 185 USD). As opposed to MSM participants, the majority of transgender people were unemployed with no regular source of income.

A 29-year-old MSM in Thimphu clearly echoed the view of other MSM: \u201cI identify myself as gay within the four walls of my room, but to the outside world I am a \u201cman.\u201d What can I say? It is hard for Bhutanese to understand and I am not going to be the first one to explain\u201d - a 29-year-old MSM in Thimphu Unlike MSM participants, the study observed relatively high level of self-confidence amongst transgender people while discussing sexual orientation. All the transgender people participants were \u201copen\u201d about their sexual orientation. \u201c I am transgender people and there is nothing I can do to change it\u2026 I am what I am\u201d - a 27-year-old transgender people in Thimphu In addition, few of the transgender participants have even revealed their sexual orientation to co-workers and till date it has not created any personal or professional issues. 24 Formative Assessment on Stigma and Discrimination Impacting Universal Access to HIV and Health Services for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Bhutan \u201cOne day, I showed up in \u201ckira\u201d (national dress for women) and a [male] co-worker asked me why I was coming in \u201ckira\u201d. I explained that I am a transgender. After looking around, he told me that if I am happy and it does not affect the work, he has no problem. That was the only discussion we had and since then we have never had any further discussion on my sexual orientation\u201d - a 26-year-old transgender person in Thimphu None of the MSM participants have ever had discussed their sexual orientation with family and friends. As mentioned by the participants, the barriers for not disclosing their sexual orientation are socially and culturally enrooted in the Bhutanese society such as: the current cultural and traditional values that define the gender roles and taboos associated in discussing sexuality including same-sex sexual behaviour. They also perceived that the legal environment emphasizes these barriers, as same-sex relationships are still illegal in Bhutan. 4.1.3 Social support The study found different levels of social support for MSM and transgender participants. The majority of MSM to date has not revealed their sexual orientation or intimate life experiences to anyone in their inner circle such as their family and close friends. Therefore, emotional support for MSM is largely non-existent. On the other hand, the majority of transgender respondents reported having a good base for social support from family and friends, as reverberated by a transgender people. \u201cI am happy as I can share my problems with my other transgender people friends and they are always here for me.

Transgender participants generally expressed a high level of acceptance from their close social circle, whereas MSM participants expressed strong fears of stigma and discrimination from family, friends, and the general population at large.

MSM respondents confessed that they hardly know other MSM (who know each other and they can contact when needed). They also expressed reservation and concerns with regard to going out or to be seen together in a group with other MSM peers. 25 4.

While MSM respondents declared to be attracted to same gender only, most of them confessed that they had and still have sexual relationships with female partners. Two MSM participants, who also reported being in a relationship with another man, also revealed a concurrent relationship with a woman.

Interestingly, only one MSM revealed commercial male partners (buying sex services when traveling abroad). The majority of the study participants mentioned casual sex partners only. After probing further on their type of sexual partners, the majority of the MSM mentioned having causal sex with women, married and single men, and transgender people.

Knowing that I did not use condom, I wanted to get checked and get tested for HIV. Upon consultation with a friend, he asked me to go across the border to get my HIV and STI tested. During that period, beside the social and cultural values the sodomy law was also very much in my mind\u201d - a 29-year-old MSM in Thimphu Although none of the study participants directly expressed feelings of shame or self-hate due to their sexual orientation (i.e., internalized homophobia), participants, particularly MSM, shared feelings and situations illustrating self-stigma or internalized homophobia. They shared feelings of isolation that is not corresponding to the Bhutanese society\u2019s norms. Given that MSM were much more \u201chidden\u201d compared to transgender people, their level of fear of being \u201crecognized\u201d as MSM and consequently the feeling of isolation was relatively higher amongst MSM respondents. \u201cYou cannot comprehend how it is to live two lives and constantly be worried about your own identity and the fear that people will judge you because of your behaviour.

They joke and make fun about it casually, not realizing that I too am one of them\u201d - a 31-year-old MSM in Thimphu Some MSM admitted to guarding their emotions and feminine expression when at home, not only to conceal their sexuality but also in an attempt to not to bring any shame to their family members. A few of the MSM interviewed also expressed guilt for not disclosing their sexuality to their family and friend, especially parents. \u201cI am very close to my parents and they have been supportive of my every decision. Sometime I feel that I should disclose my sexuality to my parents, but my greatest fear is losing the respect and love of my parents.

The confusion on when is the appropriate time to disclose their real gender to their boyfriend and the concerns that they will never be able to have a family of an open companionship posed serious concerns and challenges for them. \u201cPeople assume that due to the mismatch of expression and orientation, we are \u201crecognizable\u201d, but you will be surprised by how many are clueless, and at the end we often get rejected due to our sexuality\u201d - a 23-year-old transgender person in Chukkha \u201cI was approached by a good and handsome man and he was genuinely interested in taking the relationship forward.

Everyone was in agreement that they never have been barred or denied access to health services and admitted that for those who did not disclose their sexual orientation or appear feminine, it might not be an issue. However, all of them reported that they have never been asked or disclosed their sexual orientation and behaviours when visiting the hospitals or clinics, even for those who sought treatment for a STI problem. When asking about the conditions for them to disclose their sexuality to health care providers, the majority of participants said that it would depend to the attitude and interpersonal skills of the health care provider \u201cIf the health care provider is nice and caring, then I may be willing to share my sexuality with them otherwise it is unnecessary expose ourselves\u201d - a 27-year-old MSM in Chukkha Some of the participants highlighted the lack of privacy and issues of confidentiality in the heath care setting. \u201cThere are many people queued up and some patients even push the door slightly open to entry as quickly as possible.

Almost all the participants expressed the need to desensitize and build the capacity of health care providers for managing MSM/transgender people health issues. \u201cI don\u2019t blame our caregivers.

For the MSM group the sources of information are mostly through the Internet, newspapers and magazines. On the other hand, TV/ Radios and health information service centers were identified as major sources of information for the transgender participants. It is important to note that in general the respondents reported a low rate of condom and water-based lubricant use during anal sex, mainly due to lack of knowledge related to HIV transmission and prevention (e.g, there are strong assumptions that the probability of HIV and STI transmission is low during anal sex). The participants reported the lack of water-based lubricant in the market and health facilities, and revealed the use of saliva, petroleum jelly, and mustard oil as personal lubricant. Most of them also reported rectal issues such as tears and warts as major health concerns that would require medical attention.

Unlike other HCP, all the medical doctors have spent time abroad during their studies, ranging from 5 to 7 years in total. 4.2.2 Experience and communication with MSM and Transgender people Under this section, the study assessed the general level of awareness, past experiences with the community, and key barriers to discuss sexuality with MSM and transgender people. 4.2.2.1 General awareness and experience with MSM and Transgender people Due to their extended stay outside the country, all the medical doctors were aware of MSM and transgender people, but few had specific training on sexual health. Although the general level of awareness was high among doctors, very few had interactions with MSM and transgender people. During the past three years, three doctors saw a total of eight cases, two of which were clinical case discussions with medical colleagues from other districts. On the other hand, the majority of the HAs/ACOs were not aware of MSM /transgender people. A few became more familiar during the size estimation exercise that was implemented prior to this formative assessment. Out of the thirteen HAs/ACOs, six have already had interactions with transgender people/MSM patients during OPD consultations. Within the networks of friends and family, none of the HCP was aware of MSM/transgender people. Amongst HAs/ACOs, there was a strong assumption that it does not exist in Bhutan and that it is a \u201cwestern\u201d style of living, particularly for MSM. \u201cNow with globalization there are many new ideas and style of living that defer from our traditional values\u2026and I guess this is one of those modern concept which is difficult for our generation to understand\u201d - HA in Sarpang As opposed to HAs/ACOs, medical doctors were more open to the possibility of having MSM/transgender people in Bhutan, but some indicated that it may be a psychological problem that can be treated with proper counselling. \u201cThere is a possibility that it could be due to childhood abuse or absence of male role model given that it more common amongst the younger generation which could be due to the exploration and experimentation behaviour\u201d - a 35-year-old Doctor in Phuntsholing 4.2.2.2 Barriers to discuss sexuality with MSM and Transgender people During the interviews, the majority of the HAs/ACOs highlighted that they are in fact challenged by the limited knowledge and understanding about MSM/transgender people sexual health issues in Bhutan. \u2021\u2021 Assistant Clinical Officers are Health Assistants with clinical skills and based for the majority in hospital or BHU I, whereas Health Assistants are mainly based at BHU II 31 4.

None of the HCPs interviewed reported that they have heard or observed any discrimination against MSM and transgender people in health facilities in Bhutan.

However, they expressed the need in the future to disseminate it widely, and to involve health care providers during the design, implementation and evaluation of the strategy. As for other HCP interviewed, DHOs and ADHOs thought that MSM/ transgender health is a not a public health priority in Bhutan considering other emerging non-communicable diseases such as hypertension, cancer, and diabetes. 4.3 Quantitative survey among HCP 4.3.1 Descriptive Analysis 4.3.1.1 Respondent-rate by district and health care provider category A total of 317 out of 887 health care providers responded to the questionnaire. The overall response rate was 38 percent ranging from 25 percent in Thimphu to 83 percent in Bumthang district. The table 4 shows the number of respondents by district and category of health care providers. The response rate among health care providers ranged from 7 percent among nurse assistant to 65 percent among health assistant. A total of 4 out of 5 HIV counsellors working in Health Information Service Center (HISC) in Thimphu and Chhukha districts responded to the questionnaire. In addition, among those who sent back the questionnaire, other health staff (4 percent) such as ward staff and x-ray technicians completed the questionnaire and were classified in the category \u201cother.\u201d Some of the respondents (2 percent) did not mention their function.

Likewise, the proportion of respondents who self-reported a \u2018comfortable\u2019 or \u2018very comfortable\u2019 level of comfort in discussing sexuality with patient was higher among those who had received an education on sexual health during formal education compared to those who did not (64.1 percent vs. 44.6 percent; p=0.014), and those who attended a training course on sexual health during extra-curricular activities (66.4 percent vs. 44.7 percent; p=0.012). However, there were no statistically significant difference between those who attended a HIV training and hose who did not (55.1 percent vs.46.2 percent ; p = 0.086). The figure 5 depicts the level of HIV knowledge (basic knowledge on HIV transmission and prevention) and the level of fears of HIV infection through professional exposure. With regard to HIV knowledge, almost half (47 percent) of health care providers had a high level of knowledge, whereas for 57 percent reported a moderate or high level of fear of HIV infection through occupational exposure. Respondents who attended an HIV training course, compared to those who did not, had a higher level of HIV basic knowledge: 51.8 percent versus 42.6 percent (p<0.05). However, for those who did not attend an HIV training course the level of fears of HIV infection was lower compared to those who did attend a training: 50.9 percent versus 62.3 percent (p<0.01).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29c84b07-2fef-41d2-8919-1abe6c9508d1": {"__data__": {"id_": "29c84b07-2fef-41d2-8919-1abe6c9508d1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Formative Assessment on Stigma and Discrimination Impacting Universal Access to HIV and Health Services for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Bhutan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0899a0e389c27e2ef4e5360e2dfe0ce7a39bba3858dafb67a07ab906296928aa"}, "2": {"node_id": "388ac6d5-1149-444c-808e-82f14431779f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9b39e27e2b3255795defe3dd8bc451c7727cebc6819825596ff2bc84574d2455"}}, "hash": "31b324fdcd843ae2fa79bfc25199cb7c4b670f44c608296b83510cb60da91558", "text": "Figure 5: Level of HIV knowledge and fears of HIV infection through professional exposure 26% 27% 47% 43% 43% 14% 0% 20% 40% 60% Low Level Moderate Level High Level Low Level Moderate Level High Level Level of Basic HIV Knowledge Level of Fears of HIV Contagion through Professional Exposure Percentage N = 317 (weighted count/imputed data) 4.3.1.4 Professional experience with MSM and Transgender people In terms of professional experience with MSM and transgender people, 10 (3 percent) health care providers reported ever had MSM or transgender people patient.

These variables were not imputed keeping the non-response (i.e., missing value) recorded as \u201cno answer\u201d as depicted in the figure 7. The non-response proportion for these 2 indicators was 38.8 percent and 7.5 percent respectively. Interestingly, 2.7 percent of respondents revealed a current homosexual behaviour, 11.0 percent a bisexual behaviour, and 47.4 percent reported exclusively sex with opposite gender i.e., a heterosexual behaviour. The majority of respondents (87.9 percent) declared that they have never had a MSM or transgender person as a friend, relative, co-worker or neighbor.

The first pattern was found with the items 1, 2, and 9-12 (6 out of 12 items) reflecting an agreement or strong agreement with these items and indicating a relatively high level of positive and respectful attitude towards PLHIV. Only a few respondents (ranging from 1 percent to 7 percent) stated disagreement or strong disagreement for these items, underlying a more stigmatizing attitude towards PLHIV. The proportion of respondents who were undecided or avoided extreme response categories ranged from 7 percent to 18 percent for these items. The second pattern was observed with the items 3-8\u00a7\u00a7 (6 items) and reflects more judgmental attitude towards key populations who are HIV positive (value-driven stigma), except for the item # 3, which was related to HIV positive pregnant women. For the items 4-8, the proportion of respondents, who recorded a disagreement or strong disagreement, ranged from 35 percent to 60 percent, reflecting a significant level of value- driven stigma.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b780d34c-61db-46be-8dfb-9bdc65f2424c": {"__data__": {"id_": "b780d34c-61db-46be-8dfb-9bdc65f2424c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Formative Assessment on Stigma and Discrimination Impacting Universal Access to HIV and Health Services for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Bhutan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5bd5d3198ecf853742d86cae1d57a83f10cebc38417f6b944e1ddf215c4e2c22"}, "2": {"node_id": "aaa61660-c92b-4e5b-be16-e301e648af5e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "09db2842cf64726c8ae6c02f5bb45f9947cf913d1634d95a43bba2a66a1e7d5b"}}, "hash": "1adbcfbed32b8cfaa0e284f8581437ca7d4afafcdf2e5a48404f143cb35c6c73", "text": "With regard to the respondents who expressed a non-judgmental attitude (i.e, with agreement or strong agreement) the proportions ranged from 23 percent to 41 percent, respectively.

For these items, the proportion of respondents with an agreement or strong agreement ranged from 62 percent to 89 percent, whereas the proportion of respondents with a disagreement or strong disagreement ranged from 6 percent to 26 percent. Between 2 percent to 15 percent of the respondents were undecided or avoided extreme response categories ranged from for these items. With regard to items #6 and #10, the interpretation of the level of agreement/disagreement is done in taking in consideration the scores of the item #1 that is describing a high level of agreement and strong agreement on the \u201cnecessity to obtain consent before HIV testing\u201d. Therefore, the majority of respondents were in agreement and strong agreement to propose an HIV test to all pregnant women and patients undergoing a surgery, after obtaining their consent. Due to a lack of clarity in the formulation of the item #4, the interpretation of the scores poses a problem since these scores given by the respondents to this item were not consistent with the score of item #1. \u00b6\u00b6 For the sake of clarity, proportions < 5 percent are not displayed in the graph 40 Formative Assessment on Stigma and Discrimination Impacting Universal Access to HIV and Health Services for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Bhutan Figure 10: Scale \u201cAttitude towards HIV-related health practices\u201d: distribution of responses*** 33% 35% 22% 58% 45% 74% 34% 13% 22% 44% 43% 40% 31% 44% 33% 38% 22% 39% 26% 40% 36% 32% 12% 15% 14% 6% 12% 15% 12% 7% 7% 8% 14% 11% 5% 8% 8% 30% 17% 9% 12% 8% 5% 8% 6% 17% 9% 6% 11.

These measures supported a factor analysis for the scale on \u201cattitude towards PLHIV\u201d and \u201chomophobia\u201d, but the KMO for the scale of health practice was low (mediocre) as well as the Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 coefficient. Despite these results for the latter scale, we proceeded to a factor analysis with different rotations, but no meaningful underlying factors were identified. Therefore, the results of the factor analysis for the scale on health practice are not presented in this report. \u2020\u2020\u2020 For the sake of clarity, proportions < 5 percent are not displayed in the graph 42 Formative Assessment on Stigma and Discrimination Impacting Universal Access to HIV and Health Services for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Bhutan Table 7: Cronbach\u2019s alpha, Bartlett\u2019s test of sphericity, and Kaiser-Meyer Olkin index Scales (N* = 317) Attitude Tw.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c75075ce-5ba7-4d0f-9d46-89a75612f075": {"__data__": {"id_": "c75075ce-5ba7-4d0f-9d46-89a75612f075", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Formative Assessment on Stigma and Discrimination Impacting Universal Access to HIV and Health Services for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Bhutan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5d1c28a4ddf729341e5c8e125c66dd66d31d41362521b0a3a8e587c0f49de2e3"}, "2": {"node_id": "36097b45-011c-4c36-aede-559b00e4f586", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "47e4063205d0b6eba01db87886c4efb8c4f95bbaf0e5dcc72933b5e1305c8ab8"}}, "hash": "234b8a5a9e4fbfdcfbdbd66074c804397708ac577b231d5c39735893884940cd", "text": "PLHIV Health Practice Homophobia Number of items 12 11 21 Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 coefficient 0.72 0.62 0.86 Bartlett\u2019s test of sphericity Chi-square p-value 1699.10 <0.001 458.93 <0.001 1941.94 <0.001 Kaiser-Meyer Olkin index 0.80 0.66 0.86 * Weighted count/Data imputed A factor analysis (principal factor) was performed on weighted and imputed data, for the scale on \u201cattitude towards PLHIV\u201d and \u201chomophobia\u201d.

Discussion The formative assessment first highlighted the difficulty of reaching MSM and to a lesser extent transgender people in the different districts targeted by this assessment. During the different phases of the implementation of the formative assessment i.e., field preparation, pre-testing tools, and data collection, the team, which also included interviewers from the transgender groups, faced challenges in connecting with and recruiting these populations. Previous surveys among sexually active male and female populations in selected districts in Bhutan revealed the existence of same-sex sexual behaviour among male or female respondents in urban [7,8] and rural areas [7]. About 2 percent of male respondents reported male-to-male sex behaviours: 2.3 percent among married males in urban and 1.5 percent in rural area (12 months prior to the interview), and 2 percent among male patronizing entertainment venues. The most recent study also indicated that about 12 percent of male respondents (vs. 9 percent of female) declared knowing at least one MSM in Bhutan [8]. All these male respondents reported sex with female partners as well. This formative assessment also identified same-sex sexual behaviour among health care providers, who self-completed the questionnaire, but with a higher level as compared to the previous mentioned studies. Although MSM and transgender respondents admitted connections with other MSM and transgender peers, it would seem that they are not organized in networks, but rather in small groups and not really connected to each other. Places where MSM and transgender people can discreetly find their sexual partners exist, but these places are not exclusive for these populations. These places are also recognized as locations where MSM and transgender people socialize with their friends, but not only with their MSM and transgender people peers. Private parties seem to be the most common opportunity where MSM meet for socializing with their peers. Virtual spaces, facilitated by international social media (dating websites for \u201cgays\u201d), are also used by MSM in Bhutan, but the number of active profiles in Bhutan is still limited. It is noteworthy that a significant number of the posted profiles onto these dating websites does not included picture of the person. Given the social context, one could speculate that this absence of picture is related to the fear of being recognized and because Bhutan is a small country \u201cwhere everybody knows everybody\u201d,\u00b6\u00b6\u00b6 this fear is understandable. The team also explored the possibility of contacting and recruiting MSM through these websites, but to no avail. All of them, but one during the design of the study, refused to meet physically for a discussion.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "19f2507b-345b-4ccb-8635-9c9fabd7e388": {"__data__": {"id_": "19f2507b-345b-4ccb-8635-9c9fabd7e388", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Formative Assessment on Stigma and Discrimination Impacting Universal Access to HIV and Health Services for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Bhutan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "90b641bcd3138b878f510d6c665330a05b8229823b21ff25abbcc3fbc34514f7"}, "2": {"node_id": "3a8ed923-5c3b-4eae-a179-40faa94ca3a5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "82a981044dc6507198f853d7072db39aad102d6c84838a783a803aa8274bed3c"}}, "hash": "8d64d45333178efb98c3b4c743c561dbec8969502d9eccd150de8e3618d96805", "text": "Although there is strong evidence that MSM and transgender populations exist in Bhutan, it seems that most MSM do not derive an identity from their same-sex attraction and behaviours. Most are sexually involved with women as well as with men, and aim to fulfill the expectations of mainstream society and family that they get married and establish a family. Transgender people, in contrast, tend to have exclusively male partners and are more visible. Same-sex behaviours in Bhutan are less marked and more diffuse, and are not expressions of belonging to a \u201cgay community\u201d. This is both caused by, and the cause of, the non-existence of specific \u201cgay\u201d entertainment locations aimed at facilitating sexual contacts with high numbers of different partners.

This is in sharp contrast to other capital cities in Asia where the number of new HIV infections among these populations is still increasing [3]. Nevertheless, some of the MSM respondents mentioned traveling to cities in the region (e.g., Bangkok) for various purposes including meeting with sexual partners as well. It is noteworthy that only one MSM mentioned commercial male partners when traveling abroad, but for the remaining respondents, their sexual networks appears to include casual and to a lesser extent regular male partners. Through informal communication during the design of the formative assessment, it has been brought to the attention of the team that there were male sex workers also operating in Bhutan and mainly serving tourists. This has not been confirmed during the data collection, as the team was not successful in penetrating these networks. However, commercial sex is not uncommon in Bhutan. One study on sexual networks in Bhutan found a significant proportion of male and female respondents patronizing entertainment establishments and public places revealed commercial sexual partners: 32.5 percent of males and 1.5 percent of females declared ever having paid for sexual services, whereas 3.5 percent of male and 8.2 percent of female reported ever had received money in exchange of services [8]. However, it was not clear in the report \u00b6\u00b6\u00b6 Communication with a MSM during the design of the formative assessment 51 5. Discussion whether the latter male respondents, who received money, engaged in sex with male or female partners. The absence of organized networks for MSM and to a lesser extent for transgender people may certainly challenge the implementation of targeted interventions or research or surveillance study e.g., integrated behavioural and biological surveillance or behavioural surveys, among these populations. Transgender people as opposed to MSM are more likely to be open about their sexuality with their relatives and close friends. They are perceived to be less isolated compared to MSM who have developed strategies coping with stigma and discrimination from their family and close friends. These strategies include bisexual behaviour, although they reported only being sexually attracted to male, to show off they are fitting to the norms of the society, and avoidance behaviours such as avoiding social contact with other MSM peers in public, and not disclosing their sexual orientation to health care providers even when facing sexual health issues. These feelings and situations mentioned by the participants such as feeling of isolation, fears of being identified in public, social discomfort with other MSM or transgender people, and coping strategies, which as been identified as key dimensions associated with internalized homophobia in key studies [33,34], strongly suggest a certain level of internalize homophobia among these populations in Bhutan, particularly for MSM. They also expressed the pressure of the law criminalizing same-sex sexual behaviours in Bhutan. Although nobody has been prosecuted under this law, MSM perceived it as a sword of Damocles impacting their attitudes towards their relatives and close friends, and their health seeking behaviours (e.g., going abroad to access health services), as they still fear to be reported to local authorities and prosecuted. It is noteworthy that transgender people respondents were not aware of this law. Although it has not been directly explored, these findings suggest that transgender people and MSM have experienced diverse stressful life events related to stigma and discrimination that may have impacted their mental health status to different degree [12\u201315], and consequently may became involved in high-risk behaviours [16\u201318,35]. While access to health services is not perceived as an issue either for MSM or transgender people, the access to proper health services (i.e. good quality of care and treatment) poses a critical problem. As described in different studies, MSM, as a coping strategy, avoid disclosing their sexual orientation to their health care providers [36\u201339]. This is consistent with the findings of our formative assessment. For transgender people, even if their sexual orientation could be more obvious, health care providers do not ask questions about their sexual orientation, and transgender people do not talk about it as well. Both MSM and transgender people realized that the lack of disclosure to health care providers might affect the provision of appropriate services as clearly demonstrated in a recent research [40]. A significant proportion of health care providers also revealed their level of discomfort discussing sexuality with their clients suggesting that their communication with their client is impaired, particularly with MSM and transgender people. Several studies have clearly identified factors associated with lack of communication skills of health care providers when discussing sexuality: embarrassed feelings, complexity and sensitivity", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29b29fe8-3adf-4ca4-a8fd-bee161771020": {"__data__": {"id_": "29b29fe8-3adf-4ca4-a8fd-bee161771020", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Formative Assessment on Stigma and Discrimination Impacting Universal Access to HIV and Health Services for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Bhutan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a9eb7bfce43ee78c98c7fb4aed87c7891aa78167b4e03c386e9d50ffd39979a9"}}, "hash": "a9eb7bfce43ee78c98c7fb4aed87c7891aa78167b4e03c386e9d50ffd39979a9", "text": "of discussing same-sex sexual behaviour with their clients, time constraints, and lack of skills and expertise [41\u201344]. As it was also mentioned by one of the health care providers interviewed, the assumption of assuming that all patients are heterosexual is not uncommon [42,44]. It could also explain the low proportion of health care providers (3 percent) who reported ever had a MSM or transgender people as a client. In addition, the formative assessment also identified a low level of trust towards the health system, particularly the respect of the confidentiality and the privacy of the clients when consulting health care providers. Although the majority of health care providers (88 percent) were in agreement or strong agreement that MSM and transgender people should receive the same level of attention and care, the formative assessment identified significant levels of homophobia, misconceptions about homosexuality, and value-driven stigma that could impact the level of quality of care provided to these populations. However, stigma towards PLHIV was found lower and not correlated to value-driven stigma suggesting that health care providers have more negative attitude or are more judgmental towards HIV positive key populations such as PWID, FSWs, MSM and transgender people, and homophobic attitudes. While it may be not the case for all health care providers, as we found a significant level of the population surveyed with low index scores, this is however consistent with the perceptions of the MSM and transgender people had towards their health care providers and could also explain the difficulty for them to disclose their sexual orientation. Interestingly, the findings of the descriptive analysis of the items of the scale on homophobia showed that health care providers reported a higher level of acceptance of MSM and transgender as friend, neighbors, or co-workers 52 Formative Assessment on Stigma and Discrimination Impacting Universal Access to HIV and Health Services for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Bhutan compared to level of acceptance of having a son or daughter \u201chomosexual\u201d or having a \u201chomosexual\u201d teacher for their children. While it shows a certain level of tolerance vis-\u00e0-vis homosexuals in their social environment, it is more difficult to accept when it is happening directly to a close member of their family. These may due to the fears of losing hopes and dreams of their children, the loss of a traditional life matching with the norms of the society [45] and reinforced by conflicting beliefs and misconceptions about homosexuality. Age of respondents was found negatively correlated with homophobia and stigma towards PLHIV implying that older health care providers were less likely homophobic and reported more positive attitude towards PLHIV. In addition, sex of respondents (male vs. female) was only positively correlated with misconceptions about homosexuality and found as a critical factor for misconceptions about homosexuality in the quantile regression for the lower quantile and persisting for the upper quantile. These findings suggest that male health care providers were more likely to have misconceptions about homosexuality compared to female. However, the analysis did not identify any association between sex of respondent and homophobia either when exploring the correlation between these two variables or in the quantile regression model for homophobia. This latter finding is not really consistent with literature where it is found that females are less likely to be homophobic than males [46,47]. However, because these studies were done among the general population and young students, it may not be possible to compare. Similarly, patterns were found for acquaintance with MSM and transgender people. While this latter factor was found significantly associated with misconceptions about homosexuality in the quantile regression, it was not for the model for homophobia. Respondents who reported acquaintance with MSM and transgender people were found with a lower index score in the lower and upper quantile for misconceptions about homosexuality, suggesting that the health care providers who reported an acquaintance with MSM and transgender people were less likely to have misconceptions about homosexuality. This finding is consistent with the latter study mentioned [47] that clearly demonstrated that the acquaintance of MSM and transgender people was also a determinant factor to reduce level of homophobia among general population. Health care providers who reported having a good level of understanding MSM and transgender people health issues were found with a lower index score in all our models either for misconceptions about homosexuality or for homophobia in lower quantile and persisting in the upper quantile. These findings validate that health care providers with good understanding of these issues have fewer misconceptions and may be less likely homophobic.

A significant number of health care providers reported attending a training course on male sexual health either during their education or extra-curricular activities. In our models, an association was found among respondents who reported male sexual health training during their education, but this association revealed that these respondents had a higher index score for misconceptions (upper and lower quantile) and homophobia (upper quantile only), suggesting that they were more likely to be homophobic and to have misconceptions about homosexuality. Unfortunately, no questions were asked about the content of their curriculum, but it is suspected that their curriculum may not correctly address the sexual needs of MSM and transgender people. Attending other training courses (i.e. HIV and AIDS training or male sexual health training during extra-curricular activities) did not identify relevant findings in our models. However, in bivariate analysis, respondents, who attended these training courses, had a higher level of understanding of MSM and transgender health issues and comfort in discussing sexuality with patients, compared to those who did not attend these training courses. There were critical limitations for this formative assessment. The first limitation was the small number of MSM and transgender people recruited for in-depth interviews due to the impossibility to reach and convince enough MSM and transgender people to participate in the formative assessment, and to reach the point of data saturation during the analysis. While some findings were consistent with the literature, we also found some difficulties in interpreting other findings such as the social and sexual networks MSM and transgender people. Furthermore, during the design of the formative assessment it has been brought to the attention of the team the existence of underage MSM and transgender people, which was also confirmed by national stakeholders during the consultation. However due to the constraints of the ethical guidelines in Bhutan, it was decided to include only participants aged 18 years old or above. Therefore, this formative assessment may have missed some critical information describing different opinions and situations for this specific sub-segment of MSM and transgender people. In addition, the low response rate from health care providers (38 percent), despite multiple efforts for increasing the response 53 5. Discussion rate during the follow-up, posed another critical limitation for the analysis of the study. Low response rate among health care providers is not uncommon in the literature [48\u201350] and particularly when asking about their sexual orientation [49]. The low response rate was also combined with item non-response (missing values) in the returned questionnaires. Both issues i.e., unit and item non-response resulted in a complex analysis to minimize these biases: weighted analysis on imputed data. Therefore, it is not possible to generalize the findings of this formative research to the entire populations surveyed. The last limitations were related to the Likert-scales used in the questionnaire for health care providers. Although the different scales were pre-tested for the understanding of the items/questions, the team, due to time constraint did not assess the internal consistency of each scale prior to the data collection. While the scales on homosexuality and stigma towards PLHIV were found with a good and acceptable Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient (0.86 and 0.71, respectively), the scale related to attitude towards HIV-related health practices was found with a mediocre coefficient (0.62). Despite an item-test and factor analysis, it was not possible to improve the coefficient for internal consistency. Therefore, only a descriptive analysis was conducted for this scale. In addition, due to the lack of understanding and confusion between the terms \u201cMSM\u201d and \u201ctransgender people\u201d identified among potential participants during the design of the formative assessment and the absence of these translated terms in Dzongkha, the team used in the questionnaire, which was self-administered, a more generic terminology related to behaviour rather than gender identity. For example, in the self-administered questionnaire, it has been decided to assess \u201chomophobia\u201d encompassing attitude towards MSM and transgender people, rather to assess \u201chomophobia\u201d and \u201ctransphobia\u201d respectively. Therefore, it was not possible to assess the difference between the level of homophobia and transphobia that may be different. 54 Formative Assessment on Stigma and Discrimination Impacting Universal Access to HIV and Health Services for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Bhutan 6.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "72e29417-263c-484b-9d06-130bcfc92cc3": {"__data__": {"id_": "72e29417-263c-484b-9d06-130bcfc92cc3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Formative Assessment on Stigma and Discrimination Impacting Universal Access to HIV and Health Services for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Bhutan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6de150c7869ca036c429cedf3f62fc7e29ef2be0ff8156e8305948230c8c1ded"}, "2": {"node_id": "becf37d3-7b6c-4c67-b26a-4ca92d035e8e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/formative-assessment-stigma-and-discrimination-impacting-universal-access-hiv-and-health-services-men-who-have-sex-men-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dcc43af8138275ab23e847571e08141f590321a1fc9a5d60f46acf38b35f67af"}}, "hash": "7011b0d6bf7270dc87053abc09bbc5c92e0979483de3a507835440d638bc970e", "text": "Conclusions and Recommendations The formative assessment highlighted the barriers faced by MSM and transgender people to access appropriate services responding to their sexual health needs.

Despite the fact that the existing law criminalizing same-sex sexual behaviour has never been used in Bhutan, MSM, who were aware about this law compared to transgender people, reported concerns and fears of being reported to local authorities and prosecuted if they disclose their sexual orientation. They do not trust the health system or health care providers to maintain confidentiality of their clients. The findings also underlined the feelings of isolation, particularly for MSM and the non-existence of MSM and transgender people organizations or networks. The absence of targeted prevention services and lack of availability of commodities (such as condoms and water-based lubricants) also pose a problem for these populations. The formative assessment also found a significant level of homophobia, misconceptions about homosexuality, and value-driven stigma amongst health care providers\u2014in contrast to lower levels of stigma towards PLHIV in general. Health care providers also lack of experience and skills in dealing with and managing MSM and transgender people clients. They also reported few opportunities to build their capacity either on HIV/ AIDS or on male sexual health and to be involve in planning and designing interventions targeted to reduce HIV new infections in Bhutan. Because of the invisibility and also the denial of MSM and transgender people in their country, health care providers do not consider MSM and transgender people as a public health priority. The preliminary findings of the formative assessment were presented and discussed during a consultation meeting held in Thimphu in April 2013 with key stakeholders including four transgender people. The following strategies and key activities were identified during the consultation and revised based on the final findings of the formative assessment. Recommendations are aimed to reduce the number of new infections amongst MSM and transgender people by increasing their access to services including preventions, VCT and STI, and care & support and treatment services. These recommendations address in priority the key issues identified through the formative assessment and discussed during the consultation. The first strategy, which is related to the development of an enabling environment, targets mainly key populations such as men who have sex with men, transgender people, female sex workers, and people who inject (and take) drugs, whereas the remaining strategies are specifically recommended for addressing issues and needs of MSM and transgender people in Bhutan. Recommendations for the National AIDS Control Programme: 1. Create an enabling environment for key populations by developing a long-term strategy to reduce stigma and discrimination, to support and sustain the implementation of targeted interventions, and ultimately increase access to prevention, STI, VCT, care and treatment, and legal services for key populations \u2022 Review existing laws and corresponding policies to create supportive environment for social change and safer behaviours. Policies regarding same-sex sexual behaviour must be addressed directly and comprehensively to promote non-discriminatory attitudes towards key populations, removing potential legal sanctions \u2022 Review policies to support positive attitudes and professional ethics of health care providers towards key populations and encourage compliance with ethical guidelines and standards of care and the protection of the rights of clients to increase access to services (prevention, STI, VCT, and care, support and treatment services) for these populations \u2022 Review strategies and mechanisms for policy makers, health care providers, ethics committee members and researchers to develop guidelines for obtaining waivers for parental consent to provide care and to research underage (< 18 years old) key populations \u2022 Develop an awareness raising campaign amongst policy makers and parliamentarian on key populations issues in the country, and advocate for the implementation of supportive laws and policies to protect the rights of these 55 6. Conclusion and Recommendations populations to access health, legal, and social services. For the latter activity, establish strategic link with global, regional, and sub-regional MSM and transgender people networks for possible technical assistance for advocacy and policy \u2022 Develop modules and implement workshops to sensitize health care providers, counsellors, researchers, ethics committee members, journalists, and key media agencies on key populations issues and their professional responsibilities regarding these populations \u2022 Develop interactive campaign using above the line communication reaching broadly community to address stigma and discrimination towards key populations, and encourage dialogue and community solutions 2.

The development of a blog or forum online, which could be managed by the peer- support groups, could be envisaged for MSM. 3. Strengthen the national strategic information framework by including key information on prevalence of same-sex sexual behaviours, high-risk behaviours, and HI and STI, and knowledge about this population \u2022 Review and standardize programme indicators for MSM and transgender people including reached through peer-outreach, access to commodities, and access to services such as VCT, STI and treatment. The data should be disaggregated by sub-populations i.e., MSM and transgender people, and also by key age groups at health services and at prevention programme level \u2022 Explore the possibility to implement a more accurate size estimation for MSM and transgender people by using the scale-up network method [51] \u2022 Include systematically questions related to same-sex sexual behaviour and anal sex practice in any behavioural survey or integrated behavioural and biological survey among male populations (could be combined with the recommended scale-up network method for size estimation) in Bhutan, to estimate the prevalence of these key indicators and the trends over time. Although, it will be more relevant to conduct these surveys directly amongst MSM and transgender people, the absence of established and significant MSM and transgender people networks and the unmarked and diffused same-sex behaviours in Bhutan challenge the implementation of a random sampling approach that is required for these surveys. However, the implementation of these surveys may be considered at later stage. \u2022 Establish strategic linkages with universities in the region to support the development of social science research for building evidence base for HIV prevention programme among MSM and transgender people in Bhutan such as exploration of social and sexual networks, norms, value structures, social and sexual modes of engagement, and understanding of sexuality and sexual health among MSM and transgender people, including youth 57 7.

Gender considerations in HIV and AIDS policies and strategies. 36 Analyses of factors driving the HIV epidemic in the Pacific Islands have given insufficient attention to gender relations as a cross-cutting issue 36 International experts have advocated a gender sensitive approach to HIV and AIDS policy since 1999 38 Regional studies and strategies have identified gender as an HIV and AIDS issue but a stronger emphasis is needed in policies and programmes 39 Papua New Guinea provides an example of best practice in formulating a national gender policy for HIV and AIDS 41 IV. Gender and policy challenges 44 Gender sensitivity and \u2018mainstreaming\u2019 gender need to be supported by transformative approaches 44 Current Pacific laws relevant to HIV issues do not yet enable a comprehensive and human rights based response 45 Current HIV and AIDS messages and approaches in the Pacific are less effective because they are gender insensitive, culturally inappropriate or often misunderstood. 46 Contents The widely advocated ABC approach to HIV prevention in the Pacific is not sufficiently gender responsive for most Pacific societies and cultures 48 National policies on HIV testing and counselling must be sensitive to gender equality and human rights 51 Suggested recommendations 53 Mainstream gender equality into national and regional policies, strategies and programmes for HIV prevention and care and make them culturally relevant and human rights based 53 Address the prevention of violence against women, children (both girls and boys) and sexual minorities as an integral part of preventing the spread of HIV 54 As an integral part of programmes to prevent the spread of HIV, promote measures to encourage positive models of masculinity among men and boys and increase awareness of and promote the exercise of rights of women and girls 56 Improve the legal framework for gender equality and human rights as an integral part of preventing the spread of HIV 57 Empower women and girls economically as an integral aspect of HIV prevention programmes 59 References cited 61 Despite a persistent lack of clarity in the epidemiological picture of HIV transmission in the Pacific Islands region, there are at least three worrisome trends that can be easily observed. The first is that the virus\u2019 progression continues unabated and this progression is outpacing the current response. The second is that women tend to be infected at a younger age then men, and the third is that more women than ever before are being infected in the Pacific Islands. In the third decade of HIV responses, HIV programmes still need to better incorporate the realities and contexts of gender relations and constructions as well as social structures which are fundamental to understanding and therefore halting HIV transmission. This is particularly true for the Pacific Islands where HIV responses have been and remain insufficiently based on empirical evidence that takes context and overarching social structures and realities into account. As recently learned from Asian epidemics, the prevailing focus on identified \u2018at risk groups\u2019\u2013not only gives a false sense of security to those who do not identify with these groups, it may also contribute to the ongoing gaps in response that consistently fail to identify and respond to important contextual information, specifically that in many Pacific Islands, trans- mission could be more frequent where most people do not expect it, for example in marriage. Evidence from Papua New Guinea already supports this conclusion. Because in the Pacific, HIV is overwhelmingly transmitted sexually, it is critical to understand not only how and why HIV spreads in societies, but also how and why individuals and groups have different abilities to protect themselves from the virus and its consequences than others. It is therefore, indispensable to understand how gendered values, norms and expectations and socio-economic contexts shape or influence sexual behaviours, gender relations and the presence or", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4480c370-f104-46fc-a74e-cfedea997c01": {"__data__": {"id_": "4480c370-f104-46fc-a74e-cfedea997c01", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender and HIV in the Pacific Islands Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "71360a31ee6f7de15823b4949ee997ba6409f220a878b58800ed3eac6deb5aec"}}, "hash": "71360a31ee6f7de15823b4949ee997ba6409f220a878b58800ed3eac6deb5aec", "text": "absence, as well as range of choices available that affect vulnerability to HIV transmission. How current and future HIV responses address the social determinants of HIV risk are likely to make the difference between success and failure. Continuing misunderstandings and assumptions or avoidance or unwillingness to tackle these determinants because they are often very sensitive, sometimes inscribed in law and always enshrined in culture and practice, will ultimately result in additional HIV infections and the accompanying costs to the individual, community and national economy. As efforts by countries, donors and development partners are being stepped up in the region, the main objective of this collaborative work undertaken by UNDP, UNIFEM and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) was to gather, review and analyze the evidence of the gendered nature and impacts of HIV, as well as the links between gender rela- tions and social constructs in the Pacific Islands region; and produce a set of substantiated policy recommendations to contribute to the work of the Commission on AIDS in the Pacific. Much of the research data referred to in the document focus on Papua New Guinea and elsewhere in Melanesia. This is because there are fewer studies from Polynesia and Micronesia, to balance the extensive research on gender and sexual behaviour focused on Melanesian countries. However, the study benefited from the collaboration of a range of experts and draws on a range of sources that provide both direct and indirect comparative insights into the issues within and between Pacific Island countries. We anticipate that this work will complement other reviews being undertaken in the region, that will ultimately contribute by helping policy makers, government institutions, the private sector, NGOs, development partners and communities devel- op more efficient and targeted HIV interventions for the Pacific that fully take gender issues and relations into account.

The subject of HIV and Gender is sensitive and cannot be dis- cussed without the use of explicit language and without plainly stating the facts. It suggests recommendations based on the findings in five areas (listed below), proposing policy responses and programme approaches which can and should be fundamental to fighting the spread of HIV in Pacific Island countries and territories. Among the key issues identified through this work: Gender still does not get adequate attention in HIV programming despite the fact that it has long been recognised as being fundamental to understanding and addressing HIV and AIDS.1 The spread of HIV is closely associated with the dif- ferent and unequal circumstances of women and men and the power imbalances between them which result in different forms of gender-based discrimination against women. The Pacific Platform for Action for the Advancement of Women identified HIV as an area of concern to Pacific women in 1994.2 It was pointed out thirteen years ago (in 1996), in a UN report,3 that stopping the spread of HIV in the Pacific demands attention to the different social and cultural determinants of HIV infection among men and women. However, even in the new (2009-2014) Pacific Regional Strategy on HIV and other Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), gender is still referred to as one of many issues to be addressed to halt and reverse the spread of HIV, rather than as a central, cross cutting consideration. Similarly, few countries have developed gender responsive national HIV strategic plans and policies. One notable exception is Papua New Guinea which provides an example of best practice in formulating a national gender policy for HIV and AIDS, albeit major challenges remain in its implementation. In all Pacific Island countries, risky sexual behaviour is a major factor in the spread of HIV and other Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), especially the sexual behaviour of men who have more social power and sexual license than women. Although the socialization of boys is a cultural variable across Pacific cultures, ideas about masculinity/ies have many common features that relate to vulnerability to HIV and other STIs. Social constructions of masculinity that denigrate women and girls and emphasise physical and sexual prowess, combined with the erosion of some traditional forms of social control and rapid and disruptive social change place men at great vulnerability and risk of HIV. This then places their sexual partners (female and male) at greater risk.

Even in countries where HIV has a low rate of prevalence, STIs have been shown to be highly prevalent among women and men (across the Pacific). STIs increase the risk of sexual transmission of HIV, as well increasing risks of infertility and cervical cancer in women, and liver disease in both sexes. In countries where health services are inadequate, the risk of HIV infection is increased, as is the likelihood of public ignorance, fear and misunderstanding. Gender-based violence is a serious problem in all Pacific Island countries and territories. Gender-based violence includes beating of wives and girlfriends, sexual coercion, rape (including rape of wives and girlfriends), violence to sexual minori- ties, and sexual abuse of girls and boys. There is growing recognition that the different forms of gendered violence are connected with increased risk of HIV infection. The prospect (or reality) or violence from partners, or the threat of violence by a partner makes it even more difficult for many women to refuse sex or negotiate safe sex. Sexual abuse, coercion and lack of control over sexuality can constitute the violation of a range of (women\u2019s) human rights. Sexual abuse in childhood can have both short-and long-term psychological effects that seem to contribute to riskier sexual behaviour later in life, which then lead to increased risk of HIV infection. Sex workers and those who engage in transactional sex are mostly women and many are young. Throughout the Pacific women have less independence than men, less opportunity than men do to meet their needs and aspirations, to earn their own money, to control their sexuality or to own or control property.

Although there is a wide range of cultural and economic factors driving the spread of HIV and other Sexually Transmitted Infections across the region in different ways and at different rates, gender and human rights issues are associated with their progression everywhere. These issues include cultural defences (in law and in practice) of gender-based violence and gender inequality. Many current HIV messages and approaches are less effective because they are not sufficiently gender responsive, they are not grounded in human rights, and if they are culturally inappropriate, they may be misunderstood. Some inadvertently increase the stigmatisation of women, and may even generate violence against them, and reinforce negative images of masculinity. For example, the widely advocated \u201cABC\u201d (Abstinence, Be faithful, Condom use) approach is not sufficiently gender sensitive for application by most Pacific societies and cultures because it assumes equal decision making power around sex between men and women and because it essentially focuses on the individual rather than addressing the socio-economic context in which gender relations and sexual behaviours are shaped.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "09e7882e-4148-4e0f-b0ea-6bb273e37e4b": {"__data__": {"id_": "09e7882e-4148-4e0f-b0ea-6bb273e37e4b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender and HIV in the Pacific Islands Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e17e3f017b66eab3a6c0e5aaad211d867ca6c419350a5488b1b50a35d571b170"}, "2": {"node_id": "1a78ffdd-1ff1-4e2f-a111-7e808ae285a9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "324735f623c1b7f8351c39e68a7828f5867a5114d96415a932f3531fc705b713"}}, "hash": "62928d202a0f1bae999ef57fd8a8f14c0befc98bc50b41e37fe3f87114932672", "text": "Summary of suggested recommendations: \u2022\ufffd Mainstream\ufffdgender\ufffdequality\ufffdinto\ufffdnational\ufffdand\ufffdregional\ufffdpolicies,\ufffdstrategies\ufffdand\ufffdprogrammes\ufffdfor\ufffdHIV\ufffd prevention and care and make them culturally relevant and human rights based \u2022\ufffd Address\ufffdthe\ufffdprevention\ufffdof\ufffdviolence\ufffdagainst\ufffdwomen,\ufffdchildren\ufffdand\ufffdsexual\ufffdminorities\ufffdas\ufffdan\ufffdintegral\ufffdpart\ufffdof\ufffd preventing the spread of HIV \u2022\ufffd As\ufffdan\ufffdintegral\ufffdpart\ufffdof\ufffdprogrammes\ufffdto\ufffdprevent\ufffdthe\ufffdspread\ufffdof\ufffdHIV,\ufffdpromote\ufffdmeasures\ufffdto\ufffdencourage\ufffdpositive\ufffd models of masculinity among men and boys and increase awareness of and promote the exercise of rights of women and girls \u2022\ufffd Improve\ufffdthe\ufffdlegal\ufffdframework\ufffdfor\ufffdgender\ufffdequality\ufffdand\ufffdhuman\ufffdrights\ufffdas\ufffdan\ufffdintegral\ufffdpart\ufffdof\ufffdpreventing\ufffdthe\ufffd spread of HIV \u2022\ufffd Empower\ufffdwomen\ufffdand\ufffdgirls\ufffdeconomically\ufffdas\ufffdan\ufffdintegral\ufffdaspect\ufffdof\ufffdHIV\ufffdprevention\ufffdprogrammes 3 Gender and HIV in the Pacific Islands Region Photo: Naziah Ali (UNIFEM) Pacific Island countries and territories are diverse The Pacific Islands region is among the most culturally diverse regions on earth.

The combined total population of the seven smallest Pacific Island countries and territories in the Micronesia and Polynesia sub-regions is only 51,800. Micronesian and Polynesian countries not only have small popula- tions, but also most are characterized by past and ongoing political associations with metropolitan countries and with international migration which has a significant impact on their demographic structure.4 Data on HIV and AIDS is limited in most Pacific Island countries and more gender responsiveness should be applied to the collection and analysis of epidemiological data The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can be transmitted by the exchange of blood and semen through sexual con- tact (vaginal, anal, oral );5 through direct contact with infected body fluids such as semen, cervical and vaginal secretions; from mothers who are HIV positive to their infants during pregnancy, childbirth and breast feeding or through blood-to- blood transmission: transfusion or direct contact with HIV-infected blood by needle sharing in intravenous drug use, or use of contaminated skin/body piercing instruments. World-wide, HIV is most commonly transmitted through sex. What is HIV? HIV stands for Human Immuno Deficiency Virus. After a relatively long period (6-7 years on average) of infection without apparent symptoms, HIV attacks and destroys the Immune System and response. As a result the body is not able to defend itself against common infections and certain types of cancers (Opportunistic Infections). What is AIDS? AIDS stands for \u2018Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome\u2019 and is a surveillance definition based on signs, symp- toms, infections, and cancers associated with the deficiency of the immune system caused by the HIV infection. HIV infection is incurable but lifelong treatment with antiretroviral (ARV) drugs can very significantly keep the HIV virus in check by controlling its replication, delay the onset of AIDS and allow people living with the virus to live long and productive lives. UNAIDS estimates that at the end of 2007, close to 74,000 people were living with HIV in Oceania (Australia and New Zealand included); 70 % of them in Papua New Guinea. In that year alone, 13,000 were infected. Testing and awareness programmes in the Pacific have tended to target groups of people considered to have a high risk of becoming infected with HIV (such as sex workers, transgender males, users of intravenous drugs, seafarers and other mobile workers). In the Pacific Island Countries data from testing for HIV has also been disproportionately gathered from people attending clinics for sexually transmitted infection (STI), and from women giving birth so the available data on HIV infection is only partial and may not represent the true picture of the disease burden in the general population. 4 Current Pacific Population Dynamics and Recent Trends.

Widespread voluntary and confidential counseling and testing is not accessible, and the availability of blood screening, particularly in rural areas, varies. On one hand, due to inadequate and weak surveillance systems and capacity in most Pacific Island Countries, it is probable that HIV is under-reported and under-estimated.7 Higher rates of HIV reported for the Pacific territories French Polynesia, and New Caledonia may reflect a more robust and proactive surveillance system, as health services there are linked to the national services of France. On the other hand, selective testing in \u2018at risk groups\u2019 may overestimate the prevalence in the general population. Therefore, all conclusions based on the number of reported cases must be tentative. At best, the data on reported HIV Transmission on modes of transmission provide a very limited overall picture and needs to be taken with caution.8 The \u2018aggregated data\u2019 for the Pacific is driven by statistics from Papua New Guinea, where HIV appears to be overwhelmingly transmitted through heterosexual intercourse. The second transmission route (consistent with the first one) appears to be the perinatal transmission. In the region \u201cas a whole\u201d, 90.7% of all cases of HIV are re- ported as resulting from heterosexual transmission. When the data from Papua New Guinea is excluded (Figure 1), the limited available information on transmission shows that male-to-male sexual transmission (MSM) accounts for close to 33%, but this figure may reflect the selective testing of \u2018at risk groups\u2019, such as transgender males and seafarers. The comparative statistical data for the Pacific Islands region on reported rates of HIV infection shows a slightly higher proportion of confirmed cases among females in Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, although there is a lower proportion in multi-ethnic Fiji and New Caledonia (Table 2). Again, this may reflect the bias of selective testing. Lower heterosexual transmission is reported in Melanesia9 when PNG is excluded (Figure 2): with heterosexual transmis- sion accounting for 59% while it represents 45.2% in Micronesia10 (Figure 3) and 42.2% in Polynesia11 (Figure 4). It would be ill advised to draw conclusion from these observations as the mode of HIV transmission is not adequately documented in most Pacific Island states and territories for a number of reasons. For example in epidemiological data from Papua New Guinea, 75% of records of reported HIV infections do not indicate the mode of transmission. A significant proportion is referred as \u2018other\u2019 meaning that it is not explained due to the inadequacy of documentation, and these data result from a small number of people tested (except PNG). The use of closed categories may also pose problems by singling out certain behaviours (i.e. male to male sex, injecting drug use, heterosexual\u2026) rather than highlighting structures of vulnerability. Given the stigma associated with male to male sex and the fact that bisexuality is frequent amongst men who have sex with men in the region, it is possible that many cases reported as heterosexual transmission are not actually resulting from this transmission route. Epidemiological reports vary in detail and numbers based on confirmed reports versus estimates; for example, according to the Papua New Guinea National AIDS Council and the National Department of Health, 1,152 males and 1,193 females were infected in 2007 in that year alone, as well as 284 people whose sex was not recorded. During 2006, 1,711 males, 1,965 females and 431 people of unrecorded sex became infected with HIV.12 The cumulative figure for Papua New Guinea in 2006 was 8,530 males and 8,824 females - the near-parity indicating that primary infection is largely heterosexual - with 1,130 of unrecorded sex. These data show the massive scale of the epidemic in Papua New Guinea compared to the rest of the Pacific, and may give an indication of the likely rate of spread in the culturally similar Melanesian countries in the near future, if an adequate response, addressing gender issues and focusing on gender relations is not implemented. 7 Source: Commission on AIDS in the Pacific 2008 http://www.aidscommissionpacific.com/about_commission.html 8 Ibid 9 \u2018Melanesia\u2019 comprises Papua New Guinea , Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, New Caledonia and Fiji. 10 \u2018Micronesia\u2019 comprises the Federated States of Micronesia, Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas, Guam, Republic of the Marshall Islands, Palau, Nauru and Kiribati.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4318bb5f-8650-40bb-8483-c6de755ff5f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "4318bb5f-8650-40bb-8483-c6de755ff5f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender and HIV in the Pacific Islands Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bc832d9acd41e1ea62460dd675f0f3bb57c2a5e40bdf181bea6f4be1d3d620ac"}, "2": {"node_id": "f49e311b-5497-4e39-93c0-6ba17d18a3e6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6f4b37d43ffd4f84f8dabff22244eead64a7a237f51d7e2759d157549b4a06ce"}}, "hash": "07511d54314eb7fc8b7fe03aebf9ae11f913c60f9b71cfb1fabebc6cf040924f", "text": "11 \u2018Polynesia\u2019 comprises American Samoa, Cook Islands, French Polynesia, Pitcairn Island, Samoa, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, Wallis and Futuna. 12 National AIDS Council and the National Department of Health, 2007, The 2007 Estimation Report on the HIV Epidemic in Papua New Guinea, and on p.7, Table 1 lists the male and female infections", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "87d761e5-7688-42cc-8cc4-24696c59ae6a": {"__data__": {"id_": "87d761e5-7688-42cc-8cc4-24696c59ae6a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender and HIV in the Pacific Islands Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9d1e1a7057c68124900b74f33e9f6170a8ca6fe8b7c9c9060561f197545fec85"}, "3": {"node_id": "8fde34ec-4d46-49da-bb78-2bfebdbe4a71", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca50c0c851762370c75edaae3381f332bedfab801e62dc7c2b2915d69e053453"}}, "hash": "e029cec318d42f80defbb96f8ba8315fdc0530c04241af2b912fbb4f1220ca44", "text": "for all the years since the first recorded cases in 1987, through to the 2006. The cumulative incidence per 100,000 is a good indicator of the potential impact of HIV on a population. By comparing the cumulative new cases to a standard population size of 100,000 (Table 2) one realises that the impact of HIV is actually higher in Micronesia and Polynesia (59.0 and 49.72 cases per 100,000 people respectively) than for Melanesia (32.5) if Papua New Guinea is excluded, because the former sub-regions have comparatively smaller populations. Even a few cases can have a potentially major impact - for example only nine people in Tuvalu have been diagnosed with HIV \u2013 but with a population of only 9,600, the rate of infection could become devastating.13 The data in Table 2 is incomplete, may be biased due to different modes of collection for women and men, and the identi- fication of cases is likely to be overly low for many countries. It provides numbers of males and females infected, however the total prevalence rates in the tables are not disaggregated by sex in the data currently provided by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community. There have been calls for more gender sensitive data for the Pacific since the first Pacific Platform for Action on Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women in 1994, yet such data is still hard to find, or is collected in ways that make data difficult to compare. Recognizing the difficulty of data collection in the Pacific region and of making comparison between countries and sub- regions, there is a need for more gender sensitivity in data analysis. Agencies compiling regional data should, as far as possible, encourage collection of data - including the sources of data collection and modes of transmission - in a way that allows disaggregation by sex and age. Further, these data are not meaningful without contextualization in gender sensitive behavioural studies. Without more detailed information it is difficult to draw meaningful comparisons of male and female rates of infection. 13 These rates are quoted from Asian Development Bank, 2007.

The injury may be the result of an STI, especially those that cause ulcers, or from forced sexual penetration (rape), or through the practice of vaginal cleansing to increase dryness and friction to increase male pleasure. Violent penetration in sexual intercourse increases the risk of transmitting infection to the receptive female or male partner. The highest risk of sexual transmission of HIV is among persons who receive anal intercourse from an unprotected infected male, whether the receptive partner is male or female.15 It has been widely reported in Melanesia that there are fads among young males for cutting and inserting objects under the foreskin of the penis. Similarly it is reported in Micronesia that young males may incise patterns into their foreskins. For example, the anthropologists Holly Buchanan-Aruwafu and Rose Maebiru describe how young men in Solomon Islands use \u2018sex aids\u2019, such as polished pieces of glass or ceramic inserted under the foreskin, or horse hair and rubber rings \u2018ticklers\u2019 to encircle the penis, or circumcision cuts that leave portions of the foreskin intact. They believe these enhance- ments attract women by increasing their sexual pleasure. These practices appear to have been introduced to the Pacific Islands by seafarers from Asia. However the practices may increase the risk of acquiring HIV as well as other STI if cuts are not properly healed. These practices also increase the risk of transmitting infection to partners through damage to the vagina or anus.16 There is evidence that circumcised men may have a lower risk of becoming infected with HIV through sexual intercourse than uncircumcised men.17 Subincision of the foreskin of the penis was a traditional practice throughout Polynesia, in the Lau islands of Fiji, and in some areas of Micronesia as a rite of passage for young males in early adolescence. Nowadays in these countries, most boys have full circumcision and a medical practitioner usually performs the procedure. Carol Jenkins, a respected medical anthropologist who studied sexual behaviour and HIV and other sexually transmitted infections in Papua New Guinea over many years reported that: \u201cWhile male circumcision has an impact on the spread of HIV and another viral STI named human papilloma virus (which causes cervical cancer in women), the usual bacterial STIs are not affected. In Papua New Guinea, a wide variety of penile incisions are carried out in initiations. Although often called \u201ccircumcision\u201d \u2026 these operations are not real circumcisions, because they do not remove all the foreskin and Langerhans cells in it that attract HIV. In the 1990s, numerous reports surfaced of young men obtaining homemade circumcisions in the village, or circumcising themselves in small groups. As this often led to severe infections and was not an effective substitute for condom use as protection against HIV or other STIs, efforts were made to discourage this trend\u201d 18 14 Vicki Luker, 2002.

Australian National University. 15 According to research by Lawrence Hammar, heterosexual anal intercourse is not uncommon, and distinctions commonly made in discourses about HIV transmission between \u2018men who have sex with men\u2019 and \u2018heterosexual intercourse\u2019 can be misleading (personal communication, December 2008). 16 Holly Buchanan-Aruwafu and Rose Maebiru, 2008. \u201cSmoke from Fire: Desire and Secrecy in Auki, Solomon Islands. In Leslie Butt and Richard Eves (eds.), 2008. pp. 168-174. 17 According to WHO 2008, there is strong evidence from three randomised controlled trials undertaken in Kisumu, Kenya, Rakai District, Uganda and Orange Farm, South Africa that male circumcision reduces the risk of heterosexually acquired HIV infection in men by approximately 60%. This evidence supports the findings of numerous observational studies that have also suggested that the geographical correlation long described between lower HIV prevalence and high rates of male circumcision in some countries in Africa, and more recently elsewhere, is, at least in part, a causal association. 18 Carol Jenkins, 2007.

The 2008 WHO Report on Global HIV/AIDS states that, for Sub-Saharan Africa region as a whole, women are dispro- portionately affected in comparison with men, and the UN Secretary General\u2019s Task Force on Women, Girls and HIV in Southern Africa (2004) shows that African women are at least 1.2 times more likely to be infected with HIV than African men. This ratio is 2.5 among young people aged 15-24. Southern Africa is worst affected, with more than one in five pregnant women infected. A detailed study of gender and HIV in Tanzania examined the hypothesis that multiple dimen- sions of gender inequality increase women\u2019s risk for HIV infection. It found that inequality in heterosexual relationships does contribute to women\u2019s higher risk, and drew the conclusion that current HIV interventions should address women\u2019s empowerment and promotion of behavioural change among men.19 Gender relations are strongly influenced by culture, as discussed in the next chapter. Even allowing for the deficiencies in data, in some Pacific cultures rates of heterosexual HIV transmission appears to be significantly higher than in others, drawing attention to gender issues. For example, data from multi-cultural New Caledonia and Fiji suggest that different culture-based gender relations within different ethnic groups may affect risk of HIV exposure. Ethnicity is not recorded as a reporting factor in the epidemiological statistics on HIV in New Caledonia, but analysis of data from 2001 showed that HIV transmission in New Caledonia appears to be quite strongly related to ethnicity. Male-to-male sex accounted for about 40% of reported cases, mainly Europeans and Polynesians, but 74% of reported cases among indigenous Melane- sian Kanaks resulted from heterosexual transmission.20 A study by the anthropologists Christine Salomon and Christine Hamelin suggests that higher prevalence of heterosexual transmission among Kanaks is associated with the low status of Kanak women and cultural attitudes that sustain a greater propensity for aggressive masculine identity, and for sexual and other forms of violence towards women, including child abuse.21 A similar hypothesis may be drawn from the data for Fiji (2007). The majority of the population of Fiji comprises indig- enous Fijians, who represented 81% of reported HIV cases. In contrast, Indo-Fijians, a large minority in the population, represented 13% of cases, and other minority ethnic groups were collectively 6%. Even allowing for testing bias; in relation to their share of population, indigenous Fijians are the most significantly affected segment. Prior to 2006 most HIV positive people in Fiji were male (63% males versus 37% females), but since 2006 more women have been reported infected (55% females versus 45% males for the first 9 months of 2006). Although the trend may reflect a bias toward female testing, it is consistent with the predominantly heterosexual transmission route (87.3%).22 19 Zhihong Sa and Ulla Larsen.

Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Associa- tion, Montreal Convention Centre, Montreal , Quebec , Canada , Aug 11, 2006. 20 Higher MSM transmission rates may reflect two biases in the data, firstly that military personnel (mainly male Europeans) are provided with access to HIV testing, and secondly that MSM are targeted in HIV awareness programs. 21 J.F.

The lesson for the Pacific suggested by these findings is that there is an increased risk of HIV spreading within the general population in circumstances where it is common for people to have unprotected sex with multiple concurrent partners before and after marriage and where the general status of sexual health is low. High risk groups versus high risk behaviors It is important to be mindful to differentiate between high risk groups and high risk behaviors. Associating HIV and AIDS with certain groups (i.e. sex workers, drug users, MSM) as opposed to particular behaviours (i.e. unpro- tected sex, multiple concurrent partners) stigmatizes those groups, gives a false sense of security to those who are not part of these groups and can mislead prevention efforts. Sex workers operate in most Pacific towns but there is little research on commercial or transactional sex in Pacific Island countries, other than Papua New Guinea. Transactional sex is also prevalent in Pacific urban centres (for example, sex in return for an evening\u2019s food, drinks and entertainment). Commercial and or transactional sex is also found in development enclaves (such as sites of mining, logging and large plantations). The link between sex work and oppressive gender rela- tions is demonstrated in a 1996 study by sociologist Ruta Fiti-Sinclair of woman sex workers in Port Moresby. Fiti-Sinclair found that most of her respondents had been married and preferred the freedom of their occupation, despite its hazards, to the subordination of marriage.23 In many Pacific countries rural to urban migration encourages an environment for commercial and transactional sex. The anthropologist Holly Wardlow concluded that: Married women in rural Papua New Guinea are at risk for HIV primarily because of their husbands\u2019 extramarital rela- tionships. Labor migration puts these men in social contexts that encourage infidelity. Moreover, many men do not view sexual fidelity as necessary for achieving a happy marriage, but they view drinking and \u201clooking for women\u201d as important for male friendships. Although fear of HIV infection is increasing, the concern that men most often articulated about the consequences of extramarital infidelity was possible violent retaliation for \u201cstealing\u201d another man\u2019s wife. Therefore, divorced or separated women who exchange sex for money are considered to be \u201csafe\u201d partners.24 23 Fiti-Sinclair, Ruta, 1996. \u201cFemale prostitutes in Port Moresby: STD and HIV/AIDS knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and practices\u201d in M.

Others, such as Marshall Islands, provide ports for foreign sea- farers in the fishing industry. Seafarers have been shown to rarely use condoms and to have multiple sexual partners, both male and female, including sex workers, and those providing other terms for sexual transactions. Studies cited in an analysis of HIV risk among seafarers from Pacific Island countries in the tuna fishing and international shipping industries found, in response to a question regarding the reasons for practicing unsafe sex, that \u2018drinking too much alcohol\u2019 was the answer given by 79% of Tuvaluan seafarers, 79% of I-Kiribati seafarers and 81% of Fijian seafarers. Many Papua New Guinea seafarers \u2018admitted they were often too drunk to take notice and, even if they had condoms with them, too drunk to remember to use them\u2019. Multiple sex partners and group sex were regarded as part of the \u2018seafaring lifestyle\u2019.25 Alexandra Brewis, an anthropologist, found that the risk of spreading HIV and other STI in a general population in one of the outer islands of Kiribati is high.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f4dba48f-df7b-42a6-a588-f999eef62533": {"__data__": {"id_": "f4dba48f-df7b-42a6-a588-f999eef62533", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender and HIV in the Pacific Islands Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c67a76a2411b9f705db88a2694f24cb16dc01963ea688553c21d397ad9349711"}, "2": {"node_id": "e22dafea-f2ab-4ede-8faa-50cce7c11732", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a9458571f4df8b459bbd00cb94a11b87c070c89a6c3d712e90ad0fa1442b3ae8"}}, "hash": "4687665be86bb858e97a6f17772c5c836d1746bdb27d94dcd94efbc422a1a9c0", "text": "This is because a few single women who have lost their reputation and therefore eligibility for marriage have a great many consensual sexual relations with married and single male partners.26 A warning of the HIV transmission risk to women from MSM is provided by a study conducted in Chuuk State, FSM in 2001.

However, male-to-male sex is not necessarily associated with gender identity or exclusive sexual preferences in Pacific Island countries. Carol Jenkins cites research on male sexual behaviour in Papua New Guinea showing that men often share their sexual experiences with each other and that group sex involving one woman and many men is common throughout the country. A survey found 50% of men interviewed over age 16 had participated in some form of group sex in which men had both male and female partners. One survey cited enumerates 44 acts of group sex involving 52 women and 445 men.29 Her findings cast considerable doubt on data indicating low rates of reported HIV transmission via male- to-male sex in Papua New Guinea in comparison with most other Pacific Island countries and territories.30 25 Rachele Oriente, 2006. \u2018HIV/AIDS And Pacific Island Regional Fishers And Seafarers: Information, Education And Communications Needs And Available Resources at the Secretariat of the Pacific Community\u2019 In Anderson, K.L. & C.

However, if those Pacific island countries that presently have higher male infection rates follow trends in other developing countries, more women will be infected in the future unless action is taken to prevent the spread of HIV.

A 2004 study of pregnant women in Samoa found that 43% of the women tested had at least one sexually trans- mitted infection.32 The widespread prevalence of STIs identified in surveys since the 1970s is related to the rapid spread of HIV in Papua New Guinea and prevalence of STIs is high in males and females, whether they are considered high-risk persons or not.33 A WHO-SPC surveillance study (SGS 2006) of six Pacific Island countries found high rates of STIs in pregnant", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ebc783b8-3661-45c4-adf7-840a0dd1e052": {"__data__": {"id_": "ebc783b8-3661-45c4-adf7-840a0dd1e052", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender and HIV in the Pacific Islands Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6515e1a53cc96e3c6067c67a2a3d7f4cbdb02de1bea9430e0418c05ea2d55296"}, "3": {"node_id": "301eb075-fb18-4c0c-b83c-3b52a869e853", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "29b0eb0e18342d6955d76ad6ff755f8b6b3ae2630492942928e8660d82e19e13"}}, "hash": "7d45e8dfbeb73c704a2c6313f700bac1412fbd96e30c9ef407df04acb10f4c35", "text": "women (Figure 6).

Rates were highest in younger women aged less than 25 years.34 Chlamydia and gonorrhoea are the most common STIs among those aged 15\u201330 and in many Pacific Island countries and territories up to 20% of people aged 15\u201330 may be infected. Most men and women have no symptoms and are unaware that they are infected. Chlamydia and gonorrhoea can cause infertility in women, and people with Chlamydia have a fivefold higher risk of infection if they are exposed to HIV.35 Two other sexually transmitted viral infections are also common in the Pacific, Hepatitis B that can cause severe liver disease including liver cancer 36 but does not predispose to HIV infection and Human Papilloma virus which increases risks in women for cervical cancer, and due to the formation of genital warts and lesions may increase the risk of HIV transmission. The Papua New Guinea Institute of Medical Research surveillance summary report, found that married women had ex- traordinarily high rates of multiple STI. Of persons found to be infected simultaneously with two, three or four infections, 94% were women, of whom 82% were currently married.37 From these data, the report concludes that \u201cmarriage is a high risk setting\u201d meaning that when HIV is in the mainstream population addressing minority \u2018at risk\u2019 groups is insufficient as is an exclusive focus on extra-marital risk behaviours. More consideration must therefore be given to addressing the very real risks, particularly for women, within marriage. Young women are most vulnerable to HIV and other STIs Youth tends to be treated as an undifferentiated category in most epidemiological and sociological studies of the Pacific Islands, and the term \u2018youth\u2019 is most commonly used to refer to young men. Available data makes it clear that HIV is most prevalent among young people and young adults 15\u201334 years old. But gender issues are rarely pointed out. STI rates have been found highest in younger women, and the younger the women, the greater her physical vulnerability to HIV infection if she is sexually exposed.

Young women usually have limited powers of persuasion in their intimate dealings with men, even when they have been made aware of risks, so it is often more difficult for them to negotiate condom use or other safer sexual practices to decrease their risk of unwanted pregnancy or infection with STIs as well as HIV.38 Women of all ages, but especially young women, who notice they have symptoms of an STI are less likely to seek treatment for it than they would for another illness, because of the stigma and shame commonly associated with STIs and because health workers are often judgmental. 38 Christine Bradley, 2006.

In Papua New Guinea young women in the 20-24 years old age group are far more affected (more than twice) than young men at the same age and are infected at a younger age then men. Between 15 and 34 years old, women represent 61% of the reported cases in PNG. In other Pacific Islands Countries while the number of male cases still outnumber the number of female cases, women are also found infected at a younger age (peak between 20-29 years old) than men (peak 30-34 years old). Although this needs to be more substantiated by gender sensitive behavioural studies, in general, girls tend to reach sexual maturity earlier than boys and thus have an earlier sexual debut with partners that are more likely to be older. 17 Gender and HIV in the Pacific Islands Region Where teenage pregnancy is socially disapproved in unmarried girls and where there are cultural practices that aim to pre- vent it, the reported rates are a good proxy indictor of unsafe sex (i.e. low condom use), but otherwise teenage pregnancy rates should be treated with caution as an indicator because some Pacific cultures expect or accept pregnancy in girls past puberty, in or outside of marriage, so condom use would not necessarily be expected for contraceptive purposes. For example, according to a 2004 report on Pacific youth, births to mothers under age 19 comprised 17% of all births in both Majuro Hospital in Marshall Islands and Pohnpei State Hospital in Federated States of Micronesia. Fifteen per per- cent of teenage mothers in Pohnpei, and 17 per cent in Majuro, were delivering their second child.40 The youth report notes that there are limitations in data comparability for teenage pregnancy and as well as under- reporting of births outside health facilities, especially in Papua New Guinea. The report cites population-based estimates ranging from 3.7 per cent in Tonga to 12.8 per cent in Palau, and higher rates based on hospital deliveries. It comments that concern was expressed by health workers interviewed in Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu, who believe that teenage pregnancy is increasing. Knowledge on gender, sex and reproduction is inadequate for the protection of young women and men against HIV and other STIs Across the Pacific Islands girls tend to be unprepared to deal with peer pressure to have sex, to be unaware of their rights, and to lack the social skills to refuse intimacy. The Pacific State of Youth Report makes this important point and also cites studies in Samoa, Cook Islands and Kiribati that found evidence of misinformation about conception and pregnancy among both boys and girls, including a belief that pregnancy could not occur at first intercourse.41 Young women and men alike are likely to be as poorly informed about reproduction and conception as they are about risks of HIV and other STIs. In most Pacific societies sex is rarely if ever discussed frankly. Sex education is not usually provided within families, al- though moral injunctions may be offered. Much of the literature on HIV and AIDS in the Pacific mentions Christian-inspired attitudes of shame in the context of secrecy about sex, (but it is also important to recognize that in many Pacific cultures, speaking frankly about sex undermines the erotic association of secrecy with pleasure). Sex education is sparsely pro- vided, if at all, by health centres and schools in Pacific Island countries and territories. Human reproduction is usually covered in the biology curriculum for high schools, but may be avoided by teachers. Miliakere Kaitani reports only 57.7 per cent of her young male respondents in Fiji thought that lessons on reproductive and sexual health in the school curricula were useful. However, she explained that in Fiji basic science is a compulsory subject in junior secondary school and covers reproduction, whereas the subject Biology and Family Life are not compul- sory in senior high school. Accordingly, non-participation may explain why almost half of her sample said that instruction in school was not useful. Alternatively, it is possible that teachers were embarrassed and so did not cover the topic of human reproduction adequately. She found that sex was a common topic of conversation among young men in Fiji, but the information shared was often inaccurate, and usually connected to competitive boasting about sexual conquests.42 40 UNICEF, SPC and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "14dd4a16-ad09-4b84-8d8a-cb1c63dcbffb": {"__data__": {"id_": "14dd4a16-ad09-4b84-8d8a-cb1c63dcbffb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender and HIV in the Pacific Islands Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8d1230220996523b45f123aa8afb763b1863b7bbd52c6ddaf5bc5ab751f1f29c"}, "3": {"node_id": "88274c87-7804-4fa1-8fc7-5a225cf7a0a1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cea7d03d8bd1361419c284f54e972438cece0f40d5ff4ce679817a58417752f3"}}, "hash": "2361fe2c147cf006fb553249dd673eea3af617249477756a69f113c0e0d1be58", "text": "UNFPA 2005.

Our culture \u2026 makes it difficult for men to admit to any lack of [sexual] knowledge or experience \u2026 myths are normally passed on through peers. They tend to influence behaviour and encourage sexual risk behaviour. Two of the most common myths are \u201cthe size of the penis matters\u201d and \u201cmen are always ready and willing to have sex\u201d \u2026 knowledge is obtained from friends, peers, and mass media. Another commonly known reproductive health behav- iour myth is that using a condom does not give sexual pleasure to the two individuals involved. On the issue of condoms, Kaitaini notes that young men who do not know their sexual partners are more likely to some- times use condoms compared to those who have regular well-known partners. The longer the length of young men\u2019s lifetime coital experience the more likely they are to sometimes use condoms. Young men\u2019s casual attitudes to use of condoms included beliefs that sexual satisfaction is greater without; that condoms are unreliable; that they trusted their partner, or that they were too drunk to remember. However, young men who had sex with men were four times more likely to report ever using condoms than young men reporting exclusively heterosexual experiences.43 In most Pacific societies young people rely on their friends for information and such information is often inaccurate. They may also regard pornography from DVDs or the internet as a source of information. Pornography often provides a distorted, misogynist depiction of human sexuality (misleading depictions of girls and women enjoying rape, for example). Kaitani found that most young men in her Fiji survey typically obtained information about sexuality from sources that are not conducive to responsible sexual behaviour. 70.8% obtained what they regarded as useful information from their friends. The information included incorrect information on how to avoid STI, including HIV, and unwanted pregnancy. The mass media provided what was considered useful information by 79.8 % of the sample, and such sources of information sources included soft pornographic magazines such as Playboy, as well as hard pornographic material. The argument commonly raised against sex education in schools is that such education should be a family preroga- tive, and assumes that families will provide their children with appropriate information. However, in the aforementioned research in Fiji by Kaitani, 66.4% of the males surveyed received information on reproduction and sexual health from their father and 68.4% from their mother. None found this information useful, probably because frank discussion of sexuality and reproduction was considered un-Christian. Discussion of sex may also be culturally unacceptable in other ways \u2013 for example in most Pacific Island cultures there are taboos on the mention of sex between certain categories of kin.44 43 Kaitani, 2003, pp. 55, 176,190, 195, 201 44 In many Melanesian societies sexual matters may not be mentioned in the presence of in-laws. In Tonga and Samoa they may not be mentioned in the presence of brothers and sisters. 19 Gender and HIV in the Pacific Islands Region Photo: Thomas Jensen (UNDP) II. GENDER, CULTURE AND CHANGE IN THE PACIFIC ISLANDS Traditional cultural ideas about gender vary within and between Pacific societies Generalizations about the status of boys and girls, men and women in the Pacific in the cultural contexts of HIV can be misleading, and more effort is needed to increase understanding of the specific relative status and options of women and men in their local contexts, and in different contexts of social change. In all Pacific Islands men and women had comple- mentary roles but gender relations varied according to culture, women\u2019s reproductive roles were always valued, and their productive roles, whatever they were, were as well.

Even cooking using earth ovens was traditionally the work of young men. In contrast, in most Melanesian societies the gendered division of labour usually allocates considerable responsibility for subsistence food production to women, including horticulture, fishing and gathering.49 In many parts of Melanesia it was (and often still is) customary for a man, assisted by his relatives, to make a payment of goods and money to the family of his wife at marriage. However, in many part of Polynesian and Micronesia, gifts were exchanged competitively between the relatives of the bride and groom. In Samoa and Tonga the family of the bride cus- tomarily give the gifts of highest cultural value in a marriage exchange. Although men controlled the economy and resources everywhere in the Pacific islands, the extent to which women had property rights and participated in - rather than being just the objects of - traditional exchange transactions varied. This variation reflected the status of women, which was highest where they had economic security, irrespective of marriage.50 In some rank-conscious societies, Tonga for example, inherited status is more important than gender, so chiefly women outrank non-chiefly men. However, Fiji is a ranked society but as Miliakere Kaitani comments (drawing on an extensive review of the literature), gender inequality characterizes Fijian culture: 51 45 The term \u2018traditional\u2019 is used here to refer to values and customs that have been documented for Pacific societies in their pre-Christian or early contact situations. Traditional values are shown in many anthropological studies to persist and to influence contemporary behaviour and values despite social and economic change. What Pacific Island people regard as \u2018traditional\u201d is usually a mixture of ancient and modern customs and beliefs. 46 See: Ortner, Sherry.

Men sit separate from women because they are seen as more important. Positions are inherited and passed down through males and women are able to assume positions only when all the male possibilities are exhausted \u2026 Although women are also recognised as important to society, men are seen as the more respected sex. Male domination is a strong theme within marital rela- tions. Men are seen as the more authoritative sex. They are also seen as dominant from the societal viewpoint and this is portrayed within the underlying attitude towards marriage. These attitudes are seen in traditional acts, such as the woman leaving her house to go and live with the man.

In former times there was a great divide between men\u2019s roles and women\u2019s roles; what work one did, the other would not do, and vice versa.53 In most Melanesian societies all adult men are considered more or less equal to one another, but socially superior to all women. In many it was once believed that women\u2019s menstrual blood (and in some cases the blood of parturition) is supernaturally dangerous to men and these beliefs are still held in some areas. In the past, initiation rituals for boys often explicitly sought to cleanse them of female influence.54 Traditional behaviours and beliefs about gender and sexuality have changed over time - and are still changing Most Pacific Island countries emphasize and take pride in their traditional cultures. Some, such as Tonga, and Samoa take pride in their national, constitutionally enshrined Christian cultures integrated with traditional cultures, in which women have high social status. These countries proudly point to traditional customs as well modern developments, such as the equal participation of women in education, and growing numbers of women in decision-making positions. But customs that once upheld the status of girls and women and that encouraged young men to behave responsibly are being under- mined by modern influences.55 For example, the solidarity of extended families and communities has been weakened by emigration, urbanization and new settlement patterns. Today, extended families and neighbours are often less involved in mediating conflicts that can lead to violence against women and girls than in the past. Over the past century - or more recently - in some parts of the Pacific - there have been widespread ideological changes arising from colonial administrations, Christian influences, population movements, and most significantly urbanization. All over the world, life in towns and cities undermines the traditional values and norms of small rural societies and the devel- opment of social cohesion becomes more depended on the powers of the state. 56 World Bank, 2006.

More than 35% of the people of the Pacific Islands live and work in towns, and the rate of urban population growth throughout most of the region is high. According to a World Bank report, eight of the twenty-two Pacific countries are now predominantly urban; by 2020 more than half the population in a majority of these countries will live in towns. It points out that: Demands for higher standards of living in urban areas have made it difficult for traditional leadership structures to respond in ways perceived as adequate by town dwellers. A large and increasing proportion of the urban young men and women have never visited their traditional village communities and do not have strong links with them. Thus traditional safety nets developed by Pacific Island societies over hundreds of years are becoming increasingly strained as expectations are modified by development and many communities grapple with the transition from sub- sistence to cash based livelihoods in growth-oriented economies. As a result, the number of people living below the poverty line in urban areas is increasing numbers of children born to unmarried parents are in danger of becoming landless.56 Many studies have shown men and women once typically occupied separate, and in some cases unequal, spheres and spaces. Christian ideals of conjugal marriage have been promoted in Pacific societies, of an exclusive relationship of sexual fidelity, companionship and mutual respect between a caring husband and obedient wife.57 The conjugal model has tended to appeal more to women - as a means of social empowerment - than to men.58 This is because, although it reinforces the subordinate status of wives, it enjoins husbands to care for, protect and cherish their wives.59 However, in general, marital fidelity, whether defended by traditional values or Christian teaching, is more", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8fc1defa-2d76-4558-b1c9-488a4e91e07a": {"__data__": {"id_": "8fc1defa-2d76-4558-b1c9-488a4e91e07a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender and HIV in the Pacific Islands Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0741219a5c971a3771482cb5915ada56d1e366e7263b57e47dab3395e5cfd167"}}, "hash": "0741219a5c971a3771482cb5915ada56d1e366e7263b57e47dab3395e5cfd167", "text": "rigorously expected of and enforced upon women than men. In Christian Pacific societies sexual fidelity may be formally expected of men but privately most people believe that men are less bound by such rules than women are. Indeed in Papua New Guinea, where polygyny is still common in some parts of the country, men with many wives have high status. Across the Pacific, married men who have extra-marital part- ners are likely, at least covertly, to be admired by other men. This is not to say that there are no sanctions against male infidelity. In Samoa people once believed - and may still believe - that if a married man commits adultery, his children may become ill. Carol Jenkins reports the same belief is found in the Papua New Guinea Islands region.60 As in all human societies, Pacific Island societies had strong traditional institutions that controlled sexual behaviour. These institutions varied but usually incorporated practices that enabled older men to exert control over younger men, that kept young men and women separate from one another in everyday life, and that regulated courtship and marriage. But the forces driving social change are weakening or even extinguishing such institutions. 23 Gender and HIV in the Pacific Islands Region Social change and newfound sexual freedom in Papua New Guinea Compared to the past described by elders, people today have far greater freedom to engage in sex. This sense of freedom is personal, engendering less fear of personal damage, and instilling less fear of social sanctions. Whereas an unwed mother once was stigmatised in many Papua New Guinea societies, babies born of unwed mothers today usually are handed over to their grandparents and the young woman remains free. The majority of young men feel justified in renouncing any responsibility for parenting a child, because their girl friends are rarely without other sexual partners as well. In some rural communities, social disapproval expressed through gossip remains a strong force inhibiting sexual freedom within the community. However, visits to other villages and, most importantly, to larger towns offer opportunities for experimentation. Many people actively seek such opportunities. For married men, going to the city during a wife\u2019s pregnancy is a good way to maintain the prescribed abstinence taboo and still have a sex life. For young people, the city represents all the forbidden pleasures of sophisticated sexual partners, alcohol, and marijuana. For women of all ages, the city allows for the sale of sex, an opportunity to have fun and make money too. (C. Jenkins: \u201cHIV/AIDS, Culture, and Sexuality in Papua New Guinea ADB 2007 p 46) Notwithstanding social change, in many Pacific societies women are held responsible for upholding traditional ways. As a UNICEF and UNIFEM-sponsored analysis of the situation of the girl child in the Pacific Islands region notes: In many Pacific Island societies, \u201cculture\u201d, \u201ccustom\u201d and \u201ctradition\u201d are frequently invoked as justification for dis- crimination against, and even abusive treatment of, women and girls. However, the \u201ccustoms\u201d and \u201ctraditions\u201d that are invoked are often distorted versions of the original, which have been modified to suit the needs of the males in the family. For example, in Papua New Guinea, some fathers have used the \u201ctradition\u201d of bride price as a reason for trading their daughters for cash, motor vehicles or houses, from transient logging and mining workers. In such cases, the father often conveniently overlooks other traditions and expectations associated with bride price, such as a marriage ceremony and traditional dispute resolution processes. Furthermore, some groups within Papua New Guinea who did not practice it in the past have adopted the \u201ctradition\u201d of bride price as a way of demanding cash for the marriage of a daughter. Similarly, men invoke \u201ctraditional rights\u201d to use cash windfalls (such as mining or logging royalty payments \u2013 or money earned by their wife or wives during intermittent cash crop booms, or successful small family businesses) \u2013 to acquire an additional, and usually very young, wife. The exercise of these traditional rights to spend the family income as they please is, in today\u2019s rapidly changing societies, leading to undesirable social outcomes.61 61 Penelope Schoeffel Meleisea and Ellie Meleisea, 2006.

There is little evidence from research to indicate the extent to which young women aspire to this ideal and how likely it is to reward them for adhering to conventions.62 It seems likely, however, that non-conformity is more likely to occur in societies where young women are not in this way. A national study of sexual and reproductive knowledge and behaviour in Papua New Guinea reported that older men and women from several parts of the country recalled customs that placed a high value on virginity, particularly among girls.63 However, shame was more commonly attached to girls who became pregnant before marriage. In most traditional Pacific cultures a woman did not \u2018own\u2019 her reproductive capacity; it belonged to her family before marriage and to her husband afterwards. For example, Holly Wardlow reports that in a Papua New Guinea Southern Highlands society illicit sexual activity is defined \u2026 as the theft of a woman\u2019s productivity from her natal kin, or from her husband if she is married.... the dominant concern in cases of illicit sexual activity is not whether a woman consented, but that her family did not.64 In Samoa, Tonga and rural Kiribati feminine virtue has been reported as a feminine ideal, associated with virginity at mar- riage. Alexandra Brewis reports that women who have multiple sexual partners are severely stigmatised in rural Kiribati.65 On the other hand more relaxed attitudes about feminine sexuality before marriage are legendary \u2013 and also true to some extent - in Eastern Polynesian66 societies such as Cook Islands and Tahiti.67 In the Marshall Islands teenagers who have children are not ostracized and having a child can be seen as a rite of passage, reflecting socio-cultural norms where virginity is not as much emphasised as it is in many other Pacific Island countries, where teenage pregnancy may be considered to be an undesirable side effect of modernity and change. In the Trobriand Islands of Papua New Guinea, Katherine Lepani describes the period of adolescence as \u2026 a time of sexual freedom, individual choice, experimentation, and the search for potential partners in the open, yet hidden, space of young people\u2019s autonomy. First sexual activity is culturally valued as an important transitional point in the physical and social development of a young person. She reports that young women express confidence in their sexual autonomy and exercise the right to reject the advances of suitors they find undesirable.68 Anthropologists Deborah Gewertz and Frederick Errington show how modern influences in Papua New Guinea encour- age young women to hope that they can choose their own husbands, as they could not have expected to do in the past.69 Throughout the Pacific, adolescent girls and boys are venturing into new domains of courtship and expectations of per- sonal choice, for which there is limited or no cultural precedent, as well as considerable dissonance between the expec- tations of young women and young men. Carol Jenkins makes the point that contemporary parents and youth represent the first generation of Papua New Guineans to be confronted with mass media. This is the case for most Pacific Islands societies where, as in the rest of the world, women have been shown to be more interested in books about relationships, romance, family and marriage, and thus are more likely to expect caring, committed relationships. Young men reading soft and hard pornography are more likely expecting many sexual partners without commitment. 62 See for example Alexandra Brewis. 1992. \u2018Sexually Transmitted Disease Risk in a Micronesian Atoll\u2019 Population.

Girls who have been sexu- ally assaulted may be blamed. For example, in a recent case the relatives of girl who had been sexually assaulted at the age of 12 appealed to immigration authorities to allow her assailant to stay in New Zealand. They feared that if this man was allowed to return to Samoa and revealed his \u2018conquest\u2019, the girl would come to be seen by young men in Samoa as \u201cpromiscuous and available\u201d, also that \u201csocietal gossip will blame the girl, however wrong that might be.\u201d70 Christine Sa- lomon and Christine Hamelin comment that in Kanak society, New Caledonia \u201cany deviation by a girl from social norms, or even any carelessness, seems to legitimise male sexual abuse of her.71 Young women may blame \u2018love magic\u2019 to excuse impulsive unsafe sexual behaviour and to shift responsibility away from themselves to another person\u2019s \u2018spell\u2019. In this context, belief in love magic is an HIV risk. Although belief in love magic is mainly found in Melanesia and parts of Micronesia, students from Solomon Islands at the University of the South Pacific have been reported to sell love magic to students from other islands where there was no tradition of love magic beliefs.72 Young Pacific women are particularly confronted with unequal sexual codes. Answering the question \u201cwhat is gender\u201d in relation to HIV and AIDS, Lisa Lahari-Williams emphasizes the pressure of expectations on young women.73 She writes: When young women have to remain virgins until they marry, that\u2019s gender\u2026When they are not married but they still have sex and disgrace their family, that\u2019s gender\u2026 Whether she\u2019s a virgin on her wedding night or not, whether she gets married or not, when a young women lets her partner decide when, how and where to have sex, that\u2019s gender. When a young woman is abused verbally for offering or asking for a condom, she must be trying to hide some thing, and that\u2019s gender. When she even has to ask, not tell her partner, to wear a condom, she\u2019s getting too cheeky and demanding, and that\u2019s gender. When she\u2019s infected after she reads all the posters and loves faithfully and sticks to one partner, she has to be sleeping around, and that\u2019s gender. And that\u2019s why when it comes to HIV/AIDS, gender is what we call the \u201cfatal\u201d in equality, because it takes the chance for life itself out of the hands of a woman simply because she\u2019s not a man.\u201d The construct of \u2018Macho\u2019 masculinity encourages high risk sexual behaviour It is challenging to confront evidence from many Pacific Island countries and territories that document the sexually violent or exploitative behaviour of men, especially young men, towards girls and women. The evidence suggests that many Pacific cultures socialize boys in various ways that encourage their sexual drives to be channelled to violent or otherwise contemptuous behaviour towards women and girls. Instilled attitudes and peer group pressure are extremely powerful towards encouraging negative behaviours. It is the social construction of masculinity that must be critically addressed, not men as persons. 70 Vaimoana Tapaleao 2008. \u2018Immigrant allowed to stay despite sex attack.\u2019 New Zealand Herald Saturday, November 8. 71 Salomon, Christine and Christine Hamelin, 2008.

Often there was some form of men\u2019s initiation cult, which helped create young men\u2019s sexuality, as an equal to the natural maturation of girl\u2019s bodies through puberty and menarche. Men provided protection and aggression, did the heaviest garden clearing, hunting and deep-sea fishing, and waged war as fighters against enemies and strangers. They also uniformly controlled formal power structures, often depending on secret rituals to maintain their dominance.76 All Pacific societies had social institutions, which, although they operated in different ways, placed young men under the control of their elders. Most pre-colonial or pre-Christian Melanesian societies had men\u2019s houses in which young unmar- ried men lived and were controlled by their elders. In Samoa every village had, and many still have, associations of young men (aumaga) under the authority of older men and the council of chiefs. However, the rapidly growing urban areas of all Pacific Island countries these controls have been considerably weakened. There are comparatively few studies of masculinity in Micronesia and Polynesia. A classic study of continuing relevance is Mac Marshall\u2019s account of how modern expression of youthful \u2018warrior\u2019 masculinity has taken the form of alcohol abuse among young men in Chuuk State, Micronesia.77 Other writers perceive a continuity of traditional male \u2018warrior\u2019 into the present. Malopa\u2019upu Isaia says that: \u2026 in a warrior culture, it then creates a male sub-culture where it becomes a challenge for the native male to try and exploit as many young virgins as possible. \u2026 Sexuality was also used as revenge. \u2026 The challenge of eyeing someone else\u2019s virgin sister, while at the same time trying to protect your own sisters\u2026 makes the environment very secretive. It was a conducive environment for the outbreak of violence, paybacks, ambush and killings. Our native male sexuality was a high risk thrill.78 The association of masculinity with many sexual \u2018conquests\u2019 is also documented in a New Zealand study of male atti- tudes. This illustrates how predatory attitudes to sex are seen as traditional manly cultural norms among migrant Samoan men. Many men said that they had or expected to \u2018conquer\u2019 many women before and after marriage.79 Miliakere Kaitani, discussing how peer group attitudes to male sexuality become predatory, reports that young Fijian men learn to think of their \u2018dates\u2019 with young women mainly in terms of their expectations of a sexual relationship; placing little value on friendship, conversation or sharing experiences and feelings. Young men were found more likely to have had casual sex than to have had a regular girlfriend. Her informants told her that having casual sex and one-night partners were expected and admired behaviours, and that \u201cthe three \u2018Fs\u2019 is a common slogan in Fiji, standing for \u2018fix, f--k, and forget\u2019.\u201d She describes how one group of young men from Suva competed amongst themselves to have sex with a dif- ferent partner each week. 74 Margaret Jolly 2007.

The larger issues affecting young men concern defini- tions of manhood and opportunities to realize their masculinity. Sexual activities might have become a far more important domain for demonstrating masculinity than in the past, largely because the former roles of young men as warriors, or builders of boats, gardens, and houses, have been devalued. Cash has become the measure of a man. Men with cash can have many women and can have many material symbols of status, thus gaining respect in their communities.80", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d57035f5-f04f-4beb-9089-d732a36a063c": {"__data__": {"id_": "d57035f5-f04f-4beb-9089-d732a36a063c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender and HIV in the Pacific Islands Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "724a878ba48318fe7c8a5a5f3a7c6f3e0b1fc3a72dd0550dcfd310b9ebee17fa"}, "3": {"node_id": "96783fbc-84f8-41e3-8860-90bfb3f42b45", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "165269f788b1effddf4aabd3f8986e5be0c04652252d87d20a4f21ecd7321829"}}, "hash": "af48bdb874cf924d0d0d1e2ecac11d39b644bc03269f272cbe3521f8411b891f", "text": "However, the participants in a seminar discussion of gender and change in Micronesia saw it differently: \u2026 If men\u2019s traditional roles have eroded over time, new roles have taken the place of the old. When women\u2019s roles were lost in the course of change, however, they were never replaced. Women, who were once seen as contributors to their society on a par with men, are now becoming ever more economically marginalized. They are seen primarily as housewives dependent upon male breadwinners \u2026 men have been generally given access to new roles in the modern society, while women have not.81 There can be little recourse for women against sexual and other forms of violence when the unrestrained abuse of mas- culine power and privilege is socially tolerated, even among the police. Human Rights Watch documents the abuse of office by police in Papua New Guinea, with eyewitness descriptions of gang rapes in police stations, vehicles, barracks and other locations.82 However, although there is far more documentation of sexual violence in Melanesia, there is little evidence to demonstrate that it is proportionately less common in Micronesia and Polynesia. Maggie Cummings, an anthropologist, describes attitudes in Vanuatu among leaders, men and women, that excuse young men from exercising self-restraint and blame women for assaults and rape especially if have dressed \u2018immodestly\u2019. Modesty was equated with the wearing of neo-traditional smock-like dresses introduced by Christian missions last cen- tury. Immodesty is equated with modern styles of clothing, trousers, shorts, or sleeveless tops - but only when worn by women; men are free to follow modern styles without censure. Women who fail to conform to cultural ideals of femininity in their behaviour or dress are blamed when rapists justify their acts as a punishments for wearing \u2018revealing\u2019 attire such as jeans or \u2018pocket trousers\u2019, or because the victims were \u2018asking for it\u2019, or because they were not \u2018good\u2019 women (although modestly dressed women and girls are also often victims of rape).83 Studies from Papua New Guinea, Fiji, and New Caledonia show that young men are prone to engage in violent high-risk heterosexual activities. The most vicious manifestations of sexual violence is pack rape or group sex colloquially referred to in Papua New Guinea as \u2018lineups\u2019 and in Fiji as \u2018convoys\u2019 and in New Caledonia (\u2018la cha\u0131ne\u2019) in which the female par- ticipant is forced to submit, or is too intoxicated to resist, and who may or may not be a sex worker. Amnesty International cites a report to the Committee on the Rights of the Child, in which the Government of Papua New Guinea stated that \u201cyoung women all over the country are at high risk of rape, gang rape and other forms of violent sexual assault.84 Carol Jenkins, reporting her research findings, explains why this risk is so prevalent, citing one of interviews in which a young man freely admitted that he and his friends roam about at night looking for opportunities for a \u2018line-up\u2019.85 She comments: [These] Men give many reasons for group sex or lineups, most of which are punitive or misogynist and corroborate the interpretation that this is often group rape. As a very small proportion of these events ever come to the attention of the courts, legal definitions have not been clarified.

The youth of the perpetrators (between 15 and 25 years of age), their number, up to 10 or 15, and the statements they make raise issues regarding male socialization towards sexual predation. These rapes occur in both rural areas and Noumea. The victims are often very young girls who are made vulnerable either by their social status, by a mental handicap, by the consumption of substances at a party or because they have a \u2018bad\u2019 reputation. The disgrace that will unfailingly fall upon them explains their silence.86 Sex work and transactional sex are mainly seen as outcomes of lack of choices and opportunities open to women in Pacific societies but there are other complex factors Batiri Bataua, the chairman of Kiribati\u2019s HIV/AIDS taskforce in 2007, was reported to have told a media source that 80 to 100 young I-Kiribati girls, many from the outer islands, go to the docks and \u201csell themselves for sex to seafarers from in- ternational fishing vessels\u201d. Some were as young as 13 or 14 and they were drawn \u2026 by the bright lights of South Tarawa, and they like the U.S. dollars, the partying and the drinking that happens when the men arrive in town.87 His reported opinion was that the root cause of the problem is lack of employment opportunities: \u201cEmployment wise - that will be a very long story because we still have a long queue of unemployment, and these girls, most of them don\u2019t have good education. Trying to get a job for them, I would say, that it would be hard.\u201d Leaving aside the question of why the police in South Tarawa did not arrest the seafarers that had sexual relations with underage girls, it is not at all clear from this account that the girls referred to saw themselves as \u201cselling sex\u201d. What is more likely is that these girls were looking for entertainment and excitement as well as money, that seems legitimately available only to boys and young men according to the rules of their society. In any Pacific society material poverty and poverty of opportunity may push some women and men to resort to trans- actional sex. Carol Jenkins quotes a man in Papua New Guinea who argued that women have an advantage over men if they are poor, because they can sell sexual services whereas men cannot. Men can and do sell sexual services but empirical evidence show that more women than men \u2018sale\u2019 or exchange sex for money or goods. The demand for paid sexual services from men is generally lower. On the opposite, the booming transport and extracting industries employing a predominantly mobile male labour force88 in Papua New Guinea and other parts of the Pacific certainly contribute to an increased demand for female sexual services. However, most Pacific women who engage in transactional sex cannot be 86 Christine Salomon and Christine Hamelin, 2008.

For Papua New Guinea Carol Jenkins reports: While self-identified, full-time sex workers clearly have the highest number of partners per year, the number of clients is relatively low compared to that in other countries. On the other hand, about 15% of other women appear to have nearly as many partners as sex workers. This implies a convergence of risk levels among women in the sex trade and the most active of those practicing transactional sex. Such extensive multi-partnering can fuel a widespread \u201chot\u201d epidemic. Their clients and boyfriends are at equally high risk.89 Other studies from Papua New Guinea show that women may opt to engage in transactional sex for many reasons.90 Some act in revenge for ill-treatment or loss of status; others to obtain longed-for favours or opportunities, to alleviate poverty, or to support their families.91 Those abandoned by their husbands often", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "beed6e52-b242-4ca1-9f93-e2044e0ff94f": {"__data__": {"id_": "beed6e52-b242-4ca1-9f93-e2044e0ff94f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender and HIV in the Pacific Islands Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bb1b5e9970029cc054884c5d44be225afbdc66368a6d67375994abc046132bf5"}, "3": {"node_id": "694f5978-4e19-4115-abca-4038e66a74f6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8f40912b95deaaa236ca8858a2e6cff7d026cacc5e167e2a10f6b8525860beb2"}}, "hash": "b79c3781c68b064ac713c9c07ff7d387ecb5142b41a431cfa8f84d7eed072902", "text": "have no choice, while some may encour- aged or forced to sell sexual services by husbands or kinsmen. Others have economic incentives that outweigh incentives to adhere to customary constraints, to engage in occasional or regular sexual transactions.92 There are few studies of sex workers and transactional sex in countries other than Papua New Guinea, although the same factors are likely to be involved. It has been shown that women can have strong incentives to opt for transient relationships, which, while not overt sexual transactions, involve more female agency than traditional marriage arrangement and are usually pursued by women for their own advantage. For example, Deborah Gewertz and Frederick Errington describe how in the Ramu Sugar Limited township (a development enclave in Papua New Guinea) \u201cRamu wives,\u201d and \u201cmarriage in the Ramu way\u201d may last for weeks, or years, and often results in children, but these unions rarely involve customary exchange relationships between kin groups. Male workers may establish several such marriages because there are many women willing to become Ramu wives. The men have money, the town has education and health services, and the life of many Ramu wives is better than gardening, collecting firewood, and fetching water in their village and living under the repressive control of male elders.93 There is evidence that carefully targeted interventions to economically empower women can help to combat the spread of HIV and therefore should be a core component of national HIV prevention strategies.94 Most men who have sex with men are not transgender, nor do most of these men regard themselves as \u2018gay\u2019 or homosexual In many Western societies sexual minorities form a category of gay or lesbian persons, accepted to varying degrees; they may or may not belong to homosexual sub-cultures and communities. In Pacific societies there was no traditional \u2018gay\u2019 or straight categories of person. Men who have sex with men whether for ritual or pleasure, did not categorize themselves as homosexual or as having a particular sexual preference or gender identity. As is well known, in Polynesian societies there is a category of transgender men and boys who, in the past were not categorized by their sexuality but by their preference for women\u2019s work and a feminine demeanour. According to Jenkins, this kind of transgender identity is uncommon in Papua New Guinea, perhaps because the cultural denigration of femininity is so widespread. In the bordering and culturally affiliated Papua province of Indonesia, transgen- der males in the sex trade, (referred to in Bahasa Indonesia as waria) include few ethnic Papuans, most are Indonesians 89 Jenkins, 2007, pp 50-56 90 Lawrence J.

In a national sample cited by Carol Jenkins, 12% of men questioned told of their same-sex experiences. Men often reported male-to-male sex for payments when drunk and in enforced all-male residential scenes, such as boys\u2019 dormitories, jail, mining camps, or on oilrigs. Male-to-male sex in these contexts has nothing to do with gender identities or sexual preferences of those involved.98 It is also possible that in those countries where young women are most strictly supervised, young men are more likely to engage in male-to-male sex, as has been documented elsewhere.99 A limited study undertaken by C. Jenkins in Fiji, using a respondent driven sampling approach, suggested high levels of risk behaviours amongst men practising male- to-male sex. The preliminary findings indicated high levels of concurrent multiple partners: in the prior month, 43% of the respondents had been paid for sex and also had new non-commercial partners; 28% bought sex, sold sex and had new non-commercial partners, while another 28% had new non-commercial partners only. Condom usage was found to be clearly insufficient to provide safety and STI treatment seeking behaviour was found to be poor.100 A needs assessment study of Asian and Pacific Islander gay and bisexual men in Hawaii revealed that for many gay and bisexual men greater social and cultural value is placed upon family loyalty and community affiliation than individual identity development/enactment. The culturally based, private-public tension that this creates included an idealization of intimate relationships such that HIV risk reduction is abandoned, and the use of intentional and oftentimes faulty cost- benefit analyses result in unsafe sex as well as fatalistic beliefs about contracting HIV based on being male and gay.101 It is important to highlight that in addition to social stigma against male-to-male sex, most Pacific Island countries have discriminatory laws (i.e. sodomy laws) criminalising such behaviour and contributing to drive these men underground, heightening considerably their vulnerability to HIV. 95 Jack Morin, 2008. \u2018Its Mutual Attraction: Transvestites and the Risk of HIV Transmission in Urban Papua.\u2019 In Leslie Butt and Richard Eves (eds.), p. 41-59 96 Papua New Guinea Institute of Medical Research, 2005.

It also seems to be widely believed in different Pacific cultures that a married woman does not have the right to refuse intercourse with her husband. When girls and women are beaten for refusing sex or are forced to have sex, their risk of becoming infected with HIV increases significantly. Women who have been beaten by their husband or partner are less likely to report rape even if the rapist is not their husband or partner and more likely to fear HIV testing even if they have not engaged in pre-marital, extramarital or transactional sex. Violence and HIV risk: critical intersections There is a compelling case to end intimate partner violence both in its own right as well as to reduce vulnerability to HIV. Violence and HIV risk interact in several ways: 1. Forced sex poses a direct biological risk for HIV and other Sexually Transmitted infections by tearing and lacerating the genitals and or the anus and thus increases the likelihood of HIV to get into the bloodstream if exposed to the virus. The risk is considerably accrued for girls and young women because their vaginal tracts are immature and tear easily during sexual intercourse, it is also considerably accrued in the case of forced anal", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c89035a0-5d74-45ef-94ae-9c69d526defa": {"__data__": {"id_": "c89035a0-5d74-45ef-94ae-9c69d526defa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender and HIV in the Pacific Islands Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2877fe066e8768774a4d03c305b8c8733edc0186ed10dd419c4caf573dab90ff"}, "3": {"node_id": "e5968f62-dcd2-4767-9cb6-fb69eef7bde6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0c349f2be27d03e1bb576010b4df495003edd19ba97db5900425397bed6902a8"}}, "hash": "3c9a897976c85fb4108c50c5120dac2a606c300dcf0bf52d5d1cf7d77821b9b4", "text": "penetration. 2.

Violence or fear of violence may deter women from disclosing their HIV status or seeking HIV testing altogether and delay their access to treatment and other services (i.e. prevention of vertical transmission). (Adapted from Intimate Partner Violence and HIV/AIDS WHO 2004) Studies conducted in different Pacific Island countries show relatively high levels of violence against women. The Fiji Women\u2019s Crisis Centre which does training, counselling and research on family violence throughout the Pacific; reports that violence against women and children is prevalent throughout the region, across all ethnic and socio-economic groups. 102 United Nations organizations agree that gender-based violence is now one of the leading factors in the increased rates of HIV infection among women. Global Coalition on Women and AIDS. WHO, 2004. Violence Against Women and HIV/AIDS Information Sheet. See also WHO, 2003. Ongoing WHO-sponsored research using methodology to produce comparable results is investigating intimate partner violence in different countries around the world.103 In the Pacific a study was completed in Samoa in 2003, while studies conducted in 2008 are nearing completion for Kiribati and Solomon Islands, using comparable methodology. Some of the results are presented in the figures below: The graph (Figure 8) above highlights high levels of violence experienced by Samoan women aged 15-49 from an intimate partner. In addition, twenty four percent of Samoan women surveyed reported that they had experienced severe physical violence (defined as being hit with a fist, kicked, dragged, threatened with a weapon or having a weapon used).104 Comparison with 12 other countries showed the rate of violence against women was in the mid range in Samoa. Similar and even higher levels of physical and sexual violence from intimate partners were found in Kiribati (Figure 9) where preliminary data also indicate that physical violence was the most prevalent form of partner violence followed by emotional abuse and closely by sexual partner violence. In addition (not shown in the graph) twenty three per cent of women who had ever been pregnant reported being beaten by a partner during their pregnancy. Seventeen per cent of women who reported experiencing violence during their pregnancy had been punched or kicked in the abdomen while they were pregnant, and 18% of women aged 15\u201349 reported that they had experienced sexual abuse when they were under the age of 15.105 Preliminary data from the Solomon Islands survey (Figure 10) also shows that two out of three women who had ever been in a relationship had experienced violence by their husband or boyfriend. One out of four had experienced violence from someone who was not their boyfriend. One out of 10 experienced beating during pregnancy, and of these one out of five experienced being punched or kicked in the stomach. The findings suggest that the rate of violence against women there is third highest out of 12 other countries surveyed. 50 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 Physical violence from intimate partner % of survey respondents Sexual violence from intimate partner Physical or sexual violemce or both Figure 8: Violence against women from intimate partner in Samoa Physical violence from intimate partner % of survey respondents Sexual violence from intimate partner Physical or sexual violemce or both Figure 9: Violence against women in Kiribati 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 103 WHO, 2005.

Counsellors at the Fiji Women\u2019s Crisis Centre said that the number of women who condone violence or believe men have the right to physically punish their wives is higher than reported in the survey. The counsellors believe that Fiji Police records are not representative; assault of women is a commonly recorded offence but most women who have been as- saulted do not report it, because they have been taught to accept violence, or because of family pressure, or because of fear of reprisals if a complaint is made.107 In the study previously cited in reference to pack rape in New Caledonia by Christine Salomon and Christine Hamelin, the authors refer to a 2002 survey that found Kanak women frequently suffer from violence inflicted by their husbands or partners, and that there was a strong statistical link between such violence and limited personal economic resources. Research conducted by the Papua New Guinea Medical Research Institute in the early 1990s found that 55 per cent of women interviewed had been forced into sex against their will, mostly by men known to them. A Papua New Guinea Law Reform Commission study found two out of three wives reported being beaten by their husbands (a national average).108 Children are often present when their mothers are being beaten. The extent of girl child sexual abuse is illustrated by a study in the first three months of 1985 of 82 cases of sexual assault, in which the age of the victims were known and who were treated at Port Moresby General Hospital. Nearly half were girls under 16 years old, a quarter of them were less than 12 years old, one in ten was under 8 years old, and many perpetrators were reported to be family members.109 Figure 10: Violence against women in the Solomon Islands 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 Violence by husband or boyfriend % of survey respondents Violence from someone who was not their boyfriend Beating during pregnancy % of survey respondents Figure 11: Violence against women in Fiji 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 women reported abuse by their parents reported being hit while pregnant suffered repeated physical abuse 106 Fiji Women\u2019s Crisis Centre. n.d.

Sexual abuse in relationships was strongly associated with HIV positive status. Level of school education, post-school education and paid employment were not found to influence the rates at which women reported domestic violence. 110 Lawrence Hammar describes a case of a young HIV positive woman who was beaten and left to die in isolation. Such cases are not uncommon in Papua New Guinea, and are far more likely to be women than men. Hammar comments that such cases reveal how people do not connect what they know to be the behavioural realities of sex and marriage with what they say they have learned from the public health messages and Christian teaching.111 Research in other parts of the world has shown that women with violent or controlling male partners are at increased risk of HIV infection (after adjustment for their own risk behaviours) because abusive men are more likely to have HIV and impose risky sexual practices on partners.112 There is a paucity of research on sexual minorities and HIV risk in the Pacific Islands. However, limited and preliminary research on sexual minorities and human rights revealed high levels of physical and sexual abuse on the basis of sexual identity or orientation of individuals, including against those who self identified as; gay men, transgendered, lesbian, bi- sexual, fa\u2019afafine or fakeleiti.

GENDER CONSIDERATIONS IN HIV AND AIDS POLICIES AND STRATEGIES. Analyses of factors driving the HIV epidemic in the Pacific Islands have given insufficient attention to gender relations as a cross-cutting issue There are many factors that can facilitate the spread of HIV through Pacific populations but the reality of unequal power between men and women underlies most.114 As Carol Jenkins saw the situational context: HIV spreads more widely where sexual networks are extensive, e.g., where a person is mobile or travelling and having sex with partners in multiple locations. Having multiple partners concurrently creates a node of transfer from one sexual network to another. Where sexual networks are smaller and more circumscribed, HIV can spread but less widely. HIV spreads more easily where populations have high levels of other STDs, particularly those that produce ulcers. In all-male situations, such as prisons, mines, or construction camps, the risk of HIV transmission is high. Where economic differences between groups within a country are great, poorer men and women exchange sex for money, services, and goods with those having more resources. At the earlier stages of many epidemics, wealthier men acquire HIV more often than poorer men.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ca0b44bf-37f0-4d46-bcde-f111f69efbc1": {"__data__": {"id_": "ca0b44bf-37f0-4d46-bcde-f111f69efbc1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender and HIV in the Pacific Islands Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0edddaa3f8bae8e448d2cb819421dc0777b5c583b1add1f35c863a9d79098d49"}, "2": {"node_id": "d93fe130-b21c-4580-8543-187df25d86d8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bcf6209da689642b9f59affb47728867efe2fe66b890f63ef29ad9306ee9e672"}}, "hash": "7aabd0c763068eba522a1708c9be661185097031fe5f8b8d88da3684b11f5bb4", "text": "At the earlier stages of many epidemics, wealthier men acquire HIV more often than poorer men. However, as epidemics mature, the pool of infections tends to accumulate among poorer classes. This occurs because poorer and more marginalized people (including disad- vantaged minorities of all sorts) have less access than others to information, services, and social power to protect themselves. In many countries, women in general fall into this category. Another situation analysis in a regional study commissioned by the Asian Development Bank summarizes the situation in the Pacific Islands as follows: Social and behavioural factors common throughout the Pacific place some people in all islands at risk of acquir- ing an HIV infection. Travel and migration for work, education, and other purposes are common and widespread. Several islands depend heavily on remittances from family members working abroad as well as on the salaries of international seafarers who are away from home for long periods of time. HIV has already begun to spread among them and to their partners. \u2026 Injecting drug use is relatively rare throughout the Pacific but bears monitoring. Most substance related behavioural issues are associated with alcohol. Marijuana is present and kava is widely drunk by young and old alike. Young people in the Pacific, like young people in most of the world, experiment with drugs and sex without adequate correct information on the potential negative consequences as well as how to prevent them.

Attitudinal issues - for example, toward coercive sex, domestic violence, and the rights of women - play a role in facilitating risky behaviour. Sexuality is not treated scientifically in schools and conservative churches contribute to the prevailing stigma and vulnerability associated with it by discouraging advertising or other promotion of condoms, particularly to youth. Commercial sex is more common in larger urban areas, but a minority of young women and some times young men sell or exchange sex for cash, goods, or services. In addition, male-to-male sex, particularly involving transgender people, is a form of sexuality with traditional roots but is highly condemned by influential religious leaders. Stigma and fear are still highly associated with being HIV positive. 114 Carol Jenkins, 2007. p.9 37 Gender and HIV in the Pacific Islands Region Again, this analysis does not provide a gender perspective. Men are far more likely than women to have the resources to use and abuse alcohol, kava and cannabis and are subject to more peer pressure to do so. Women and girls are more subject to coercive sex, and women are far more likely to be subject to \u2018domestic\u2019 violence. Prevailing values allow men more sexual freedom than women in most Pacific cultures. Transgender males are more likely to be raped and to consen- sually receive than give anal intercourse, and therefore are more likely to be infected than their male partners - who do not see themselves in terms of a sexual preference or gender orientation. Gender and HIV in Papua New Guinea Papua New Guinea has the most severe epidemic of HIV and AIDS in the Pacific and is one of the most affected countries in the world. There are many reasons why the situation there is so serious. Many provinces are underde- veloped and have high levels of poverty and few functioning health services. Social change has been historically recent, rapid and disruptive in many parts of the country. There are serious challenges to public welfare and safety, provision of education and health services and communications. There are problems of controlling crime, mostly perpetuated by gangs of men, who prey on townspeople and on people using roads and highways rural areas. Papua New Guinea has far more development enclaves than any other Pacific Island country, where most pre- conditions for HIV transmission can be found. Lawrence Hammar, who has studied the social conditions of STI and HIV transmission throughout Papua New Guinea, argues that the primary cause of the epidemic is severely imbalanced state of gender relations in that country, defining gender relations as \u201cthe relations of power between men and women, especially in marriage but generally\u201d. He points to contributing factors such as endemic beating and rape of women115 ; girls commencing of sexual intercourse when they are too young for sex to be consensual; lack of access by women to contracep- tion and sexual health information; prevalence of sexually transmitted infections for which women are blamed and which damage women\u2019s bodies and psyche, and diminish their fertility. UNICEF, using data from SPC Pacific regional surveillance, points to those groups in Pacific Island countries that are particularly vulnerable to HIV infection.116 \u2022\ufffd Seafarers,\ufffdhave\ufffdfar\ufffdhigher\ufffdrates\ufffdof\ufffdHIV\ufffdinfection\ufffdthan\ufffdthe\ufffdgeneral\ufffdpopulation,\ufffdbecause\ufffdseafaring\ufffdcarries\ufffda\ufffdspecific\ufffd occupational risk.

International experts have advocated a gender responsive approach to HIV and AIDS policy since 1999 Gender considerations have been addressed in HIV and AIDS policy and programmes in global and regional approaches for many years. On a global front, in 1999, UNAIDS published an influential technical paper entitled \u201cTaking Stock of Research and Programmes on Gender and HIV/AIDS\u201d. This reviewed research on gender-related determinants of risk and vulnerability to HIV infection among men and women and the differential impacts men and women experience as a result of actual illness, accessing treatments, or seeking and receiving care and social support. It demonstrated that HIV and AIDS programmes that address gender equality as a central goal maximize their overall effectiveness. This goal includes analyzing and addressing gender issues in planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies, programmes, projects and research. In 2004, WHO published a review paper \u201cIntegrating Gender into HIV/AIDS Programmes\u201d that points out how highly complex the HIV and AIDS epidemic is in its reach and impact, and that these complexities are magnified when exam- ined through the lens of gender. The paper uses a conceptual framework to sort through the different types of gendered responses to the epidemic, and differentiates one approach from the other. It recommends that this approach can greatly facilitate the development of guidelines to assist programme managers and policy makers to integrate gender in HIV and AIDS programming. WHO recognizes that integrating gender considerations into programmes is essential for: \u2022\ufffd Increasing\ufffdcoverage,\ufffdeffectiveness\ufffdand\ufffdefficiency\ufffdof\ufffdinterventions;\ufffd \u2022\ufffd The\ufffdpromotion\ufffdof\ufffdequity\ufffdand\ufffdequality\ufffdbetween\ufffdwomen\ufffdand\ufffdmen,\ufffdthroughout\ufffdthe\ufffdlife\ufffdcourse,\ufffdand\ufffdensuring\ufffdthat\ufffdinter- ventions do not promote inequitable gender roles and relations; \u2022\ufffd The\ufffdprovision\ufffdof\ufffdqualitative\ufffdand\ufffdquantitative\ufffdinformation\ufffdon\ufffdthe\ufffdinfluence\ufffdof\ufffdgender\ufffdon\ufffdhealth\ufffdand\ufffdhealth\ufffdcare;\ufffdand\ufffd \u2022\ufffd Supporting\ufffdMember\ufffdStates\ufffdin\ufffdundertaking\ufffdgender-responsive\ufffdplanning,\ufffdimplementation\ufffdand\ufffdevaluation\ufffdof\ufffdpolicies\ufffd programmes, and projects. 117 Holly Buchanan-Aruwafu, 2007. An Integrated Picture: HIV Risk and Vulnerability in the Pacific: Research Gaps, Priorities and Approaches. Secretariat of the Pacific Community. 39 Gender and HIV in the Pacific Islands Region The WHO paper warns that purely technical approaches are unlikely to be effectively adopted without attention to the \u2018structural\u2019 aspects of gender integration. A gender perspective in programming requires institutional systems, processes, and structures that routinely, continuously, and comprehensively identify and respond appropriately to the different ways in which gender affects programming. It makes the important point that existing approaches to address gender in HIV and AIDS programming fall along a continuum from \u2018harmful\u2019 - where discriminatory distinctions are made between men and women that actually negate any real or potential programme successes - to \u2018empowering\u2019 - reducing gender-related constraints and power imbalances. Accordingly, the paper advocates a transformative approach to create more gender- equitable relationships - one which goes beyond \u2018gender sensitivity\u2019 approach because it seek to change the underlying conditions that cause gender inequities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4b230246-1bf1-454a-972b-5b9abc55ae23": {"__data__": {"id_": "4b230246-1bf1-454a-972b-5b9abc55ae23", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender and HIV in the Pacific Islands Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b577181d6fbedf82d557c7749cd4ffb8d5d954ca01b165add3a5aa9aff2369b"}, "2": {"node_id": "dcf906ce-cb12-47d2-a448-b75f85e67ad3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "307fcb7a1ebe7c9f3e7229fcd23c5ae8f5d6533181822da9899011c70d4fc536"}}, "hash": "7242035497d59e77341478181b7d67977080211deda83baf45dd02e7419b4d80", "text": "Since 2004 the emphasis on addressing gender inequality as fundamental to stop and reverse the spread of HIV has greatly intensified at the policy level with leading UN agencies118 multiplying policy and advocacy (as well as technical and financial) efforts to support member states to better address the gender and human rights dimensions of HIV.

It features statements by prominent Pacific women that low status of women was an important consideration in addressing the spread of HIV and other STI, and advocated care and concern for people living with HIV. The booklet highlights the potential roles of women\u2019s organization and women in the media in raising public awareness.119 In 2005 UNESCAP Discussion Paper Gender and HIV/AIDS in the Asia and Pacific Region notes that, with regard to the Pacific Island region, well-known socioeconomic forces such as population mobility and youthful population structure, along with specific national patterns of population mobility, such as employment in seafaring and enclave development in fisheries, forestry and mining are driving HIV transmission. However, the paper highlights the low status of women and violence against women as driving factors and to illustrate the issues, it cites numbers of studies and surveys for three countries; Papua New Guinea, Samoa and Fiji", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0370529-dcb2-43c4-aa88-1ffd286ca1b2": {"__data__": {"id_": "b0370529-dcb2-43c4-aa88-1ffd286ca1b2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender and HIV in the Pacific Islands Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "235390f69714acebb04a142664d6c43f0f0dc79fde740f5ac66d26b8811901c2"}, "3": {"node_id": "8394766d-d7ec-40c3-a743-4e4ec148a56d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e4c7768efd8023f7c84c90bb832f6859db388a03c9aa16bbeb9ab9c6a72a2a15"}}, "hash": "234467927d45e806a4e2eca71a365a3939b152e6a0d1f6e15dcc6f6768eba4eb", "text": "demonstrating that a high proportion of women have experienced physi- cal and sexual violence. The paper identified many significant issues for the Pacific Islands but did not propose specific approaches. A 2004 research paper, \u201cEmerging Issue: HIV/AIDS and Women in the Pacific Island Countries and Territories\u201d, commis- sioned by the Pacific Women\u2019s Bureau of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, provides an overview of epidemiologi- cal data, commitments made by regional governments in relation to the status of women, and national programmes and strategies to combat HIV and AIDS for Cook Islands, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. This paper also draws attention to the low socioeconomic status of women, and to sexual and other forms of violence against women as risks or contributing factors to the epidemic. It advocates a human rights-based approach to raise public understanding and legal protections for human rights and proposes that widespread public education on the facts of sexually transmitted infection must be stepped up. The paper was probably the first policy-oriented paper for the Pacific region to advocate, albeit indirectly, a \u2018transformative\u2019 approach, recommending the engagement of men in measures to halt the spread of HIV, and measures to reform cultural norms in the socialisation of boys. A 2005 situation analysis of HIV/AIDS in the Pacific, commissioned by the Asian Development Bank, does not specifically address gender considerations, but recommends advocacy to enable a rights-based approach to prevention, treatment, and care. Later on, the Bank published a more descriptive report and situation analysis for the Pacific Island region in 118 UNDP, UNAIDS, UNIFEM, UNHCR, UNFPA, UNICEF, the World Bank and WHO in particular. Addressing the specific gender and Human Rights concerns of HIV is one of UNDP\u2019s key priority areas. 119 United Nations Development Programme, 2000. Pacific Women Against AIDS 2000. 2007 based on research by two medical anthropologists; Cultures and Context Matter: Understanding and Preventing HIV in the Pacific. The two discussion papers in the report address HIV/AIDS, culture and social change in Papua New Guinea, and HIV and youth in the Pacific, with particular references to the Solomon Islands. Gender issues are described, but not emphasized as key issues. The above mentioned report is focused on the Melanesian sub-region of the Pacific. Although Melanesian region ac- counts for most of the population of the Pacific, there is still a need for more attention to the cultures and contexts of the small island states of Polynesia and Micronesia, for even though some of these countries have low numbers - or no - re- ported cases, many risk factors have been identified, as referred to in chapter I above. The 2005 Pacific Regional Strategy on HIV/AIDS 2004-2008 included among its strategic principles the statement that it is \u201cbased on an approach sensitive to gender and vulnerable groups\u201d and \u201caffirms the protection and promotion of human rights\u201d120 \u201cHIV/AIDS is a gender issue. It affects both men and women, but women are more vulnerable for biological, epi- demiological and social reasons. A key element of a strong and effective response to HIV/AIDS in the Pacific will be to provide young Pacific Islanders with an environment in which young men are encouraged to treat young women with respect and care. Gender plays a role in making women vulnerable to HIV infection partly because of disparities in decision-making capacities and power relations between men and women. \u2026 Throughout the world, the epidemic is more pronounced in situations where macro policies lead to increased gender disparities. The spread of HIV/AIDS can be slowed only if meaningful changes are brought about in the sexual behaviour of men.

In par- ticular there is a need to address with specific measures the link between HIV and AIDS and endemic violence against women.121 Another gap is how gender relates to the care of people with HIV, associated illnesses or AIDS. A UNDP- regional overview of gender and time - use in the Pacific Islands notes that the responsibilities of caring for those with AIDS is most likely to fall upon women but only Papua New Guinea has so far begun to develop home-based care systems.122 The report highlights the need for time use studies in both rural and urban areas with a high prevalence of HIV to make the gendered context of responsibility clearer and to enable the development of treatment and support that better meets the needs of care-givers, and of people living with HIV. The Commonwealth Secretariat is planning to look at the time use of HIV care- givers in six countries, including the Pacific. The study examines ways to improve the lives of care-givers.

This was commissioned by the National AIDS Council as a companion docu- ment to the country\u2019s National Strategic Plan on HIV/AIDS 2006-2010. The Council and its Secretariat have made com- mitment to be guided in their work by these two Plans together, and are recommending the National Gender Plan and Policy to other stakeholders in Papua New Guinea. Papua New Guinea\u2019s National gender policy and plan provides a sound basis for re-formulating regional and national policies for HIV and AIDS in the Pacific Islands. In its Policy Framework, National Gender Policy and Plan on HIV and AIDS identifies eight key policy issues. i. Addressing Gender Inequality: women and girls are more vulnerable to HIV infection than men but less able to protect themselves, because of their dependent situation. The NGP will promote gender equality in access to prevention, treatment and care, strengthen the leadership of women, improve the ability of women and youth to protect themselves with less reliance on men\u2019s choices, create partnerships for reducing gender inequality, and mainstream gender into all HIV and AIDS activities. 121 Secretariat of the Pacific Community, January, 2009. http://www.spc.int/hiv/ 122 UNDP 2008. Making the invisible, visible: Gender and Time Use Surveys in the Pacific. ii. Gender Mainstreaming: NAC will act as lead agency for mainstreaming a gendered approach to HIV/AIDS across all sectors, providing mechanisms and training personnel to ensure that gender considerations are integrated into the planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the response. iii. Gender-Based Violence: physical and sexual violence are major sources of risk to women and girls, requiring a major emphasis in programming. iv.

The gender policy spells out the national priorities noting that successful implementation of all the gender strategies is dependent on the creation of institutional mechanisms for mainstreaming gender and appointment of personnel with the responsibility, skills and resources to ensure implementation. High level leadership sensitisation on gender issues is essential. Gender violence must be given a much higher profile, with Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) provided for rape victims. More efforts must be made to prevent transmission to babies.

GENDER AND POLICY CHALLENGES Gender sensitivity and \u2018mainstreaming\u2019 gender need to be supported by transformative approaches Gender sensitivity (which identifies biological, cultural and socioeconomic difference between the sexes) is not enough. Transformative approaches are needed to address and seek to redress gender issues and inequalities in the fight against HIV and AIDS. As UNAIDS, UNFPA and UNIFEM declared in 2004 in a joint policy paper on women and HIV and AIDS: As long as women and adolescent girls are unable to earn an income and exercise their rights to education, health and property, or are threatened with violence, progress on the AIDS front will pass them by. Strategies for survival are pioneered every day on the ground by women living with HIV/AIDS. The limitations lie elsewhere: in the painful shortage of resources - especially for women and women\u2019s issues - and in the shameful lack of political will to meet international commitments. For too many years, the voices and demands of women, particularly women living with HIV, have fallen on deaf ears. The world can no longer afford to ignore them. We must find the money needed for care and treatment for all. We must put an end to the stigma and discrimination that limit women\u2019s access to treatment and leave them responsible for taking care of the ill and dying. We must make it possible for them to envision a future.123 More recently (2008), UNAIDS and UNDP have increasingly put more emphasis on the need for promoting gender equal- ity and human rights in HIV programming: A lack of attention to gender inequality and power imbalances between women and men is at the heart of many chal- lenges to effective HIV planning and programming. Discriminatory and gender-blind laws may spawn violence and other human rights violations and thus fuel HIV epidemics.[\u2026] Patterns of HIV infection vary between women and men, people with different sexualities and different age groups. They also reflect the importance of \u2018knowing your epidemic\u2019 by understanding the role of gender inequality in driving epidemics, as well as the interaction between gender inequality and other social and structural factors - such as economic status, ethnicity and religion - that can influence disease dynamics. [\u2026] Efforts to achieve universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support [need to] pay attention to gender inequality and the specific needs, interactions and roles of women and men, and of girls and boys. In particular, the involvement of women and men living with HIV is critical to promoting effective programming.124 Human Rights, Gender and HIV Basic human rights principles are core elements for effective strategies to address the intersection of gender and HIV. Rights-based programming principles stress the universality, inalienability, interdependence and indivisibility of rights. Commonly, rights-based approaches are understood to be based on human rights principles of non- discrimination, participation, inclusion, empowerment, transparency, accountability, obligation and interconnectiv- ity (i.e.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "589dbb89-255a-4646-b7ee-7c84663c6807": {"__data__": {"id_": "589dbb89-255a-4646-b7ee-7c84663c6807", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender and HIV in the Pacific Islands Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "81768db1fca7d2a765fa8d96a6d8fb29413e9d46182c14f2f31b6044f93cf4f7"}, "2": {"node_id": "dd1c3aa1-abdd-4145-8325-3a2edc3f1119", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6f7f0e2687be4a1ae7f8ca000890cbb4d494ac826789678b85152c4782d06ae3"}}, "hash": "62898bb45ef95d36c7a37042aab84250aa64335f1d6147f46d2aad948a5a9e6c", "text": "assuring the conditions for enjoyment of rights). Furthermore, according to human rights principles, for programming to be meaningful, it must be available, accessible, acceptable, and of high quality. Each of these points can help guide approaches to HIV programming, including addressing the intersection of gender and HIV. A critical first step is participation: ensuring that groups that are differently affected by the epidemic in a country (e.g. women as well as men, girls as", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dc98e5a1-7291-4e95-8c5f-182943ba8920": {"__data__": {"id_": "dc98e5a1-7291-4e95-8c5f-182943ba8920", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender and HIV in the Pacific Islands Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a98aaefcef48b5ce742500a8a44988b35d72dc6500714ad5e89096ff37ba8ed6"}, "3": {"node_id": "cf183a28-c042-400b-8311-d9af4d628126", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-and-hiv-pacific-islands-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1801ae19ea4641a4c083f7f70a26934196e79a8d115d9172317834459488c4ed"}}, "hash": "8b1738a4984e0b76caffead34778f01fcd209b13541c93215b475b2a6913aa15", "text": "well as boys, people of different sexualities) are meaningfully involved in the development, execution and evaluation of AIDS strategies.

Bradley points out that: Mainstreaming has become a key method for enhancing women\u2019s equality since the 1995 Beijing Platform for Action, but it has not been consistently successful in ensuring that women\u2019s concerns are adequately addressed. It is the sub- ject of continuing controversy, with many practitioners and analysts concluding that gender can be \u201cmainstreamed into oblivion\u201d. Current Pacific laws relevant to HIV issues do not yet enable a comprehensive and human rights based response The role of law reform and the question of how best to integrate human rights sensitive law reform measures into HIV and AIDS management programmes in Pacific Islands countries has been given considerable attention by academics,125 activists and development partners over the last few years. Recently, a review of laws relevant to HIV issues in 15 Pacific Islands Countries has been jointly undertaken by the UNDP Pacific Centre, UNAIDS and RRRT in order to gauge th
