This arrangement has since worked out well for both groups. As is evident from these examples, conservation has a lot to do with involving both formal and informal mechanisms. For conservation to be successful and sustainable, local communities should be able to understand why the formal approaches adopted must be locally adapted. This is especially important for a country like the Maldives, where the environment comprises the bedrock of our development. We invariably, and by default, have to think of the environment and development together, not just for sustainable development, but for sustained development. As a small island nation, the population is distributed across many far-flung islands, making service delivery expensive. Added to that is the fact that the economy is heavily dependent on natural resources. If we take tourism, the largest contributor to the Maldives\u2019 GDP, it is the natural beauty of our ecosystems that most attracts tourists. While the Maldives is now a middle- income country, this achievement currently rests on fragile grounds. Our climactic and environmental vulnerabilities are at such a point that a single major disaster has the potential to seriously damage the economy at any given moment. Take the predictions regarding El Ni\u00f1o events for 2015, for instance. If the coral bleaching becomes exacerbated as a result of such meteorological events, we will witness grave economic consequences, beginning with the obvious impact on tourism. THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE The impact of climate change on island nations like the Maldives is particularly severe. There is already evidence of a rise in sea levels and changes in weather patterns. For instance, the country receives roughly 2,000 mm of rainfall every year. While the amount of precipitation hasn\u2019t changed much overall, what has changed is its intensity: people are now facing more droughts and increased flooding events, as well as, on the other extreme, extended dry spells. Sea swells and the storm systems too have changed. Sea-water flooding has become frequent, with people losing their homes and livelihoods in such incidents. To address this, a hard- engineered option is to build sea walls barricading these at-risk communities, but protecting all 200-odd inhabited islands with such sea walls would be Conservation has a lot to do with involving both formal and informal mechanisms. Local people need to understand why formal conservation approaches need to be adopted for them to be successful and sustainable. 17 ISLAND LIFE an enormous task involving exorbitant costs. Another option is to find less expensive homegrown methods, which UNDP, with the government, is trying to do. Tourism depends to a great extent on the corals and the ecosystem around them. Maintaining and sustaining this biodiversity thus becomes critical. When we address issues of waste management, we contribute immensely to biodiversity conservation. Similarly, when we address climate change, we also contribute to conservation. Everything is thus interlinked. That\u2019s why the Maldives is such an exciting sandbox, where all of these aspects can and do come together. In this context, we have worked with the government to develop a Coastal Management Regulation to guide investments and infrastructure development. For a country with so much coastal area, this is an important piece of legislation. Initially, we had pitched for a guideline, but recognizing the significance of the issue, the government itself proved willing to convert it into regulation. Meanwhile, what is being proposed in the draft regulation is being piloted to demonstrate how it can be implemented. ENERGY AND CARBON EMISSIONS UNDP has also worked in the past towards removing bottlenecks in the adoption of renewable energy. A great deal of research has been carried out to explore the possibilities offered by wind and solar energy. A trust fund has been set up with the Bank of Maldives and the Environment Ministry to facilitate investment, so that people can obtain soft loans for renewable energy initiatives. We have also collaborated with the Maldives Polytechnic to build technical capacity for the maintenance of renewable energy products. At present, we are piloting a Low Emission Climate Resilient Development (LECReD) Programme in the Laamu Atoll. While primarily focused on climate change, this is in fact a multi-faceted sustainable development-enabling programme that seeks to incorporate, aside from climate change, issues of conservation, sustainable resource use and waste management, among others, in the local development agenda. The idea is to allow thoughts on environmental and climate change to merge with planning and governance at the local level.

Climate change undermines the resilience, viability and profitability of these value chains, both directly and indirectly. Maldivians don\u2019t always get to enjoy the best their country has to offer: stunning luxury resort islands like these. 20 U N D P M A L D I V E S The Maldives is not built on sand, but on the world\u2019s most endangered ecosystem: coral reefs. Climate change causes sea temperatures, along with the acidity of the oceans, to rise. Both kill coral, fish and the many organisms that use the coral reefs as their habitat. The resultant impact on the livelihoods and nutrition of people who rely on these resources is significant. In Baa Atoll, an Atoll Ecosystem Conservation project was initiated to try to conserve the environment. This project, supported by UNDP and financed by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), is the first biosphere reserve of the Maldives, protecting the atoll\u2019s exceptional marine and coastal biodiversity. As the project becomes a model of conservation for all atolls in the Maldives, many resort islands operating in the country are becoming increasingly aware of their responsibility to make their businesses environmentally friendly, sustainable and educational. 21 ISLAND LIFE At the Banyan Tree Resort, Moosa Shan, a young Maldivian, works in the marine lab.

It is important to note that UNDP has emphasised inclusion in all of the policy instruments it has helped develop with the Government of the Maldives. There has been a focus on voice and participation, rather than just institutional development. It is as much about participatory law-making as it is about participatory planning. There are also issues of inequality between residents of Male, the capital, and those of remote islands. In Male, basic services like health and education abound but the population density is very high and so is the cost of living for its residents. People can barely break- even at the end of every month. That is probably one of the biggest challenges in the capital. In the remote islands, there are issues with access to basic servicesleading to a lower standard of living compared to that of Male\u2019. The geographic location of the islands, scarcity of resources such as land and people, accessibility of services, limited job opportunities that matches the skill sets of the population force people to move to Male.

However, there remain areas where there are policy gaps, which are leading to development challenges for the country. There are two critical areas: demographics, especially the growing youth population, and the increasing inequality among regions and communities. UNDP has been working closely with the Government of the Maldives on policy support, to identify the gaps that exist and to develop better services to cater to the needs of the people. In Maldives, youth unemployment is high, not because of a shortage of jobs, but because of a mismatch between jobs available and the skills of job- seekers. the government to develop a policy around youth labour.

UNDP Maldives these complex development challenges facing Maldives. As the NHDR suggests, in order to manage the quality of life in both rural and urban locations, and to counter rural to urban migration, it is important to develop peripheral hubs outside Male. Developing a hierarchy of services for various categories of islands and clearly informing people of the availability of services at each level has become imperative. This approach would involve central hub islands that provide tertiary services and periphery islands that provide selected services. This could significantly reduce the cost of providing services.

As the main political parties fought in tightly contested elections, there were fears of negative consequences on social harmony. The election results were only announced after an unexpectedly prolonged course, with the elections being postponed on multiple occasions. When countries undergo difficult transitions like these, the ensuing social and political tensions can have untoward effects on the nation\u2019s social fabric. This can lead to difficult social relations\u2014 adversely affecting community psychology. The impacts are felt much more acutely if the communities are smaller, where everyone knows everyone else. With these sensitivities in mind, UNDP, in addition to providing technical support to the Election Commission to hold credible elections and conducting voter education, also placed a strong emphasis on social cohesion by creating spaces for dialogue. After the elections, these platforms for dialogue evolved into a forum to address other societal issues. Take Lhaviyani Atoll Olhuvelifushi Island -- home to some 600 people -- for example. Like other islands in the Maldives, it suffers from a lack of a proper waste management system. Absence of designated waste disposal areas and lack of awareness on practices such as waste separation, recycling and treatment have become serious matters of concern. Through participatory dialogue, UNDP Maldives along with Local Government Authority (LGA), worked with men and women of Olhuvelifushi to openly and constructively discuss waste management and other issues. At the end of the dialogue, the community devised an Action Plan together with the Island Council and worked out a timeline to rollout different activities to address the issue. \u201cWe want our island to be a model for other islands. To solve our problems, we need to work together despite political or other differences. Hopefully, Olhuvelifushi will demonstrate that\u201d Nadheema Mohamed, 33, participant said. YASMEEN RASHEED PROJECT COORDINATOR \u2013 RESULT AREA 3, INTEGRATED GOVERNANCE PROGRAMME, UNDP MALDIVES 35 ISLAND LIFE But it all began with efforts to create safe spaces in the run up to the elections in 2013. A youth dialogue series titled \u2018Elections Fever\u2019 was piloted in July 2013 to provide space for youth to express themselves in light of the divisions and conflicts arising due to the elections. More than 200 youth attended the series and many participated in the discussions that followed plays based on community theatre. Community-based theatre (CBT) emerged as an effective tool for dialogue\u2013especially in engaging the youth. Over the past three years, UNDP has trained over a dozen CBT facilitators and held over 20 youth dialogues across the country using CBT. Additionally, in 2015, a series of dialogues were conducted using CBT methodology in Male, Lhaviyani and Laamu Atoll with participation of over 60 young people as CBT actors. CBT has also been adapted as a way to conduct issue- It is a theatre that is at the service of ordinary people and that aims at democratizing peoples\u2019 access to art and culture not only as passive consumers but as active participants, as creators, in the process re-discovering their inherent creative potential usually dormant and atrophied after years of non-usage. It is an entirely community-driven process, in which people from different walks of life come together to collectively discuss important community issues, develop interactive plays about these issues and act out these plays in front of other people like them in order to start a search for grassroots solutions, in which the focus of the performance lies as much on the audience as on the actors on stage. It generates open conversation on an issue of community interest between different levels of the community. WHAT IS COMMUNITY-BASED THEATRE? based community dialogues in island communities, as UNDP demonstrated with interventions in southern atolls on issues such as gender equality, youth unemployment and political conflict. \u201cUNDP\u2019s community-based theatre is providing much needed space for public dialogue.

He was the Maldivian Government\u2019s Project Director for the reconstruction of houses in nine islands in the Maldives that were destroyed during the Indian Ocean tsunami that hit in December 2004. UNDP Maldives\u2019 Island Life spoke to Minister Ibrahim on the challenges and opportunities facing the Maldives, including fears about rising sea levels, depleting groundwater and their subsequent effects on agriculture and food security. The Maldives faces several environmental challenges, in addition to those from climate change. Can you elaborate on the government\u2019s vision for environmental protection? Our vision entails ensuring that Maldivians are environmentally aware, that there is minimal pollution and destruction of the environment, and that there is sustainable use of natural resources, land, reefs and the open sea. Rising sea levels present a very real and difficult challenge for the Maldives. What is your biggest fear? Over 80 percent of the total land area of the Maldives is less than one metre above the mean sea level. All of our critical infrastructure is very close to the shoreline. This includes the majority of tourism, fisheries, communication infrastructure, utility services and about one half of our housing infrastructure, which are all within 100 metres of the coastline. Beach erosion is already a serious problem for us and even by 2013, more than 60 percent of our inhabited islands were reporting serious erosion. Our biggest fears are that the rising oceans will deplete our groundwater, affecting agriculture and food security and eroding our shores, which will have devastating consequences on our livelihoods and economy. 38 U N D P M A L D I V E S While there are efforts being made by the government and the private sector to address climate change impacts on the tourism industry, coastal and beach erosion continue. Are you worried that this will affect tourist numbers in the long run? What measures does the government plan to take to address this issue? Despite the grave threats facing us, we are determined to build our resilience to climate change. The National Climate Change Policy Framework, recently adopted by the President, highlights as one of its policy goals, the strengthening of adaptation action and building climate resilient infrastructure and communities. To achieve this, we are already taking initiatives to incorporate climate change projections into development planning and infrastructure programmes to adopt sustainable adaptation technologies that are appropriate to the local context. With regard to the tourism sector, the Ministry is facilitating tourism adaptation programmes and other necessary initiatives to increase the resilience of the tourism sector to climate change impacts. Such initiatives include the development of appropriate policies and the creation of enabling environments for the introduction of low emission development technologies. Solid waste management is another big challenge. How is the government dealing with it? The environment has been placed under increasing pressure from the growing volume of waste being generated. Until recently, there was little infrastructure development for waste management. They tend to be limited to addressing specific waste issues for regions or for types of waste. Therefore, in order to address this issue, we are bringing in two different levels of waste management systems -- one is to create a community- based system where councils from the respective community will be responsible for implementation. On the other hand, we are also creating a regional system with a waste transfer system connected to the islands. The regional facilities will be operated and managed through a state-owned enterprise. The government recognises that without a national policy framework and implementation strategy for waste management, the potential for improving environmental outcomes in this sector will be limited. In this regard, we have formulated a national waste management policy, which was launched few days ago. This policy will play a critical role in determining broad national strategic directions for solid waste in the country, the most significant being the decision to pursue regional waste management systems for the treatment of waste in the Maldives. It also establishes cost-sharing arrangements for waste management that are based on the principle that the polluter should pay for", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b4ab857b-0785-4f1b-a632-a479fddda8a9": {"__data__": {"id_": "b4ab857b-0785-4f1b-a632-a479fddda8a9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-maldives-2016-island-life-magazine", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Maldives 2016 Island Life Magazine", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-maldives-2016-island-life-magazine", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f5f08a5c4f35ed4afbf833825f7b186435a2d32dd74b23e90f4f6b704a4ed0dd"}}, "hash": "f5f08a5c4f35ed4afbf833825f7b186435a2d32dd74b23e90f4f6b704a4ed0dd", "text": "waste management and disposal. In the meantime, the policy also identifies specific responsibilities for waste generators. It emphasises the construction of waste management infrastructure with provisions of waste to energy, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Obviously, addressing all these issues will require substantial investment and there are already a lot of ongoing actions. How do you see an increase in public and private investment to address the environmental challenges? Under the National Climate Change Policy Framework, we have developed a plan to sustainably finance climate action in the Maldives. We strongly believe that developed countries need to support vulnerable countries adapt and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Therefore, public funds need to be made available to address climate change impacts facing countries like the Maldives. We also believe that the new climate agreement needs to make sure there is adequate and predictable financial support beyond 2020 for climate actions. The Maldives is making efforts to strengthen the leveraging of private finance to the fullest extent possible. One of our most important activities in this regard is the Accelerating Sustainable Private Investments in Renewable Energy (ASPIRE) Project, which we recently launched. This programme aims to increase clean and renewable energy in our energy mix. I believe this programme will support H.E President Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom government\u2019s policy goal to meet 30 percent of our daily peak energy demand from renewable sources. This project would also enable private sector investment in PV infrastructure development and diversify the investment base of the country by developing a local market, as well as expertise in renewable energy. The project will p Coastal Erosion has had severe impacts on livelihoods forcing some islanders to relocate their homes from coastal areas. UNDP Maldives 39 ISLAND LIFE make strategic use of different funding sources, including government funds as well as support from the World Bank\u2019s International Development Agency, the Scaling up Renewable Energy Investment Programme, and private sector funding to push to increase private sector risk-taking in this sector. This is just one example of our efforts to increase private sector investment in addressing environmental challenges. However, I would like to note that it is very hard for us to attract private funding for adaptation projects, such as coastal protection infrastructure, as these investments have little or no profit generation potential. The successful joint proposal by UNDP and Government of Maldives has led to the Global Climate Fund (GCF) approving a significant amount of funding for the Maldives in November 2015. Can you elaborate on how the funds will be used? I am very pleased the Green Climate Fund recently approved a USD 23.6 million grant to implement a project to address climate change induced water shortages in the northern atolls of the Maldives. Water security in a total 49 islands will be ensured under this project. During the past few years, we have been observing unusually long dry seasons, as a result of global climate change. As most of the communities in outer islands depend on harvested rainwater for drinking, and the existing storage capacity is no longer enough to last until the rainy season, the government faces severe challenges as well as added costs each year to deliver emergency water supplies to outer islands. The proposed project would also contribute to the achievement of several of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. These include not only the goals to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, and the goal to combat the impacts of climate change, but this would also contribute to the goals to promote sustainable agriculture, ensure healthy lives, and contribute to achieving gender equality, among others.\u201d How do you gauge the partnership among UNDP, the people and the Government of the Maldives in addressing environmental challenges? For over three decades, UNDP has been supporting the Maldives and its people in environment protection, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and in recovery from natural disasters. UNDP has been a crucial partner in working on increasing climate resilience and in providing financial and technical support in preserving and restoring the environment. Undeniably, this has enhanced peoples\u2019 well-being and livelihoods. How do you see future collaborations between UNDP and the government? What improvements would you like to see in terms of the support that UNDP provides to the government? We see a future of close collaboration and cooperation. Climate change is a top priority in terms of development policies. We need support in capacity building at the national, atoll and island level so that climate change information can be translated into policies, followed by their effective implementation.

The island of Maalhos, like the majority of the islands in Maldives, traditionally depended on ground water collected from the freshwater lens of the island as the primary source of both clean drinking water as well as water for other daily needs. But for the people of this island, the days of collecting water from the miskithuvalhu (\u2018mosque well\u2019) is long gone. \u201cOur ground water is contaminated. It is unusable, unsafe and unhealthy. It is only good to flush toilets,\u201d explains 41-year-old Aishath Zulfa, who is the Vice President of the island\u2019s Women\u2019s Development Committee. \u201cThere was a time when we would all go to the mosque well to collect water. But today, the ground water has a pungent odor and a murky white color.\u201d Rising demands for water due to an increase in population took their toll on the limited freshwater supplies beneath the ground. The absence of a proper sewerage system and an unhealthy and environmentally-unsound system of draining sewage into the ground through septic tanks further worsened the matter. \u201cBut we are still forced to use the water as we do not have any other alternative,\u201d says Zulfa. \u201cWe use air pumps to aerate the water so that we can at least get rid of the odour to some extent.\u201d With the Maldives being ground zero for the immediate effects of climate change, unpredictable weather and rainfall patterns put islanders even more at risk. \u201cFor the past three years, we have requested 30 tonnes of emergency water from the government each year during the dry season,\u201d says Abdulla Shujau, President of the Maalhos Island Council. Realising the deficit of groundwater, local authorities have worked hard to introduce rainwater collection tanks that can store up to 2,500 litres of water into almost all households. But these tanks are all still dependent on rainfall. \u201cAnd we are no longer able to accurately predict how long the dry season will last,\u201d says Shujau. \u201cEven in the dry season, it may rain for the first month or two.

BRINGING GOVERNMENTS CLOSER TO CITIZENS Technology is helping local governments connect with their communities to address local issues AMINATH SHOOZA PROJECT ASSOCIATE, ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT PORTFOLIO & INNOVATION AMBASSADOR, UNDP MALDIVES Active citizen participation is key to good governance, yet very rarely are there avenues in developing countries where citizens can hold their governments accountable from their own comfort zone\u2014without having to attend town hall meetings or knocking on the doors of city councils. This situation is changing in the Maldives, ever since the launch of an innovative method for citizens to participate in governance and have their voices heard. Inspired by the United Kingdom\u2019s \u2018Fix My Street\u2019 platform, several online platforms have been developed in the Maldives for citizens to anonymously report the problems they notice. For instance, if a local fisherman notices that people are dumping garbage haphazardly, he can log onto Make-My-Island, either through the web or the mobile app, and report the matter then and there with details outlining the nature and location of the problem. The complaint is recorded on the website and mapped digitally. The council then addresses this problem and reports back to the reporter informing that something has been done about his complaint. Further, the website is a transparent I N N O V A T I O N 43 ISLAND LIFE How Does Make My Island Work ? platform where anyone can see how many issues are reported and addressed by the authorities. The Maldives\u2019 prototype Make-My-Island project was partnered with UNDP to tailor a cost-free solution for island residents. A series of prototype tests are being conducted in Laamu Atoll Fonadhoo Island by UNDP Maldives, with the support of the Fonadhoo Island Council and the local community, including women and youth groups and local NGOs. The results have been impressive for a pilot project. After citizens submitted their complaints, 24 municipal issues, such as damaged street lights and unauthorised dumping of waste, were reported and addressed. Since testing began, residents have reported a more engaged local council that is responding to their concerns. This will hopefully lead to improved local services in Fonadhoo and become an example of what is possible for other remote islands of the Maldives. \u201cThis project is a great asset for the police,\u201d said Ahmed Shakir, chief of police in Laamu Atoll. Who is a key partner in scaling up the pilot to four other islands of Laamu Atoll. The project is currently being tested in Male\u2019 and greater Male\u2019 to address issues of littering. The project leverages the Maldives\u2019 youth bulge and its high level of mobile phone penetration to help bring governments closer to citizens. While there are fewer town hall meetings between residents and local councils, the country has over 600,000 mobile phone subscribers, for a national population of only 400,000.

Despite the fact that the Maldives fares significantly better than many countries when it comes to gender equality, ranking 49th on the Gender Inequality Index in UNDP\u2019s 2014 Global Human Development Report, women like Zaieema remain the exception. Women\u2019s participation in public life and decision- making is not proportional to the strides the Maldives has made in reducing gender inequality. Women\u2019s political representation remains low, with women holding a mere 6 percent of seats in both the national parliament and local councils. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many women ready to step into leadership positions,\u201d says Zaeema. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many opportunities and even where women perform, there is very little recognition of their work.\u201d Zaieema does her part by providing training and support for other women to take up more leadership positions. She is also a big promoter of livelihood opportunities for women, training them on acquiring and retaining G E N D E R E Q U A L I T Y STILL SOME WAY TO GO p Zaeema ( L ) is a leading female figure in Laamu Atoll. UNDP Maldives 45 ISLAND LIFE traditional handicraft skills. Zaieema is hopeful about the future. Under the Decentralization Act amendments put forward to the Parliament, a minimum of one seat will be reserved for the President of WDCs. UNDP is working to support women like Zaeema and help prepare others for leadership positions in public sphere. For the next five years, UNDP will be working with the government and civil society groups to increase participation and representation of women in the public sphere. The formidable barriers to women\u2019s participation in public office are often the same ones restricting their participation in the labour force. The unemployment rate for women was 31 percent in 2010 and across all sectors and industries, the mean monthly income for women is lower than that of men. According to the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (2009 \u2013 2010), while the major reason given by both women and men for being unemployed was because they were unable to find suitable employment, 22 percent of women cited household chores as a reason, and another 3 percent were deterred by objections from family members. UNDP\u2019s baseline survey on women in public life further underlined that marriage and pregnancy at a young age, geographical isolation and social norms restricting women\u2019s mobility are factors that hamper women\u2019s participation in paid work. Furthermore, sexual and gender-based violence is widespread in the Maldives. According to The Maldives Study on Women\u2019s Health and Life Experiences 2007, one out of three women aged 15-49 is reported to have experienced at least one form of physical and/or sexual violence. Thus, a lot more needs to be done to ensure that women, who constitute 49 percent of the Maldivian population, are able to participate in national development processes. In other words, increasing women\u2019s contribution and participation in national development is crucial for the future of the country and requires interventions at all levels, across all sectors. Legislation and policies to uphold gender equality commitments need to be introduced. It should be noted that key legislations, such as the Domestic Violence Prevention Act (2012), Sexual Harassment Prevention Act and Sexual Offences Act (2014) have been adopted. Ongoing work to pass a Gender Equality Law is another important step forward. Furthermore, institutions need to embrace gender sensitive practices, such as flexible working arrangements and effective mechanisms to address work place harassment. // Increasing women\u2019s contribution and participation in national development is crucial for the future of the Maldives and requires interventions at all levels, across all sectors. q A Female Military Officer", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a9434130-d340-4dae-8082-bd83a2ec8476": {"__data__": {"id_": "a9434130-d340-4dae-8082-bd83a2ec8476", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-maldives-2016-island-life-magazine", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Maldives 2016 Island Life Magazine", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-maldives-2016-island-life-magazine", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bc9626613819c4f453697261312dd20763045f0059b80bd0bc71d84138210f39"}}, "hash": "bc9626613819c4f453697261312dd20763045f0059b80bd0bc71d84138210f39", "text": "Attending a workshop on women\u2019s empowerment organised by UNDP and the Government. UNDP Maldives 46 U N D P M A L D I V E S WHAT ARE THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS? The Sustainable Development Goals, otherwise known as the 2015 Global Goals for Sustainable Development (SDGs), build on the Millennium Development Goals(MDGs), eight anti-poverty targets that the world committed to achieving by 2015. The MDGs, adopted in 2000, aimed at an array of issues that included slashing poverty, hunger, disease, gender inequality, and access to water and sanitation. Enormous progress has been made on the MDGs, showing the value of a unifying agenda underpinned by goals and targets. Despite this success, the indignity of poverty has not been ended for all. The new SDGs, and the broader sustainability agenda, go much further than the MDGs, addressing the root causes of poverty and the universal need for development that works for all people. UNDP Administrator Helen Clark noted: \u201cThis agreement marks an important milestone in putting our world on an inclusive and sustainable course. If we all work together, we have a chance of meeting citizens\u2019 aspirations for peace, prosperity, and wellbeing, and to preserve our planet.\u201d All 17 Sustainable Development Goals are connected to UNDP\u2019s Strategic Plan focus areas: sustainable development,democratic governance and peacebuilding, and climate and disaster resilience. MALDIVES AND SDGs The government of Maldives has already taken steps to begin implementation by convening a national committee for SDGs. The Maldives has achieved five out of the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) ahead of the 2015 deadline, making it South Asia\u2019s only MDG plus country. 48 U N D P M A L D I V E S www.mv.undp.org www.facebook.com/UNDPMaldives www.twitter.com/UNDPMaldives www.youtube.com/UNDPMaldives Empowered lives.

Acknowledgements vi Report of the ASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities FOREWORD The UNDP and the ASEAN Secretariat\u2019s work that resulted in this \u201cASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities\u201d demonstrates the ASEAN region\u2019s commitment to better accountability in the measurement of progress. This is an international norm that now also palpably guides the region\u2019s own conduct. In the case of the Millenium Development Goals (MDG5) the measurement of progress was part and parcel of the commitment to act collectively in full view of the ASEAN peoples. When we measure we understand better what we are doing well and where it is being done well. We come to understand where we should look for exemplars within and outside of our states, especially when some of our efforts might be found wanting. Significant MDG challenges remain and the report shows that more complex challenges are clearly upon us. The different ASEAN sectoral bodies have begun to describe the challenges for the regionin the coming years through the medium of this report. Yet, the backward glance we are given here revealing unachieved MDGs warns of the need to first persevere further to acquire some of the seemingly more rudimentary development capabilities. Before, or even as, the ASEAN buckles down to creating more sophisticated institutions for confronting the new challenges we are here made more than just dimly aware that it is the rudimentary capabilities after all that must stack up one upon another in order to form complex capabilities for development. Perhaps it is the juxtaposition of the remaining MDG challenges and of the Post-2015 priorities in a single report that allows for this important sort of epiphany. We thank the UNDP for supporting and working with the ASEAN Secretariat in making this report possible, and we look forward to the continuing collaboration. Patrocinio Jude H. Esguerra Ill SOMRDPE Chair/Representative of the Philippines vii Report of the ASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities FOREWORD When the ten ASEAN Member States embarked on the process of building an ASEAN Community by 2015, they committed themselves to maintaining peace and promoting prosperity in the region with a promise of better quality of life, narrowed development gaps and a caring and sharing community for all ASEAN peoples. With ASEAN\u2019s Community building process closely linked to the global development agenda, all ASEAN Member States along with the international community sealed their commitment to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) also by 2015. To cooperate with and assist each other in fulfilling national MDG commitments, ASEAN adopted the ASEAN Roadmap for the Attainment of the MDGs in 2011. This is the framework for collective action to accelerate development progress in the region. Through the synergy of efforts at both national and regional levels, coupled with support from partners and stakeholders, ASEAN has achieved great strides in poverty reduction, health and education, women empowerment and partnerships for sustainable development. With the imminent realization of the ASEAN Community by the end of this year, the regional assessment concluded that while there has been uneven progress across countries and targets, the ASEAN region as a whole has shown remarkable achievements in the attainment of the MDGs. With these significant accomplishments and lessons learned, it is hoped that this assessment report provides guideposts for key challenges to be addressed and opportunities to be seized with a view toensuring ASEAN\u2019s resilience and competitiveness beyond 2015. Together with the international community, ASEAN will continue to play a significant rolein further reducing poverty and promoting prosperity for all the peoples of the Community.

It also suggests ways that regional support and collaboration can help. The joint assessment found that the impact of the MDGs is visible in the ASEAN region. This is especially true in terms of reducing poverty. But this progress has been uneven, with significant differences between countries and between different groups within countries. Looking ahead, the analysis points to a range of challenges broadly grouped around two themes. First, there is still a need to reach the most vulnerable and remote populations who missed out on the benefits of the MDGs. Second, many ASEAN Member States are ready to move to the next stage of sustainable development. This means confronting new challenges such as rapid urban growth and non-communicable diseases. It also means more ambitious targeting of longstanding ones, such as focusing on the quality of education and creating a high skilled labour supply to meet the demands of the market. The 2030 Agenda and the SDGs can help guide longer-term development and monitoring. But countries will need to decide their own ways of integrating these aspiration targets into national plans. The joint regional assessment can help ASEAN Member States with this important task, highlighting priority areas for action to make the new global agenda relevant to national needs. We think this report will be an important contribution to the region\u2019s development. UNDP thanks the ASEAN Secretariat for their close partnership and looks forward to further collaboration in assisting countries in the region to meet their development aspirations. Haoliang Xu UN Assistant Secretary-General, UNDP Assistant Administrator and Director of the Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific ix Report of the ASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities 3 Report of the ASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities Executive Summary 2015 and Beyond: Setting Development Priorities i. 2015 represents a double milestone for the ten countries that make up the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). It is the target year for the establishment of an ASEAN Community. It is also the target year for the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which are integrated in the ASEAN Roadmap for the Attainment of the MDGs, a framework for collective action to accelerate development progress. Since their inception in 2000, the eight MDGs, encompassing a broad set of fundamental development challenges, have had a significant impact on the global agenda for development, defining priorities, measuring progress, and driving results for global poverty reduction and development (Box A). ii. Planning for the post-MDG era is now well underway. As the global framework is finalized and ASEAN moves towards setting its post-2015 vision, it is a good time to assess the MDG agenda and identify new strategies for further inclusive and sustainable development in the region. In this context, this report takes stock of the MDGs in ASEAN, focusing on the following questions: What progress has been made? What targets have been more difficult to reach? What new challenges and opportunities are arising that will need to be integrated in a post- 2015 development strategy for ASEAN? And how can ASEAN move towards defining and implementing these strategies? Box A: The Millennium Development Goals Goal 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger Goal 2: Achieve universal primary education Goal 3: Promote gender equality and empower women Goal 4: Reduce child mortality Goal 5: Improve maternal health Goal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability Goal 8: Develop a global partnership for development The MDG Agenda: Success Stories and Unfinished Tasks iii. This review shows that the ASEAN region has accomplished a great deal on the MDG agenda, particularly in terms of reducing poverty. There has also been some convergence in socio-economic indicators, with the poorest and in 1990 less developed countries showing particularly strong progress in many areas. But 4 Report of the ASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities progress is also uneven, and especially the challenge of rebalancing economic growth towards a sustainable pattern has remained a challenge universally. Moreover, there are significant differences between countries, and between different groups within countries, pointing to specific groups of vulnerable people who have not partaken in the process of human development to the same extent as others. iv. ASEAN\u2019s progress on poverty reduction is impressive by any standard. In some twenty years, the region has transformed itself from one struggling with pervasive levels of extreme poverty to one with moderate poverty levels.

But achievements are not uniform: a few countries have seen less rapid reduction than others. Translated into absolute terms, Lao PDR, Indonesia, the Philippines and Cambodia host some 160 million people living on less than two dollars per day. Poverty reduction is also uneven within countries, leaving rural populations and ethnic minorities behind. And poverty reduction has not resulted in a concomitant reduction in malnutrition, which still affects one in three children in Lao PDR and Cambodia. v. The value placed on education has been a trademark of Southeast Asia and already in the early 2000s, a vast majority of children in primary school age attended school. By now, almost all children finish primary education in Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam, and Brunei Darussalam. This has paid off in high levels of foundational skills (e.g., literacy, numeracy), and top ratings for Vietnam and Singapore in international assessments of student competencies. Some specific groups, especially children from lower socio-economic backgrounds, still remain at a disadvantage, especially at post-primary levels of education. But girls and women have equal access to education compared to boys and men in most countries; female literacy rates are also high. vi. Women have become more empowered as economic development has proceeded. But there is still a significant gap between women and men in terms of political representation. Women are also less likely to be able to harness their full earnings capacity they have less access than men to paid employment outside the household. vii. ASEAN Member States have significantly reduced health risks facing their populations, especially for children and women. Poorer countries have seen significant progress, not least due to targeted prevention programs like vaccination. Nonetheless, the target of reducing child mortality by two thirds has not been reached in most countries. And in spite of increased attention given to prenatal care and safe deliveries, progress on reducing health risks to pregnant women is uneven and has even been reversed in a few countries. However, in countries severely affected by epidemics like HIV/AIDS, infection rates have been reduced. viii. Progress on sustainable development, pairing development and increased quality of life with respect for a balanced and healthy environment in the future \u2013 has been very mixed. Emissions in carbon dioxide have increased in parallel with 5 Report of the ASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities economic growth, and the deforestation process has been rapid in some countries. At the same time, some progress has been made on increasing access to improved water sources and sanitation systems (which in themselves are intimately linked to health and well-being). ix. Lastly, the review of the MDGs also showed that comprehensive and recent data are available for most parts of the monitoring exercise, suggesting that ASEAN Member States, by and large, have strong statistical systems that can provide this vital information. Nonetheless, some gaps still exist, and more disaggregated indicators will be needed in the future. Emerging Challenges x. Together with those parts of the MDG agenda that remain incomplete, emerging challenges form a set of leading themes for building inclusive and sustainable growth in the post-2015 era. xi. Inclusive economic and social progress. Even as poverty has fallen across the board, groups of \u201ccore poor\u201d are emerging that are not able to benefit from economic development to the same extent as others. In parallel, inequality is increasing, and differences in opportunities according to location (rural and urban) and higher level skills (haves and have nots) are becoming accentuated. xii. Balanced urban growth. By 2013, nearly 300 million people in ASEAN Member States lived in urban agglomerations, of which more than twenty-five percent are in cities with over one million habitants. In the next fifteen years, ASEAN\u2019s urban areas are expected to have to accommodate another 100 million people. Whereas this expansion represents the fact that economic opportunities have become concentrated in urban areas, it puts high pressure on urban planning for infrastructure and other public services. Currently, urban inequality is also increasing and urban development is not keeping up with the massive expansion. People living in urban areas are also increasingly at risk to natural disasters and the impacts of climate change. xiii. More productive jobs and more skills adapted to those jobs. ASEAN\u2019s economies have seen a transformation in the structure of production and employment towards higher value added products and services.

However, by the same token, uneven access to good jobs remains a critical cause of poverty. Rural populations largely depend on an agricultural sector that is marred by limited labor productivity and among the poorer member states, a majority of the population is not in secure wage employment but in informal sector jobs and/or self-employment. At the same time, youth are finding difficulties in completing the transition from school to work. Workers\u2019 opportunities for good jobs depend partly on the skills they have and how relevant these are for labor markets. Although lack of access to education is one problem, the share of unemployed with tertiary education is also on the rise in many countries. And although countries are increasingly providing strong foundational skills, more 6 Report of the ASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities work is needed to build on these skills and adapt the skills sets \u2013 including technical, entrepreneurial, people and communications \u2013 to labor markets. xiv. New health threats. Non-communicable diseases were not included as priority health areas in the MDGs. However, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes are becoming increasingly significant sources of premature deaths. Their increasing significance may partly be ascribed to changing consumption and environmental patterns. At the other extreme, intensified globalization means increased threat of pandemics, such as the Avian Flu or SARS in the recent past. Strong coordination and communication are needed to manage disease outbreaks successfully. xv. Climate change. ASEAN Member States are exposed to the effects of climate change, such as rising sea levels, more frequent and more powerful floods, and risks to food security. It remains a very hazard prone area, highly vulnerable to natural disasters \u2013 some effects of which are intensified by climate change itself. There is a compelling need to work towards reversing the negative trends in terms of emissions and other effects of unsustainable consumption and production patterns. At the same time, ASEAN Member States must proactively reduce disaster risks and build more resilient communities that can resist shocks, recover from their impacts, and adapt positively to the changing environment. xvi. Social protection systems. Experiences from the recent past, in particular distress in connection with the Asian financial crisis in 1997-1998, as well as a look towards the future, provide several motivations for strong social protection systems. Solid systems help protect individuals and families, especially more marginalized groups, from economy wide shocks as well as those risks related to everyday life, including unemployment, illness, death of a family provider, droughts, and so on. A flexible social protection system can therefore help cushion shocks that are transmitted into globally and regionally integrated economies, help cope with the effects of natural disasters, and help reach those groups of core or chronically poor that are not able to benefit from economic growth. The ASEAN Declaration on Strengthening Social Protection, adopted in 2013, emphasizes that social protection is a human right and that nobody in need should be excluded from essential services (ASEAN, 2013a). Ways Forward xvii. In sum, much has been achieved in terms of the MDGs. It is now time to take the agenda forward and include new challenges and opportunities. Policy coordination and coherence is at the center of the agenda. There are strong synergies between different policy areas: skills help secure better employment which helps reduce poverty, balanced urban growth helps balance environmental concerns, and better water management improves health and nutrition. Some policy challenges are also better tackled at a regional level, including risks related to climate change and pandemics. xviii. ASEAN is focused on promoting and facilitating active regional collaboration around important policy issues. It will remain so going forward. Currently, 7 Report of the ASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities collaborative work is carried forward primarily through established focal points in ASEAN\u2019s sectoral bodies. It is a good time to consider how these activities are working, including for the purposes set out by the ASEAN Roadmap for the Attainment of the MDGs such as strengthening advocacy around development goals, building and sharing knowledge, and the identification and exchange of expertise (ASEAN, 2011). As the region turns its focus to defining a set of post- 2015 priorities, it is thus appropriate to raise questions about how regional solutions might be delivered most effectively. For example, can the current implementation mechanisms be strengthened further? Is collaboration working better for some thematic areas than others? Does the availability of expertise from inside and outside the region differ?

Are there follow-up mechanisms in place that enhance accountability and help identify next steps? Moving forward, key activities to consider in the context of the post-2015 development agenda include: xix. Identifying good practices and setting regional norms. ASEAN can establish the principle of results-driven and results based policy, focusing on identifying good and innovative approaches, and evaluating their effectiveness. ASEAN should continue to work towards identifying best practices across the different policy areas and themes \u2013 from within the Community and from outside the region, as well as setting standards and norms. xx. Promoting peer-to-peer exchanges. Countries with different development challenges in the aggregate may nonetheless identify common areas of policy interests. ASEAN remains well placed to identify and promote bilateral exchanges around common themes. In view of emerging themes, this may include policy targeting of ethnic minorities, accessing remote populations, processes of decentralization, challenges for mega-cities, and other areas that are shared concerns for some countries and not for others. xxi. Improving monitoring frameworks. \u201cWhat gets measured gets done\u201d, and once a set of new development priorities has been established, ASEAN should have the mandate to develop a solid monitoring and evaluation framework. This report has identified significant variation in data availability across the region, probably reflecting differences in statistical capacity between countries. The task remains to build further statistical capacity, harmonize measurements, identify relevant indicators, and provide regular monitoring and evaluation of the framework. xxii. Enhancing statistical capacity. In particular, ASEAN could complement international efforts at measuring and harmonizing data, especially by focusing more on disaggregated indicators. The MDGs have been monitored by the UN agencies and while ASEAN could monitor the completion of these databases, data collection work should be coordinated and not duplicated. But a key lesson of the MDG process has been that aggregate indicators do not always capture specific vulnerable groups. This is increasingly an issue of concern in ASEAN, where significant improvements overall sometimes disguise slower progress for some core groups. While the new global framework cannot be expected to focus on all forms of disaggregation, ASEAN could take on the role of complementing the broader monitoring frameworks with such disaggregated indicators, putting 8 Report of the ASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities more emphasis on distinctions between rural and urban, poor and non-poor regions or population groups, and gender in a diverse set of social and environmental indicators. In addition, and as discussed above, the increasing complexity of objectives and the transition towards multi-dimensional and interdependent development goals will also require new approaches to defining indicators for concepts like productive and decent jobs, inclusive growth, and higher order skills. Such efforts should be closely coordinated with institutions like the ADB and the UN system, in particular ESCAP. 11 Report of the ASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities 1. Introduction 2015 and beyond 1. Since their inception in 2000, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have had a significant impact on the global agenda for development: they have served to identify shared views on development priorities and have established a globally recognized framework for commitment, monitoring, and evaluation. Strong progress has also been made towards the eight goals over the past 15 years, particularly in terms of addressing extreme poverty, combating communicable diseases, and improving access to primary education.1 2. The MDGs are aligned with the purposes of ASEAN, in particular those related to alleviating poverty and promoting inclusive and sustainable development for its peoples. As a result of this shared vision, the MDGs have been integrated in the ASEAN Roadmap for the Attainment of the MDGs, a framework for collective action to accelerate development(ASEAN, 2011),and progress has been monitored and assessed. 3. 2015 represents a double milestone for ASEAN: it is the target year for the establishment of an ASEAN Community, and it is the target year for moving beyond the MDGs into the next sets of development challenges. The ASEAN charter (adopted in 2008) identifies common areas of policy priority with a strong bearing on development, but which were not explicitly included in the MDGs. These include, inter alia, ensuring safety and security from conflict; fostering democracy, good governance, and respect for human rights; and guaranteeing equitable access to opportunities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "88dcdd41-13d3-46ea-baa2-2a05b2daa2ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "88dcdd41-13d3-46ea-baa2-2a05b2daa2ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-asean-regional-assessment-mdg-achievement-and-post-2015-development-priorities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the ASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-asean-regional-assessment-mdg-achievement-and-post-2015-development-priorities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "878fa17e8688d0db71a789aca0ead14a1a7808ad99f79ee7a580a25e42a677d9"}, "2": {"node_id": "26b5dd68-e9e4-4d32-8b1a-6e3dc16fa812", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-asean-regional-assessment-mdg-achievement-and-post-2015-development-priorities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2ed561f10f101b413330fc0aaa97d45827614e7147b860a3ce6408670f868c13"}}, "hash": "123ab67fcc85bc08ee1c466aafe86755d49502cdc3d41262fd56990873cb4e46", "text": "The same themes are also garnering attention globally as the post- 2015 development agenda takes shape.

This report is organized as follows. o The remainder of the introduction presents economic and other events that have impacted MDG progress, particularly in recent years. o Section 2 assesses achievements in terms of the MDGs in ASEAN Member States, highlighting both areas of success and remaining challenges. o Section 3 moves to the emerging issues that need to be addressed. o The final and concluding section provides suggestions for areas and modes where regional support and collaboration can help countries tackle priority areas for development identified as critical for ASEAN Member States in the post-2015 era. The MDG era - growth, shocks and resilience 6. During the past 25 years \u2013 the period of evaluation for the MDGs \u2013 the ASEAN Community has seen an impressive economic transformation and has developed into a significant global economic power. If the ASEAN Member States were one economy, the combined output of the ten member states would today amount to the seventh largest economy in the world. ASEAN\u2019s economic expansion compares well with other emerging as well as developed countries: in recent years, economic growth rates have surpassed those of Chile and Korea, and while the distance in the size of the economy to China has increased, that to developed OECD countries like Finland has fallen (Figure 1.1, a). With the exception of Brunei Darussalam, all countries have seen their economies (GDP) grow by more than four percent per year on average since 2000. At the same time, ASEAN economies have 13 Report of the ASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities moved up the value added ladder. Less developed countries saw a shift in production out of agriculture and into industries while more developed countries in the region transformed more decisively into service economies. 7. Moreover, since the Asian crisis, ASEAN Member States have also managed to build up stronger resilience to economic and financial shocks. These strategies paid off, as witnessed by the comparatively contained impact of the global financial crisis in 2007-2010 (Figure 1.1, b). Although ASEAN has weathered economic shocks from the international economic and financial system better than in the past, the region has also been exposed to significant climatic and health shocks in recent years.

In spite of some economic convergence over time, the countries in ASEAN also remain very diverse (Table 1.1).The region spans countries at vastly different levels of development, as measured by GNI per capita: two high income countries, two upper middle income countries, four lower middle income countries, and two low income countries2 2 In 2015, the World Bank established threshold levels for the classification along Gross National Income per capita in USD as follows: Low income \u2264USD 1,045, lower middle income \u2264USD 4,125, upper middle income \u2264USD 12,755, high income USD 12,746 or above. .

Even countries at comparable income levels have different contexts: Indonesia accounts for two-fifths of ASEAN\u2019s total population and Lao PDR for one percent, and less than one-third of Malaysia\u2019s population live in rural areas compared to over half of Thailand\u2019s population.

The Millennium Development Goals: taking stock 9. The 2011 ASEAN report on the MDGs pointed to significant achievements in terms of meeting the MDGs but with some variation in outcomes across different measures of development goals, across countries, and across groups. In particular, the ASEAN region as a whole has been an early achiever in reducing poverty and malnutrition, in increasing the attendance of skilled personnel at child birth, in reducing mortal diseases such as tuberculosis, and in improving access to basic sanitation. The region was, generally, on track to reduce infant and child mortality by 2015. However, the ASEAN region overall had been comparatively slower in ensuring access to basic education and in providing better sources of (drinking) water to the population. Finally, no progress had been noted on a climate issue of significant importance to the region, namely the decline in forest cover(ASEAN, 2012). 10. This current review of attainments towards each goal also shows that the ASEAN region has accomplished a great deal on the MDG agenda. In particular, remarkable progress has been made towards lifting people out of extreme poverty, defined as those living on less than one dollar per day.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "41cfae0b-eab1-4af4-b977-aa37afc42452": {"__data__": {"id_": "41cfae0b-eab1-4af4-b977-aa37afc42452", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-asean-regional-assessment-mdg-achievement-and-post-2015-development-priorities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the ASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-asean-regional-assessment-mdg-achievement-and-post-2015-development-priorities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8ae29c3d66cdd2ae204dada71036e792903f461cbe021b1b52c58d321a506fe2"}, "2": {"node_id": "984f513e-dcef-4d74-8ded-85239bac23a0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-asean-regional-assessment-mdg-achievement-and-post-2015-development-priorities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "820e7da4d80561e3f93b987179034a496429f71b31e5e9413523c6b148ef807a"}}, "hash": "dc3df70fb8c3f1d69f23aafebee6ea49654f60e28b6431bbd45956c2d18563b0", "text": "The number of people living on less than one dollar per day has fallen by more than 100 million since the early 1990s, during a time when the total population has increased by 100 million.

However, because of weaknesses in statistical capacity, including regional coordination, and the time lag in processing and reconciling statistical information, providing relevant and comparable benchmarking data for ten countries invariably involves trade-offs. In order to provide a succinct overview, the report has given preference to sources of information that provide comparable and consistent data across countries. Because the report is focused on achievements, meaning changes over time, data sources that provide consistent time series have also been selected, to the extent possible. With these constraints in mind, the data used below draw on a combination of data from national sources, provided by ASEAN Member States, and the United Nations country- level database for the Millennium Development Goals (United Nations Statistics Division, 2014), supplemented with information from the World Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators, and relevant ASEAN publications. Indicators presented below are drawn from a comprehensive MDG dataset prepared for the purpose of this report (Box 2.1). For each Goal, those indicators deemed most pertinent, given availability of data, are presented. There is a rich set of information available for the MDG monitoring framework \u2013 a testament to the general statistical capacity that has been built up in ASEAN countries 3 Data are lacking for some countries on some indicators. Information is shown for those countries that have reasonably recent data for assessing progress. 18 Report of the ASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities over the past decades and the commitment to respond to the challenge of measuring development progress. Yet the exercise undertaken for this report shows that significant data and information gaps still exist. There are countries that lack information on poverty and hunger, and data collection/reporting on health indicators, especially those related to reproductive health and HIV/AIDS, is generally weak. For others, disaggregated numbers by gender or rural/urban location are not readily available. In a few cases, data exist for one year only, which permits benchmarking against other countries but does not allow for an appreciation of developments over time. Overall, this demonstrates the continued importance of strengthening statistical capacity. Significant reduction in extreme poverty and hunger 11. In some twenty years, ASEAN has transformed itself from a region struggling with very high poverty to one with moderate levels of poverty. In the early 1990s, nearly one in two persons in the ASEAN region4 Figure 2.1 lived in extreme poverty (defined as living on less than one dollar per day), while two in three persons lived in moderate (defined as less than two dollars per day)or extreme poverty. With the exception of a few countries in the region, notably Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei Darussalam, poverty was thus a pervasive feature, affecting a majority of the population in most Member States. In the past few decades, the number and share of people suffering from such levels of deprivation have fallen dramatically and consistently over time. Today, about one in eight persons is affected by extreme poverty, still living on less than one dollar per day, with one in three living on less than two dollars per day. ASEAN Member States have also managed to maintain momentum over time, as the strong progress registered in the 1990s also continued in the 2000s. As a result, ASEAN\u2019s poverty levels are now almost half of those of South Asia and a quarter of those of Sub-Saharan Africa, although they trail behind the outstanding pace of poverty reduction witnessed in China ( , a and b). 12. Much of the regional progress can be assigned to what must be considered an extraordinary process of poverty reduction in a few populous countries. In Vietnam and Thailand, extreme poverty was virtually eradicated. Vietnam and Indonesia alone shifted some 100 million people out of extreme poverty. But there has also been progress in less populous countries. In 1990, nearly half of Cambodia\u2019s population was extremely poor, compared to only 10 percent in 2011. Encouragingly, the trends in reducing two dollar per day poverty are equally steep in these countries. Economic growth has not only shifted people above subsistence minimum, but it has helped a great number of people escape poverty altogether. 13. The transformation from a region with high to low poverty is nonetheless a qualified success. First, a few countries have seen a slower pace in reduction than others. In Lao PDR and the Philippines, extreme poverty rates fell by less than half \u2013 which, although successful from a global perspective, is slow progress in the context of ASEAN \u2013 and moderate", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "58befa0f-7de3-4420-8aff-eb4987ef5295": {"__data__": {"id_": "58befa0f-7de3-4420-8aff-eb4987ef5295", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-asean-regional-assessment-mdg-achievement-and-post-2015-development-priorities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the ASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-asean-regional-assessment-mdg-achievement-and-post-2015-development-priorities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2c3c33599843d4348d1fe3c9c8c7fdddb1a56f638c368e9ab9e17cc4442cfa12"}, "3": {"node_id": "24332a72-3c85-41a8-b7a0-f07866873cb6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-asean-regional-assessment-mdg-achievement-and-post-2015-development-priorities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "29807cbf4ad488a34711d411dc8adcf3f0a5c10a582e608090696d7746635eb4"}}, "hash": "e23d4598901f3701bb89656081a4a723830b2687326fa031687d3486c0096a25", "text": "poverty rates fell by only a quarter.

Second, in absolute terms, the region is still hosting a significant number of poor. 19 Report of the ASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities Taken together, in Lao PDR, Indonesia, the Philippines and Cambodia, some 160 million people are still living on less than two dollars per day (Figure 2.1, c and d).

Third, progress on poverty reduction is also uneven within countries, pointing to a more unbalanced growth process than can be discerned from national level data. In particular, differences in urban and rural populations have been accentuated over time. The incidence of poverty is at least twice as high in rural areas compared to urban areas in all Member States except Indonesia, and the gap has been increasing with the notable exception of Malaysia (Figure 2.2, a). In Vietnam, while poverty has fallen for both ethnic minorities and those who belong to a majority ethnic group, the gap in poverty rates has increased (World Bank, 2012b). 15. Fourth, poverty is both a cause and result of hunger: lack of food, or lack of the right food, is stunting physical and mental development in children, lowering the earning capacity of adults, and exposing pregnant women, infants and children in particular to serious health risks. Whereas the proportion of people exposed to hunger is less today than twenty-five years ago, the incidence of malnutrition has not fallen as rapidly as poverty levels. Only Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand have managed to halve, or more, the proportion of underweight children as set out by MDG 1. As late as 2006, three in ten Cambodian children under five remained malnourished (Figure 2.2, b).

Close to universal access to primary education 16. Education is fundamental for economic development, with the potential for raising productivity and future incomes, improving health and nutrition across generations, and helping establish democratic values. Strong emphasis on the value of education, well before the MDG agenda was defined, has been one of the most significant strengths of ASEAN Member States and part of its success story in terms of economic growth and diversification. In fact, access to primary level education was high already in the early 2000s, when over 90 percent of children in the relevant age group were enrolled in all countries but Lao PDR. The most recent data show nearly universal access in many countries (Figure 2.3, a). Almost all children in Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam, and Brunei Darussalam not only enter but also complete their primary education (Figure 2.3, b).Overall, ASEAN Member States compare very favorably with South Asian, Latin American, or African countries. 17.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "24332a72-3c85-41a8-b7a0-f07866873cb6": {"__data__": {"id_": "24332a72-3c85-41a8-b7a0-f07866873cb6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-asean-regional-assessment-mdg-achievement-and-post-2015-development-priorities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the ASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-asean-regional-assessment-mdg-achievement-and-post-2015-development-priorities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2c3c33599843d4348d1fe3c9c8c7fdddb1a56f638c368e9ab9e17cc4442cfa12"}, "2": {"node_id": "58befa0f-7de3-4420-8aff-eb4987ef5295", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-asean-regional-assessment-mdg-achievement-and-post-2015-development-priorities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e23d4598901f3701bb89656081a4a723830b2687326fa031687d3486c0096a25"}}, "hash": "29807cbf4ad488a34711d411dc8adcf3f0a5c10a582e608090696d7746635eb4", "text": "17.

Although enrolment rates now are high in Cambodia and Lao PDR, less than seventy percent of children actually finish primary school (Figure 2.3, c), and literacy rates are considerably lower than in other ASEAN Member States.6 Figure 2.3 Among other things, the high levels of malnutrition shown above are likely to influence children\u2019s ability to benefit from education, whether directly because of hunger or vulnerability to infection. And some groups remain more excluded from educational opportunities than others. For example, in Vietnam there are significant gaps in enrolment, even at primary levels, between girls from rich households and ethnic majorities, and those from poor households and ethnic minorities ( , d). In Malaysia, where enrolment rates are close to universal and have been for some time, the challenges in primary education now include bringing in the remaining few, dealing with undocumented children, and narrowing the gaps in access and outcomes between children with different socio-economic backgrounds(Government of Singapore, Ministry of Social and Family Development, 2013).

At the other end of the spectrum, where education gaps have been closing, further ground remains to be covered in terms of empowering women and giving them equal voice and influence in society. Although women\u2019s participation in political life is increasing, they are still underrepresented compared to men \u2013 although it is important to point out that this low representation is a global issue, affecting OECD countries overall as well (Figure 2.4, c)7 Figure 2.4 . Women are also still much less likely to access gainful employment outside of the household. Those who are employed are also more likely to be in vulnerable forms of employment, with worse job conditions including lower wages and with little or no recourse to social protection systems or basic safety nets ( , d). Again, specific groups are particularly at risk \u2013 including women belonging to migrant groups, ethnic minorities, and refugees \u2013 and remain outside the realm of policy focus (Jones & Stavropoulou, 2013). In more advanced economies, new challenges include the low representation of women in leadership positions, especially women on company boards. A study by GMI Ratings (a major corporate governance ratings firm) showed that as of March 2013, the percentage of board directorships held by women in Asia remains low \u2013 3 percent and 6 percent in industrialised and emerging countries, respectively(GMI Ratings, 2013). 7No information is available on the share of women in parliament in Brunei. However, the share of women in the top three civil service categories is roughly the same as men. 23 Report of the ASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities Figure 2.4: Girls have equal access to education and women are more (but far from equally) represented in politics (a) Ratio of girls to boys in primary and secondary education (%) (b) Women, adult (15-64) and youth (15- 24) literacy rates.

Improving health for all 22. Health is a precondition for, as well as an indicator and an outcome of progress in, sustainable development (World Health Organization, 2012). It is a human right and central measure of human well-being, and it forms the basis for a productive economy. The poorest countries in ASEAN have had to combat high mortality and exposure to ill health among children and women, and the region suffered from the onslaught and rapid spread of HIV/AIDS in the late 1980s. In 1990, nearly one out of five live-born children died before reaching the age of five in Lao PDR while one out of ten boys and girls under five died in Cambodia and Myanmar. Pregnant women were at high risk with an estimated 12 mothers out of a thousand dying in connection with childbirth. 23. Overall, these different health risks have been reduced, especially in those countries where, twenty-five years ago, the population was most exposed.

More generally, large multi-country outbreaks of infectious diseases (e.g., measles, diphtheria, etc.) reflect inadequate coverage and coordination at all levels in most countries. 24. At the same time, while measures towards improving reproductive health have paid off in many countries, in others the health risks involved with child birth remain high and have actually worsened. According to national estimates, maternal mortality ratios have fallen significantly in Lao PDR, Cambodia and Vietnam. However, changes in Indonesia and the Philippines are a cause of concern, as maternal mortality ratios(based on national estimates) have increased. The discrepancies to the modeled estimates8 Figure 2.5 are significant. A majority of, albeit not all, women give birth in the presence of skilled health staff, except in Lao PDR, and the share has increased everywhere, including the Philippines and Indonesia. However, the latter two countries also display large inequalities in access to health services across provinces and regions (UNICEF Indonesia, 2012). Although women are less likely than before to have children under the age of 20, adolescent pregnancies, which are a significant risk factor for child and maternal health, remain high. Moreover, five countries \u2013 Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and the Philippines \u2013 still have high maternal mortality ratios and adolescent birth rates compared with most middle-income countries globally. Among other things, the contraceptive needs of adolescent groups \u2013 not always a culturally accepted area of discussion \u2013are often left out of the agenda ( , c and d). 8 Modelled maternity ratios are estimated with a regression model using information on the proportion of maternal deaths among non-AIDS deaths in women ages 15-49, fertility, birth attendants, and GDP(World Bank, 2015). 25 Report of the ASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities Figure 2.5: Many more children survive their infancy and fragile first five years of life, but women\u2019s reproductive health is not improving everywhere (a) Infant mortality, 1990 and 2013 (b) Child (under five) mortality, 1990 and 2013 (c) Maternal Mortality Ratio (per 100,000), national estimates (early 2000s and latest) and latest modeled estimate (d) Shares of birth attended by skilled health staff, early 2000s and most recent Source: Estimates based on data sources as per Box 2.1. No national estimate available for Brunei. 25. The higher risk of dying from an often preventable disease is also a core risk for the poor. Southeast Asia has the highest infection rate of HIV/AIDS after Sub- Saharan Africa (Girard, 2013), and many of those afflicted are co-infected with tuberculosis. The spread of HIV/AIDS, however, has been contained over the past twenty years in the region.9 Figure 2.6 In particular, in countries which were harder hit, in particular Thailand and Cambodia, there has been a marked slowdown in infection rates after a peak at the end of the 1990s ( , a). These countries also show a comparatively high share of infected persons receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) than others. In Malaysia and Vietnam, however, where infection rates remain low but have increased, less than one-third of infected persons receive ART (Figure 2.6, b). Infections in many of Southeast Asia\u2019s countries are concentrated in a few hotspots, including mobile populations along transport corridors or highly exposed communities. The effects of high infection rates are evident: nearly 60,000 children under 15 are now living with HIV/AIDS in the region10 9No data are available for the incidence of HIV in Brunei\u2019s population aged 15-49.

Source. Estimates based on data sources as per Box 2.1. Mixed success on ensuring sustainable development 26. Sustainable consumption and production translates into the challenge of using services and products that increase quality of life while minimizing the use of natural resources, toxic materials, and emissions of waste and pollutants. In ASEAN as elsewhere, the ambitions to pair development and increasing consumption levels with respect for a balanced and healthy environment have met with mixed success. Global emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) have increased, and in ASEAN, CO2 consumption, measured per capita, has increased in all countries except Singapore. Measured in relation to GDP, emissions have stagnated or fallen, however, reflecting the fact that production and consumption patterns have not become more CO2 intensive but that instead emissions are the result of rapid economic growth (Figure 2.7, a and b). Deforestation is progressing rapidly in most countries except Vietnam and the Philippines, especially in Myanmar, Indonesia and Cambodia, contributing to soil erosion, impaired water cycles, and increased greenhouse effects (Figure 2.7, c).In line with a global trend, more progress has been made on reducing consumption of Ozone-Depleting Substances (ODS), i.e., man-made substances that cause ozone depletion.11 11 The Montreal Protocol was established in 1987 to combat ozone depletion. A recent report shows that the protocol has been very successful in combating ozone depletion across the globe(UNDP, 2014).. 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 Cambodia Indonesia Lao PDR Malaysia Myanmar Thailand Vietnam 0 20 40 60 80 100 Malaysia Vietnam Myanmar Lao PDR Thailand Cambodia Indonesia Brunei 27 Report of the ASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities Figure 2.7: Difficulties ensuring sustainable production and consumption patterns (a) CO2 emissions per capita (b) CO2 emissions, per PPP$ of GDP (c) Forest area 2010 or later, as % of area in 1990 (d) Consumption of all Ozone-Depleting Substances in ODP1 metric tons Source.

ODP = ozone-depleting potential-weighted metric tons which are metric tons of individual ozone-depleting substancesmultiplied by theirozone-depleting potential. 27. ASEAN has also successfully been increasing access to improved sanitation and water sources. In 1990, only a small minority of the populations in Lao PDR and Cambodia had access to any form of sanitation facilities. In fact, access levels were below countries in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. In several countries, a significant share of the population lacked access to improved water sources. In the 25 years that followed, and especially between 2000 and 2015, many more people were given access to cleaner water and better sanitation systems. However, the population living without an improved access to water remains higher than in China or even South Asia in most ASEAN Member States (Figure 2.8, a and b). 28.

Emerging challenges and policy issues 29. The review of progress on the MDG agenda has revealed strong, indeed remarkable achievements on areas at the heart of economic and social development. ASEAN populations have by and large been lifted out of extreme levels of poverty and deprivation, almost all children go through primary school, and child and maternal mortality have come down overall. Particularly strong progress has been noted in the poorest countries. 30. Yet, significant challenges have also been identified. This includes ensuring both more inclusive and more sustainable growth patterns, ensuring high quality schooling, improving nutrition and access to quality health care, and perhaps especially ensuring the fair and equal participation of vulnerable groups in the economy and society. 31. Moving beyond the incomplete MDG agenda, new challenges related to sustainable development and poverty reduction are also emerging. In some cases, these new areas are part of the unfinished business of the MDGs; in others, they represent the next level in the process of economic development. The continued integration of production and work, the ongoing process of building resilience through disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation measures, and changing consumption and production patterns, provide opportunities but also new risks. For ASEAN Member States, the explicit goal of deepening and broadening integration as one community will have effects on a variety of socio-economic dimensions, including employment opportunities, environment, labor migration, nutrition and health. Identifying and monitoring key challenges for the Post-2015 era 32. As the UN Member States prepare to adopt a set of development goals (the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)) for the period beyond 2015, ASEAN is identifying its own priorities towards shared and sustainable prosperity. Among those raised in the ASEAN Charter from 2008, safety from conflict, governance and democracy, human rights, and equitable access to opportunities stand out as a set of issues gaining importance as ASEAN Member States approach the next step of development. 33. The SDGs, while still in draft form, build on the MDGs but are also widening the development agenda based on lessons learned from past efforts as well as challenges that have emerged after the turn of the millennium. In particular, the agenda forming around new development objectives puts additional emphasis on inequality; improving access to employment and decent work; productivity in poor earning sectors (in particular agriculture); climate change and the environment more broadly (including clean water, clean energy, and clean air); urbanization pressures; resilience of the poorest to economic, natural and social shocks; new causes of mortality and illness, including a rise of non-communicable diseases and ill health", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "be0cdada-7459-4a10-a755-152c041775f6": {"__data__": {"id_": "be0cdada-7459-4a10-a755-152c041775f6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-asean-regional-assessment-mdg-achievement-and-post-2015-development-priorities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the ASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-asean-regional-assessment-mdg-achievement-and-post-2015-development-priorities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f012ae8a16d8132bb4e8c9e0713ccc4c2cbb861d51c1b7b1a5621aebe1c91493"}, "3": {"node_id": "09bc5fd2-3bce-4bb6-80c4-930dc5be4228", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-asean-regional-assessment-mdg-achievement-and-post-2015-development-priorities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "243cc099a66255a82c3a4cca6507f964c3df24d61940aa15368295263daf2a67"}}, "hash": "2b607ac63f2c7e5cbaf9929488162daa2f254018fe65cf82c15b68109ccb7e97", "text": "and death due to drugs, pollution, and traffic; and special attention to strengthening the means of implementation as well as global (and regional) partnerships (Box 3.1). 32 Report of the ASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities Box 3.1: The Sustainable Development Goals: Proposal from the OWG GOAL 1 End poverty in all its forms everywhere GOAL 2 End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture GOAL 3 Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages GOAL 4 Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all GOAL 5 Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls GOAL 6 Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all GOAL 7 Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all GOAL 8 Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all GOAL 9 Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation GOAL 10 Reduce inequality within and among countries GOAL 11 Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable GOAL 12 Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns GOAL 13 Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts* GOAL 14 Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development GOAL 15 Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss GOAL 16 Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels GOAL 17 Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development Source: United Nations Open Working Group on SDGs (Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals, 2014). 34. Integrating the unfinished business with emerging challenges, a set of key themes emerge for the post-2015 era for ASEAN Member States, within the overarching theme of making economic growth inclusive and sustainable. These include: (i) Making economic progress more inclusive; (ii) Managing and broadening the benefits of urban growth; (iii) Providing better jobs; (iv)Deepening skills for the modern economy; (v) Meeting persisting and emerging health threats; (vi) Responding forcefully to climate change and vulnerability to natural disasters; (vii) Establishing social protection systems that build resilience; and (viii) Improving governance. 35. The MDG process has highlighted the potential impact of identifying measurable challenges, defining indicators, and establishing monitoring mechanisms for holding the development community at large accountable to their commitments and allowing for benchmarking across countries. ASEAN will need to coordinate with and adapt to the global set of indicators, which have been developed and adapted for maximum relevance through expert groups for each specific area of development (e.g. health or environment). While it is beyond the scope of this report to provide such expertise, the indicators used below could be considered a suggestion of the kind of monitoring framework that could be established for the region. More specifically, the MDG experience also showed that it is easy to overlook important gaps at a disaggregate level when focusing on indicators at a national level. In fast 33 Report of the ASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities growing countries like the ASEAN Member States, tracking progress at a disaggregate level becomes even more important. Making progress more inclusive 36. Economic growth has reduced poverty in ASEAN, but it has not necessarily been pro-poor \u2013 that is, growth has not necessarily benefited the poor as much as other groups. In parallel with ASEAN\u2019s strong record on poverty reduction, income inequality has increased in some countries (Figure 3.1). Since 2000, the Gini coefficient has fallen in Cambodia, Thailand, the Philippines and Malaysia, but it is on the increase in Lao PDR and Indonesia. Inequality levels also compare poorly to less wealthy countries in South Asia as well as to the OECD. The share of income that belongs to the 10 percent poorest in the population has also fallen significantly in some countries, and in all countries except Cambodia it is lower than in countries like Bangladesh which struggles with much higher poverty levels. 37. There is evidence, hence, of both widening welfare gaps more generally, and of the concentration of deprivation in smaller groups of core at risk people that are not able to partake in the process of economic development.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "09bc5fd2-3bce-4bb6-80c4-930dc5be4228": {"__data__": {"id_": "09bc5fd2-3bce-4bb6-80c4-930dc5be4228", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-asean-regional-assessment-mdg-achievement-and-post-2015-development-priorities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the ASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-asean-regional-assessment-mdg-achievement-and-post-2015-development-priorities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f012ae8a16d8132bb4e8c9e0713ccc4c2cbb861d51c1b7b1a5621aebe1c91493"}, "2": {"node_id": "be0cdada-7459-4a10-a755-152c041775f6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-asean-regional-assessment-mdg-achievement-and-post-2015-development-priorities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2b607ac63f2c7e5cbaf9929488162daa2f254018fe65cf82c15b68109ccb7e97"}}, "hash": "243cc099a66255a82c3a4cca6507f964c3df24d61940aa15368295263daf2a67", "text": "As development progresses, focus may need to shift from relying on trickle-down effects from economic growth to strategies for including the chronically poor and vulnerable.

It also showed persisting gender inequalities in some areas. Among the driving forces of these growing gaps are increasing skills premium in labor markets, a lower share of labor income in total value added, and rising spatial inequalities (Zhuang, Kanbur, & Rhee, 2014). Rising inequality is a concern from a democratic and individual human rights perspective, but it is also a threat to social cohesion and as such to long-term economic and political stability.

The rapid process of urbanization \u2013 in itself a mark of rapid economic growth is also a measure of spatial inequalities. Cities in Southeast Asia have expanded rapidly and the urban population has doubled over the past 25 years. By 2013, nearly 300 million of ASEAN\u2019s populations lived in cities, of which 84 million lived in cities with over one million inhabitants (Figure 3.2, a). The increasing concentration of people in urban areas reflects the spatial concentration of economic activity which in turn has led to in-migration from rural areas. 39. Rapid growth in city populations is putting significant pressures on urban infrastructure and other public services, as well as on job opportunities in urban areas. As such it also risks propagating inequality within urban areas. According to UN-Habitat\u2019s estimates, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Bangkok and Ho Chi Min City now count among the most unequal cities in the world (UN Habitat, 2013). 40. The persistence of urban slums \u2013 informal urban settlements that lack reliable infrastructure, law enforcement, and other public goods and services \u2013 points to this unbalanced growth pattern. In 2009, 23, 18, 9 and 6 million people lived in urban slums in Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand, respectively (Figure 3.2, b). The trend towards larger urban populations is expected to continue; ASEAN urban areas are expected to grow by a staggering 100 million people between 2015 and 2030, the result of a complex pattern of rural-urban migration as well as international migration flows and natural population growth. Accommodating such expansions in planned and coordinated urban systems that increase quality of life of urban citizens is a key challenge that requires strong policy coordination. This includes actions to strengthen urban disaster resilience. 41. Rapid urbanization and increased economic integration has also brought challenges in terms of combating existing and emerging threats from organized crime related to narcotic drugs \u2013 the value of illicit trades in heroin and methamphetamine alone are estimated at around 2 percent of ASEAN\u2019s GDP. With integration and infrastructure reinforcement along common developing areas, there is increasing pressure to ensure efficient but legal movements across borders, many of which are currently highly porous. In recognition of the perils related to organized crime and drugs, the \u201cASEAN Leaders\u2019 Declaration on Drug-Free ASEAN 2015\u201d adopted in 2012 commits ASEAN countries to intensify efforts to eradicate illicit drug production, processing, trafficking and abuse by 2015 (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime: Regional Office for Southeast Asia and the Pacific, 2013).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "512d138c-fc04-4b6b-a065-50d5c03791e1": {"__data__": {"id_": "512d138c-fc04-4b6b-a065-50d5c03791e1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-asean-regional-assessment-mdg-achievement-and-post-2015-development-priorities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the ASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-asean-regional-assessment-mdg-achievement-and-post-2015-development-priorities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d39b1ab49393c9b3c30804019ad799a509b0de7112138b2c00d09c9247d2ab46"}, "2": {"node_id": "bb7c1ff3-f4da-4ed8-9e8a-871709354d42", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-asean-regional-assessment-mdg-achievement-and-post-2015-development-priorities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f43321c456149d66a3b87b420da5b5f9b517dbcb5b64496628fe6ce5eae464d6"}}, "hash": "0a174eca31141ef56f56698392747a5b31aee4f48a0e9f61d4195e0473891810", "text": "35 Report of the ASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities Figure 3.2: Fast but unbalanced urban growth (a) Urban population in ASEAN, 1990, 2000, 2013 (millions) (b) Urban population living in slums (millions and as share of total urban), latest available Source: Estimatesbased on United Nations Population Division, UN Habitat, 2013.

From this perspective, notwithstanding the good progress, several countries still have large shares of the population in agriculture, although the sector\u2019s contribution to value added is much more limited. In practice, this means that rural populations still, by and large, depend on an agricultural sector that is marred by limited labor productivity and high earnings volatility. Further, the majority of working adults in Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Lao PDR are in more insecure forms of employment without fixed wages and social protection, such as household-based enterprises or self-employment (Figure 3.3, a and b). Although child labor incidences have fallen dramatically, one third of all children aged 7-14 in Cambodia work. Even in a high income country like Singapore, a study of low income households show a clear relationship between access to higher paying jobs and income generating capacity, with less than 12 percent of respondents in white collar work12 12 Typically, senior official/legislators, managerial professional, or technical occupations. (Government of Singapore, Ministry of Social and Family Development, 2013)The slower progress of transformation of labor market outcomes towards higher productivity occupations and sectors is strongly linked to poverty and deprivation. In Lao PDR, ethnic minorities have less access to better jobs and better wages (Packard & Nguyen, 2014). In Vietnam, ethnic majority groups, even among the rural poor, have more diversified sources of income off the farm than those from 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 1990 2000 2013 Urban population (millions) 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 0 5 10 15 20 25 Cambodia (2005) Indonesia (2009) Lao PDR (2005) Myanmar (2005) Philippines (2009) Thailand (2009) Viet Nam (2009) Percentage Million people Slum population, millions Share of slum pop in tota urban pop 36 Report of the ASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities minority groups(World Bank, 2012b). Overall wage inequality is also high and has not fallen over time (Figure 3.3, c). 44. Increasing inequality in income and opportunities is a concern also for younger generations. At the same time as access to education has increased, a great number of young people are not finding productive jobs. In several countries, youth unemployment rates are high; in others, a large share of the young population remains inactive, neither working, looking for work, nor studying (Figure 3.3, d). Slow or incomplete transition from school to productive work opportunities raises the risk of youth falling into inactivity or low-income traps, over time becoming unable to enter labor markets at a higher earnings level because of lack of experience and a deterioration in unused skills.

Building skills takes time, and tomorrow\u2019s work force is formed today, from early childhood into post-secondary education. 46. Beyond primary education, there are still education gaps in some countries. Less than half of children and youth in the appropriate age group in Cambodia, Lao PDR and Myanmar are enrolled in secondary levels of education. Moreover, getting education is not a guarantee for success, showing that there are problems with quality and relevance of skills also at higher levels. The share of unemployed people with tertiary education has increased in all countries for which there are recent data and accounts for more than one quarter of all unemployed in several countries. This mismatch in level and content of skills points to a skills gap in the labor market: over 10 percent of firms in Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Vietnam, and one in three Malaysian firms, consider an inadequately educated work force the greatest bottleneck to business (World Bank, 2014a). At the same time, uneven access and quality of education, especially in rural areas, coupled with strong incentives for migration, have in some countries resulted in high inflows of low skilled migrants to urban areas, which in turn has contributed to reducing options for more productive jobs in urban centers and has increased the rate of urban unemployment and informal, low productivity work. 47. Technical skills tend to be highly valued by employers everywhere, but so is the ability to work in teams, solve problems independently, and adapt to changing demands. These skills are formed from early life and onwards, in both schools and homes. Although countries are increasingly providing strong foundational skills, more work is needed to adapt these skills to labor market needs (Packard & Nguyen, 2014). These efforts include, but are not limited to, building basic foundations, flexibility and learning capacities through good basic education; fostering technical and vocational training systems that are connected to labor market and private sector needs; and encouraging continued professional development through life-long learning (e.g., on-the-job training, apprenticeships, and skills upgrading courses\u2014 within or outside of firms). 38 Report of the ASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities Figure 3.4: Skills gaps in quantity and quality (a) Net enrolment rates in secondary education, latest available (b) Unemployed with tertiary education, as share of total unemployed, 2000 and latest available Source: Estimates based on data sources as per Box 2.1. Meetingpersisting and emerging health threats 48. The populations in ASEAN Member States live, by and large, under continued health threats from HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and dengue fever, all communicable diseases that were identified as critical challenges in the MDG agenda. There have been strong efforts to contain these threats through various initiatives focusing both on prevention, early detection, and access to relevant medical assistance. 49. It is a witness to the strength and influence of the MDG agenda that \u201cwhat gets measured gets done\u201d. By the same token, however, health issues that were not included as priority areas in the MDGs have been receiving less attention. In particular, non-communicable diseases, like cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, cancer, and diabetes, are a significant cause of premature death, particularly in developing countries. WHO estimates that 80 percent of premature deaths due to non-communicable diseases could be prevented. The changing pattern of disease and mortality may partly be ascribed to changing lifestyles, involving more sedentary lives, different diets, more exposure to pollution and congestion, and new tobacco, alcohol and drugs habits. In Brunei, for example, the number of premature deaths ascribed to cancer, heart disease, and diabetes are rapidly increasing (Figure 3.5, a). 50. At the same time, industrialization and rapid and uncoordinated urbanization and concentration in large cities is also taking a toll. As an example, the number of traffic related deaths in most ASEAN Member States is significantly higher than in countries in Western Europe and is particularly high in Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand (Figure 3.5, b). Globally, the estimated number of deaths attributable to ambient particular matter (PM) pollution quadrupled between 2000 and 2010(OECD, 2014).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1a26c719-e3c5-4738-a621-1bc04cace7fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "1a26c719-e3c5-4738-a621-1bc04cace7fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-asean-regional-assessment-mdg-achievement-and-post-2015-development-priorities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the ASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-asean-regional-assessment-mdg-achievement-and-post-2015-development-priorities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0152d804e43536213415125593456e0f0b59bcc81c4814c4b8fbaeddf675eb62"}, "2": {"node_id": "398b6320-f6c4-42d1-8e73-1438c3301ca4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-asean-regional-assessment-mdg-achievement-and-post-2015-development-priorities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f220b65a8575d12bc57ab1ce9f3f61f106b30c3faf2371ef3b96f5d8c034f0e8"}}, "hash": "071340e20522560936001b7988bacd6fb6c082445ea282530efdec8272923cc2", "text": "Developing countries in ASEAN are vulnerable to these risks: while underweight children remain the lead cause of burden13 13This time-based measure combines years of life lost due to premature mortality and years of life lost due to time lived in states of less than full health. of disease in sub-Saharan 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Chile Korea, Rep.

Balanced and sustainable development with a respect for the limitations in planetary resources has been one of the most difficult tests of the MDG agenda. Changing lifestyles and spatial dynamics have intensified these challenges, including through the repercussions of climate change.

The poor are always more vulnerable to such disasters than the non-poor. An approach that both centers on reversing the trend in CO2 emissions and other unsustainable consumption and production patters, and that builds systems to cope with the effects of change, is needed. 52. Access to clean water and sanitation is a basic human right. The Water Security Index developed by the ADB identifies several dimensions to water security: satisfying household water and sanitation needs, providing an input to productive activities including but not limited to food production, sustainable urban water services, balanced eco-systems, and resilience to water-related disaster (ADB, 2013). Using this framework, water security is not assured in Southeast Asia. While the region ranks fairly well in terms of economic water security, water services in urban areas are limited. Moreover, the region\u2019s ability to cope with and recover from water related natural disasters (e.g., storms, flooding) is insufficient (Figure 3.6). Figure 3.6: Water Security Index, Asian sub-regions. Source: ADB, 2013. 53. Several Member States in the ASEAN Community are among the world\u2019s most exposed nations to the dangers imposed by climate change. The Asia-Pacific zone remains globally the most vulnerable to natural disasters, both in terms of frequency and in terms of impact. The region lost an estimated two million people in natural disasters between 1970 and 2011. Three in four persons killed globally in this period lived in Asia. Climate change is intensifying the impact of such disasters. For example, the intensity of typhoons appears to have increased(ESCAP, 2012). Vietnam, Myanmar, Thailand, and the Philippines, have all been affected by natural disasters in recent years in both urban areas and small villages.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a3542e1e-001a-419f-adec-04c631cb2ec7": {"__data__": {"id_": "a3542e1e-001a-419f-adec-04c631cb2ec7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-asean-regional-assessment-mdg-achievement-and-post-2015-development-priorities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the ASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-asean-regional-assessment-mdg-achievement-and-post-2015-development-priorities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f6579e925a10ee2da6e14f5c36ce8d423a54994b1ac4ec79c59883fbdcb5db33"}, "2": {"node_id": "e7e30f29-e5fa-4a92-90da-437f47c97a32", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-asean-regional-assessment-mdg-achievement-and-post-2015-development-priorities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0244e72d10efa287afa3d767ffa2caacc765531221f4f7dcc867aabe0a9ee084"}}, "hash": "6d7e18945554f5fc39aff12558efba6bdf1b4c7a1c0feb59ca2abc6479fecb71", "text": "The Declaration on Institutionalizing the Resilience of ASEAN and its Communities and Peoples to Disasters and Climate Change, adopted in April 2015, underlines the importance of having policy coherence that links disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation, and long-term sustainable development(ASEAN, 2015).

Development plans would similarly need to work proactively to increase capacities for prevention and mitigation towards building resilience. Strengthening social protection systems 54. Both experience from the past and a look towards the future provide several motivations for strong social protection systems that can help individuals prevent and manage risks. On the one hand, countries need to have the capacity to swiftly deal with aggregate shocks that affect large parts of the population at once, or hit specific groups more deeply. On the other hand, social protection also exists to help people manage individual risks at the family and household level. The ASEAN Declaration on Strengthening Social Protection, adopted in 2013, emphasizes that social protection is a human right and that nobody in need should be excluded from essential services (ASEAN, 2013a). 55. Even temporary shocks can have long lasting and perhaps life-long effects on well-being. There is substantial evidence of the long lasting effects on MDG-related areas even of relatively short-lived economic crises (World Bank, 2010). The Asian Financial Crisis in 1997-1998 highlighted the dire long-term human and economic consequences of not having safety nets in place. Even temporary effects, like increasing malnutrition for children, lower school attendance, or prolonged spells of unemployment, inactivity, or low paid work, can have long-term consequences for individual\u2019s cognitive skills, health and overall income earning capacity. 56. Dynamic economic change creates winners and losers. Social protection systems can assist in cushioning the negative effects of change and build support for such developments without holding back change itself (Paci, Revenga, & Rijkers, 2012). Open and increasingly integrated economies like the ASEAN Member States are likely to see economic and financial shocks generated elsewhere transmitted through their own economies. Natural disasters, a permanent risk factor in the region, also carry significant economic costs, and the ability to recover quickly after such events will depend on the resilience of social protection systems as well. Moreover, there is a poverty, nutrition and basic education agenda that is partly unfinished and there is consensus that groups of core or chronically poor still exist in many countries who are not able to benefit from growth processes. Strong social protection systems can help such households better manage income shocks and life cycle events. The example of Indonesia\u2019s scholarship program Jaring Pengamanan Sosial shows the value of safety net systems to protect poor children\u2019s school enrollment in times of shock (Cameron, 2002). Although social protection has become incorporated in most poverty reduction approaches in ASEAN, there is a concern that systems need to be better adapted to reach the most vulnerable groups, including women and children, especially from minority ethnic groups (Jones & Stavropoulou, 2013). 42 Report of the ASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities Improving Governance 57. The findings of this report also underscore the importance of capable, transparent and fair governments. For one thing, specific groups are still largely without voice and agency in public life and are not benefiting from publicly provided services. Rising inequalities are creating tensions in traditionally cohesive societies. With growing incomes, citizens tend to increase their capacity to organize themselves and exert political pressure. An effective and efficient policy agenda will also rely on the capacity of governments to create partnerships, seek out synergies and recognize complementarities with these partners, and coordinate policy interventions. Results-driven policy requires not only high capacity \u2013 ASEAN Member States generally are considered to display high government effectiveness and good regulatory quality \u2013 but also transparency and inclusive development processes. Ways forward in defining and collaborating on the development agenda beyond 2015 45 Report of the ASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities 4. Ways forward in defining and collaborating on the development agenda beyond 2015 58. The year 2015 is a milestone for the 10 Member States that make up ASEAN, as it represents the target set for the establishment of the ASEAN Community. The process of integration coincides with the process towards defining a new inclusive and sustainable development agenda, beyond the targets set for 2015 with the MDGs some fifteen years ago. A key finding of this report is that much has been achieved in terms of reducing poverty and improving well-being, that there has been some convergence in socio-economic outcomes, but that some challenges persist and new ones have surfaced. Another finding is that progress on one indicator is related to others, as in the case of employment and poverty reduction,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c251e059-73a6-410c-8d3b-d5ac6a6a594a": {"__data__": {"id_": "c251e059-73a6-410c-8d3b-d5ac6a6a594a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-asean-regional-assessment-mdg-achievement-and-post-2015-development-priorities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the ASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-asean-regional-assessment-mdg-achievement-and-post-2015-development-priorities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f97862de21b83bfe6089f83bb0020a52528eff00a1d19703de92a1cb1b663ac1"}}, "hash": "f97862de21b83bfe6089f83bb0020a52528eff00a1d19703de92a1cb1b663ac1", "text": "or malnutrition and improved infrastructure for water and sanitation. Policy responses, hence, must be coordinated and coherent. 59. ASEAN is now in the process of defining priorities for the medium-term future. Development priorities will differ between ASEAN Member States depending on the level of development and other country specific characteristics and challenges. Some common themes and priorities from this review can nonetheless be identified, including inequality, urbanization, and building resilience to disasters and climate change. There are strong reasons to intensify collaboration across these different policy themes. The process of integration should benefit from a process of coordination outside the area of economic policy. Several policy challenges are better tackled at a regional rather than country level. Obvious areas for such collaboration include prevention and mitigation of the risks related to disasters and the impacts of climate change, work towards improving sustainable development processes, migration flows, the response to communicable and emerging infectious diseases, cross-border criminal networks, and transboundary social and health issues that require cross-sectoral coordination (e.g., drug resistant diseases or the flow of fake or substandard medicines). The most extreme form of these challenges such as increasing exposure to more violent natural disasters or the development of pandemics, require ASEAN Member States to have put in place systems to help populations cope with and recover from large scale shocks, for example by developing systems of surveillance and disease control in order to respond to epidemic outbreaks. 60. ASEAN is focused on promoting and facilitating active regional collaboration around important policy issues. It will remain so going forward. Currently, collaborative work is carried forward primarily through established focal points in ASEAN\u2019s sectoral bodies. It is a good time to consider how these activities are working, including for the purposes set out by the ASEAN Roadmap for Attainment of the MDGs such as strengthening advocacy around development goals, building and sharing knowledge, and the identification and exchange of expertise (ASEAN, 2011). As the region turns its focus to defining a set of post-2015 priorities, it is thus appropriate to raise questions about how regional solutions might be delivered most effectively. For example, can the current implementation mechanisms be strengthened further? Is collaboration working better for some thematic areas than others? Does the availability of expertise from inside and outside the region differ? Are all countries benefitting from exchanges and tool-kits to address development 46 Report of the ASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities policy challenges at home? Are there follow-up mechanisms in place that enhance accountability and help identify next steps? Moving forward, key activities to consider in the context of the post-2015 development agenda include: 61. Identifying good practices and setting regional norms. ASEAN can establish the principle of results-driven and results based policy, focusing on identifying good and innovative approaches, and evaluating their effectiveness. ASEAN should continue to work towards identifying best practices across the different policy areas and themes \u2013 from within the Community and from outside the region, as well as setting standards and norms. 62. Promoting peer-to-peer exchanges. Countries with different development challenges in the aggregate may nonetheless identify common areas of policy interests. ASEAN remains well placed to identify and promote bilateral exchanges around common themes. In view of emerging themes, this may include policy targeting of ethnic minorities, accessing remote populations, processes of decentralization, challenges for mega-cities, and other areas that are shared concerns for some countries and not for others. 63. Improving monitoring frameworks. \u201cWhat gets measured gets done\u201d, and once a set of new development priorities has been established, ASEAN should have the mandate to develop a solid monitoring and evaluation framework. This report has identified significant variation in data availability across the region, probably reflecting differences in statistical capacity between countries. Important tasks are to build statistical capacity, harmonize measurements, identify relevant indicators, and provide regular monitoring and evaluation of the framework. 64. Enhancing statistical capacity. In particular, ASEAN could complement international efforts at measuring and harmonizing data, especially by focusing more on disaggregated indicators. The MDGs have been monitored by the UN agencies and while ASEAN could monitor the completion of these databases, data collection work should be coordinated and not duplicated. But a key lesson of the MDG process has been that aggregate indicators do not always capture specific vulnerable groups. This is increasingly an issue of concern in ASEAN, where significant improvements overall sometimes disguise slower progress for some core groups. While the new global framework cannot be expected to focus on all forms of disaggregation, ASEAN could take on the role of complementing the broader monitoring frameworks with such disaggregated", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "737cb8cb-4da6-49c6-8c5d-60e59ed44a98": {"__data__": {"id_": "737cb8cb-4da6-49c6-8c5d-60e59ed44a98", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-asean-regional-assessment-mdg-achievement-and-post-2015-development-priorities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the ASEAN Regional Assessment of MDG Achievement and Post-2015 Development Priorities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-asean-regional-assessment-mdg-achievement-and-post-2015-development-priorities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "99fd1cd8233a1b5f693d760a56701703a0c943b921c2b125ce43f000a420552d"}, "3": {"node_id": "8bbbaccd-0ea4-46c8-a27a-46af813f1768", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-asean-regional-assessment-mdg-achievement-and-post-2015-development-priorities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "45c0824395aca5195472cf541e42390df7799b62e862ce00f2a27b8677c5bc7f"}}, "hash": "2901935f491c93a0588e4e9585ac5a37ebef3f483c28801e30cd7b00e0872f0a", "text": "indicators, putting more emphasis on distinctions between rural and urban, poor and non-poor regions or population groups, and gender in a diverse set of social and environmental indicators.

Now, 15 percent of steel produced in the secondary sector (6.2 million tonnes a year) is produced by energy-efficient methods. In turn, this has reduced average specific energy consumption by 24 percent (431 megajoules of energy per tonne of steel), and together saved energy costs of US$19 million annually. The estimated energy saved stands at 79,000 tonnes of coal and 63 million units of electricity every year. Moreover, GHG emissions have been reduced by 260,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide annually \u2013 an average of 913 tonnes of CO2 per year per steel unit \u2013 demonstrating a strong reduction for the industry\u2019s carbon footprint and a positive step for small and medium enterprises toward protecting the environment. Further, these achievements become even more important in light of the new Sustainable Development Goal on ensuring access for all to clean, affordable energy by 2030. Notably, much of the investment in cleaner production processes in India has been driven by small mill owners themselves. Through using multiple and innovative approaches, including cluster meetings, e-networks and presentations to the steel industry association, UNDP was able to quickly reach out to steel units to sign up to implement energy efficiency. This resulted in leveraging public grants of about US$3.8 million, from the Ministry of Steel, AusAid and UNDP, into US$16 million from private steel units \u2013 a growth in investment by a factor of four. Here, the role of the Government was especially crucial: More than half of the initial grants (US$2 million) were from the Ministry of Steel. The Government also co-chaired, with UNDP, a proactive project steering committee that offered guidance at every stage and resolved any issues. In addition, breaking down interventions into smaller sets and grouping them as packages with different levels of investment requirements led to wider acceptability for implementation by a large number of units in a shorter STRONGER PARTNERSHIPS, GREATER IMPACT: Effectively Scaling Up Development Innovations Across Asia-Pacific Using Energy Efficiency to Re-Imagine Steel Production in India Impact yy 15% of steel produced in the secondary steel sector (6.2 million tonnes per year) now employs energy-efficient methods yy Reduced average specific energy consumption by 24%; estimated energy saved is 79,000 tonnes of coal and 63 million units of electricity every year yy Reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 260,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year yy Substantially increased expertise/ professionalism in energy efficiency in small- scale steel units, from 10 to nearly 100 persons Uniqueness yy Multiple and innovative approaches to quickly reach out to steel units to sign up to implement energy efficiency, including through cluster meetings, e-networks, and presentations to the steel industry association. yy Facilitated even small investments by grouping a smaller number of technology solutions, so that average investments were US$35,000, compared to US$230,000 in earlier phase yy Extensive documentation (energy-efficient technology packages, reference manual on profits, posters) significantly helped in decision making by plant owners and greater understanding of interventions for supervisors and workers Key Partnerships yy Ministry of Steel, AusAid, Global Environment Facility India is one of the largest producers of steel in the world, and small-scale steel re-rolling mills \u2013 which produce nearly two-thirds of long steel products in the country \u2013 typically are responsible for high levels of pollution and inefficient resource use.

And again, the Government role was central: When the project faced a funding deficit after scaling-up funds were exhausted, the Ministry of Steel extended its financial support by providing an additional US$300,000. The project was further boosted by a three-tier approach to formulating knowledge products to propagate widespread replication of the technologies across the sector. This not only accelerated awareness in the sector about energy efficiency, but also significantly supported decision-making by plant owners as well as a greater understanding of interventions by plant supervisors and workers. First, energy-efficient technology packages were provided to owners to inform them about technical specifications and cost benefits of the intended technology. Second, a reference manual on energy- efficient technologies and practices for profitable steel rolling was produced and disseminated to plant supervisors, informing them as well of details of technology packages and their benefits. Third, posters for workers and foremen informed them on the \u201cdo\u2019s and don\u2019ts\u201d of using the technology packages and energy-efficient measures. In all, about 1,000 people from the steel units (owners, plant engineers, foremen) have been trained on energy efficiency measures. The project particularly increased the number of professionals in the small- scale steel sector with expertise in energy efficiency, from only 10 to nearly 100. It also has garnered numerous awards for its contribution to energy saving in the steel sector, including the 2014 India\u2019s Leading Energy Saving Expert Award from HITEC India, a non-profit organization that aims to promote IT solutions, next-generation networks and enabled services to the country. UNDP\u2019s partnership with the Ministry of Steel is an exciting demonstration of how energy efficiency makes good business sense. If up-scaled to 1000 secondary steel units in the country, these low-risk, technology innovations could reduce energy consumption by upto 50%. In doing so, it can reduce 2.3 million tonnes of CO2 emissions, roughly equal to taking all passenger cars of Delhi\u2019s roads.

Apart from aiming to confront the truly startling rates of infection among key populations, efforts to combat HIV also have to address the legal and social barriers that inhibit effective immediate response. Deep-rooted stigma and discrimination surrounding the disease are obstacles that limit access to public health services, and efforts to address such obstacles have been constrained by Indonesia s legal system, which directly and indirectly affects the HIV epidemic. The absence of a strong legal framework to discourage stigma and discrimination and the misinterpretation of authority through decentralization has created disharmony and contradictions between the law and corresponding regulations related to HIV. The lack of access to information about national policy and guidelines for HIV programme have contributed to increased barriers, as have learned social norms on gender and discrimination against key populations, including sex workers, men who have sex with men, transgender persons, and injecting drug users. The Global Commission on HIV and the Law (2010-2012), an initiative launched in 2010 by UNDP Administrator Helen Clark, examined how laws and practices can transform the global AIDS response. The Commissions findings and recommendations reveal that evidence-based laws and practices firmly grounded in human rights exist and are powerful instruments for challenging discrimination, promoting public health and protecting human rights. In addition, the benefits are felt beyond HIV responses to encompass health and development outcomes more broadly. UNDP together with UNAIDS and the National AIDS Commission convened a national consultation on legal and policy barriers to HIV in Indonesia to further assess the legal barriers to effective implementation of the National AIDS Strategy and Action Plans 2010-2014. The objectives were to assess the implication of barriers to HIV response, identify opportunities under existing legal and supportive policy frameworks and provide concrete recommendations. The consultation involved representatives from relevant sectors, including academic institutions, civil society, faith-based organizations, members of key populations and government officials. The UN Country Team is thankful to all participants for their cooperation and feedback. It is imperative that we as the UN together with the Government of Indonesia and civil society create an enabling socio-legal environment to collaboratively undertake efforts to make a significant impact on the national HIV response.

on the national review and consultation of legal and policy barriers to HIV is intended to: 1. identify legal barriers and support (best practice) in implementing national policies on HIV/AIDS response 2. propose recommendations for removing existing barriers to ensure access to justice for key populations. PROCESS A workshop was conducted following a UNDP-commissioned review of national legislation related to the implementation of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, performed by consultants, Adhi Santika and Simplexius Asa. The workshop involves representatives from relevant sectors, key populations and civil society organizations, including the academia, as follow up to the review. 1. Opening Address by National AIDS Commission (KPAN) - Ms. Fonny (KPAN) considers the workshop an important event, particularly as in recent years together with other stakeholders the Commission has advocated for policy change in the health sector in order to improve access for key populations. Numerous directives at the presidential and cabinet level have been issued and implemented, in addition to various joint ministerial policies and national human rights laws. A host of obstacles however still prevails, primarily due to extra-legal forms of stigma and discrimination within society and disharmony between laws and the corresponding regulations. This is made worse by the imposition of the law on regional autonomy that is not accompanied with a rigorous and well-defined monitoring mechanism for the effective implementation of laws. 2. National AIDS Commission (KPAN) - Mr. Halik Sidik KPAN affect the HIV epidemic. These issues cover the following: (1) poverty and unemployment, and how it affects the number of indirect sex workers vulnerable to that makes it vulnerable to trafficking, including narcotics; (3) stigma and discrimination by the government and local values that attach negative labelling to homosexuals, commercial sex workers and people who use drugs , which are manifested in discriminatory practices that impede the effective implementation of HIV/AID\u2019S response programs; (4) service quality, coverage and sustainability that may be compromised due to political issues, such as decentralization and power shifts; (5) gender inequalities in Indonesian culture that influence power relations between men and women, leading to sexual exploitation; (6) how culture and the structure of law has a bearing on the implementation of government laws and regulations on HIV. These key issues need to be taken into account when formulating strategic measures related to HIV and the law in Indonesia. 3. Ministry of Health - Ms. Endang From the standpoint of the Ministry of Health (MoH), a strong legal umbrella for HIV response programs along with its corresponding guidelines is crucial. For the purpose of enforcing the law, if required, sanctions should also be imposed when wrongly implemented. MoH firmly believes that PLHIV are equally entitled to the rights enjoyed by other citizens in accessing health services.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5f9c1da2-1c35-404d-af7e-411d67a66957": {"__data__": {"id_": "5f9c1da2-1c35-404d-af7e-411d67a66957", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-consultation-legal-and-policy-barriers-hiv-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National Consultation on Legal and Policy Barriers to HIV in Indonesia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-consultation-legal-and-policy-barriers-hiv-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "47db26333a50f15a917c50da3ea654419e2ad5992582dace353a08d2f27f943d"}, "2": {"node_id": "5d969fed-4b59-4003-b71f-b1362b2c157d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-consultation-legal-and-policy-barriers-hiv-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "125957569dbc429805d8842d4b81f211d6058a84b74401268d9f218714be29b8"}}, "hash": "e102c8e959e82839978aacc09c2984713eca41d895d730f6339ddc96ecf549d8", "text": "The Ministry has introduced its own legal framework for HIV/AIDS control (ministerial regulations, circular letters and others) among others on logistics, referral ARV treatment and free anti-TB medications.

Civil Society: Indonesian AIDS Coalition (IAC) Mr Aditya Wardhana Indonesia AIDS Coalition as a civil society representative stated that HIV/AIDS response requires an enabling environment which Indonesia sorely lacks because HIV issues are still considered a taboo topic particularly from a moralist standpoint. IAC highlighted on several key issues that should be dealt with in the fight against HIV/AIDS in Indonesia: The need for appropriate national policies to ensure comprehensive cross-sectoral HIV/AIDS response; Policy review on financing HIV/AIDS responses specifically related to sustainability as 60% of HIV/AIDS program financing in Indonesia is derived from foreign/external sources; The need for discussions and policies on access to treatment and laboratory test for PLHIV in relation to drug patents and production, as well as services provided in the country; and The need to develop policies that do not discriminate against PLHIV and key populations. IAC hoped for more serious efforts in developing policies based on evidence and needs, instead of moralistic ideologies. 5. UN System, UNAIDS Mr David Bridger The Global Commission on HIV and the Law has identified the following key issues related to HIV/AIDS response and the law: Punitive laws will lead to human rights abuses and accelerate the spread of HIV; Punitive laws will put available resources to waste and reduce the effectiveness and efficiency of HIV and health investments; Effective evidence-based public health laws and best practices that embrace human rights can strengthen HIV/AIDS global responses that should be urgently replicated or scaled up; and Structural guidelines, such as the law, play a vital role in bringing the HIV epidemic to an end. Concerning the situation of HIV and the law in Indonesia, a background paper showed that regional autonomy has led to the enactment of local policies inconsistent with national laws that may undermine national HIV/AIDS responses. In 2011, UNAIDS has published guidelines for introducing 7 key programmes: (1) reduce stigma and discrimination; (2) provide HIV-related legal services; (3) monitor and reform laws, regulations and policies related to HIV; (4) legal literacy; (5) sensitize lawmakers and law enforcement agencies on HIV issues; (6) train health care providers on human rights and medical ethics related to HIV; (7) reduce gender injustices and violence against women, and empower women in the legal, social and economic aspects within the HIV context. A UNAIDS study on these 7 programme areas in 7 institutions in Indonesia in 2012 revealed that 93% of HIV-related spending which amounted to US$ 4.8 million were focused on the first programme area of reducing stigma and discrimination. There has been negligible investment for HIV/AIDS response in the other 6 programmes. National consultations are expected to build on the momentum to discuss on more creative ways to surmount challenges faced in implementing HIV/AIDS response in Indonesia, specifically relating to the law. In addition, discussions should also touch on strategies for supporting the other 6 programme areas in order to improve access to justice as part of national HIV/AIDS response, both in the National HIV/AIDS Strategy until 2014 and as input for the National HIV/AIDS Strategy for 2015-2019. 6. Review Outcomes of the Global Commission on HIV and the Law from the UNAIDS Regional Support Team for Asia and the Pacific Ms. Brianna Harrisson The law has the potential to improve the lives of PLHIV and indirectly curb the spread of HIV by strengthening legal systems/legislation conducive for HIV responses. The Global Commission on BACKGROUND | 9 HIV and the Law was established to examine how the legal environment laws, law enforcement and access to justice - can support or obstruct effective HIV responses. The Commission has conducted research, consultations and analysis, and observed data from 140 countries to deliver recommendations to governments and international bodies. The purpose is to help governments and international agencies to establish and enforce evidence-informed laws and regulations that are pragmatic, humane and just. Furthermore, it can be used as an advocacy tool by PLHIV, civil society and communities affected by HIV. Recommendations place emphasis on creating an enabling legal environment that upholds and promotes human rights and universally-recognized legal norms. The Global Commission on HIV and the Law stressed that legal reform needs to consider the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2bfd437a-a34b-4a5a-bf8c-2228c8de7d76": {"__data__": {"id_": "2bfd437a-a34b-4a5a-bf8c-2228c8de7d76", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-consultation-legal-and-policy-barriers-hiv-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National Consultation on Legal and Policy Barriers to HIV in Indonesia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-consultation-legal-and-policy-barriers-hiv-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca3da2366b69bcd46f6ecfa76aa730ff3f1c8dfc0f64a169576791b4c999da0b"}}, "hash": "ca3da2366b69bcd46f6ecfa76aa730ff3f1c8dfc0f64a169576791b4c999da0b", "text": "following: Discrimination Criminalization of HIV transmission, exposure and non-disclosure Key populations Women Children and adolescents Laws on intellectual property rights and global efforts to provide treatment Recommendations offered by the Global Commission on HIV and the Law: Legal reform Improve law enforcement practices Strengthen access to justice It should be kept in mind that Indonesia is bound by the shared commitment to conduct reviews of legal and policy barriers and to initiate national, multi-sectoral consultations concerning legal and policy barriers. By the end of 2014, every UNESCAP member country must submit a progress report to ESCAP of national reviews on HIV and the law. 7. Legal Review by Local Consultants Mr. Adhi Santika and Mr. Simplexius Asa From the review of HIV and the law in Indonesia, it was found that not only is the legal framework weak, but laws are being ignored and the legal system mocked at. This urgently calls for legal reform, inter-agency collaboration and legal education. In reviewing HIV/AIDS policies in Indonesia, it is necessary to observe their hierarchy, whether they are implementable and have a definitive purpose, and to take into account local values and public participation. A review of laws and regulations either directly or indirectly related to HIV/AIDS response was performed by a research team with the intent of providing answers to the following research questions: 1) Is there any guarantee for key populations and PLHIV to access basic services to meet their needs? 2) Is there legal protection and/or guarantee of equality before the law for key populations and PLHIV in leading their personal and social life? 3) Is there guarantee of legal protection specifically intended for key populations and PLHIV? 4) Is there guarantee of legal protection for key populations and PLHIV in receiving legal aid and/or access to justice? The study examines 18 national laws and local regulations introduced in DKI Jakarta, East Java, Bali and North Sumatera. It was found that their formulation and criminalization process, including legal norms specifically for criminal offences, has yet to allow for factors that may affect their effective implementation and enforcement. The substance of law fails to formulate criminal law norms through a prescriptive approach and/or carries different meanings which often lead to multiple interpretations by law enforcement agencies and members of the public. In terms of the structure of law, reviewed legislation did not taken into consideration the capability of civil servants recruited as investigating officers (PPNS) in local governments, in terms of quantity and quality, in examining and investigating criminal offences, and neither has there 10 | BACKGROUND been any meaningful effort to develop well-trained and competent civil service investigators. There is also the absence of a proper mechanism for cooperation between PPNS within and outside of the local government with police investigators at the provincial and district/city level. The culture of law on the other hand relates to the contribution and/or support that the public can offer for enforcing local regulations. Under current circumstances, provisions on criminal law laid down in local regulations have yet to be effectively implemented and enforced. The study pointed to the need for legal reform in terms of the substance, structure and culture of law, and for sensitizing politicians, law enforcement agencies and citizens, including PLHIV and key populations on the right to legal guarantee and the fulfilment of basic needs. Consultants however have not reviewed patent laws and have promised to do so within 2 weeks. 8. Law-Making Process \u2013 Mr. Adhi Santika Adhi Santika gave an introduction to the legislative process, primarily on the fundamental principles that need to be considered in drafting a law. In the formulation process, it should be kept in mind that the law should not merely be an instrument for dispute settlement and social order, but also as part of social engineering. A legal concept that also includes social engineering is the most appropriate and relevant legal development approach to date. The problem however lies in the extent to which the formulation of laws (in a neutral legal context) has anticipated its impact on the public. The law-making process is often not entirely anticipatory, but more reactive towards a situation occurring within society. Strategic issues to be considered in the law-making process which should be prevented from manifesting are as follows: (1) inter-hierarchical (vertical) contradictions; (2) intra-hierarchical (horizontal) contradictions; (3) contradictions among clauses in a law or regulation. Law-making principles and methods are set out more explicitly in Law No. 12/2011 on the Formulation of Laws and Regulations. Ideally, the drafting of a law or regulation should take into consideration empirical evidence, local values, national and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bc527318-0362-4cd2-bb28-e0aaaf7a1204": {"__data__": {"id_": "bc527318-0362-4cd2-bb28-e0aaaf7a1204", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-consultation-legal-and-policy-barriers-hiv-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National Consultation on Legal and Policy Barriers to HIV in Indonesia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-consultation-legal-and-policy-barriers-hiv-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e364e9ec535b0b4d79aea5ed5ccf4d554f5eb398f808e45ef2066d70e5182215"}, "3": {"node_id": "87de3386-dfed-4edb-bd51-4a6bc583c26f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-consultation-legal-and-policy-barriers-hiv-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "73e40f9df0d5b7bd2157acd44716e973ff2985c9a4a8649c9ed00b578d478ab9"}}, "hash": "7b089723d9a09b58e6874da8bc0b63890d0eafecd1938c929a2e30625adccd45", "text": "international situation, academic review, public participation and mechanisms for smooth implementation. As a final point, the law should be seen as a system which in totality is inseparable from the values that society adheres to. If the purpose of introducing a law is too detached from social reality, then there will be adverse effects that need to be taken into account. The social engineering concept also does not end with the creation of written policies because the written law is subject to limitations. This concept necessitates the professional role of law enforcement bodies to give soul to the printed words set forth in a law or regulation. NOTES ON GROUP DISCUSSIONS Group discussions were conducted according to the topic or issue identified or determined by UNDP and UNAIDS based on the consultants\u2019 report which cover: \u00a5 Children and youth (facilitator: Irawati Atmosukarto) \u00a5 Women (facilitator: Irawati Atmosukarto) \u00a5 PLHV and treatment (facilitator: Aditya Wardhana and Yogi Wirastra) \u00a5 People who use drugs (facilitator: Halik Sidik) \u00a5 Sex workers (facilitator: Halik Sidik) \u00a5 MSM and transgender (facilitator: Yogi Wirastra) Participants were divided into several groups according to their interest, expertise and experience. Each topic was allotted \u00b1 1.5 hours with a facilitator to guide the process. Discussion results werepresented in a plenary session and jointly discussed to refine and agree on recommended actions to address the legal and policy barriers identified. 11 12 | GROUP DISCUSSIONS LEGAL PROTECTION IN NATIONAL LAW This was discussed in the review conducted by Adhi Santika and Simplexius Asa. The principles of human rights, including non-discrimination, have become part of national law enshrined in the second amendment to Indonesia\u2019s 1945 Constitution and Law No. 39/1999 on Human Rights. In reference to the legislative hierarchy and principles as laid down in Law No. 12/2011 on the Establishment of Laws and Regulation, laws that govern public life in Indonesia should adhere to the said principles and hierarchy. The review also examines various conventions and covenants that Indonesia has ratified and made part of its national law. Legal protection of HIV/AIDS prevention programs is therefore grounded in both national and international legal norms. Legal and Policy Barriers and Recommended Actions Present Reality 1. Estimates of Key Populations, MoH 2009: IDU (105,784), Female sex workers (214,054), MSM (695,026), Transgender (32,065). 2. HIV prevalence based on MoH Estimates, 2009: Transgender (18.96%), MSM (3.47%), FSW (6.12%), IDU (49.69%). 3. Social status: key population refers to a specific community considered as a social disease or to people given PKMS status (persons having social welfare issues) that hampers them from accessing public services due to stigma and discrimination. This manner of treatment causes them to live in poverty and adopt risk behaviours. Their impoverishment is not because of the inability to earn a decent living, but due to social and legal impediments that end in their povertization.

Key populations are caught in a dilemmatic position when it comes to the law. On one hand, they are citizens entitled with the right to access government aid in order to lift themselves out of poverty and for social rehabilitation. On the other hand, apart from their impoverished status, they are also perceived as a community who has violated (lost) their sense of decency that distresses the public as they are condemned as a social disease. This institutionalized status has instead incited stigma and discriminatory treatment. 2. In other words, as a result of discrimination and stigmatization, the legal, formal recognition of key populations has instead become a major barrier for them to fulfil their social functions accordingly. 3. The foregoing situation somewhat reflects an insincere attempt at providing state protection. This is particularly evident in social rehabilitation efforts, whereby the state has treated them as mere objects in policy-making, made worse with their stigmatization and discrimination. 4. When it has been formally described in the law that key populations need to transform themselves in order to agree with social norms acceptable to society, the government is indeed giving a false impression of providing social protection and security. 5. This insincere attempt from the government has failed to change the risk behaviour of key populations because it has not succeeded in improving the quality of their lives.

Several matters that need to be considered: 1. Children are more often considered as part of domestic affairs, both in a cultural and spiritual sense. Bringing children to the public domain therefore causes anxiety, fear and uncertainty in society. 2. There are a significant number of children/young persons with risk behaviours as a result of being victims of sex crimes or narcotic abuse, yet they have never been identified as target groups/direct beneficiaries for outreach programmes, IEC, VCT, NSP and substitution therapy. 3. Children at risk are an inseparable part of families within key populations. 4. There are numerous laws and regulations related to the interest of the child, but have different definitions of a child\u2019s age. This is made worse by the absence of executive guidance that clearly delineates age groups according to the scope of intervention within the range of 0-24 years old (pre-school 0-6; school-age 7-12; teenage 13-18; young adult 19-24). 5. There are still many national laws and regulations unfavourable to the best interest of the child.

There is doubt and uncertainty from implementers (especially the government) of HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care programs when dealing with children and young people which result in failure to act accordingly. The exception however for HIV/AIDS response programs initiated by NGOs that provide direct services to the public; anyone at risk (regardless of age) becomes the program\u2019s target group. 2. As it is best not to impose direct intervention on the child, the ability to prevent HIV transmission greatly depends on the effectiveness of programs that seek to change the behaviour of adults \u00e0\uf0e0 100% condom use, PMTCT, PICTR, access to sterile needles and syringes and methadone/substitution therapy. 3.

This state of powerlessness further makes women more vulnerable to HIV infection. 2. The number of reported HIV/AIDS cases among women by June 2013 reached 12,593 cases with a cumulative percentage of 28% (MoH 2nd quarterly report 2013). There has been a significant rise in HIV/AIDS cases among women (from 17% in 2006 to 35% in 2011). 3. Those most vulnerable to HIV infection (80%) are clients of sex workers and long-term partners (girlfriend/wife). The second highest cumulative number of HIV/AIDS cases occurs among housewives (5,006 cases). This reflects how women are highly vulnerable to being infected from the husbands. Not surprisingly, the number of HIV/AIDS cases among housewives tends to increase each year. 4. Women bear multiple burdens when a family member is infected with HIV: Must care for her ailing husband Becomes the primary breadwinner of the household Vulnerable to HIV infection due to lack of negotiating power in condom use The child of an expectant mother is at risk of contracting HIV 5. The imposition of certain requirements (perceived or interpreted) that discriminate against women from accessing specific health services. For example, registration form for pap smear (Ms./Mrs.), partner notification for PMTCT services. 6. Main reasons why women are overlooked with regard to HIV issues: Women do not know about the HIV status of their partner, and are therefore unaware if they are already infected Even if they know of their HIV status, women are fearful of telling their family members lest they become subject to stigmatization and discrimination In accessing health services, women are normally not questioned about her own high risk behaviour or that of her partner, thus failure of early detection. re perceived to be not at risk, and as a consequence they lack the required knowledge and skills to prevent HIV infection.

Women do not see the importance of having knowledge of HIV/AIDS because they do not consider themselves as part of populations at risk. 2. When their sex partners engage in high risk behaviour, women are incapable of effectively negotiating protection for themselves (such as with regard to condom use). 3. When the health system detects a woman at risk of being infected, the system is unable to effectively initiate intervention for the male sex partner. Example: to participate in PMTCT, partner notification is required. 4. When a woman is affected by HIV under the worst circumstances (husband falls ill or dies due to HIV), her access to economic resources is restricted by law.

Most transgender people from a relatively young age have been marginalized by their families and communities, leaving them without any opportunity to pursue proper education that can help them develop their skills to seek legitimate work. As a consequence, they have to adjust to group culture, often leading to sexual risk behaviours in order to survive. 2. Government and society\u2019s treatment towards them makes it impossible for transgender individuals to secure permanent, decent work. Under such circumstances, they are more inclined to violate ethical and moral norms simply to survive. This means that they have not changed their lifestyle and behaviour. 3. The situation is made worse by lack of access to employment that society dictates as appropriate and respectable. This makes it near impossible to help transgender persons avoid from adopting risk behaviours. 4. The health of transgender people living with HIV who are criminalized by the DKI Jakarta Regulation on Public Order is often compromised due to denied access to ARV treatment.

Five provinces with the highest number of prostitution tolerance zones are DKI Jakarta (7%), East Kalimantan (5%), Riau Islands (4%), Bangka Belitung (4%), and East Java (4%). 5. Estimated percentage of sex workers vulnerable to HIV infection is 3.3%. 6. FSW has no right to resist or defy the wishes of the procurer, with no objection whatsoever, including with regard to condom use. 7. 58% of HIV/AIDS cases are caused by infection during unprotected sex. 8. Local regulations on HIV/AIDS response are in contradiction with other local regulations that allow condoms as admissible evidence. 9.

An excessively broad definition of pornography leads to subjective interpretation. Furthermore, Article 21 allows the public to be involved in guiding and counselling FSW and this makes them feel insecure when engaging in their work. FSW feel restricted because in addition to legal sanctions, they are also subject to social sanctions. Article 3 (e) Prevents the spread of pornography and commercialization of sex in society.

Hampers prevention program outreach and development Implication to HIV/AIDS Prevention 1. Social rehabilitation services for FSW provided by the government have failed to bring about significant improvements and most FSW continue with their profession and sexual risk behaviours. 2. Failure of social rehabilitation programs has led to the diminishing trust of this particular group towards the government and those in power. 3. The majority of FSW have never felt safe or protected in their profession, leading to negligible bargaining power and heightened vulnerability towards STIs and HIV.

Estimated number of people who use drugs through injecting in Indonesia is 105,784 people (MoH 2009). HIV prevalence among IDUs may have seen a downward trend, but intervention for IDUs related to harm reduction remains inconsistent with contradictory local policies. 2. Social status: people who use drugs are marginalized members of society as they are considered to have abnormal behaviour and perceived as law-breakers. 3. Law enforcement agencies are not wholly committed to the idea of IDUs requiring rehabilitation, while there are still policies that continue to criminalize them. As a consequence, IDUs dealing with the law are liable to criminal punishment without access to rehabilitation or other required services. 4. MoH is mandated by the law to support Government Regulation No. 25/2011, yet still finds it hard to implement the regulation due to many ambiguities with regard to the financing mechanism and other state responsibilities. 5. Estimated HIV prevalence reported to MoH among IDUs is 49.69% from the estimated population (MoH 2009). Legal Protection Government Regulation No.25/2011 on Implementation of Mandatory Self-Reporting of Narcotic Users Chapter I Article 2 (a) The purpose of this provision on mandatory self-reporting for narcotic users is to fulfil the rights of people who use drugs in obtaining treatment and/or health care through medical and social rehabilitation. The clause on mandatory self- reporting is necessary to prevent people who use drugs from receiving criminal sanctions, but this has not proven to positively impact on people who use drugs. Article 5 IPWL (appointed institution where a people who use drugs should report to) is required to have the necessary personnel and facilities that meet rehabilitation standards. Even though this regulation has set out the capacity requirement that the IPWL must meet, the absence of an agreement between the 3 key players (MoH, MoSA, BNN) has lead to ambiguities in implementing rehabilitation programmes.

Despite having Law No. 35/2010 and Government Regulation No. 25/2011 on mandatory self-reporting in place, to date there is still no policy that deals with therapy. What steps should therefore be taken if a diversion to rehabilitation is deemed necessary given the absence of a comprehensive set of directives on therapy? No agreement has still been reached on the definition of therapy, what are the appropriate therapy modalities, who will be providing the therapy as it will be between the three key players (MoH, MoSA, BNN). Government Regulation No. 25/2011 in fact clearly stipulates that IPWL must demonstrate the capacity to assess the needs (rehabilitation) of the person reporting to the institution and provide services according to the need.

This process started with a partnership between UNDP and Renmin University School of Law in the preparation of an HIV and Law Review Report, which was completed in late 20131. The HIV and Law Review Report formed the basis for a National Dialogue on HIV and the Law organized by UNDP, UNAIDS and Renmin University School of Law and hosted by the Red Ribbon Forum in December 2013 in Beijing, China. This report highlights the discussions and recommendations that came out of the consultation meeting in December 2013, together with additional research conducted by Dr. Jia Ping. Dr. Jia was the primary report writer and incorporated additional interviews with key stakeholders in both the legal and HIV/public health fields. Andrea Pastorelli, Policy Specialist on Poverty, Equity and Governance in UNDP China managed the entire process and helped in drafting sections of the report. Gu Qing, Team Leader, Poverty, Equity and Governance team, UNDP China, guided implementation of the entire initiative. Thanks to Siddharth de Souza, Mitchell Luo and Fu Rong in UNDP China for providing invaluable copy-editing and translation support, as well as fact checking and data analysis. Further thanks go to David Shallcross and Zhou Kai from the UNAIDS China office for the support provided during the national consultation meeting and the recruiting of the consultant. Thanks to Nana Taona Kuo, Hedia Belhadj and Catherine Sozi, successive UNAIDS Country Coordinators (UCC) in China, for strongly support this area of work. Special thanks to Edmund Settle the Policy Advisor on Governance, Human Rights and Sexual Diversity based in the UNDP Bangkok Regional Hub, and to Brianna Harrison, Human Rights and Law Advisor in the UNAIDS RST in Bangkok, for providing overall guidance and critical technical support at key stages of the process. The review and consultation process was supported by UNDP and UNAIDS together with the UN ESCAP Secretariat. 1 \u201cNational Report on HIV and the Law\u201d, 2013, Renmin University Law School and UNDP. Acknowledgements 2 The Policy and Legal Environment Related to HIV Services in China When countries gathered in New York at the beginning of this century to articulate a new development agenda, they elevated AIDS to the top of international development priorities. Acknowledging the historic impact of the AIDS epidemic, Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 6 called for global efforts to halt and begin to reverse the epidemic, an objective that has helped inspire unprecedented action globally. Through a series of high-level meetings, the UN General Assembly established strategies, goals and targets to give life to MDG 6 and to accelerate progress towards achieving global objectives by 2015. At the 2011 General Assembly High-Level Meeting on HIV/AIDS, UN Member States reviewed a decade of historic progress in the HIV response and endorsed the \u201c2011 Political Declaration: Intensifying our Efforts to Eliminate HIV/AIDS\u201d. The political declaration commits governments to review laws and policies that adversely affect the successful and equitable delivery of HIV prevention, treatment and care programmes to people living with or affected by HIV. Governments in Asia and the Pacific have since reinforced this commitment with UN ESCAP Resolutions 66/10 and 67/9, and the agreed Regional Framework for the Implementation of the Political Declaration (The Roadmap) agreed at the 68th UN ESCAP Commission Meeting. This past September, countries gathered back in New York to approve a new development agenda, the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This time the global community unanimously approved the most important and courageous commitment to date, to end AIDS everywhere by 2030.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "51e7fd04-589b-4f64-b26c-0b7a21cd0c85": {"__data__": {"id_": "51e7fd04-589b-4f64-b26c-0b7a21cd0c85", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-china-review-and-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV Services in China: Review and Consultation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-china-review-and-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "62143abf76261d32c63ab301bd2840a1010bd03b9202abc87a8dbb0ef04c6e08"}, "2": {"node_id": "0db57d38-1b67-4cdd-ab5a-1dd20264dfc1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-china-review-and-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f9ecc8c7b93c4db6f2e0459d5cde5373d8a440f364ca634c7a969f3550f36c82"}}, "hash": "dae457a3f14188067d5dfa4dc1b13c25c38e64edf8911937a815233945de6f70", "text": "Globally, UNDP is supporting governments to meet these commitments and targets.

The Commission\u2019s recommendations offer guidance to governments and international bodies in shaping laws and legal practices that are science based, pragmatic and just. UNDP, working in partnership with the UNAIDS Secretariat, other UN agencies, governments and civil society partners, has been supporting countries in Asia and the Pacific in taking forward the work of the Global Commission on HIV and the Law, including supporting country- level National consultations on HIV and the law and doing Legal Environment Assessments on HIV and key populations. These provided opportunities for governments, civil society, key populations and other relevant stakeholders to review and strengthen legal and regulatory environments for HIV through a national participatory process. The message of these reviews is clear. While the HIV epidemic has become one of the greatest public health challenges of our time, it is now evident that it is also a crisis of law and social justice. We now have all the evidence and tools we need to radically slow new HIV infections, 2 Risks, Rights and Health. Report from the Global Commission on HIV and the law, 2012. Foreword 3 United Nations Development Programme, China however this comes at a time when punitive laws and other political obstacles are standing in the way of success3. Urgent efforts are needed to review and reform national legal and policy frameworks, revising or repealing laws to ensure a rights-based response that provides equitable access to essential HIV services. Particular attention needs to be paid on the removal of punitive laws regarding key populations, such as men who have sex with men (MSM), sex workers and people who use drugs. Better legal frameworks need to be complemented by robust, sustained investment in anti-stigma programming that works to forge healthier social norms of inclusion, tolerance and non-discrimination. Three decades of experience have shown that the promotion and protection of human rights are essential for preventing HIV transmission and reducing the impact of HIV. Evidence-based approaches and protective and enabling legal environments reduce vulnerability to HIV and ensure that HIV prevention, treatment and care services are accessible by those most at risk. On the other hand, laws that criminalize HIV transmission, sex between men, sex work and drug use, or that fail to protect the rights of women and children, are major barriers to accessing HIV services and interventions, reinforcing social stigma and hindering effective responses to the HIV epidemic. Notwithstanding years of substantial investments and political commitment by the Government, the HIV epidemic in China continues to increase. China is among 15 countries that account for the majority of new infections as well as total number of people living with HIV globally. For this reasons, it remains a top priority country for the UN Joint Programme on AIDS. We will not end AIDS globally if we do not make progress in China. And we will not make progress in China if we don\u2019t start looking at the social determinants of health and HIV infections, including the law. The end of the global AIDS epidemic is within our reach. This will only be possible if science and action are accompanied by a tangible commitment to respecting human dignity and ending injustice. Law prohibits or permits specific behaviors, and in so doing, it shapes politics, economics and society. The law can be a human good that makes a material difference in people\u2019s lives. It is therefore not surprising that law has the power to bridge the gap between vulnerability and resilience to HIV. We hope this report and the national consultations based upon it will start a needed conversation about practical steps for China to take to translate international and regional commitments into action. Only in this way will China support the world in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.

One of the main drivers of the Chinese epidemic remains the high level of stigma and discrimination faced by PLHIV and key populations. A key factor to this is China\u2019s failure to enforce protective laws for most at risk populations, which is now undermining the overall response to the HIV epidemic. China\u2019s State Council adopted the National AIDS Prevention and Treatment Regulations in March 2006 (hereby 2006 National AIDS Regulations). The 2006 National AIDS Regulations include the most comprehensive attempt at protecting the rights of PLHIV, including the right to marry, to access health- care services, to enjoy equal employment and education opportunities and the right to confidentiality and non-discrimination. Although a big step forward, the 2006 AIDS Regulations and other related regulations alone have not provided effective protection for people living with or affected by HIV in China, who are still experiencing high levels of stigma and discrimination. Better enforcement of these national regulations, together with targeted and evidence-based legal reforms are needed to make sure that people in most need of health or HIV services are able to access them. In fact, the current legal environment has a particularly negative public health impact on key populations including people who use drugs, commercial sex workers and men who have sex with men. This, in turn, is Executive summary 7 United Nations Development Programme, China contributing to the further spread of HIV in China. The preliminary findings of this national law review include: 1. While the 2006 National AIDS Regulations are good, its progressive measures are not enforced and are still largely unknown at the Provincial level. 2. There are conflicts and differences that still exist between some provisions in the 2006 National AIDS Regulations and provincial regulations that haven\u2019t been reformed. In this respect, in the last five years a number of Provincial or municipal governments have proposed enacting regulations that were stigmatizing and dehumanizing towards PLHIV. All of these regulations went in direct conflict with the 2006 National AIDS Regulations. 3. Most importantly, the 2006 National AIDS Regulations are subject to overriding laws that have a higher priority in the Chinese legal hierarchy, such as selection procedures that still permit HIV-related discrimination in employment, or criminal laws relating to sex work and drug use. Contradictions between different provisions, within the same law or between different laws or regulations at the national level, prevent efficient HIV prevention among key populations, especially sex workers and drug users and often lead to punitive law enforcement practices. 4. Punitive laws, administrative regulations and severe law enforcement practices negatively affect public health interventions among drug users and sex workers. The current legislation and law enforcement practices quasi-criminalize sex workers and drug users, preventing people from accessing prevention and treatment services and increasing the risk of HIV among these populations, and through them to the general population. Practical examples include: the continuous use of condom possession as evidence of sex work, custody and education (C&E) detention centers for sex workers, police crackdowns and rounding up of sex workers; compulsory treatment and detoxification centers for people who use drugs as well as specific parts of the Dynamic Control System (DCS), the national database for drug users. 5. Lack of effective rules and mechanisms to protect confidentiality. Mandatory testing is still the dominant model for testing, with poor follow-up on counseling and treatment initiation. Weak confidentiality protection and a lack of procedures to deal with breaches in confidentiality contribute to low testing rates among key populations. 6. Overall, the lack of anti-discrimination legislation in China fuels the epidemic, with severe discrimination against PLHIV and key populations in areas of health, employment and education: I. Employment discrimination is still widespread in both the private and public sectors. In the private sector physical check-ups and health permits are required for anyone working in seven categories of the service", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e12eb656-dc35-4f34-8d97-f04cd0a9b08e": {"__data__": {"id_": "e12eb656-dc35-4f34-8d97-f04cd0a9b08e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-china-review-and-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV Services in China: Review and Consultation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-china-review-and-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "77caedab5ca16cc1860d955268e9ed96e437ffb5f8fdcaba81e40025b4787386"}}, "hash": "77caedab5ca16cc1860d955268e9ed96e437ffb5f8fdcaba81e40025b4787386", "text": "industry. This includes small businesses in the \u201clocus publicus\u201d. In the public sector the entire civil service still requires an HIV-test before the final offer of employment. This practically impedes PLHIV from entering the civil service. 8 The Policy and Legal Environment Related to HIV Services in China II. Access to non-discriminatory medical treatment for PLHIV remains a challenge. In China a separate system of infectious diseases hospitals provides specific medical services for people living with infectious diseases. This often leads to the situation where the general hospital system denies admission to PLHIV, especially for non-HIV related medical procedures, such as surgeries or neonatal and gynecology services for pregnant women. Infectious diseases hospitals lack the resources and know-how on general surgery and maternity issues, often leading to an institutional barrier to proper medical treatment for PLHIV. III. Social and institutional discrimination against sexual and gender minorities pushes MSM underground, fueling the epidemic. Censorship laws preventing public discussion of sexual minorities in the media continue to marginalize the LGBT community, while LGBT CBOs and NGOs are unable to officially register and operate and require considerable financial and capacity building support. This, together with rampant social stigma against sexual minorities, pushes most gay men or other MSM to live in the shadows and has a negative impact on their uptake of HIV prevention services. In the last 8 years the percentage of new infections arising from homosexual transmission has increased from 2.5% in 2006 to 29.4% at the end of 2012, posing a severe challenge to China\u2019s AIDS response. The report concludes that HIV-specific law and judicial reform in China is urgently needed, with a view to protect PLHIV and key populations from discrimination while actively supporting effective outreach and prevention services. The report also provides a series of specific recommendations on legal and institutional reforms. Among these, the most important include the enactment of an overarching national AIDS law and an anti-discrimination Law; the abolition of the law-enforcement practice that uses condom possession as criminal proof of sex work; the repeal of the C&E detention center system for sex workers; and the reform of the compulsory detoxification center system for drug users. (See conclusions section on page 42). Process and methodology 9 United Nations Development Programme, China In 2012 UNDP China worked with Renmin University Law School to undertake a joint national law review on HIV and key populations. A report was published in 20134 and led to a national consultation on HIV and the law in Beijing in December 2013. This report is based on information collected during the national dialogue as well as follow- up research conducted over a period of twelve months with key stakeholders in China. 1. Purpose of the research The purpose of the report is to document the current legal, regulatory and policy environment impacting on access to HIV services by PLHIV and key populations, including a review of: \uf0b7 Protective laws, regulations, policies and programmes which support human rights and access to health in the context of HIV and AIDS, including their implementation and enforcement; \uf0b7 Punitive laws, regulations and policies which pose barriers to human rights and access to health in the context of HIV and AIDS; \uf0b7 Gaps and weaknesses in the current legal environment, as well as contradictions between HIV-specific laws/regulations and other legal or regulatory frameworks at the Central or Provincial government levels; \uf0b7 Identify practical recommendations, reforms and next steps to improve the legal environment and promote social inclusion and strengthen the national response to AIDS. 2. Research methodology I. Literature review Existing domestic laws, regulations and relevant policy documents were collected and analyzed. Attention was paid to the evolution of the HIV-related legal system in China and to document the status quo. The implementation of the Law and its impact and effects on key populations was also studied to discover gaps and inadequacies. Additionally, international norms, treaties and academic papers on international legal cases and best practices were also collated to understand international best practice and provide useful reference for China to improve relevant systems and practices. Finally, the research team collected and examined relevant books, papers and data related to HIV, criminal law and law enforcement practices in China. II. Comparative research Comparative research refers to a method aimed at carrying out comparison in specific legal system of AIDS from different dimensions, to acquire pros and cons of different 4 National Law Review on HIV and Key Populations, 2013, Renmin University and UNDP. 10 The Policy and Legal Environment Related to HIV Services in China systems and to discover inadequacies in comparison and to draw", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e73f47f5-605e-4481-87fe-cec9c8f35759": {"__data__": {"id_": "e73f47f5-605e-4481-87fe-cec9c8f35759", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-china-review-and-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV Services in China: Review and Consultation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-china-review-and-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eb1ad4bed316f64c2f4e5675726c640c989c522637ec17b0f46d4855cb4af723"}}, "hash": "eb1ad4bed316f64c2f4e5675726c640c989c522637ec17b0f46d4855cb4af723", "text": "from experience. The comparative research in this project includes the comparison of the following two directions: A vertical comparison in systems and practices across different historical periods was carried out to assess the development of systems and their practical effects in every historical period; and A horizontal comparison between mainland China and foreign legal systems and comparison between different regions and provinces of China was also carried out. Through this comparison, the research was able to better identify the gaps and challenges in the current Chinese legal system and practice as well as support the researchers in putting forward feasible and evidence-based recommendations. III. Field research In order to obtain accurate and first-hand information, especially on discrepancies between national and provincial laws and regulations and their impact on service delivery, the original project team arranged a field research programme which included visits to Yunnan, Beijing and Henan. IV. National dialogue on HIV and the law In December 2013 UNDP and UNAIDS organized a national dialogue on HIV and the law at Renmin University Law School in Beijing. More than one hundred people representing legal organizations, universities, UN agencies, HIV and key populations CSOs, PLHIV, as well as a number of government departments participated in the dialogue. This report includes information and recommendations identified during that meeting. 11 United Nations Development Programme, China 1. The role of the law in the response to AIDS Three decades of experience in the global response to the AIDS epidemic have shown that the promotion and protection of human rights are essential for preventing HIV transmission and reducing the impact of HIV. Rights-based approaches and protective and enabling legal environments reduce vulnerability to HIV, ensure that HIV prevention, treatment and care services are accessible by those most at risk and enable people living with and affected by HIV to participate in the planning and implementation of effective interventions. On the other hand, laws that criminalize HIV transmission, sex between men, sex work and drug use, or that fail to protect the rights of women and children, are major barriers to accessing HIV services by those who need them the most, reinforcing stigma and discrimination and hindering effective national and community responses to the HIV epidemic. In 2001 and 2006, all UN member states committed to implement laws that eliminate discrimination against PLHIV and vulnerable groups and to ensure their full enjoyment of human rights, access to health care as well as legal protection. In 2011 this commitment was reiterated in the UN General Assembly Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS, where Member States committed to create legal, regulatory and social environments which advance and safeguard dignity, health and justice in the context of HIV. While some progress has been made in these areas in the last decade, in many countries criminalization, discrimination, punitive law enforcement practices, human rights abuses and failure to enforce protective laws continue to undermine the Introduction 12 The Policy and Legal Environment Related to HIV Services in China response to the HIV epidemic5. In too many countries6 the law, either on the books or on the streets, dehumanizes many of those at highest risk of HIV infection: sex workers, transgender people, MSM, people who use drugs, prisoners and migrants. Rather than providing protection, the law renders these \u201ckey populations\u201d all the more vulnerable to HIV. Evidence shows that punitive laws, discriminatory and brutal policing and denial of access to justice for people with and at risk of acquiring HIV are actually fueling the epidemic. These legal practices create and punish vulnerability. They promote risky behavior, hinder people from accessing prevention tools and treatment, and exacerbate the stigma and social inequalities that make people more vulnerable to HIV infection and illness7. In particular the criminalization of same-sex relationships, sex work, drug use and harm reduction measures create climates that enable civilian and police discrimination while legal redress for victims is impossible. Fear of discrimination or even arrest drives key populations underground, away from HIV prevention and harm reduction programmes. Incarceration and compulsory detention exposes detainees to sexual assault and unsafe injection practices, while condoms and harm reduction measures (often including antiretroviral medicines) are too often denied8. Every efficient and effective national response to HIV needs to address stigma and discrimination and increase access to justice. Through education and awareness raising, national responses to AIDS should address the causes of stigma and discrimination. Most importantly, efforts to eliminate stigma and discrimination must reach beyond traditional health stakeholders and engage all arms of government, including legislative and judicial branches, as well as civil society and PLHIV. Steps are also needed to inform and sensitize", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "654efc11-4019-4297-a17b-856d2966d92d": {"__data__": {"id_": "654efc11-4019-4297-a17b-856d2966d92d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-china-review-and-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV Services in China: Review and Consultation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-china-review-and-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "463e5f075a9748487eb3ce93a743e51cf7c35650a906efba9f04601ded1dc917"}, "3": {"node_id": "725adcdf-9128-4720-b10f-bec8cb38d3ce", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-china-review-and-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6385ddbd53ccc272cba6804a68fbd041a8af31c07fdbfa59ce55573c123a6e49"}}, "hash": "7638f02f95c660097ef0e08ed61643c28358a5ce55a39b72497d29533759ccf5", "text": "those who make the laws (parliamentarians) and those who enforce them (Ministers of Interior and Justice, police, prosecutors, judges, lawyers, prison officials and traditional and religious leaders) regarding human rights in the context of HIV9. Evidence shows how protective laws, adequately resourced and enforced, help broaden access to essential health and social services, enhance the quality and effectiveness of services and protect people living with or vulnerable to HIV from stigma, discrimination and violence10. However, while 123 countries, including China, have legislation to outlaw discrimination based on HIV and legally protect some populations based on their vulnerability to HIV, most of these laws are ignored, laxly enforced or aggressively flouted11. Greater investment in enforcement mechanisms for antidiscrimination laws is needed, including support for legal services for people living PLHIV and members of key populations, as well as programmes that educate people living with or affected by HIV regarding their rights.

At a time when international funding for AIDS is diminishing and national governments around the world are asked to fund ever larger portions of their AIDS programmes, using the law effectively will make the difference between success and failure. 2. The AIDS epidemic in China By the end of 2013, there were an estimated 810,000 PLHIV in China. By the end of January, 2015, actual case reporting showed 508,864 PLHIV, including 302,498 individuals living with HIV and 206,366 AIDS patients. In the same year, about 160,288 deaths were reported13. Overall, the number of PLHIV continues to increase, as well as the percentage of all-cause mortality. The HIV epidemic in China is described as overall low prevalence with marked geographic and sub-regional heterogeneity. The majority of PLHIV in China live within only six of China\u2019s thirty-three provinces: Yunnan, Guangxi, Henan, Sichuan, Xinjiang and Guangdong. These provinces report the highest number of HIV and AIDS cases, representing around 70 to 80 per cent of the national total. The epidemic is concentrated among key populations\u2014sex workers, MSM and people who inject drugs. Case reporting data indicate that the primary route of HIV transmission currently is through sexual intercourse \u2013 both heterosexual and male-to- male sex. In the last three decades, China has instituted broad policy and programmes in HIV prevention, treatment and care within its ongoing health reforms. China has led the world in some of the most progressive policies, such as the establishment and scale up of methadone and harm reduction services for people who inject drugs \u2013 the impact of which has been a decline in HIV prevalence from 7.2% to 6.3% between 2003 and 2013. Similarly, the country is an \u201cearly adopter of Treatment as Prevention\u201d where early antiretroviral treatment and a comprehensive package of services are provided to sero-discordant couples. These interventions reduced transmission within couples from 5.9% in 2009 to 1.0 % in 2013. However, new infections among other key populations as well as women, continues to increase. Gay men and other MSM: Within sexual transmission, the percentage of new infections arising from homosexual transmission has increased significantly, from 2.5% in 2006 to 21.4% at the end of 2013, clearly overtaking IDU as a source of new infections. This shows a disturbing increase in infections among MSM. According to the 2014 National Sentinel Surveillance (NSS) data, HIV prevalence among MSM was 7.3%14, which is significantly higher than in the general population.

However, while condom use is relatively high, in 2011 the percentage of sex workers and MSM who received at least one HIV test during the past 12 months stood at only 38.2% and 50.4% respectively. Injecting drug users (IDUs): In 1989 HIV was detected amongst injecting drug users (IDUs) in Yunnan province. Needle sharing drove the epidemic and HIV spread rapidly to IDUs in neighboring cities and along drug trafficking routes. By 2002 HIV was present amongst IDUs in all Chinese provinces. It is believed IDUs may have been the core source for all later sub-epidemics in China. Today the six provinces (or autonomous regions) of Yunnan, Xinjiang, Guangxi, Guangdong, Sichuan and Guizhou accounted for nearly 90% of the country's total number of IDU related infections. A zero tolerance attitude to drug use meant that the government was slow to implement HIV prevention interventions with drug users. In the late 1990s the Chinese government began to show a change in attitude towards preventing HIV transmission among IDUs. A pilot needle exchange programme began in Guangdong in 2000. Further interventions for IDUs were also explored and in 2004 a methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) programme was piloted. The programme found that the rates of heroin use, intravenous injection and crime related to drug use decreased in the pilot areas. By the end of January, 2015, 623 counties (or districts) within 28 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) had established a total of 767 methadone maintenance clinics, currently providing MMT for 182,845 people who inject drugs. Thanks to these interventions and to a rapid change in drug consumption trends in China (mostly away from injecting drug use) new infections in drug users have declined consistently to less than 25% of overall new infections. Sex workers: Data from the last National Sentinel Surveillance (NSS) suggest that HIV prevalence among sex workers is 0.3% in 2013, or over five times that of the general population16. However, other more comprehensive cross-sectional studies have found much higher prevalence rates. A study funded by UNFPA and the World Bank pooled data from twelve HIV studies in China published between 2007 and 2011, and found the HIV prevalence among sex workers overall to be 3%17. More recently, a study of 737 sex workers in Yunnan covering \u2018higher risk\u2019 (i.e. lower-end venues) and \u2018lower risk\u2019, (i.e. higher-end venues) found that the overall HIV prevalence among these sex workers was 10.3%. However, the difference between higher and lower risk venues of Health of the People\u2019s Republic of China. 15 Wu ZY et al.

Another review of studies on sex workers between 1996-2010 found the median HIV prevalence to be 0.6%, but with a significantly higher prevalence in Yunnan (range 8.3%-10.3%), reporting also that sex workers in lower-end venues were twice as likely to be HIV-positive than those in higher-end venues19. 1.

While China lacks an overarching HIV law, scholars have identified over 200 regulations, national and provincial, that relate to HIV. There are many more laws and regulations that are relevant but do not specifically mention HIV. At the central government level, other types of policy documents, such as the \u201cHongtouwenjian\u201d (Red-headed documents) provide clear direction for subsequent central laws, regulations, as well as local regulations. 2.

AIDS care, 2011, 23 (sup1): 5-25. 20 Chinese Legislative Law. HIV and the law in mainland China\u2014an overview 16 The Policy and Legal Environment Related to HIV Services in China Regulations include the most comprehensive attempt at protecting the rights of PLHIV in China, including the right to marry, to access health-care services, to enjoy equal employment and education opportunities and the right to confidentiality and non- discrimination. The regulations also provided new detailed provisions concerning the treatment, care and support of PLHIV and institutionalized the \"Four Frees and One Care\" policy, effectively providing a strong legal basis for the protection of the rights of PLHIV and AIDS NGOs21. The provisions included in the 2006 National AIDS Regulations represented progress in government policy on HIV and paved the way for equally progressive amendments and adjustments of regulations at the local level. After collecting experience in implementation over the past 8 years, in accordance with common legislative techniques in the PRC, the government should consider to enact a more definitive and detailed AIDS law, instead of only regulatory acts. However, the development of AIDS law and policy in China must be viewed in the context of China's emerging legal system, which has developed considerably over the past 35 years from almost nothing. In this context, the legal environment around HIV in the current legal system in China contains the following main weaknesses22: I. Gaps and conflicts in legislation and/or regulations AIDS regulations and other laws often conflict with each other, and the courts are not always empowered to resolve the conflicts effectively. Consider the provisions in the new 2006 National AIDS Regulations that require localities to reach out to intravenous drug users. These provisions conflict with provisions of administrative and criminal laws and policies that require local authorities to crack down on those who engage in intravenous drug use. As we discuss later in the report, the conflict also exist inside the Narcotics Law itself and this types of conflict also negatively impact sex workers. II. Weakness of legal institutions and problematic bureaucratic coordination For the courts, the lack of power to interpret laws along with the legislative gaps and conflicts in the law itself can result in less than perfect enforcement of laws and regulations, especially when the provisions are vague or the legislation lacks definitions or procedures. More importantly, lack of coordination among departments of the central government, or among local departments at the provincial and city level, impedes the proper implementation of the progressive provisions of the 2006 regulations for example. III. Central-local issues The lack of an institutionalized mechanism to deal with conflicts between the central and provincial levels within China creates problems in the implementation of central regulations and policies. Local governments will often adapt the central policy and law 21 Supra note 16. 22 John Balzano & Jia Ping. Coming out of Denial: An Analysis of AIDS Law and Policy in China (1987-2006). Loy. U. Chi. Int'l L. Rev, 2005, 3: 187. 17 United Nations Development Programme, China to their own circumstances, thereby altering the main tenants of the center's policy. Sometimes the localities will simply refuse or thwart the enforcement of central policy. Although the factors listed above are by no means a comprehensive list of all of the institutional obstacles to the effective enforcement of AIDS law and policy in China, they provide an important guide to more a specific analysis of AIDS law and legislation23. 3. The development of AIDS policy and law since 1987 I. National policies and government plans regarding AIDS At the top of the policy and law pyramid are major policy documents that the central government, sometimes jointly with the Chinese Communist Party, issues in an area of particular concern or development. These policy documents, sometimes referred to as \"Red-headed documents\" (Hongtouwenjian), are not officially a form of legislation, although they often pave the way for legislation in the form of central laws, administrative regulations, administrative rules, or various forms of local regulations24. Some major policy documents regarding HIV are: (a) The 1987 Ministry of Health\u2019 first National Plan for the Prevention of HIV/AIDS (the 1987 Plan). The 1987 Plan stated that the priority of the Ministry was primarily to prevent", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3329f77-7ac6-4482-a510-9ee1175f6caa": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3329f77-7ac6-4482-a510-9ee1175f6caa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-china-review-and-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV Services in China: Review and Consultation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-china-review-and-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e5011cb28c818ec9002d5cafc1f82fda03f8b807a0082d326b26fc80f4751fdc"}, "3": {"node_id": "281a673a-a090-435d-ac81-e856b7211bc9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-china-review-and-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4085c9cd496c5cc16e7933c0cf469e4411622cb1b33ba451c90ac7145389b5fb"}}, "hash": "152446dbf4c59f7c3b352d958cf8b7e0844ef7d1656e4cd8bf48b5139dfda7ff", "text": "this foreign disease from entering China with measures including a ban on foreign blood products from entering the PRC. However, the plan did lay out the basic features of the government's methods for preventing and controlling AIDS, namely education, awareness and training, the first testing programme, quarantine (i.e. border control), research, as well as international cooperation. (b) In 1990 the State Council issued a more comprehensive national plan, The 1990 Plan, which covers a three year period (1990-1992), presents a more in-depth analysis of the circumstances surrounding AIDS and infectious diseases in China, and contains more specific strategies for treatment of those infected and the prevention of sexual transmission, transmission through blood transfusion or donation, and transmission from mothers to their children. HIV started to be regarded as not merely a foreign disease. The 1990 Plan reflected a much deeper understanding of the disease and an increase in guidance from other countries and international organizations, such as the World Health Organization. (c) This was followed by a more comprehensive plan, the 1998-2010 National AIDS Plan (the 1998 Plan), which the government then supplemented with the 2001- 2005 Plan (the 2001 Plan). These two plans reflect a larger, more cooperative strategy amongst many departments in the central government. The 1998 Plan again represented progress in that it acknowledged and pledged to fix problems with the safety of the blood supply system, which at the time was behind most of the infections in China. It also paid attention to high-risk populations, including education for prisoners. 23 Ibid. 24 Ibid. 18 The Policy and Legal Environment Related to HIV Services in China (d) The 2001 Plan can only be described as reflective of the government's increasing nervousness in the face of the surge of the AIDS epidemic in China through the late 1990s and into the twenty-first century. However, the 2001 Plan did not lay out any true new concrete measures for increasing the effectiveness of public health measures, but instead, it merely stated that the situation was growing more serious and officials should take steps to increase supervision and monitoring of growing HIV infections. (e) The State Council Notice on Further Strengthening the AIDS Response was issued at the end of 2010 setting out new policy measures focusing on the \u201cFive Expands, Six Strengthens\u201d approach, resulting in important achievements \uff0cexcept on strengthening social mobilization and multi-sectorial engagement . \u201cFive Expands\u201d includes: \uf0b7 Information, education and communication activities; \uf0b7 Surveillance and testing; \uf0b7 PMTCT; \uf0b7 Comprehensive interventions, and \uf0b7 Coverage of ART. \u201cSix Strengthens\u201d includes: \uf0b7 Blood safety management; \uf0b7 Health insurance; \uf0b7 Care and support; \uf0b7 Rights protection; \uf0b7 Organizational leadership, and \uf0b7 Strengthening of response teams. II. Official HIV-related legislation I. HIV testing The Twelfth Five-Year Action Plan of China for the containment and prevention of AIDS\u201d adopted in 2012 included a significant change on the principle of HIV testing in China. The plan proposed for the first time the principle of \"informed opt-out\" HIV testing25. The new policy on HIV testing expects all medical services, including public and private hospitals, clinics, emergency centers, substance abuse centers, medical surgical clinic, etc., to carry out HIV testing on all outpatients as a routine for HIV screening, with the patient retaining the right to decline. The acceptance of the \u201copt out\u201d system is actually a policy change from the previous controversial widespread \u201cmandatory testing\u201d in medical facilities. However, mandatory testing still exists in both private and public employment practices (such as the civil service examination) and in some aspects of port and customs requirements, especially related to student and business residency permits26.

II. The right to know and confidentiality Effective protection of the right to privacy or confidentiality is key to protect the rights of PLHIV. The 2006 National AIDS Regulations stipulate that if a patient's right to privacy is infringed, he may sue the accused provider or bring a lawsuit in accordance with the Chinese Law on Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases (Infectious Disease Law) 30. The act stipulates that no one should disclose the name, family address, employer, personal images, medical record and any other information related to the identity of a person living with HIV or their relatives. However, in somewhat contradictory fashion, Article 38 of the same law also stipulates that PLHIV should reveal their status to their sexual partners and their doctors without explaining or regulating under which \u201cconditions\u201d (such as to what extent the \u201cvital interests\u201d of those sexual partners may be threatened). This is an issue that needs to be clarified in the law. Unfortunately, since the 2006 AIDS Regulations are not considered a national law but only a national regulation of the State council, this did not pave the way for any kind of compensation system based on civil liability. Even worse, there is still no law that clearly protects \u201cconfidentiality\u201d in Chinese civil law system. Thus, the only legal basis to launch a civil litigation against any breach of confidentiality is the \u201cright of reputation\u201d, as stipulated in Article 101 of the Chinese Civil Law general rules (Minfatongze). Article 120 of the same law stipulates that citizens whose rights of 27 See Free HIV/AIDS voluntary counseling and testing management methods regulation. 28 See Article 23: The State carries out voluntary counseling and testing system. 29 See: Notice on Printing and Dissemination of National HIV Testing Management Regulations. Issued by MOH, 12 June, 2006. Effective: 12 June, 2006. Level of effect: Ministry-level regulation. Others include the National HIV testing technical specifications, the HIV testing laboratories basic standards, the National HIV sentinel surveillance embodiments (Trial) and more. 30 See AIDS Prevention and treatment Act Article 56, first paragraph. The second also stipulates a series of administrative punishment for medical entities (and other entities) breaking the law against the rights to confidentiality of PLHIV, patients or their relatives. 20 The Policy and Legal Environment Related to HIV Services in China reputation, honor or image were violated can ask for redress in the attempt to recover their reputation, reduce of the impact of the offence, or receive an apology from the violator(s), as well as request compensation. According to Chinese legal theory and legal practice, citizens can cite Article 120 for remedy of their right to confidentiality with the pre-condition that their reputation was damaged. Thus there exists an important loophole in the law for the specific protection of the right to confidentiality in HIV-related cases in main land China. After the Chinese Torts Law put into effect since 2010, plaintiffs can launch a civil suit based on \u201cGeneral Personality Right\u201d for legal remedies, although it looks quite broad, it was well accepted by the courts in the most recent cases. A related concept is the \u201cRight to Know\u201d. Article 42 of the 2006 National AIDS Regulations stipulates that staff of medical institutions should notify the HIV status to patients directly or to their legal guardians in certain cases. But there is no legal liability embodied in the Act for those who did not fulfill their obligation of notification. The Act does not provide strict procedures on how to notify thus putting the right to confidentiality of PLHIV at risk. In addition, the Article only regulates behavior of \u201cworking staff\u201d in medical institutions, and does not cover staff in other entities, such as prisons, custody and detention centers, nursing homes, etc. As China continues to have a large system of detention centers for sex workers and drug users this loophole impacts the lives of many PLHIV who are detained in these centers. Article 31 of the 2006 National AIDS Regulations stipulates that public security and judicial administrative entities should implement prevention and treatment measures targeted at PLHIV who are in prison", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "894ef237-1729-4a4f-b707-1be99136fbcf": {"__data__": {"id_": "894ef237-1729-4a4f-b707-1be99136fbcf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-china-review-and-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV Services in China: Review and Consultation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-china-review-and-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "412bbfcc64dd734e38a53a4989e92c9fd151a3d46a1e41c78320d229d31ee4ad"}, "3": {"node_id": "9debdb1c-3211-4de1-9dc4-eb955cd5a3e2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-china-review-and-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0d7390b202530bb26cb1ed295d85768a26cf37e79dafbb7c88f7491b867ab383"}}, "hash": "646aab2caa06ebb3ba8aeebb92b58b709331ae6da34e2d7b478282c82a97c71f", "text": "or under custody in educational detention centers (sex workers), compulsory detention centers for drug rehabilitation, and re-education through labor education centers (which have been gradually closed down since 2014). The Act also mentions the need for \u201ctechnical support\u201d from the CDC in this area. In practice, it is still unclear whether this means that mandatory testing is widely implemented in these centers without proper notification to the detainees. III. Anti-discrimination\u2014an overview Overall, anti-discrimination law is still in its early stage of development in the PRC. An increasing number of legal professionals have proposed draft bills in the recent years, most of them focusing on discrimination based on gender, age, disabilities and diseases such as Hepatitis B. All the same, there have been some high-profile anti- discrimination cases in the court system (including 5 public cases of HIV-related discrimination) and the body of law that includes anti-discrimination provisions is growing. Still, laws and regulations usually only contain anti-discrimination terminology or general concepts. There is no detailed procedure for collecting evidence and bringing lawsuits in order to enforce these provisions. Most importantly, China lacks a strong court system able to effectively respond to these cases31. China\u2019s HIV-focused anti-discrimination regulations need to be considered within this broader context. Regulations at both central and local levels only include provisions 31 Supra note 19. 21 United Nations Development Programme, China that forbid discrimination in housing, marriage and employment. But these anti- discrimination provisions mainly focus on the PLHIV community and conflicts exist between regulations at the central level and local levels. Most importantly, clear, detailed and due procedure for redress are completely absent. Furthermore, there is no law or regulation that includes anti-discrimination clauses targeted at sex workers, drug-users or sexual and gender minorities. All this while punitive provisions within strong criminal laws targeting sex workers and drug users and social campaigns against these communities continue to have a negative impact on their vulnerability to HIV. In summary: \uf0b7 There is no clear definition of \u201cdiscrimination\u201d in current Chinese law; \uf0b7 No feasible remedy clauses exist when damages occur; \uf0b7 No overarching rules on anti-discrimination can be applied to HIV related cases; \uf0b7 Punitive provisions criminalize drug users and quasi-criminalize sex workers. These provisions nullify the anti-discrimination clauses in the 2006 National AIDS Regulations; \uf0b7 Awareness raising of health professionals and policy-makers on the importance of anti-discrimination in responding to HIV is needed. IV. \u201cFour Frees and One Care\u201d policy In 2004, the central government launched the \u201cFour Frees and One Care\u201d policy, which was later incorporated into the 2006 AIDS Prevention and Treatment Act32. This policy offered free treatment to rural and urban residents without social insurance, free voluntary counseling and testing from the Chinese Center for Disease Control, free treatment for pregnant mothers and free testing for infants and free education for children orphaned by AIDS (the \u201cfour frees\u201d). The \"One Care\" part of the policy includes government subsidies for those living with HIV and their families in order to help improve their living conditions. This policy single handedly changed the national response to AIDS in China and is responsible for the large progress achieved in treatment coverage nationwide. Most importantly, it reflected a change in the attitude of the Chinese government from one of fear to one of compassion and active response, and its willingness to combat the disease among what at the time were important target groups (women and children) in rural and urban areas. However, the effectiveness of this policy is under question more than a decade later, mostly because of changes in the nature of the epidemic and because of the continuous legal and institutional constraints discussed in this report33,34. Issues related to blood transfusion One of the reasons that prompted the Chinese government to launch the very successful \u201cFour Frees and One Care\u201d policy was the illegal blood donation scandal that 32 See Article 44. 33 Supra note 19. 34 For example, Zhenhai district in Wenzhou, Zhejiang province, established a targeted basic living allowance system for PLHIV. According to Chengdu basic medical insurance Interim Methods for urban and rural residents, HIV-related medical expenses are included in the basic medical insurance coverage. 22 The Policy and Legal Environment Related to HIV Services in China happened in in Henan and nearby Provinces in the 1990s35.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9debdb1c-3211-4de1-9dc4-eb955cd5a3e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "9debdb1c-3211-4de1-9dc4-eb955cd5a3e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-china-review-and-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV Services in China: Review and Consultation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-china-review-and-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "412bbfcc64dd734e38a53a4989e92c9fd151a3d46a1e41c78320d229d31ee4ad"}, "2": {"node_id": "894ef237-1729-4a4f-b707-1be99136fbcf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-china-review-and-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "646aab2caa06ebb3ba8aeebb92b58b709331ae6da34e2d7b478282c82a97c71f"}}, "hash": "0d7390b202530bb26cb1ed295d85768a26cf37e79dafbb7c88f7491b867ab383", "text": "According to an estimation by the Ministry of Health, UNAIDS and WHO in 2011 there were 780,000 (620,000\u2013 940,000) PLHIV, among them 6.6% were infected through commercial blood collection and donation, blood transfusion and usage of blood products (92.7% in Henan, Anhui, Hubei and Shanxi provinces).

Since the enactment and implementation of the Blood Donation Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1998, HIV transmission through medical blood transfusion includes patients\u2019 usage of contaminated blood or blood products leading to HIV transmissions, which is in violation of the Blood Donation Law. Cases of this category can now be dealt with according to the Law. The victims may directly bring a suit against the blood supply/transfusion entities and a claim based on the General Principles of the Civil Law. But according to the Chinese Tort Liability Law Article 54 and 58, the clinical damage liability should only follow \u2018fault liability\u2019 and \u2018fault presumption\u2019 principles. Article 7 of the Tort Liability Law specifies that \u201cif an actor harmed others\u2019 civil rights, regardless of whether the actor had fault or not, he/she shall assume tort liability as specified in the law\u201d. Nonetheless, there was no relative specification in the existing laws. On the other hand, Article 29 and Article 60 of the Tort Liability Law stipulates that \u201cin the case that the damage to others is caused by irresistible force, the actor does not bear tort liability\u201d and that \u201cif limited by medical technologies at time, the illness is difficult to diagnose and treat, then the clinical institution is not liable\u201d. This can be applied to cases with infections during a window period of infection or false negative test results. The provisions of these laws make it difficult for victims of blood transfusion to claim real compensation, for the burden of proof is on their side and is very difficult to fulfill\u2014they have to provide evidence to prove that the hospitals or blood stations were \u201csubjectively wrong\u201d or made \u201ca subjective error\u201d which means the hospitals or blood stations knew that the blood or blood product was contaminated when the victim used it. This is often impossible. In the year of 2011, a groups of experts include academia on ethics, lawyers and health expert delivered a comprehensive report to the Chinese government (the Beijing Red Ribbon Forum also supported to organize ad hoc conferences) with recommendations on how to compensate those people in suffering37. The report proposed to build an 35 There are three types of cases of people infected by blood contaminated with HIV/AIDS in mainland China: The first type is the infection through retro-transfusion of erythrocytes (Red Cell) after trading blood in rural areas in many cities and provinces which are centered in Henan. The second type is the exposure through surgery transfusion by contaminated blood from illegal blood trade, among those many of which are compulsive transfusion. The last type of exposure concerns hemophiliacs who came into contact with infection during their treatment which requires injection of a blood product called FVIII (Factor VIII), many of those coming from Shanghai Institute of Biological Products. 36 See Qiu RZ, et al.

It was then revised in 1992, 2000 and 2008 respectively. The 2008 law integrated SIPO (State Intellectual Property Office) Order No. 31 and 3738, the TRIPS Protocol agreement on compulsory license and added an anti-monopoly clause39. Article 49 of the law stipulates that when there is a national emergency, or for the purposes of public interests, SIPO can issue compulsory licenses on inventions or utility models40. Article 49 covers both situations of \u201cnational emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency\u201d as well as \u201cpublic non-commercial use\u201d (Government Use) under the TRIPS Agreement. One break-through in recent years has been the Measures for Compulsory License of China issued in May 2012. The Measures finally detailed the process and requirements for a department under the State Council to ask for a compulsory license under Article 49 of the Patent Law.

But the challenge in practice is how to implement Article 12 of 2012 Measures and Article 49 of the Patent law. Local manufacturers are mostly geared for export production and still lack incentives for the development of local generic pharmaceuticals in China. For one of the most troubling features of the TRIPS CL regime is Article 31(f) which requires that compulsory licenses be authorized \u201cpredominantly for the supply of the domestic market of the Member authorizing such use.\u201d Although a CL for import is perfectly lawful, there may well be Article 31(f) restrictions on exporters that limit that right. 25 United Nations Development Programme, China 1. Right to education and employment As mentioned above, the 2006 National AIDS Regulations prohibit discrimination against PLHIV and their families in education and employment settings. Unfortunately its implementation at the provincial level is weak and the knowledge around this provision still really low. In 2011, Guangxi province\u2019s Southern Country Today reported that a six year-old AIDS orphan named A Long was denied entrance to a local primary school due to protests and complaints from other students\u2019 parents41. This is one of a number of similar cases that show the severe social discrimination still widely present in Chinese society against PLHIV. This is continuing despite central and local regulations and policy commitments to provide support for AIDS orphans in terms of education42.

For example, in May 2014 the Henan Provincial Education Bureau issued an policy named Notification on enhance AIDS prevention and education among schools, stipulating that all freshmen recruited by Universities and colleges in Henan should undergo mandatory testing for HIV, due to the \u201csevere situation of the AIDS epidemic\u201d in the province with rapid increasing of HIV infection cases among youth. The policy raised a big debate at the national level, even though it argued that the confidentiality of the testing results would be well protected and that Universities should not deny the admission of those HIV positive freshmen43. High levels of discrimination and general public fear of HIV often drive local government\u2019s actions44. This also applies to the area of employment. The Employment Promotion Law45, which came into effect in 2008, regulates that employers cannot refuse to hire carriers of pathogen of infectious diseases, but the last sentence of Article 30 points out that they (carriers) should not engage in any job that could \u201ceasily transmit the disease\u201d already banned by a law, Acts of the State Council or regulations of the State council\u2019s Health authority46. The language of the Employment Promotion Law actually is a generic version of the 2004 Infectious Disease Law47, and obviously conflicts with the content of Article 3 of the 2006 National AIDS Regulations, which prohibits discrimination against PLHIV and their families on employment. The law provides too much power to administrative authorities when it says \u201cLaw, acts by State Council and regulations of the State Council\u2019s health authority\u201d to decide which type of work PLHIV should engage in. However, the Employment Promotion Law provides a legal basis for a \u201cright to claim\u201d. According to Article 62 of the law, the employers or workers can launch litigation against anyone (employers or employee) who violates the law. Since 2008, there have been 5 public employment related cases dealing with HIV discrimination in mainland China. The latest one reached an agreement for compensation (total CNY 40,000 or approximately USD 6,500) while the plaintiff withdrew the litigation from the court48. This is the second case where the plaintiff received compensation, but without a judicial judgment. However, the main challenges on HIV-related employment discrimination are still 43 See http://www.gongyishibao.com/html/yaowen/6566.html, last visit on 29 October, 2014. 44 A research on discrimination conducted by UN agencies in 2011 pointed out that among 2000 respondents (PLHIV) 41.7% have the experience of be discriminated, 11.9% of pregnant women was suggested to do abortion. Another research in 2008pointed that among 6000 respondents 41.3% would not work with PLHIV and 47.8% refuse to join a common meal with PLHIV.

Interestingly, the Health Management Implementation Regulation in Locus Publicus (2011) itself does not mention HIV. It only regulates that people living with an Infectious disease of the digestive tract such as dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis A and E, or people with active pulmonary tuberculosis or exudative skin diseases should not engage in direct service for customers before they are \u201ccured\u201d 51. In addition, a 2006 notice from the Ministry of Health states that PLHIV can work in the food industry52. However, Article 30 of the 2006 AIDS Prevention and Treatment Act has had a negative impact on the lives of PLHIV pushing many of them to depend on low-skilled jobs and reinforcing social stigma and discrimination. 2. Access to treatment and medical services To prevent discrimination against PLHIV in accessing medical services, Article 16 of Law on Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases stipulates: \"The state and society should take care of patients with infectious diseases, pathogen carriers and suspected patients of infectious diseases and help them receive timely medical treatment, and such population shall not be discriminated against by any institution or individual\". More specifically, the 2006 National AIDS Regulations stipulate: \"Medical institutions shall not refuse to carry on treatment to the patient because of he/she is or is suspected of being infected with HIV\".

However, discrimination against PLHIV in hospitals remains too commonplace. The main reason rests with an institutional weakness. People living with infectious diseases are expected to attend Infectious Disease Hospitals present in each city or region. However these specialized infectious disease hospitals are not \u201cgeneral hospitals\u201d with the full capacity to provide services such as cancer treatment, or gynecology and obstetrics treatment for pregnant women. Yet once PLHIV present themselves to the general hospitals for these types of services they are often rejected. In addition, insurance for occupational exposure is limited and there are no incentives for doctors and medical workers to provide qualified health services to PLHIV. 3. Right to free movement The Infectious Disease Law provides three categories of diseases: A, B and C. AIDS is now a category B disease, not requiring isolation (quarantine) for treatment, this has been the case only since a revision of the law in 200453. This law protects patients by prohibiting discrimination (Article 16) and the release of private information (Article 12). The law also provides penalties for failure to report an outbreak of an infectious disease. For ports and immigration issues, the HIV/AIDS Prevention and Management in Port Areas54 regulates quarantine related issue as follows: \uf0b7 Port Quarantine: the Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) is in charge of inspection and management of human organs, biological products, blood, etc. \uf0b7 PLHIV should report their status to AQSIQ or its branches when they enter or leave China. \uf0b7 Citizens who live more than one year in foreign countries should report to AQSIQ branches or related hospitals above the county level to get an HIV test. Foreigners who apply for travel or stay in China should come to local branches of AQSIQ for physical examination. \uf0b7 Physical check-up, including HIV test, is needed when citizens go abroad and stay more than one year. \uf0b7 AQSIQ should set up an HIV/AIDS surveillance site network around port areas. 53 Law on Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "06af7ef4-9678-4e98-941c-81fa377b8659": {"__data__": {"id_": "06af7ef4-9678-4e98-941c-81fa377b8659", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-china-review-and-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV Services in China: Review and Consultation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-china-review-and-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "77d88b5aef7c5225506dc72c0c2bc82d592cc49f59638ed766b454213e23f0f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "0377624c-19c7-4f8c-a4b3-12862a0f23f8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-china-review-and-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bc00f759df6a7c955613e1608fd1ca14be6e119f7488d8b0a2ff044b4d576992"}}, "hash": "bbb2026d4f014cf2f4365106be667f7c39a00eda9270f4bdbe4cd02da2e91a91", "text": "53 Law on Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases.

Marriage rights The 2006 National AIDS Regulations include the right of marriage for PLHIV. The Act prohibits discrimination against PLHIV and their families in marriage and other areas. However, it does not grant a civil right of action, nor does it impose administrative punishments for violations of this basic right. Most importantly, some procedures already stipulated by other regulations and laws go in direct contrast to the AIDS Act in this respect: \uf06c The Marriage Law of the PRC, which was amended in 2001, includes a provision that prohibits people living with certain diseases from marrying. \uf06c Marriage registration agencies will not register the marriage if the medical authorities believe that one of the parties is living with a disease dangerous to the other party and not suitable for marriage. \uf06c The Ministry of Health (MOH) has issued an \u201cOpinion on the Regulation of Persons with HIV and AIDS\u201d (1999), stating that those who have progressed to AIDS should postpone their marriages. The Opinion states that people with HIV should seek medical counseling before marrying55. It is clear that many of these provisions should be reformed as they still provide a basis on which authorities can deny marriages to PLHIV. 1. Sex workers I. Background For the majority of its history, sex work was legal in China. Under pre-Confucian imperial rule, sex work and pandering were legitimized by common court practice56. 55 See: Marriage Law (Amended 2001), issued: 9 October, 1980, amendment effective: 18 April, 2001, level of effect: national-level law by NPC. Marriage Registration Regulations, issued: 30 July, 2003, effective: 1 October, 2003, level of effect: State Council regulation. 56 Gil VE & Anderson AF. State-sanctioned aggression and the control of prostitution in the People\u2019s Republic of China: A review. Aggression and violent behavior, 1998, 3 (2): 129-142. The impact of the legal environment on key populations 30 The Policy and Legal Environment Related to HIV Services in China Since the emergence of Confucianism as a moral code around mid-to-early-500s BC, sex work, pandering and buying sexual favors were still sanctioned as an upper-class privilege 57 . In the tumultuous early 20th century, many Chinese provinces, like Guangdong, taxed sex work in order to increase public revenues58. In 1949, however, sex work was outlawed and the government made concerted efforts to eradicate it completely, because sex work was seen as a symptom of capitalistic subjugation of women59. All sex workers were essentially portrayed as victims, and started being detained in rehabilitation 'shelters' for re-education (in Communist morality) and re- training in new skills60. In legal provisions, such as the 1957 Act of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Security Administration Punishment, selling of sex carried a misconduct connotation. Under the provisions of the Act, a woman caught doing sex work could be given a warning, or placed in detention for a maximum of ten days and fined up to 20 Yuan61. The process was set-up outside of the criminal justice system, instead directed by the Public Security Bureaus, the People's Procuratories and some local chapters of the Chinese Women's Federation62. The era of reform and opening up starting in 1978 initiated, among other economic activity, a rapid expansion of the visible sex industry in China. This led to a reactive tightening of the legal framework in an attempt to limit sex trade, and later, especially in the 1990s, to control the spread of HIV and STDs63. II. Current legal environment The \u201cMeasures for Detention and Education\u201d developed by the Ministry of Public Security stipulates that detention in C&E centers can be implemented for those who refuse to abandon their \u201cwrong behavior\u201d after repeated education.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9944b6b7-6f4c-49bc-a1a1-de16dfc71965": {"__data__": {"id_": "9944b6b7-6f4c-49bc-a1a1-de16dfc71965", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-china-review-and-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV Services in China: Review and Consultation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-china-review-and-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9160d332676f4df604d7237d4b35e52e282abe5ba0da5e9c2f3c61bfb80132e5"}, "2": {"node_id": "1365e7c1-76ea-4c54-9ab0-5c28d3d1720d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-china-review-and-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "677c6539887f62040ee571ea0d70a3921ec167d27f3453a4d9478d4dd78f9418"}}, "hash": "58d007a5200b842c4baca21753586a6daea96b0330a73d9f5e2010d07cf836d0", "text": "Article 30 of the \u201cRegulations of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) on Administrative Penalties for Public Security\u201d developed by MPS in 1986 stipulates that \u201cProstitution, whoring, pandering or housing prostitution or whoring with a prostitute are strictly forbidden.

Reflection on phenomenon of prostitution. Central Advisory Net, 2010. 31 United Nations Development Programme, China In order to strictly prohibit the growing practice, the Standing Committee of NPC promulgated \u201cThe Decision on Severely Prohibiting Prostitution and Whoring\u201d65 on 4 September, 1991, and authorized the State Council to formulate relevant regulations accordingly; on 4 September, 1993, the Council issued Regulations on Detention and Education for Prostitutes and Whoring Goers66, making the first step in establishing the current system of C&E centers. The Decision and Regulations mentioned above have served as the legal ground for the punishment imposed on sex workers and their clients in juridical practice. Experts estimate that about 18,000\u201328,000 FSW are sent to C&E detention centers every year67. From 1987 to 2000 the number of people detained in these centers reached around 300,000 with 200 C&E centers established nationwide 68 However, some scholars believe that number was underestimated and the data from the police department might constitute only 30% of the real number 69. Prosecutions have increased in recent years, with public security administrations processing more than 833,000 prostitution cases nationwide from 2002 to 2006, with the total number of people involved reaching to 1.82 million70. The C&E detention system has no legal basis and its application lacks explicit procedures, which causes arbitrary and selective law enforcement by public security administrations71. It is frequently the case that a sex worker or her client is detained for 15 days according to the \u201cLaw of the PRC on Penalty in Public Security Administration\u201d, and then detained and educated again from six months to two years according to \u201cThe Measures of Detention Education for Prostitutes and Whoring Goers\u201d. Public security bureaus apply the sex work laws arbitrarily. A survey of 348 migrant sex workers (higher-end, lower-end and street-based)72 in Beijing found that http://news.9ask.cn/falvlunwen/xflw/201001/302173.html 65 It is stipulated that \u201cwhoever engages in prostitution or whoring shall be punished in accordance with the provisions in Article 66 of the Regulations on Penalties in Public Security. With respect to persons who engage in prostitution or whoring, the public security administrations in conjunction with departments concerned may carry out compulsory education in law and morality and force them to participate in productive labor at a designated place in order to rid them of the pernicious habits. The term shall range from six months to two years.

In practice, sex workers and their clients who are able to pay (sometimes steep) fines are not detained, but those who are unable to pay are end up in the C&E system. Cases collected by some non-governmental organizations also show that relations with public security officers often determine whether a sex worker faces detention. Although detention and incarceration are supposed to be applied only to repeat offenders, the likelihood of detention increases for all sex workers during crackdowns when police are known to have arrest and detention target quotas74. In 1999 only 29% of sex workers in detention centers in Zhejiang province were re-offenders 75 . Arbitrary and selective law enforcement by public security officers causes judicial corruption, greatly undermines the seriousness of law and unity of the legal system, and violates the fairness of law enforcement, further damaging the credibility of state justice76. III. Negative impact on the HIV epidemic The risk of being detained forces sex workers to hide their true information, making it difficult for them to access HIV testing and counseling as well as treatment services77. Most importantly, despite explicit guidelines to not do so78, the police often use condom possession as evidence of sex work and as basis for arrest. The practice is particularly likely during crackdowns, and decreases sex workers\u2019 use of condoms, as many stop carrying them, or venue managers do not allow them to be kept on premises79. This has led to a situation where clearly most sex workers decline to use condoms for fear of this being taken as evidence of prostitution by the police80. Police crackdowns also increase sex worker mobility, which expands sexual networks and increases risks of STD spread81, while disrupting professional and social networks resulting in increased vulnerability82. people involved, but descriptive terms to distinguish between sex workers in different settings. 73 Yi H et al.

Despite the governments\u2019 recognition in many legal documents of sex workers as a key population in responding to HIV, the current legislation and law enforcement practices on sex work increase the risk of HIV among sex workers and through them to the general population. The further underground China\u2019s millions of sex workers are forced to operate, the more difficult it is to respond to the HIV epidemic through public health efforts. The equal rights of sex workers under the 2006 AIDS Prevention and treatment Act must be affirmed clearly, and sex workers diagnosed with HIV guaranteed a sufficient alternative livelihood, social support and medical treatment85. 2. People who use drugs I. Background In the early 1980s, China became a new market for a number of international drug cartels. Drugs started to be sold along the border regions of Yunnan province, especially between China and Myanmar. In about 10 years, China changed from a transit country for drug trafficking into a large drug consumption market. The number of drug users and the diversity of drugs used kept increasing. According to official statistics, by the end of 2012, the number of registered drug users in China was almost 2.1 million, with opioid drug users accounting for 60.6 per cent while synthetic drug users accounted for 38 per cent (NCB 2013). In January 2014, it was reported that the number of registered drug users reached 2.4 million86. But, it was estimated that the actual number could be as high as five times that, or more than 10 million, with the number of teenage drug users accounting for over 70 per cent of the total87. In the last few years changes in the drug market have meant an especially high amount of new methamphetamine based drugs, which increased six fold from 2005 to 201288. Injecting drug use was the original and primary driver of the HIV epidemic in China. While its total share of new infections has dropped considerably in the last ten years, injecting drug use still accounts for approximately 25% of new infections. II. The chilling effect of Chinese narcotics law system on AIDS prevention Facing this severe situation, the government and legislature of China decided to adopt 83 Lin et al.

Asian Bioethics Review, 2014, 6 (2). 34 The Policy and Legal Environment Related to HIV Services in China a punitive approach to dealing with drug use. The Anti-Narcotic Drug Decisions promulgated by the National People\u2019s Congress Standing Committee in 1990 stipulated severe punitive measures for drug users, such as 15 days detention, mandatory treatment and education and even forced labor education89. In 2008, the Anti-Narcotic Drug Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China (NPC 2008) was formally promulgated (repealing the 1990 Anti-Narcotic Drug Decisions). In this law, compulsory testing, compulsory registration, compulsory detoxification and detention were all strengthened90. In addition to this national law, there are a series of relevant regulations or rules issued over the last fifteen years aimed at curtailing drug use, including: Rules on the Procedure of Drug Abuse Tests (2009); Management Measures for Compulsory Isolation Detoxification (2000); Measures for Identifying Drug Addiction (2011); and the Management Measures for Compulsory Isolation Detoxification of Public Security Department (2011). Although the 2008 Anti-Narcotic Drug Law provided more choices for drug users, in terms of voluntary detoxification and community detoxification in addition to compulsory detoxification, the majority of its focus remained on the latter.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cef95b59-a038-4396-ba59-984578516778": {"__data__": {"id_": "cef95b59-a038-4396-ba59-984578516778", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-china-review-and-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV Services in China: Review and Consultation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-china-review-and-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a5340e108096223bc198a155d1e522aaec719402f9153442424c5ae12331c64b"}, "2": {"node_id": "5c6ef5c3-f74d-45ce-9228-1d22478593ab", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-china-review-and-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4a617383982914b9bc283112ea93a3fbbe2871aadf7a5b566022759ea6fb6fb4"}}, "hash": "331ecb70a51da7229539cd991e03bb86041b1369512dc6010239863f1940150e", "text": "This law institutionalized the compulsory detoxification centers system as a parallel system to the re-education through labor (RTL\u2013which has been gradually closed since 2013) system and the C&E centers system for sex workers.

Article 38 is considered especially problematic when it comes to the implementation of the law. The term \u201cserious violation\u201d has no clear definition or criteria, while the expected \u201cagreement\u201d on the side of the drug user for community detoxification should be voluntary rather than a mandatory one. In practice, local PSBs decide whether to administer community detoxification or send a drug user to a compulsory detoxification center93. The PSB makes this decision through a process based on vague criteria without clear and adequate medical scientific evidence. It has in effect become an extra-judicial system, through which the PSB can make decision to deprive citizens\u2019 (regarded as drug addicts) personal freedom without a due process before the court. The compulsory detoxification system, along with the Anti-Narcotics drug Law, have a negative effect on the response to AIDS in China, especially impacting prevention services for drug users 94 . Although progress has been made and the PSB now collaborates with public health workers, it is still hard to initiate and scale up health interventions inside these detention centers. Most importantly, the fear of being detained in these centers prevents many drug users from accessing HIV-related services in public hospitals or testing clinics. Another obstacle to a more comprehensive HIV response is the DCS. This is a national system built to monitor the real time location and movement of all registered (convicted or formerly detained) drug users. In practice this means that if a drug user, or former drug user\u2019s, name is included in this system, every time this person applies for a job, gets admitted into a hospital, checks into a hotel or a flight, the local police will be notified of his/her presence in the local community. This often leads to the police being called and the drug user being questioned. In July 2012, the Ministry of Public Security issued a revised \u201cNotice on enhanced management and control of drug users\u2019 drivers\u201d, which called for the cancellation of the driver\u2019s licenses for all drug users still considered as addicts or currently in the community or compulsory detoxification centers95.

The 2004 State Council\u2019s Notice on Substantively Enhance AIDS Prevention and Treatment (the 2004 Notice) pushed the Ministry of Health to work in close collaboration with the PSB to pilot (Methadone) substitution therapy and needle exchange programs in all areas where increased HIV infections were driven by injecting drug use\u201d96.

This was followed in March 2006, by the China Action Plan on AIDS prevention and treatment (2006-2010). The Action Plan included a goal of covering 70% of key populations with prevention interventions. All counties (cities) with 500 plus registered drug users were asked to establish clinics for MMT while the regions to provide clean needle exchange services. Coverage of community methadone maintenance work increased steadily. At the end of 2011, a total of 738 methadone maintenance clinics had been established in 623 districts and counties of 28 provinces nationwide. A cumulative total of more than 344,000 drug addicts had received community MMT, and 140,100 were receiving treatment. An average of 190 people received treatment in each clinic. The treatment adherence rate was 74.9%. Community MMT and needle exchange played an important role in reducing new HIV infections among drug users in China97. Most importantly, both policies above influenced Article 17 of the 2006 National AIDS Regulations which calls for the establishment of a governmental coordination mechanism to deal with HIV prevention and anti-narcotic work above the county level. The Act clearly states that the health, public security and food and drug administrations of each Province should collaborate and promote HIV prevention measures, including maintenance treatment for drug users. The 2006 National AIDS Regulations also institutionalized the right to HIV services for those who are under arrest, detained and who are serving time in C&E or compulsory detoxification centers. The act made the PSB and the justice department responsible to implement these measures within the centers. In March 2012, 12 UN agencies signed a joint statement calling for the closure of compulsory drug detention and rehabilitation centers98. In response, in 2013 a group of Chinese scholars and lawyers issued a report proposing a new legal and policy framework to the Chinese government99. The recommendations include: \uf0b7 Carry out a national evaluate on the efficiency and effectiveness of compulsory drug detention and rehabilitation centers; \uf0b7 Revise relevant legal standards to reform the current rehabilitation system and gradually promote treatment services initiated by community-based organizations and other social organizations; \uf0b7 In the meantime, transform and upgrade the existing compulsory centers, improving the quality of the health services currently in place in accordance with international medical standards. 3.

However, with the establishment of the People\u2019s Republic of China, same-sex behavior became more politicized, leading to tougher political and legal crackdowns.

However, the Chinese Criminal Law passed in 1979 introduced the crime of \u201chooliganism\u201d. The article states: \u201cthose who commit\u2026insult and harass women or commit other hooligan-like activities which damage public order to a severe extent, will be sentenced to imprisonment for a maximum of 7 years\u201d. This vague definition of hooliganism led to later judicial practices and explanations including within the \u201chooliganism crime\u201d also \u201cimproper sexual behavior\u201d among male persons. This meant, indirectly, that Article 160 could officially be applied to punish the MSM population. This was supported in 1988 by another case addressed by the research division of the Supreme People\u2019s Court100. The Court basically stated that because there was no specific law or judicial explanation regulating behavior among same-sex males, these activities could in effect be interpreted in the law as hooliganism activities. However it also recommended deeper investigation of the specific cases and situations, looking at the consequences of such behavior, whether it was consensual or forced behavior before applying Article 160 of Criminal Law. Over the last fifteen years this legal framework was reformed. In 1997 the National People\u2019s Congress revised the criminal law and removed the concept of \u201chooliganism\u201d all together. As a result, the 2005 Public Security and Management Law deleted the articles related to hooliganism activities, restricting the ability of policemen to intervene on issues of consensual, adult same-sex behavior; (unless there is an exchange of money, in which case according to a 2001 order issued by Ministry of Public Security \u201cimproper same-sex behavior\u201d should be categorized as prostitution activities). 100 China Supreme People\u2019s Court.

Finally, in summer 2012, the Ministry of Health changed the blood donation policy from banning all \u201chomosexual\u201d donors, as it had been for more than thirty years, to only \u201cmen who have sex with men\u201d103. Despite these changes, the government has been largely silent on sexual orientation and gender identity related social issues, taking a \u201cnot encouraging, not discouraging, not promoting\u201d attitude. In certain aspects of China\u2019s law, for example, censorship in the media, movies and television, homosexual content in any form is explicitly banned. Overall, the lack of anti-discrimination laws or regulations protecting sexual minorities leave most LGBT people and MSM open to institutional and societal discrimination in a number of ways. While anti-discrimination regulations exist in a variety of forms, including in the Constitution, laws on the protection of women, laws on the protection of the disabled, laws on the protection of minors and of seniors, and laws on employment, etc., none of them explicitly defines sexual orientation and gender identity as a specific basis of discrimination104.

This relates especially to cases of extortion and violence towards members of the LGBT community (especially transgender sex workers) and between intimate sexual partners, as well as from public authorities, such as the security department. Victims of violence and extortion often do not report these cases to the police for fear of being further victimized. \uf0b7 Same-sex rape is also a problem because the law clearly defines rape as an act committed against a woman. Rape of a man does not constitute a crime, unless it has caused considerable physical injury to the victim, in which case it could be sued as crime of wilful and malicious injury.

III. MSM and HIV policy environment The Chinese Ministry of Health\u2019s MSM AIDS Comprehensive Prevention and Control Pilot Program Work Plan (The Work Plan) issued in 2008 is the most comprehensive policy focusing on China\u2019s MSM epidemic. It makes provisions for various aspects of HIV prevention among MSM, including establishing specific medium term goals, organizational management and implementation details, as well as funding requirements. The Work Plan aimed that more than 90% of the MSM population with HIV testing and 95% of HIV-positive MSM with counseling services and strengthen prevention measures to reach more than 70% coverage. The plan also makes provision on the form of behavioral intervention and education among MSM, including \u201ccarry out behavioral intervention activities among MSM population mainly through core peer advocates to promote safe sex, reduce HIV-related high risk behaviors and improve skills of STD and HIV prevention.\u201d Local CDCs (or together with MSM civil society organizations) are responsible for the training of core peer advocates; MSM civil society organizations are recognized as being responsible for recruiting and training teachers and candidates for core peer advocates, while the CDC is responsible for overall supervision and evaluation. Training of trainers of peer advocates is conducted first, then with the support of local CDCs, the recruiting and training for core peer advocates is carried out, and trained peer advocates are encouraged to conduct intervention activities in their networks. Meanwhile, a number of hotlines and online platform as well as more traditional condom promotion and outreach intervention activities are incentivized. These laws and regulations exemplify the increasing recognition of the need of focusing on key populations like MSM in order to successfully respond to HIV in China. However, China\u2019s legislation still lacks specific protections for the MSM population and the role of governmental organizations is still limited. minority, race, sex, religious. 40 The Policy and Legal Environment Related to HIV Services in China The 2006 State Council AIDS Prevention and Treatment Act was an important and useful step forward in AIDS-related law and rights protection in China. The AIDS Act includes the most comprehensive attempt at protecting the rights of PLHIV in China, including the right to marry, to access health-care services, to enjoy equal employment and education opportunities and the right to confidentiality and non-discrimination. However, its implementation has remained weak and these regulations alone have not provided effective protection for people living with or affected by HIV, who in 2014 are still experiencing high levels of stigma and discrimination. Many of the most important provisions within the 2006 National AIDS Regulations are still in direct conflict with local government regulations and continue to be challenged by alternative policy decisions of local authorities. Most importantly, the 2006 National AIDS Regulations are subject to override by a number of laws that have a higher priority in the legal hierarchy, such as selection procedures that still permit HIV-related discrimination in employment for the public sector106 or criminal laws and practices that undermine the successful response to the HIV epidemic amongst key populations, especially sex workers and drug users. Finally, conflicts between provisions of the same law and different laws and regulations have made proper law enforcement difficult, leading to law enforcement practices in direct opposition to the 2006 National AIDS Regulations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a446466c-c95b-421d-bf61-6e7ac41c6c1f": {"__data__": {"id_": "a446466c-c95b-421d-bf61-6e7ac41c6c1f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-china-review-and-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV Services in China: Review and Consultation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-china-review-and-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2991cd37f852a360370b0a1d894f01ae52827c9b2bf02bdc4e6d1cb258ef6d9b"}, "2": {"node_id": "bf0a4c09-1322-4194-b413-bc4405d81463", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-china-review-and-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bff33f7a30ec8b5135128a00aac274b1945b19f99959096566bc428559d4ba4e"}}, "hash": "2c04d34dabb813c4f2061c1d733e22d4cc422aa81da23d503f8c19e0e93f51a5", "text": "Overall, the 2006 National AIDS Regulations are only the \u201claw on paper\u201d, with very 106 \u201cThe Law of the People's Republic of China on Promotion of Employment\u201d article 30 Conclusions 41 United Nations Development Programme, China limited impact in real life and a very different picture when it comes to the \u2018law on the streets\u201d.

There are conflicts and differences that still exist between the 2006 provisions and provincial ones that were never reformed since they came into place. More worryingly, a number of Provincial governments have recently proposed stigmatizing and dehumanizing regulations in direct conflict with the 2006 National AIDS Regulations. 3. Contradictions between different provisions within the same law or between different laws or regulations at the national level prevent efficient law enforcement. These need to be clarified. 4. The 2006 National AIDS Regulations are subject to overriding laws that have a higher priority in the legal hierarchy, such as laws that still permit HIV-related discrimination in employment, or criminal laws relating to sex work and drug use. 5. One example is employment discrimination, with the civil service medical exam, which contradicts specific provisions protecting PLHIV from employment discrimination. This and other contradicting practices in the public sector need to be reformed by fully implementing the 2006 National AIDS Regulations. 6. Strong criminal laws and severe law enforcement practices negatively affect drug users and sex workers. The current legislation and law enforcement practices prevent people from accessing prevention and treatment services, increase the risk of HIV among these populations and through them to the general population. Examples include: Condoms used as criminal evidence of sex work; C&E centers for sex workers; sex workers crackdowns; compulsory detoxification detention centers for drug users; as well as parts of the implementation of the DCS, the national database for drug users. 1. Deal with conflicts of legal provisions and institutional governance The 2006 National AIDS Regulations need to be revised, together with other related AIDS regulations, thus to reduce internal conflicts with other laws. The 2006 National AIDS Regulations should be upgraded to a national law\u2013 passed by the National People\u2019s Congress to increase its authority and power. This would give more teeth to some of the protections contained in the regulations. Recommendations 42 The Policy and Legal Environment Related to HIV Services in China The Chinese Government should set up an HIV Law Steering Committee to promote more effective coordination among different ministries, legislative bodies and judicial area, with a comprehensive action plans to initiate HIV-related legal reforms. 2. On anti-discrimination More practical clauses could be added to the 2006 National AIDS Regulations, as well as the Civil Procedure Law and its judicial explanations and the Torts Law to deal with HIV-related discrimination. This includes: \uf0b7 Deal with employment discrimination, by reforming the health examination requirements for the private sector and for the civil service; \uf0b7 Deal with institutional discrimination in healthcare settings by reforming the infectious disease hospitals system. Mechanisms for expanding and ensuring care of PLHIV in general hospitals need to be set-up, as well as incentives for medical workers to provide essential care services (such as better insurance, trainings, education and compensation for possible professional exposure, etc.); \uf0b7 Specific penalty clauses should be added for the violation of the 2006 National AIDS Regulations and for any HIV-related discrimination; \uf0b7 To strengthen legal empowerment of PLHIV as well as deal with discrimination, the Government and civil society organizations should work together to provide HIV-specific legal aid services. The Ministry of Justice National Legal Aid Center could support community initiatives in this area; \uf0b7 China should consider enacting a comprehensive anti-discrimination law in the future. 3. On sex workers I. The PSB should actively stop the law enforcement practice that treats condom possession as evidence of prostitution, especially during police crackdowns of sex work establishments. Measures at the central and provincial levels in key provinces are required to ensure that this practice is not continued. II. The C&E detention system violates the basic rights of sex workers while having a disproportionately negative effect on their vulnerability to HIV infection. These centers should be abolished in line with recent experiences from other countries such as Vietnam. In the meantime, the PSB should be made to work more closely with the CDC in supporting effective and accessible prevention services among sex workers. 4. On people who use drugs I. Abolish or deeply reform the compulsory detoxification and re-education center system; II. Strictly limit the use and disclosure of information from the drug", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bbcb3c5f-f99a-4432-ba1d-3fd1fe425baa": {"__data__": {"id_": "bbcb3c5f-f99a-4432-ba1d-3fd1fe425baa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-china-review-and-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV Services in China: Review and Consultation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-china-review-and-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ee101fd6fb5f3cbf6e938b0d572a161d92cb4061b52473c9aaec542cc220a10a"}}, "hash": "ee101fd6fb5f3cbf6e938b0d572a161d92cb4061b52473c9aaec542cc220a10a", "text": "addicts dynamic monitoring database and improve the management of the data in this system; III.

This would be a first step in providing a more supportive environment for them to fully come back to society; 43 United Nations Development Programme, China IV. Reform the current driving ban for drug users \u2013 this negatively effects former drug users in their reintegration into society. 5. On MSM I. Address the lack of anti-discrimination measures for sexual and gender minorities. This should include passing an anti-employment discrimination clause/law on the basis of SOGI or adding SOGI criteria to existing laws and regulations; II. Amend media censorship laws that ban SOGI themes from being discussed. Promote public sex education and broader public sensitization on sexual and gender minority issues; III. Support easier registration processes for HIV and/or LGBT NGOs, especially encouraging the development of community based organizations (CBOs) working with the MSM community. 6. On mandatory testing and confidentiality I. China should reduce the use of mandatory testing while trying to improve the protection of confidentiality for PLHIV; II. The law and regulations need to be revised accordingly to empower the PLHIV community to seek remedy through the judicial system when there is a breach in confidentiality. This should include adding specific penalties for confidentiality breaches to enable stigma reduction; III. Finally, local procedures that require someone to inform their spouse of their HIV status should be reformed in accordance to the 2006 National AIDS Regulations. 7. Research and training on HIV in China China needs to pay more attention to legal and policy research on HIV, especially from a social sciences perspective focusing on the socio-economic determinants of HIV infection. More discussion and policy debates should be supported and multi-sectoral engagement and collaboration revived. More sensitization of government officials at all levels on how HIV-related law and rights protections can promote a more efficient and effective HIV response is needed.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "552e6c57-ac63-4a96-8c21-1443f82783d7": {"__data__": {"id_": "552e6c57-ac63-4a96-8c21-1443f82783d7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-mainstreaming-environment-and-sustainable-development-projects", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender Mainstreaming in Environment and Sustainable Development Projects", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-mainstreaming-environment-and-sustainable-development-projects", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "994f8667a033fec78f77b85ada13e7a1262fe6190702ac0173946cf38eaf6d01"}, "3": {"node_id": "deb906ba-4213-4092-b897-808952a63bd4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-mainstreaming-environment-and-sustainable-development-projects", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "57cbd820e4bcf1e259a04cfe716c6af2606070f39873eae196c3b23275ff64b3"}}, "hash": "997dd31d464107f8d7d22256636930b6b26f8ca9f13cefb9ee39f6c08cdf6ae5", "text": "Gender Mainstreaming in Environment and Sustainable Development Projects A Perspective from the Asia-Pacific Region UNDP Bangkok Regional Hub (BRH) would like to acknowledge following for their valuable contribution in this publication.

Capturing the full story of gender equality in participation in training activities 29 3 Gender Mainstreaming in Environment and Sustainable Development Projects Foreword The United Nations Development Programme has been supporting environment, energy and climate change programmes in the Asia-Pacific region for more than two decades. As the UN\u2019s principle development agency, UNDP\u2019s support in these areas is vital. Development cannot proceed without a clear focus on the sustainable use and management of natural resources and the role that energy plays in that development. More recently, we have come to realize that decades of development gains are now being threatened by a changing climate. These changes are affecting everything from weather patterns to water supplies, agricultural productivity, sea levels and the frequency and intensity of storms, floods and other severe weather events. In 2013 alone, UNDP disbursed $132 million in grants to countries in the Asia-Pacific region to help better protect and manage the environment. Yet UNDP does not support environmental programming for the sake of the environment, but rather for the sake of those people in developing countries whose lives and livelihoods depend on a healthy environment. And while it might appear that many of these environmental sectors are dominated by men (forestry, fisheries and mining to name a few), the fact is that men and women, boys and girls, stand to benefit equally from a healthy environment, or to suffer equally when that environment become degraded. With this in mind, we have developed much more rigorous tools in recent years to measure how well our programming is taking into account the differentiated needs of women and men. We believe this not only lays out a path towards greater equality in the world, but also towards improved sustainability in our work. Unfortunately, a recent review of reporting in the Asia-Pacific region showed that we are still lagging behind in the gender dimensions of our environmental programming. While more of our projects are delivering sex-disaggregated data on participation in project activities (49% in 2014 vs with 34% in 2013), less than 1 in 6 of our environmental projects includes gender indicators in their performance reports (16% in 2014), and only 1 in 8 includes data on livelihoods, income or quality of life for men versus women (13% in 2014). We believe these problems in project reporting are partially due to weaknesses in project design. Therefore, based on the findings of this recent review, we have prepared these guidelines for UNDP staff on \u201cGender Mainstreaming in Environment and Sustainable Development Projects: A Perspective from the Asia-Pacific Region.\u201d Gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment are cross-cutting issues that require attention during the entire project cycle, from design to implementation to monitoring, evaluation and reporting. Gender equality is a core value of the United Nations Charter and a key area of focus for UNDP. Not only this, but we also believe that gender equality is a prerequisite for sustainable development. Only when women and men are equally empowered to manage the development process are those developments likely to be sustainable, resilient and durable. To that end, we trust these guidelines will assist UNDP staff to design better projects in the first place so that we can achieve better results in the end.

Understanding these differences and inequalities can help to identify specific needs and the realities faced by women and men, and target assistance accordingly. At the same time, the likelihood of success of a development programme or project is enhanced if the perspectives of a wide spectrum of society are taken into account. This is important as the participation of both women and men in the conceptualization, management and implementation of projects can significantly enhance the impact and effectiveness of a project. UNDP recognizes that communities and nations are more resilient and likely to achieve sustainable growth when both women and men are equally empowered and capable to contribute to development processes. For UNDP, addressing gender inequalities and reshaping policies to empower women and girls means that both women and men can become catalytic agents of change as equal partners in the quest to promote growth that is inclusive, just, equitable and sustainable (UNDP, 2014a). Gender mainstreaming is UNDP\u2019s main strategy to achieve gender equality, and therefore seeks new entry points and innovative approaches through its development interventions. Natural resources management projects often build on local practices and require local knowledge. Despite the fact that women play a vital role in the conservation, management and sustainable use of energy and environmental resources, their contribution is seldom recognized and often overlooked. As a recent UNDP report on biodiversity \u201c\u2026.Basic arithmetic tells us that if all members of society are equally empowered to contribute, the sum of their efforts will be far greater than if whole groups, like women, do not enjoy equal opportunity\u201d. Helen Clark, Speech to Women\u2019s International Forum, New York on 12 January 2015. Chapter 1. Introduction points out, women must be seen and heard when trying to implement an effective natural resource management policy (UNDP, 2014c). At the same time, gendered divisions in roles related to natural resources management hamper equal sharing of knowledge and skills among the entire population, and risk missing out on opportunities. In 2014, an initiative was launched to assess the gender impact of UNDP-implemented environment and sustainable development programmes and projects in the Asia-Pacific Region. This assessment included a review of the Project Implementation Reviews (PIRs) (for projects funded by the Global Environment Facility, GEF), Annual Progress Reports (APRs)1 (for all other projects), evaluation reports and interactions with project staff in selected countries. The focus of the review was on good practices and lessons learned in addressing gender in UNDP\u2019s environment and sustainable development projects.2 This publication, has been prepared on the basis of this work and following discussions with UNDP staff, which provides guidance on \u201chow to\u201d mainstream a gender perspective into the activities, both normative and operational, of the environment and sustainable development portfolio within UNDP. 1 The APR is a UNDP requirement which forms part of the Country Office\u2019s monitoring system and project management.

However, if it is not considered at this stage, there are still opportunities to integrate a gender perspective during later stages of the programme activities, including at the time of evaluation as this can feed into future designs of programmes. Mainstreaming gender considerations implies incorporating the following elements in the UNDP project cycle: (a) involvement of both women and men in constituents\u2019/beneficiaries\u2019 consultations and analysis; (b) the application of data disaggregated by sex and gender information in the background analysis and justification of projects; (c) the formulation of gender-sensitive objectives, strategies and gender-specific indicators; (d) outputs and activities consistent with these; (e) gender-responsive institutional structures set up under projects; and (f) including impact assessment on gender equality in the terms of reference for evaluations, and requiring inclusion of and gender expertise in evaluation teams. 1.1 Structure of these Guidelines In line with the UNDP project cycle, these Guidelines are divided into two parts: The first part, presents basic of gender equality, the second part (Practical Steps to Mainstreaming Gender through Programming) provides guidance on how to carry out gender mainstreaming in UNDP operations, and align it with the UNDP project cycle. Figure 1 presents each stage in the UNDP project cycle and the opportunities for specific gender actions, as well as the chapters in the Guidance Note where an explanation can be found.

Gender mainstreaming is a tool to ensure that this principle is central to everything the UNDP does, including in reporting. All UNDP initiatives are required to include specific measures to address gender inequalities accompanied by gender (and sex) disaggregated indicators. In addition, gender concerns need to be integrated at all stages of the programme/ project cycle, starting from the design phase. Hence, gender, as a cross- cutting theme applies to all projects, irrespective of their focus and specific activities. UNDP utilizes several institutional mechanisms to ensure gender mainstreaming, namely: the project appraisal process, in accordance with the UNDP Programme and Operational Policies and Procedures (POPP) guidance document Social and Environmental Screening Procedure (SESP); the gender marker tracking system on investments for gender equality results; and the Results Oriented Annual Report (ROAR), which includes a section on gender.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "94502a2c-5131-4e0e-953e-88d95485d44c": {"__data__": {"id_": "94502a2c-5131-4e0e-953e-88d95485d44c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-mainstreaming-environment-and-sustainable-development-projects", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender Mainstreaming in Environment and Sustainable Development Projects", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-mainstreaming-environment-and-sustainable-development-projects", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "837d646b449ee419d9afbbbc545723648f7c8afba8e4995e79901caf512f2f80"}, "2": {"node_id": "6e6614f7-78a8-4185-8801-aac4555a8671", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-mainstreaming-environment-and-sustainable-development-projects", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "51d0570466912c113b2c98570e679b6e901e82497d467234209141a9ccac740b"}}, "hash": "7aacdbec024ce832560cd004bb4c3900b37e9cc402eb5367613d94e4d58250ae", "text": "Further, in order to support its projects in the environment and sustainable development portfolio, a number of manuals/ toolkits/ factsheets, both generic and sector specific, have been produced and are available for use (see Box 1).

Steps also need to be taken to ensure that they do not suffer adverse effects during the development process, and that their dignity and human rights are respected (GEF, 2014). Accounting for gender equality is important when financing projects that address environmental issues. This is because gender can influence access and control over environmental resources. The objective involves attaining gender equality and gender mainstreaming should be integrated in all GEF operations. A focal point for gender (or other staff) should be appointed to support development, implementation, as well as to monitor aspects of socio-economic context, including gender. Box 1. Policy requirements on gender equality for GEF partner agencies 11 Gender Mainstreaming in Environment and Sustainable Development Projects The term gender is not the same as the term sex. Gender is a relational term that includes both women and men. It is used to describe socially determined differences between women and men, such as roles, attitudes, behaviour and values in a given context. Sex refers to the male and female biological differences. Sex roles are considered universal and inborn and do not change over time or across cultures. A gender issue is any issue or concern determined by gender-based and/or sex-based differences between women and men. Gender is not synonymous with women. Addressing gender issues involves addressing all aspects and concerns of how women and men interrelate, their differences in access to and use of resources, their activities, and how they react to changes, interventions and policies. Historically, because women are more disadvantaged than men in most societies, the majority of gender-related activities have focused on improving the lives of women. However, gender equality not only a women\u2019s issue, and both women and men must be involved to advance gender equality. Gender mainstreaming is not just about adding women: it means looking at women and men and the relationship between them\u2014both as actors in the process and as beneficiaries Gender equality and gender equity are not synonymous. Equality exists when both women and men are attributed equal social value, equal rights and equal responsibilities and have equal access to the means (resources, opportunities) to exercise them. Equality does not mean that women and men are the same or that they become identical, but rather that their similarities and differences are recognized and that their opportunities and their benefits become and remain equal. Gender equity refers to fairness and justice in the distribution of responsibilities and benefits between women and men. To ensure fairness, measures may be needed to compensate for the historical and social disadvantages that prevent women and men from operating on a level playing field. (Adapted from UNODC, 2013) The environment and sustainable development portfolio includes areas of natural resource management (chemicals, biodiversity, water management, etc.), energy and work on poverty and the urban environment. All these areas interface with communities and hence offer opportunities to contribute towards the achievement of gender equality. Box 2. Using the terms correctly 12 Gender Mainstreaming in Environment and Sustainable Development Projects Wearing a gender lens from the outset of a project will lead to inclusion of a gender perspective in the objectives, expected outcomes and activities of the project. Consulting with women and men in project communities provides pointers for planning and informs the project on how women and men perceive proposed their respective interventions. It also allows them to envisage their roles in the project, and provide inputs on any technological features they would like to see featured, and discuss ideas on what strategies might work (and not work) for involving women and men. It is therefore important to obtain detailed information on the gender context and challenges, and review the impact on gender of the planned programme prior to its use during programme development and resource mobilization. It is useful to have clear mandate to integrate gender and poverty aspects and more importantly, to ensure that the findings from gender and socio-economic assessments are used for project planning at an early stage of project justification, i.e. around the time when the socio-economic assessments are carried out. Chapter 3. Identification of gender issues/ strategizing (UNDP project stage: Justifying a project) There are a number of ways in which an understanding on gender issues can be built during the project justification stage.

Deciding what level and degree of analysis is appropriate in the given situation \u2014 and choosing an appropriate methodology \u2014 requires balancing resources against the need for in-depth results. The advice and insights of a gender expert at this stage will be helpful in making an appropriate decision. 3.1 Guidance for undertaking social impact assessments The first window of opportunity to examine gender issues during the planning stage is the application of the Social and Environmental Standards (SES)3 to which all UNDP Programmes and Projects must adhere to. Gender equality is one of three principles the SES articulates (see Box3). 3 http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/ corporate/Social-and-Environmental-Policies-and- Procedures/UNDPs-Social-and-Environmental-Standards- ENGLISH.pdf 9 Provide specific guidance on gender to consultants undertaking social impact assessments to include gender analysis 9 If needed, field quick one-time studies to illustrate specific gender issues relevant to the project 9 Share project concepts with gender experts for their inputs 13 Gender Mainstreaming in Environment and Sustainable Development Projects \ufffd The promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women are central to the mandate of UNDP and intrinsic to its human rights-based approach to development programming. This effort includes advocating for women\u2019s and girls\u2019 human rights, combating discriminatory practices, and challenging the roles and stereotypes that create inequalities and exclusion. \ufffd UNDP Programmes and Projects will be gender-responsive in their design and implementation. UNDP will seek to identify and integrate the different needs, constraints, contributions and priorities of women, men, girls and boys into its programming.15 \ufffd UNDP Programmes and Projects will promote gender equality and the empowerment of women. UNDP will seek to reduce gender inequalities in access to and control over resources and the benefits of development. Programmes and Projects will ensure that both women and men are able to participate meaningfully and equitably, have equitable access to Programme and Project resources, and receive comparable social and economic benefits. \ufffd UNDP will ensure that its Programmes and Projects do not discriminate against women or girls or reinforce gender-based discrimination and/or inequalities. (UNDP, Social and Environment Standards, 2015) Accordingly, the Social and Environmental Screening Procedure (SESP) is to be applied to help ensure that the requirements of the SES are accommodated. The SESP should be used iteratively as a design and appraisal tool from the earliest stages of Project preparation. Early screening is critical in identifying and integrating gender equality perspectives in projects. The SESP template includes the following question on gender: 4 4 UNDP Social Environmental Screening Procedure, 2015 Gender Equality and Women\u2019s Empowerment 4 Answer (Yes/No) 1. Is there a likelihood that the proposed Project would have adverse impacts on gender equality and/ or the situation of women and girls? 2. Would the Project potentially reproduce discriminations against women based on gender, especially regarding participation in design and implementation or access to opportunities and benefits? 3. Have women\u2019s groups/leaders raised gender equality concerns regarding the Project during the stakeholder engagement process and has this been included in the overall Project proposal and in the risk assessment? 4. Would the Project potentially limit women\u2019s ability to use, develop and protect natural resources, taking into account different roles and positions of women and men in accessing environmental goods and services? For example, activities that could lead to natural resources degradation or depletion in communities who depend on these resources for their livelihoods and well being Box 3. Social and Environmental Standards Principle 2: Gender Equality and Women Empowerment 14 Gender Mainstreaming in Environment and Sustainable Development Projects In completing the SESP template on gender, a key input is the social impact assessment, which is undertaken by consultants that have been hired for this purpose. As a general rule, all socio-economic surveys and data gathering exercises in the project should incorporate sex-disaggregated data. When undertaking a social impact assessment, the following parameters should be examined, and be specifically included in the reporting template: \ufffd Are women and men affected differently by the issues that the project is trying to address? And if so, how? \ufffd Do women and men (and social groups) have differing priorities? \ufffd What contributions will women and men be making towards the project goal? \ufffd Who has access to and control over resources?

In other words, what will it take to ensure that all the target beneficiaries are able to benefit fully from the project? The exact mix of gender issues to be covered in the assessment will, to a great extent, depend on the project objectives and scope. For example, a project that plans to train women and men in improved agricultural practices, needs to know which specific activities women and men are engaged in, what is the level of literacy and numeracy among women and men (this information is needed to design the curricula and training materials), and whether there are any potential negative impacts of planned project activities on either women or men. At the same time, it is useful to guide consultants to specific gender resources. 3.2 One-time quick gender assessments If a project is already underway or the SESP process is completed, it is still possible to undertake a rapid gender assessment and provide directional inputs on the positions held by women and men on the issues addressed by the project, as well as their developmental priorities. It is also possible to address any specific constraints/ bottlenecks that may prevent them from fully benefiting from the project, and what strategies are needed to harness their strengths and opportunities. In 2011, a rapid gender assessment (RGA) was undertaken in the context of the NAPA project5 on \u201cReducing vulnerability of Cambodia\u2019s agricultural sector to climate-induced changes in water resources availability\u201d as the project was well underway. A vulnerability reduction assessment (VRA) that had previously been carried out did not investigate several pertinent gender issues within the target groups. The RGA yielded the following information, which was used to shape the future project strategy (ETC Foundation, 2012): \ufffd Because women are responsible for domestic work, such as cooking, animal husbandry, vegetable gardening and collection of water for household purposes, they are disproportionally affected by the impacts of natural disasters. Women reported a lack of or limited access to information on natural hazards, while men were better informed. \ufffd In Farmer Water User Committees (FWUC), most men, as heads of households, reported participation. On the other hand, none of the women interviewed participated in the FWUC. \ufffd Drinking water collection is a serious problem and women, as water carriers, find this task especially challenging during the dry season. Based on these findings, interventions were introduced that specifically dealt with the issue of drinking water (even though the primary focus of the project was on water for agricultural purposes) including water harvesting structures, and training of effective use of water. 5 Promoting Climate Resilient Water Resource Management and Agricultural Practices in Rural Cambodia (NAPA follow- up) UNDP Mongolia 15 Gender Mainstreaming in Environment and Sustainable Development Projects 3.3 Broaden consultations to include gender experts A simple way to get inputs in this area, even to plan an assessment, is to make use of any gender expertise that may exist within the organization. During the planning stage, it is advised to: \ufffd Consult individuals with knowledge of gender issues in specific thematic areas, such as gender in the energy context, gender in the climate change adaptation context, etc. Others (local civil society organizations, national/local government machineries for gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment) can also provide an overall understanding on the issues that affect women and men in the region. \ufffd Consider involving an individual with specific knowledge of gender issues to review the concept note and provide ideas from a gender perspective. \ufffd Consider assessment teams that include a gender expert or assign a person on the team to be the Gender Focal Point, with clear terms of reference. 3.4 Using gender data to inform programming When sex-disaggregated data and information are collected, it is also important for staff to know how to use the data and information collected. The issues that have identified are only useful if they inform programming. For example, gender analysis might reveal that, in one region, women continue with their roles of caregivers and housekeepers, even when employed outside the home, and also that they need to get the consent of male family members when going out. These findings are useful only when the programmatic implications are made clear: Women\u2019s caregiving role and limited mobility means that they may have limitations in attending training programmes, especially when organized far off from their homes. Hence, training centres and other activities have to be provided closer home when training women (UNODC, 2013). Women will also face difficulties if the timing of these activities interfere with their gender roles.

In the NAPA project, the rapid gender assessment revealed that radio is by far the most preferred media tool because of its affordability and the range of information than can be broadcasted to most farmers. Radio broadcasts are considered useful and informative by both women and men. It was also revealed that when going to rice fields in the mornings, most men carry the radios with them. In terms of project strategy, this meant that if radios are used as the main information channel for sending early warning systems in the event of an extreme weather condition, women are likely to receive information later than men. For this reason, alternative communication channels have to be envisaged. Based on own analysis, a UNDP project to strengthen the resilience of the agriculture sector in Lao PDR acknowledged from its inception stage that women were not participating in decision-making despite their role in marketing of agricultural products and livestock production as well as ensuring their families\u2019 food security. The project subsequently acted on the identified need for specific measures to increase the engagement of women in decision-making related to agriculture production and productivity, as well as in equitable benefit-sharing form such decisions. Collection of sex-disaggregated data, inclusion of gender-specific targets and indicators in the Results & Resources Framework, tracking gender balance in activities as well as general gender equality awareness raising and gender mainstreaming skills development for project staff and beneficiaries were prioritized and vigorously pursued. One concrete result of those actions was the provision of water harvesting weirs to 214 households in the two target provinces. This intervention followed the recognition of women\u2019s role to fetch water and the fact that they had to travel long hours for the water, as pointed out by women themselves. Figure 2.

Building on gender analysis Gender disaggregated data (statistics, interview results) Analysis (what dose the data mean: causes and consequences of the differenc/gender gap) Action (what actions are needed to correct the imbalance) 16 Gender Mainstreaming in Environment and Sustainable Development Projects Project formulation builds on the work undertaken during the project justification stage and involves the development of a complete programme/project document. Once issues have been examined with an appreciation of the different implications for women and men, designing gender-sensitive objectives, outcomes and outputs is relatively straightforward. Specific suggestions in this regard are as follows: 4.1 Highlight gender issues in discussions with stakeholders during the formulation stage \ufffd The starting point for addressing gender issues in project formulation is to build an understanding and appreciation for these issues. This can be done by raising such issues during discussions on scoping, project design and formulation missions; this would build awareness of partners on potential gender issues and its implications for the project. For example, discussion points for a biomass energy/ cook stoves project could include: o The potential of including village level artisans (women and men) in cook stoves businesses; o Overall gender inequality in society which affects women\u2019s ability to participate in, and benefit from, biomass energy programmes (e.g. women\u2019s illiteracy, lack of information and training; poverty; lack of resources including land rights, especially among women-headed households); o Different roles of women and men in collection, processing and use of biomass fuels for cooking and heating; o The level and context of reliance of women and men on biomass fuels in operating small and micro-scale industries; and o The potential role that women can play in the distribution of cooking stoves. \ufffd Involve, where possible, government agencies/ ministries/focal persons who work on gender issues from the start (i.e. during the scoping mission discussions). \ufffd Ensure that projects are aligned to gender- related commitments made by UNDP, GEF and national governments. \ufffd Emphasize that project committees should include women and men and this should be mentioned explicitly in the ToRs so that both the project partners and the consultants should be aware of and agree.

The starting point for including a gendered situation analysis is \u201chow does the core problem (which the project is trying to address) affect women and men respectively, and in relation to each other and how will women and men be able to contribute to addressing the core problem\u201d. For example, in the context of a project that aims to mitigate the impacts of climate change on water, the situation analysis should include information on: \ufffd What specific tasks do women and men perform in water management in agriculture, drinking water and for other purposes in homes? \ufffd Do women and men experience hardships differently from water shortages and hence are forced to cope differently (for example, women may be responsible for managing cattle which becomes increasingly difficult when water is scarce, while men may be responsible for land irrigation)? \ufffd Is it possible for women and men to equally contribute to project-related decision-making processes? \ufffd Is there a difference between the ability and opportunity of women and men to benefit from project activities? For example, are women and men educated to the same level? Do they have similar mobility? Are women and men likely to be able to equally participate in project meetings and training events and benefit from them? \ufffd Are there any potential impacts of the project activity to reinforce gender stereotypes and to perpetuate gender inequality? 4.2.2 Project rationale and policy conformity When identifying the problem, it is necessary to underline what the different implications of a given project are for women and men, as obtained from the situation analysis. The justification section will contain arguments for gender mainstreaming and gender equality, and it will be necessary to highlight contexts where underrepresented women will contribute towards the core objectives of the project. For example, in a land and water conservation project, the existence of local women\u2019s groups provides an opportunity to work through them, potentially leading to greater project effectiveness. There may also be an existing women\u2019s farmers groups that can be involved. The Indonesia \u201cStrengthening Community-Based Forest and Watershed Management\u201d project, for example, engaged women-led community-based organizations (CBOs) and other groups of women to take the lead in a number of core project interventions, such as forest and nurseries to rehabilitate forest and land degradation; collection and marketing of non-timber forest products (NTFP); agricultural products processing; and animal husbandry. This undoubtedly benefitted the women and also provided a viable vehicle for community- level implementation. Similarly, in the context of climate change and water, the rationale may contain the justification that women are primarily affected by water shortages, and hence need to be specifically targeted. Most countries have a clear framework and goals towards gender equality, articulated through national policy statements. It is useful to establish a clear link with project strategy, national gender equality policies and UNDP mandates for gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. Grounding a gender activity in national policy gives it legitimacy and often provides a much needed impetus for engaging national level partners in the activity. 4.2.3 Setting project objective, outcomes and outputs The formulation of the objectives provides an opportunity to describe how the project will make a direct or indirect contribution towards improving gender equality. The objective explains the expected impacts of the programme/project, how it will affect the current situation, contribute to one or more aspect of UNDP\u2019s mandate and defines the substantial benefits for the target group. In describing expected results, ask how gender equality will be increased and be reflected as an outcome. In stating the objectives, outline what changes the project will bring about for women and men and describe the target groups in terms of gender. Some of the key questions to consider when mainstreaming gender in the formulation of objectives and outcomes include: 18 Gender Mainstreaming in Environment and Sustainable Development Projects \ufffd Does the project goal/objective need to have a gender dimension? \ufffd Does the objective address the needs and concerns of both women and men? \ufffd In what ways can it contribute to the overall goal of gender equality? \ufffd Will this objective bring about improvements for women as well as men? \ufffd Who participated", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f87fbcb3-b17b-4f73-ab23-fedf2d97fc9e": {"__data__": {"id_": "f87fbcb3-b17b-4f73-ab23-fedf2d97fc9e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-mainstreaming-environment-and-sustainable-development-projects", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender Mainstreaming in Environment and Sustainable Development Projects", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-mainstreaming-environment-and-sustainable-development-projects", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "acfc639a4b28d2ca617dff8a23188bd97294907248db58c3691a8278995cb31c"}}, "hash": "acfc639a4b28d2ca617dff8a23188bd97294907248db58c3691a8278995cb31c", "text": "in choosing the objectives from the variety of needs to be addressed? The gender balance within the target beneficiary group will need to be checked as there may be projects which specifically target men or women in order to enhance gender equality. If this is the case, it should be clearly explained. 4.2.4 Formulating activities Some of the key questions to consider when mainstreaming gender in the formulation of activities include: \ufffd How do women and men benefit from project activities? \ufffd What contribution will women and men make to the project? \ufffd What will be the participation of women and men? Are the activities appropriate to the involvement of both women and men? \ufffd How and to what extent can the activity address social and historical disparities between women and men? \ufffd Are any additional activities needed (e.g. training in gender issues, additional research, etc.)? \ufffd Is the planning flexible enough to provide for the possibility of new activities in response to women\u2019s and men\u2019s constraints as they emerge? \ufffd If equal participation of women and men is culturally or politically problematic, what measures will the project propose to contribute to transformative changes? Some examples of possible gender responsive activities in UNDP\u2019s environment and sustainable development projects are presented below: Gender responsive activities in disaster risk reduction (ICIMOD, 2007) \u2022\ufffd Identify and target the most vulnerable, such as the informal sector or home-based workers, in livelihood enhancement activities. \u2022\ufffd Target highly disadvantaged categories of women, e.g. widows, women living below the poverty line and unemployed women. \u2022\ufffd Capitalize on local knowledge of women and men, e.g. among the most vulnerable members of a particular community, or some of the coping strategies that were used in past disasters). \u2022\ufffd Ensure the provision of safe shelters and housing, including adequate lighting and provisions to protect security and privacy of women and girls in shelters and housing. \u2022\ufffd Restoration of pre-school and child-care centres, schools and community education programmes supporting women, girls, men and boys. Gender responsive activities in setting up urban water supply systems \u2022\ufffd Include gender considerations in design, siting and maintenance of facilities. \u2022\ufffd Provide for privacy needs, security and safety considerations, in particular of women and girls. \u2022\ufffd Ensure gender-equal committees. Consider stipulating a mandatory ratio of women/men in executive committees to ensure their representation. \u2022\ufffd In construction work, ensure comfortable work conditions for women and men (e.g. gender-equal wage rates, separate toilets for women and men, and child-care facilities). \u2022\ufffd In training, include community hygiene education and sanitation. \u2022\ufffd Train and involve women where they are underrepresented in O&M, financial and organizational management. Example of good practice in Cambodia: Ensuring that women have better access to water resources for household use (Gender- focused activities in NAPA) \u2022\ufffd Training of women and men on water use and recycling. 19 Gender Mainstreaming in Environment and Sustainable Development Projects \u2022\ufffd New project target of \u201c50 percent of women in farmer water user groups receive trainings on irrigation system\u2019s maintenance, management and utilization\u201d. \u2022\ufffd New technical measures on drinking water: Wind, solar and wind pumps. \u2022\ufffd Farmer user groups (women and men) for drinking water resources: community ponds; community wells; rain water harvesting tanks. 4.2.5 Project results framework The UNDP project results framework captures a detailed description of the results to be achieved by the end of the project in tabular form. The table contains the baseline at the start of the project; indicators to measure progress; annualized target to be achieved at the end of a year; and annualized achievement report against the target. The two main steps in monitoring results on gender equality involve: \ufffd Developing indicators and targets, as part of the project document; and \ufffd Tracking performance through data collection, analysis and reporting. This section deals with the first element, integrating gender in the results framework. A central element of the results framework is setting indicators: performance indicators should be formulated in a manner that is gender-sensitive in order to be able to measure the changes for both women and men, as well as determine how successful the programme was in improving gender equality. Some tips for gender-sensitive indicators are as follows: \ufffd Include at least one gender indicator at the outcome level. \ufffd At the same time, keep gender indicators and targets to a limited number so as not to overload the project, while ensuring that they will reflect meaningful results on gender equality. \ufffd When identifying gender indicators, pay attention to how to verify these. \ufffd Disaggregate data by sex, where relevant. The first and simplest approach is to disaggregate participation data by", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bfdbcde6-22de-488b-8f5b-827eb9001a39": {"__data__": {"id_": "bfdbcde6-22de-488b-8f5b-827eb9001a39", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-mainstreaming-environment-and-sustainable-development-projects", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender Mainstreaming in Environment and Sustainable Development Projects", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-mainstreaming-environment-and-sustainable-development-projects", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "026f3c7c8da472016ad3dbacee909eb427395648a3dda2a1f408711001ba55f4"}, "3": {"node_id": "22d04335-5502-49d2-b08b-391dd48810c3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-mainstreaming-environment-and-sustainable-development-projects", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bcf406723012ff069997b00707906619170243f771c3ac6e95e10a31537419d1"}}, "hash": "27c9e006dafa5a5cdc3dd4bf43ab390c69126f36c63ce80cf9b9d0ecab9a75fd", "text": "sex (number of women and men attending a training programme/ a meeting, for example). However, sex disaggregated data (for example, ratio of women\u2019s and men\u2019s attendance at a meeting) alone are insufficient indicators for gender equality. The \u2018story behind\u2019 that explains the reason for the difference in women\u2019s and men\u2019s participation and what the project has done to correct the imbalance needs to be reported as well (see Box 5). \ufffd Go beyond participation. Ensure that at least some indicators capture developmental results of the project on women and men, e.g. income/ productivity gains for women and men resulting from the project activities; improved access to and reliability of infrastructure services, such as energy, drinking water etc.; improved school enrolments; improved health etc. Achieving higher participation of an underrepresented or disadvantaged sex in a given activity (training course, discussion of a new policy, etc.) is always desirable. Nonetheless, a project is not necessarily gender-responsive or contributing to gender equality just because a high rate of women has taken part in its activities. Example: A 40 percent rate of female participation in a \u201cStart Your Business\u201d training course does not necessarily imply that the course is tailored to the needs of women, and that women and men have benefited equally from it, nor that the participating women and men will be equally likely and successful in creating an enterprise and generating an income. UNDP India (Nagaland) Box 5. Going beyond participation 20 Gender Mainstreaming in Environment and Sustainable Development Projects \ufffd Include indicators that capture developmental impacts and spin-off effects. Working with women often results in multiplier effects. Research has shown that women tend to spend a sizeable proportion of their earned income on improving the health, education and wellbeing of their families, thereby bringing about long- term intergenerational impacts. In addition, the review of UNDP\u2019s 2013 & 2014 PIRs, APRs and evaluations reports revealed that other development impacts, such as improved gender relations, recognition of women\u2019s role and capability in managing natural resources, and the disadvantaged having their voices heard, are documented in an anecdotal manner. In general, areas that would be worthwhile to systemically capture in reporting include: \ufffd The number of representatives from among women and disadvantaged groups that are: o Participating in project activities, such as training programmes; o Contributing resources in terms of labour or cash, etc.; o Participating in decisions on the use of community facilities, such as water and sanitation site selection and construction; o Represented in community bodies and in decision-making on the project \ufffd Quantifiable increase in incomes for women and representatives of disadvantaged communities. \ufffd Other benefits, such as reduced workload, more time available for self-improvement and leisure. Indonesia\u2019s \u201cStrengthening Community-based Forest and Watershed Management (CBFWM)\u201d Project includes a clear outcome level indicator (indicator 1.3), supported by targets: \u201cIn six critical watersheds, the proportion of (a) women and (b) the landless involved in community groups has increased from 8 percent and 4 percent, respectively, to at least 30 percent and 25 percent, respectively\u201d. On this indicator, the 2013 PIR reported progress on both gender and social inclusion: \u201cThe project involved 14 women\u2019s groups and the proportion of women in CBOs increased from 17 percent in 2012 to 22 percent in 2013. This group also participates actively in project activities, such as trainings, meetings and accessing small grants for piloting CBFWM model at sites. Their participation is about 30 percent of the total participants. Furthermore, the project involved 498 farm workers who do not have land (15 percent of CBO members are landless)\u201d. Box 6.

Especially in projects which have a significant gender dimension, it is useful to ensure that: (a) gender knowledge and experience is a criterion for selecting project staff; (b) project staff are briefed adequately on relevant gender issues and be provided training on gender mainstreaming by gender experts; (c) ensuring results on gender equality is assigned as a specific responsibility (this \ufffd Impact: Improved health, education, family welfare and environmental protection. \ufffd Project sustainability: Cost recovery, breakdown rates, cleanliness of facilities, number of user groups/members (by gender), and number of meetings held and participation of women and men. For guidance, two sets of outcome indicators are presented in the table below: could be ensured by hiring a gender expert for the project, or by integrating gender mainstreaming responsibility into the job descriptions of key project staff, or by assigning a gender focal point for the project); (d) and ensuring gender parity of the staff members. In case there is no gender expertise within the team, consider engaging a short-term consultant to provide inputs at this stage. 22 Gender Mainstreaming in Environment and Sustainable Development Projects 4.3 Assign the gender marker The gender marker was launched in 2009 in UNDP for the purpose of strengthening the institutional accountability for delivering gender equality results. The gender marker enables UNDP to track and monitor how gender-responsive each financial allocation and expenditure is. It also enables UNDP to analyze trends by region, outcome and focus area. The gender marker is also a platform for continued dialogue amongst UNDP staff including gender experts on why gender matters and how UNDP can make transformative changes in this regard. All UNDP-implemented projects have to be rated against a four-point scale indicating their respective contribution towards the achievement of gender equality. A score of 3 indicates that the project\u2019s principle objective is the advancement of gender equality and/or empowerment of women and girls. A score of 2 indicates that the project is making significant contribution towards gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment.

In each of these, actions are undertaken in areas of community-based actions, policies and legislation, research/documentation. Good practices in addressing gender drawn from project experiences within the environment and sustainable development portfolio of UNDP in the Asia-Pacific region are documented in a separate document, \u201cGender mainstreaming in UNDP\u2019s environment and sustainable development projects, A compendium of good practices and lessons learned\u201d. Chapter 5. Implementing a project (Operations and monitoring) (UNDP project stage: Implementing a project) Tips for integrating gender in environment and sustainable development portfolio: 9 Look for the knowledge of both women and men to build on, e.g. knowledge of forests, other natural resources and biodiversity in neighbourhoods. 9 Be conscious of and address gender-specific needs of women and men (e.g. differences in energy needs). 9 Be attentive to those experiencing social exclusion (widows, female heads of households, men and women with disabilities, LGBTs, and those from socially marginalized groups). 9 Provide continued mentoring (more than technical skills, leadership/ management). 9 Build flexibility into programmes for women and men in order to allow them to fully and equally participate in project activities. 5.1.1 Introduce work on gender mainstreaming early on Even if specific gender-focused activities may not be envisaged at the design stage, including a framework for gender work early on allows for making budgetary provisions for specific activities that may be undertaken later. Inclusion at design stage also sets the necessary framework, and makes it possible for staff with training in gender analysis and other necessary skills to be hired in order to mainstream gender in the project. It also helps to ensure that all working procedures (planning documents, budgets, reporting) are engendered well before implementation. Projects such as the Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) in Cambodia was able to incorporate gender aspects in the TORs for service providers, which subsequently led all project activities. 5.1.2 Build strategic linkages In rural areas, especially remote areas, women are relatively less visible, and for this reason, projects find it difficult to engage with them. Extension workers mostly interact with men who go out to public places. It is a good practice to forge contacts with 24 Gender Mainstreaming in Environment and Sustainable Development Projects other partners with relevant skills, expertise and have worked with women. In Bhutan, the SRBE was able to jumpstart the process of \u2018seeking out\u2019 women as stove manufacturers by connecting with BOWEA, which has a deep reach in rural and remote areas and the necessary networks to engage with women. All projects reviewed also engaged with the government, and involved them in training programmes and other activities, which helps achieve buy-in, but also ensures the sustainability of efforts after a project is completed. 5.1.3 Embed interventions and processes within national processes The national and subnational governments need to be fully engaged in the process, in capacity building and in the project decision-making process in order to take it forward as their own. It is equally important to ensure that gender actions get embedded in the national planning processes. In this regard, one example of good practice is the Indonesian SCBFWM project in which gender action plans developed under the UNDP project were integrated within the local watershed plans of four provinces. 5.1.4 Build on different knowledge of women and men resulting from their different responsibilities in natural resources management In developing countries, especially in rural areas, women and men rely heavily on their natural environment for their livelihoods and food security, while at the same time, nurturing and protecting it. Women and men may have developed different sets of knowledge of the environment in which they work and live in according to their respective roles in managing them. In both Nagaland in India and in Cambodia, women were traditionally involved in shifting cultivation and in traditional cookstoves. The Sustainable Land and Ecosystem Management in Nagaland India and Sustainable Forest Management (SFM), Cambodia projects saw these as opportunities and worked towards strengthening these roles, providing inputs on technology, improved practices, knowledge and leadership skills. However, care must be taken to avoid reinforcing gender stereotypes, which may in turn adversely influence women\u2019s or men\u2019s access to opportunities. 5.1.5 Be responsive to specific constraints and challenges faced by women In", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b303c68f-e87c-499f-a6e1-ea8114641ac6": {"__data__": {"id_": "b303c68f-e87c-499f-a6e1-ea8114641ac6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-mainstreaming-environment-and-sustainable-development-projects", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender Mainstreaming in Environment and Sustainable Development Projects", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-mainstreaming-environment-and-sustainable-development-projects", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "be8d789fa546dc878ceec6993e6dbbcebc2e737535ef3638525100bf964eed99"}, "3": {"node_id": "aba67083-5973-41f7-85a9-e7917c9d7758", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-mainstreaming-environment-and-sustainable-development-projects", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1f08962407a94265f38c0c75791fd3c1000cfae77c6bd6cdc8fd09b415fc61bc"}}, "hash": "35ff7ac57581e05667dba82ee67f53db53ceb4f261f32d34d7093b701f646018", "text": "developing countries and especially in rural areas, women are engaged in a large number of subsistence tasks, including fetching fuel, fodder and water for homes and engaging in micro-enterprises. With climate change and concomitant natural resource degradation, the burden of depleting energy sources falls disproportionately on women. Implications are far-ranging, starting from the inordinate amount of time and effort spent on these tasks and the missed opportunities for employment, education and self- improvement that follow from this. Interventions that seek to engage women must take these factors into consideration and include strategies that address these issues. A case in point is women\u2019s participation in training programmes, which is often limited because of their multiple responsibilities, lack of time and limited mobility. Some practices that have worked while conducting training for women include: Training venue and time \u2022\ufffd Located to where participants live and scheduled at times when they are free from their household chores. \u2022\ufffd A location that is easy to reach and socially acceptable by all.

In UNDP, monitoring of results is reflected in the PIRs and the APRs at the project level and in the ROARs at the country level. Evaluation, on the other hand, occurs periodically, usually at mid-term (MTE) and at the end of the project: Terminal Evaluation (TE). Broad themes for enquiry during monitoring include: \ufffd What is the overall progress of the implementation of activities? \ufffd What constraints are faced in the implementation of the programme? What are the faced by constraints women and men? How can these be removed? \ufffd Is there a need for additional activities? What is the need among women and men? \ufffd Do the participants actually benefit from the activities? Do all groups of women and men participate and benefit equally? How can differences be explained? Is there anything that can be done to ensure that benefits are distributed more equitably? \ufffd What is the project\u2019s contribution towards improving gender equality? 5.2.1 Approaches to data collection The lack of gender-disaggregated data is one of the major barriers to planning, and indeed to establishing credibility of gender equality results. Gender- disaggregated data can be collected using both quantitative and qualitative methods, and is easily collected through surveys; it can also be collected using key informant interviews, focus group interviews, and one-on-one in-depth interviews.

Targeted baselines: A common bottleneck reported by projects is that baseline surveys are conducted right at the beginning of the project, and do not necessarily capture gender disaggregated data on incomes which can subsequently be used for monitoring post- project changes. One of the strategies to address this is to create an interim/targeted baseline, which involves collecting income and expenditure data specifically for the set of women and men that will be participating in training and other project activities. This can be done through a short, to-the-point questionnaire administered with all participating women and men at the beginning of the training event. In addition to providing a baseline on incomes, expenditures, and assets of women, this can also be used as a method for registering interested women and men with a view to screening them for future participation. b. Empowerment diaries. When women earn an income, multiple development benefits are observed, such as diversification of productive options for the family, creation of new sources of wealth and income to support family investments in education and health. Resources controlled by women tend to be invested more heavily in children (at the margin) than resources controlled by men (World Bank, 2001: 70). One way of capturing such outcomes is empowerment diaries. The method is simple: a sample of women who are participants in a project activity that is expected to enhance incomes/strengthen livelihoods are asked to maintain a simple diary, in which they record all major expenditures they make as well as investments/assets purchased. The definition of \u201cmajor investment\u201d may be different for each participating woman, and hence an element of flexibility in monitoring this data is required. The number of such entries in a month may be as few as 5-6, but the pattern of expenditure is likely to reveal what women spend on once they have control over funds and a pattern of enhanced investments in empowerment, health and education. The data is qualitative in nature and can narrate stories of women\u2019s empowerment. c. Capturing changing perceptions of women and men about gender equality. As the project progresses, there may be transformative changes in gender relations in the target communities. It would be useful to capture changing perceptions of women and men through group discussions or video diaries. 5.2.2 Collecting gender-sensitive data in the field An equally important aspect of data collection is how it is collected. An awareness of local cultures and sensibilities is needed when collecting data in communities. This needs to be highlighted to consultants and project developers when carrying out interactions. When designing collection of monitoring data for any project, consider the following: \ufffd Analyzing any issue should include the impact on women and men. \ufffd Collect sex-disaggregated data, where relevant. Sex-disaggregated data: data that is broken down by sex. Gender-disaggregated data: data, that in addition to being broken down by sex, is also produced taking into consideration the different socio-economic realities women and men face. So the types of data being collected or how data questions are formulated consider existing gender concerns and differentials. For example, the number of women headed households and men headed households adopting solar home systems is sex- disaggregated data. When this is accompanied with data that represents why this is so, for example, with data on income levels and asset ownership of women headed households and men headed households, their access to information, it would be gender disaggregated. Data that throws light on the barriers and constraints to women and men participating and benefiting equally from the programme/project is gender disaggregated. Box 8 Difference between \u201csex-disaggregated\u201d data and \u201cgender-disaggregated\u201d data 27 Gender Mainstreaming in Environment and Sustainable Development Projects \ufffd Use participatory techniques that involve both women and men in assessments and discussions. \ufffd Ensure staff is properly trained and briefed on data collection and analysis techniques. Ask if there is someone in the team with the necessary expertise. If not, where can it be obtained? What kind of capacity building is needed? Can the regional gender specialist or gender focal point help? \ufffd Ensure that sampling is representative. Surveys often under-represent women. For example, when household surveys are used, the \u201chousehold head\u201d \u2013 usually defined as a male \u2013 is often the only source of information. \ufffd Obtaining information from both women and men may increase the cost and time of data collection. This needs to be considered but is often neglected during the planning and budgeting of the M&E exercise. 5.3 Monitoring progress at institutional level At the institutional level, the following indicators", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e05c01a5-7b4d-40cd-8787-2898d857a400": {"__data__": {"id_": "e05c01a5-7b4d-40cd-8787-2898d857a400", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-mainstreaming-environment-and-sustainable-development-projects", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender Mainstreaming in Environment and Sustainable Development Projects", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-mainstreaming-environment-and-sustainable-development-projects", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2138873838e06ebdc9263df2804209da8d7c30bd5d78fdd5b9505aca54b380bd"}, "3": {"node_id": "f2642553-0c42-408e-bd56-54fb7442d27d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-mainstreaming-environment-and-sustainable-development-projects", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "481a716df0b1d250d15d85863e825dfbe8b40364b2987c7cfb7b8c53136e1361"}}, "hash": "d17245e5bba9e02018b99fc84f4c514a4cc5e64f26efba5a5650df9b5b7d9c49", "text": "that can help track performance on gender: \ufffd Number of projects where the SESP ensures the involvement of both women and men in constituents/beneficiaries consultations and reports specifically on the issue. \ufffd Number of project documents that highlight/ recognize the gender dimension, as part of the justification and background. \ufffd Number of project documents that identify women and men as distinct target groups and include a goal that reflect their needs. \ufffd Number of project documents that include specific measures to ensure that both women and men are included and participate in project planning and implementation. \ufffd Number of projects whose results frameworks include gender sensitive indicators and targets on: (a) participation in project activities disaggregated by sex; (b) benefits accruing to women and men; and (c) progress towards gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. \ufffd Number of progress reports reporting gender disaggregated data on processes and results. \ufffd Number of projects with communication products reflecting the perspective of both women and men. \ufffd Number of projects with the contribution towards gender equality explicitly measured as part of the project\u2019s M&E framework. \ufffd Ensure that the field teams are gender-balanced so that female fieldworkers can work with women, who may not interact freely with men community mobilisers.

The 2014-2017 Gender Equality Strategy emphasizes that in the light of the pivotal importance of gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment: \u201csustainable human development will not be fully achieved unless women and girls are able to contribute on an equal basis with men and boys to their societies\u201d. In this context, gender mainstreaming is a tool to 6 The APR is a UNDP requirement which forms a part of the Country Office\u2019s monitoring system and project management. There is no stipulated template for APRs. ensure that this is centralized in everything the UNDP does, including in reporting. 6.2 Incorporating gender dimensions and results into reporting Reporting in general should ensure that any data on participation is disaggregated by sex and more. In practice, this means that not just the number of male/female participants is reported but that this is substantiated with supporting information such as: age, social status, presence of intersecting forms of discrimination, participation in decision-making, as well as whether there were any barriers to meaningful participation for any group and if so, whether any strategies were employed to address this. Below are five critical areas for reporting on gender and other questions to ask during reporting: Table 2 Five Critical Areas for Reporting on Gender Critical Areas What to report on Issue analysis: Data on and analysis of gender issues in background analysis and rationale of the project \ufffd Are women/men/social groups affected differently by the issue? \ufffd Do women/men/ social groups have different priorities? \ufffd Who has access and control over resources?

However, simply reporting that x number of women or men were in attendance does not provide a proper account of whether or not their participation was meaningful. Unless quantitative representations of sex-disaggregated data on participation is substantiated with further, qualitative details, it can prove to be meaningless. The reason the data must be collected on separate groups should also be made clear in reporting, including investigation into context-specific social relationships. In order to obtain more meaningful data the following questions need to be answered: What has been the level of participation of all groups? Are the activities appropriate and inclusive? Have the groups benefitted equally? Who attended and what did they learn? How was it used? Figure 3. Capturing the full story of gender equality in participation in training activities This is particularly important because upon closer inspection, there may be tacit barriers that prevent disadvantaged groups from participating in a meaningful way. For example, if women have a lower social status in a community, they may feel uncomfortable about undertaking training alongside men. This may also prevent them from asking questions or voicing their opinion. Knowledge about these kinds of barriers can be difficult to ascertain unless a deeper level of gender analysis is undertaken which explores the social dimensions of a project context. A good practice example is seen in the 2014 PIR for the Cambodia\u2019s Community-Based Adaptation Programme, which reported that \u201c276 climate change awareness-raising and natural resources management (NRM) meetings/workshops had been conducted with 37,075 people, including 27,253 women\u201d.7 The report then goes on to relay plans for substantiating this data in a meaningful way by stating that a \u2018mini-survey\u2019 is planned to assess the level of understanding that beneficiaries have regarding the project. 7 UNDP, 2013.

In such cases, reporting should include information on \u2018inputs\u2019 directed at women, as well as the results or \u2018outcomes\u2019. For example, it is important to report that strategies have been implemented to help female entrepreneurs in a poor community to strengthen their livelihoods while simultaneously ensuring that negative impact on the environment is limited. However, a more meaningful account will include such aspects as whether there was an impact on income, new livelihood options, skills acquisition, assets and control over assets. Research has shown that women tend to spend much of their earned income on improving the health, education and wellbeing of their families and children, thereby bringing about long-term intergenerational impacts. Hence, how women use their incomes is a useful piece of data to collect and report on. A good example of reporting on this can be found in the 2014 PIR for the project on \u2018Strengthening sustainable forest management and the develop- ment of bio-energy markets to promote environ- mental sustainability and reduce rural poverty and CO2 emissions in Cambodia\u2019. This project aims to: \u201c\u2026assist in removing the main barriers of land and forest degradation by integrating and mainstreaming community-based forest and protected area management into policy, planning and investment frameworks, participatory land-use planning (accompanied by forestland demarcation), speeding up the legal recognition and registration of community forests and protected areas managed by communities, \ufffd Reporting should be very specific. Generalized statements which may articulate a commitment to gender sensitivity are not meaningful unless substantiated. Groups should be referred to specifically by name. Reporting needs to be clear, specific and detailed enough to give insight into the unique social landscape of the project. \ufffd When reporting results, it should be made clear what the implications of these results are. If participation of women who were underrepresented otherwise in project committees or training has improved, this is positive.

Mrs. Yim Dim, aged 43 years and a mother of 4 children, lived in Chhoam Sangke village, Phnom Srouch district, Kampong Speu province. She has been engaged in the collection of bamboo in the CF when CF committee has been recently allowed to collect bamboo within CF as part of piloting their CF business plan implementation. Not only does the above example of reporting provide quantitative income figures, it also substantiated these figures with qualitative information describing the livelihood practice and the impact that it has had on the lives of Mrs. Dim and her family. Box 10 Things to remember when reporting 31 Gender Mainstreaming in Environment and Sustainable Development Projects 6.2.3 Institutional structures Reporting on the meaningful participation of disadvantaged groups including women in decision- making bodies on a project and community level is important. There are two key areas in which reporting can be done and these are: (a) representation in project governance structures; and (b) representation in community-based governance structures. Engaging both women and men in decision-making not only ensures that there is more equitable representation and may also help to encourage a sense of ownership over a project for those involved. Projects do better when communities as a whole are not only participating and benefiting but are also committed and engaged in making sure it is a success. Because of this, the degree to which a project is facilitating participation is crucial for reporting (Box 9). 6.3 Reporting specific to GEF projects In 2008, the GEF conducted its first comprehensive review of gender mainstreaming within GEF projects. One of the direct results of this review was that project templates and review criteria were revised to take greater account of gender dimensions. GEF project templates now describe the socio-economic benefits and gender dimensions that are to be delivered within a project and how this will support overarching global environment benefits. Policy requirements include: methods to assess the potential roles, benefits, impacts and risks for women and men of different ages, ethnicities, and social structure and status which should be monitored through the use of gender-disaggregated indicators (GEF, 2014). This is also reflected in annual monitoring and reporting. Past reviews have found gender to be a weakness in implementation and evaluation reports (GEF, 2014). New gender mainstreaming processes have been included under GEF 6 which will be reflected in future reporting, and are outlined in the table below: Table 3 Gender Indicators and Source of Verification Goal: Achieve global environmental benefits and sustainable development through gender equality and empowerment of women Objectives Gender indicators Source of verification Project design fully integrates gender concerns.

However, this does not mean that all reporting on gender should be restricted to this section. In fact, gender reporting will be integrated throughout the whole report. Some suggestions on possible entry points for incorporating gender-sensitive reporting within PIRs include: \ufffd The Communications and Knowledge Management section could include quotes from both women and men, reporting on impacts disaggregated by gender or social group and when discussing completing the section on \u2018specific issues faced by specific groups\u2019. \ufffd In the Partnership section, under CSOs/NGOs and under indigenous peoples, include any gender- sensitive strategies that may have been implemented. This may include targeted support like finance, market linkage or skill development. Results should be noted, such as any increase in income or representation in community bodies. These details may also be included in the \u2018General Comments\u2019 section. Further to this, there is a \u2018file upload\u2019 feature to upload of any supporting GESI-related reports, case studies, short videos, etc. This feature should be taken advantage of to substantiate reporting where appropriate. 6.4 Reporting in ROARs The ROAR is an important corporate strategic reporting tool which was designed to help measure and monitor results on a programme level. The ROAR is used to ascertain the effectiveness of country programmes and their contribution to transformational change based on both quantitative and qualitative evidence. The UNDP has recently reviewed the design and use of the ROAR based on experiences from 2013 and earlier years. As a result, a new 2014-2017 template has been created. The major change is that the primary users of the ROAR are now defined as the Country Office (CO), making the primary objective of the ROAR to enable COs to carry out a performance self-assessment (UNDP 2014d). Some of the entry points for reporting gender results in the 2014 ROAR template can be found below: 6.4.1 Section A2: Outcome level progress and results This section asks for a review of Outcome Indicators. A checklist is provided which asks COs to rate the level of positive change that outcome indicators have reflected. If the CO indicates that positive change has been achieved, this must then be substantiated in 2,500 characters or less. The template asks: What were the main gender sensitive reporting if there have been positive outcomes relating to gender equality, social inclusion or women\u2019s empowerment. \ufffd Promote women\u2019s economic empowerment \ufffd Prevent and respond to sexual and gender-based violence \ufffd Strengthen evidence-informed national strategies and partnerships to advance gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment \ufffd Support implementation of measures to increase women\u2019s participation in decision-making \ufffd Other (Please specify) (300 characters) (UNDP 2014d) Box 11 ROAR gender equality contribution checklist 33 Gender Mainstreaming in Environment and Sustainable Development Projects 6.4.2 Section A4: Gender equality This section asks for a gender marker rating. A guide to the gender marker is included in Chapter 4 of this document. The template asks whether any gender results have been achieved and if yes, these results must then be specified in 1,000 characters or less. The ROAR template asks for the inclusion of progress at both an output and outcome level rather than for specific activities that were implemented. Following this, there is a checklist to identify what kind of work relating to gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment is being carried out. Identifying the category of the contribution should be fairly straightforward. For example, an outcome related to the strengthening of women\u2019s livelihoods through the implementation of sustainable land and water use strategies would fall under \u2018Promote women\u2019s economic empowerment\u2019. For any other kind of contribution not included in the list there is an opportunity to be specific. 6.5 Stories from the field Personal accounts and stories from the field is an effective way of communicating those results that cannot be captured through numbers and data.

Some tips about writing such stories are: The story must have a clear take-away. What is the point of the story? Is it a lesson learned? Does it provide an innovative example of what can be done? Does it show a result or change in the lives of people? Summarize the main point at the end. Provide context. Provide enough context to make sure your reader understands what\u2019s at stake or how their life could be affected by the events in the story. Don\u2019t overwhelm with background information, however. Capture developmental results. Provide information linking project impacts to the lives and realities that women and men face. For example, it could be reported that with the increase in income, they were able to spend more money on family health and education, enabling them to have their children vaccinated and to keep them in school. Another example could be that by obtaining an employment, women and men have become part of formal social protection programmes, including a national pension scheme where exists. Cut out the clutter. While it\u2019s important to provide enough details to lend credibility to the story and enough context, it is easy to include too much information. Make sure all details included are relevant to the story. Avoid gender stereotypes. Use gender-sensitive language and refrain from portraying women and men in stereotypical illustration. Highlight stories of women and men who have transformed rigid gender norms and gender stereotypes. 34 Gender Mainstreaming in Environment and Sustainable Development Projects Evaluations are essentially instruments for learning, establishing accountability and making course corrections. Having a gender-sensitive evaluation system is just as important as having a \u201cgendered\u201d project design. A project evaluation must examine a range of gender dimensions, including: \ufffd Whether the project is reaching women as well as men? What are the wider impacts/changes the project achieved in relation to women and men? \ufffd What is the impact of the project on women and men, and their power dynamics? Which of women\u2019s/men\u2019s activities does the project affect? \ufffd Is the planned component consistent with current gender responsibility for the activity? \ufffd If there is a plan to change women\u2019s/men\u2019s performance of the activity (i.e. through remuneration and new technology), it is necessary to question if it\u2019s feasible. If a plan goes ahead, what would the positive or negative effects be on women/men? \ufffd Does the monitoring and evaluation strategy consider women and men separately? Have indicators been developed to measure how women and men are impacted by the activities and results? In UNDP projects, the MTEs provide a key opportunity for course corrections, while the TEs provide lessons for future programming. The MTR is a space for reporting that can be used to address and impacts that were not considered during planning or incorporated in the log frame. It can do that by making comments and suggestions, such as whether indicators are gender inclusive and if not, how they could be to ensure that development benefits are able to be adequately monitored in a gender- sensitive manner. The TOR for conducting an MTR requires the evaluators to assess, under results framework, the following:8 8 UNDP-GEF Midterm Review Terms of Reference, Standard Template 1: Formatted for attachment to UNDP Procurement Website \u201c\u2026. Examine if progress so far has led to, or could in the future catalyse beneficial development effects (i.e. income generation, gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment, improved governance etc...) that should be included in the project results framework and monitored on an annual basis....\u201d It also requires the evaluators to \u201c\u2026.Review the extent to which relevant gender issues were raised in the project design......and guides the evaluators to \u201cAnnex 9 of Guidance For Conducting Midterm Reviews of UNDP-Supported, GEF-Financed Projects for further guidelines\u201d.

Chapter 7. Gender in project closing (UNDP project stage: closure and learning) 35 Gender Mainstreaming in Environment and Sustainable Development Projects 2. Provide concrete guidance to consultants on setting up a gender-sensitive evaluation methodology A challenge for considering gender in evaluations is that obtaining information from both women and men may increase the cost and time allocated to data collection. Women may be more timid than men or may not even be allowed to speak, or be represented in public meetings or community consultations. There may be reluctance from men to include women in discussions. Women may have less time at their disposal because of household tasks. These factors need to be considered and preventative measures put in place in the planning of the TOR and the budget of the evaluation exercise.

Provide concrete guidance to consultants on specific themes and gender, e.g. gender and biomass energy, or gender and climate change, etc. Consultants need to be made aware of the following UNDP resources on these issues: Box 12 A selection of UNDP resources on gender 36 Gender Mainstreaming in Environment and Sustainable Development Projects The following are examples of issues that consultants need to address in specific types of projects. Issues to examine in a water project Women are the primary collectors, transporters, users and managers of domestic water and promoters of home and community-based sanitation activities. Securing water for families has a direct bearing on women\u2019s health and access to education and employment. Among the issues to consider in a project are: \ufffd Whether the project uses women\u2019s and men\u2019s knowledge on water resource. \ufffd What roles and responsibilities women and men have for difference water uses. \ufffd What specific tasks do women and men perform in water management, and are they affected differently by shortages. \ufffd What coping strategies do they adopt and in what ways does the project help address water shortages for women and men. \ufffd What role do women and men have in decision- making bodies that control decisions on water? Has the project contributed to strengthening women\u2019s role? \ufffd What has been the level of participation of women and men in training programmes conducted under the project? Have women been able to benefit to the same extent as men from these training programmes? Have gender disaggregated results been documented? Issues to examine in a disaster risk reduction project \ufffd Are the early warning and evacuation systems designed in line with the mobility and access to information that women, men as well as disadvantaged like the elderly, have? \ufffd Does the project adequately target/ involve the informal sector (such as home-based workers and women)? \ufffd Does the project adequately target/ involve highly vulnerable categories of women \u2013widows, women living below the poverty level and unemployed women? \ufffd Does the project incorporate mechanisms to capture women\u2019s and men\u2019s local knowledge on vulnerable members of the village, neighbourhoods and communities, as well on coping strategies in past disasters? \ufffd Does the project address gender based differences in issues related to safe shelters and housing, including adequate lighting and provisions to protect security and privacy in shelters and housing?

Within the \u2018Project Description and Background\u2019 the development context must be explained. For environment and sustainable development projects this will normally include details on any identified environmental issues, the socio-economic status of affected communities and individual groups within these communities (particularly disadvantaged groups), the gender dimensions of the project and the relevant institutional and policy factors. The objectives, outcomes and projected results need to be described in this section. Within this context, strategies aimed at gender and social inclusion should be outlined. This section also includes the identification of any threats or barriers that the project sought to address. Within the \u2018Findings\u2019 section of the TE, the project design should be examined and rated, including to what level gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) issues were relevant. These GESI issues should have been reflected in the planning stages (results framework) and there should be evidence that they have been considered during implementation. For example, any actions taken to improve women\u2019s income generation or to introduce new skills for a particular disadvantaged group should be noted. Importantly, there should also be evidence that contributions towards gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment and social inclusion had been monitored during the project cycle. The GESI principles and entry points outlined above can be adapted for reporting purposes in the TE. 38 Gender Mainstreaming in Environment and Sustainable Development Projects UNDP India (Nagaland) Annex 1.

Projects This annex presents a comparison between the reporting in the 2013 and 2014 PIRs. The analysis was undertaken by means of a: \ufffd Word search: Within the context of the overall framework of gender equality within UNDP, a word search was carried out to determine how many times words such as gender/ women/ disadvantaged were used in the report. When these words were used within a reporting template, they were disregarded. The occurrence of a high number of these words did not necessarily reflect attention to gender issues; however, an absence or near zero use was indicative of either no attention to these issues, or no relevance of these issues. \ufffd Review of content reporting: At the next level, these reports were reviewed to determine the context of the gender reporting that had been carried out, as well as the gender focus, e.g. participation in meetings/ formation of groups/ income increase of a particular group. It may be noted that the analysis intended to cover both gender and social inclusion issues. However, the reporting of social inclusion in the reports was found to be non-existent, as a result most examples cited reflect gender equality alone. This is a gap in reporting that needs to be corrected. 1. Results of the word search Figure 4.

A Word Search is not a method that is likely to result in deep analysis; however, it can provide an indication of whether reporting has addressed the issues of gender and social inclusion at any length. Annex 2. Analysis of 2013 and 2014 PIRs 50 Gender Mainstreaming in Environment and Sustainable Development Projects A word search of the 2014 PIRs was conducted, the words searched for gender, women and female. In the 2014 PIRs, only 24 of the 61 reports (39 percent) mentioned the word gender. Most PIRs only included the words gender, female or women about ten times or less. Trends observed within most projects that fell into this category included: reporting was restricted to the \u2018Towards Gender Equality\u2019 section or was only extended to sex disaggregated data on participation, one or more gender indicators were absent and reporting on gender was very brief. Twelve projects did not mention the words gender, women or female (19.6 percent). Half of these were projects from India. While it is not always the case, often when these key words are completely absent it can mean that the gendered dimensions of a project have been neglected in reporting and this was observed in the 2014 PIRs. 2.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8378110-81e7-4fb1-8261-7a01d9dd388a": {"__data__": {"id_": "f8378110-81e7-4fb1-8261-7a01d9dd388a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-mainstreaming-environment-and-sustainable-development-projects", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender Mainstreaming in Environment and Sustainable Development Projects", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-mainstreaming-environment-and-sustainable-development-projects", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0d43500caadf22c8df8a63939f629b35a0c49651a54f2601a3a8ad9e24836e87"}, "2": {"node_id": "5b90e52f-7368-47ed-8a79-928e1350c71f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-mainstreaming-environment-and-sustainable-development-projects", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b678c118abf38f22f53f41e66d4a955777549d738bfde43c9064de323b8957f"}}, "hash": "37a17b4fcb930592051cdca7e950f247a35b88ff626705c9e6edf1cc37405783", "text": "2.

Gender assessment Both 2013 and 2014 PIRs were reviewed for reporting on gender assessment that had taken place during the project cycle. Among the 2013 PIRs, 20 projects (27.4 percent) reported on gender assessment whereas in 2014, this was lower at 13 projects (20.6 percent). However, three of the 2014 PIRs also explicitly state that there are plans for future gender assessment which, when reported, would bring the percentage back up to 24.5 percent of PIRs. A clear example of reporting on gender assessment can be found in the 2014 PIR on \u2018Integrated Land and Ecosystem Management to Combat Land Degradation and Deforestation in Madhya Pradesh\u2019 . This project aims to address unsustainable land management practices through supporting and promoting sustainable rural livelihoods, while simultaneously addressing environmental issues at the community level. The PIR identified the major barriers as: institutional barriers, economic and financial barriers and technology and knowledge barriers. The project strategy aimed at removing these barriers while simultaneously promoting ecologically sustainable rural livelihoods. The reporting states that the Training Need Assessment (TNA) study of the nine project had conducted the gender assessments required for the capacity building and training of the Joint Forest Management Committee (JFMC) members. The outcome of the TNA study has been incorporated for developing the capacity building and training proposal for selecting an agency for implementing the programme. The identification of women as JFMC members for the capacity building programmes will be carried out based on the study and findings of the report. What makes this reporting effective is that it: (a) states explicitly that gender assessment has been undertaken and gives the reason as: (a) for the capacity building and training of JFMC members; (b) explains that the findings had been taken into consideration during the capacity building and training segment; and (c) identifies the necessity of women\u2019s participation as the outcome of the assessment. The outcome of this report is reflected in the following reported result: 52 Gender Mainstreaming in Environment and Sustainable Development Projects Based on the recommendations of the Review Committee, modules for the training and capacity building of the Forest Committee members were identified. PMU initiated the process of identifying Forest Committee members that will receive training as community-level master trainers. At least 10 percent of these master trainers will be women. This result indicates that after the gender assessment recognized women\u2019s participation as a weakness and steps were taken to address the issue. 5. Identifiable gender indicator and targets An identifiable gender indicator is distinguishable because it is designed in a way that will allow for the measurement of change for women and/or men as individual groups. This may be apparent through the specific use of the words women or men in the Results Framework. Collection of sex disaggregated data, by itself, may not be sufficient indicator of gender equality. However, sex disaggregated data substantiated with the \u2018story behind\u2019 any imbalances between women\u2019s and men\u2019s participation and information about what the project has done to correct these imbalances is more meaningful. Among the 2013 PIRs, 8 projects (10.9 percent) have identifiable gender indicators. In comparison, this has improved in 2014 with 13 PIRs (15.8 percent) with identifiable gender indicators.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8ab8656-4810-4510-ad6c-c6e469f60253": {"__data__": {"id_": "e8ab8656-4810-4510-ad6c-c6e469f60253", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-mainstreaming-environment-and-sustainable-development-projects", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender Mainstreaming in Environment and Sustainable Development Projects", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-mainstreaming-environment-and-sustainable-development-projects", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ab118e904941cb6be18d649c2902f59c744690ba88efa6388f931c2c4aac0e81"}, "2": {"node_id": "96846678-dc14-4e9c-ac67-e0da7c906ffc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-mainstreaming-environment-and-sustainable-development-projects", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f43a53c558c36e612bde8bbab044d066f4704b022be736b0be32fccbd18d185e"}}, "hash": "cdd2ebde00102b4293118e454fd72b5feee26c71510d14bb4e2c644dea2c6b15", "text": "A good example of a clear and identifiable gender indicator can be found in \u2018Strengthening Community- Based Forest and Watershed Management\u2019, a sustainable forest and watershed management project operating across six watersheds in Indonesia.

However, further reporting on this project identifies women\u2019s participation as \u2018weak\u2019 point and goes on to describe several barriers preventing participation and gender equality, making an indicator to monitor female participation both suitable and useful. 6. Livelihood, income and quality of life One of the main problems in the way developmental results are reported is that they are often not substantiated by meaningful data. One example of this is contained in a 2014 PIR: \u201cWomen are the main field work force in the rural areas and as such they are the most vulnerable to contamination caused by POP pesticides. The removal of POPs pesticide waste and preventing it from spreading to cultivation land have benefited women and children\u201d. The report does not provide any further detail regarding how women and children have benefitted (or not) from the project activities. It is an easy assumption to make that the rehabilitation of contaminated land will have a positive impact on women and children as the targeted beneficiaries, however the actual benefits are not demonstrated in the report. For example, have instances of poor health linked to pesticide contamination been lowered amongst women and children? Are they able to grow more crops and raise their income or improve food security? In the 2013 PIRs, five projects (6.8 percent) reported qualitative or quantitative data on the tangible impacts on disadvantaged groups. Against this, 13 of the 2014 PIRs (21.3 percent) reported on qualitative or quantitative data on income, livelihood or quality of life. Aspects such as an increase in women\u2019s income, new sustainable livelihood options and the acquisition of new skill sets are important for reporting. When reporting on income, it is also important to note that data is made meaningful when it is substantiated by information on access and control over income for disadvantaged groups. 53 Gender Mainstreaming in Environment and Sustainable Development Projects 7. Sex disaggregated data on participation This continues to be a very strong area of reporting. In the 2013 PIRs, 34 percent of reports included sex disaggregated data on participation, and increased to 49.2 percent in the 2014 PIRs. However, while the inclusion of sex disaggregated data on participation is important, on itself it does not necessarily prove that participation was meaningful. This kind of data can be substantiated with deeper information regarding the nature of participation. A good example of meaningful reporting on participation in workshops can be found in the 2014 PIR \u2018Expanding and diversifying the national system of terrestrial protected areas in the Philippines\u2019. This is a biodiversity project aimed at reducing harmful human activities linked to the degradation of biodiversity in the Philippines. The strategies that were employed for this purpose included: Addressing key barriers and establishing solid foundations for accelerated expansion of the terrestrial system in the Philippines in partnership with key organizations, local communities and other stakeholders, and supported by strong management capacities, and sustainable financing. \ufffd Reporting sex disaggregated data on participation in workshops, and covering in detail concerns raised by women during the workshops. \ufffd Female participants in workshop groups were concerned about the risk associated with environmental degradation, such as occurrences of La Ni\u00f1a, drought, increase in temperature and flooding, and landslides due to strong typhoons. \ufffd Women also referred to other frequently encountered risks in the area near Mt. Naculod, which was experiencing soil erosion, and depletion of food and water supply. This kind of reporting gives more meaning to the quantitative data that is routinely collected on male and female participation in workshops and training. By reporting female-specific concerns, women have been given the space to voice their concerns within the project. Reporting these concerns means that they have also been recorded. 8. Coverage of social inclusion in reporting Reporting on social inclusion is almost entirely absent from the 2014 PIRs. There is some mention of disadvantaged groups, such as the landless and the elderly. At times, it is acknowledged that indigenous groups may face certain forms of discrimination. However, these statements are almost never substantiated with any detail. An example of this can be drawn from the \u2018Sustainable Land Management in Shifting Cultivation Areas of Nagaland for Ecological and Livelihood Security\u2019 project which reports: \u201cFormation of Land Use Committees (LUCs), which have representation from all sections and institutions of the village, including even the usually marginalized sections such as women and landless farmers, and their subsequently formed action plans which addressed issues such as food security and ecosystem balance have created an enabling environment for sustainable jhum and forest", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f679b87b-c244-4fc6-96fd-26e58c560ee3": {"__data__": {"id_": "f679b87b-c244-4fc6-96fd-26e58c560ee3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-mainstreaming-environment-and-sustainable-development-projects", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender Mainstreaming in Environment and Sustainable Development Projects", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-mainstreaming-environment-and-sustainable-development-projects", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3974197d55ddb3105ac6144487a3e71df490408958a422b26da586f0f335ba74"}, "3": {"node_id": "85d5a882-5e35-4e47-af19-c24eb4b612c6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/gender-mainstreaming-environment-and-sustainable-development-projects", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ab75d42f8c3552351367bc390421328d3dcedbcab84e920b68767f60e04d9d8d"}}, "hash": "c9763e1d8ca0f5c8148dda69c3966ffa688ae70782c05df89c7424cc1e00a9e3", "text": "management systems\u201d. The acknowledgement that landlessness may be linked to discrimination and marginalization is significant. However, this is not explored in any detail elsewhere in the report despite the existence of several entry points to explore intersecting forms of discrimination within this project, such as gender, landlessness and indigenous status. The examination of social inclusion dimensions has not been significantly strengthened in reporting that had taken place in 2013 and 2014. This indicates that this is an area which could be strengthened significantly in future. Reporting on social inclusion is important in the context of gender mainstreaming, but it is equally important to address the structural implications of discrimination linked to disadvantaged groups in a project. 54 Gender Mainstreaming in Environment and Sustainable Development Projects 9. Overall conclusions on 2014 PIRs The overarching conclusion drawn from a review of the 2014 PIRs is that the majority of the strengths and weakness are reflected in the 2013 PIRs. \ufffd Reporting on gender tends to be restricted to the \u2018Towards Gender Equality\u2019 section of the PIRs. Even when issues are identified, they are usually restricted to this particular section and this makes it difficult to find substantiating data in the rest of the reporting. Rather than being a component that is routinely integrated into reporting, it seems that in 2014, GESI reporting continues to be treated as a separate objective to the overall project reporting. \ufffd With regards to participation in project activities, quantitative sex disaggregated data is recorded/however mostly without the accompaniment of important information about the social implications of this data. \ufffd Gender reporting is often not results-based and there are not always easily identifiable strategies within the reporting that have been implemented that are specifically linked to the achievement of gender equality. In many cases, it seems likely that project activities are in fact contributing to gender equality on the ground. However, reporting may not be doing justice to the significant work being done to address gender equality. In addition, the \u2018implicit\u2019 knowledge of project managers and team members is often not easily converted into \u2018explicit\u2019 reporting and this must be strengthened. \ufffd Reporting on social inclusion continues to be largely absent. 55 Gender Mainstreaming in Environment and Sustainable Development Projects The following is a list of resources and tools within thematic groups that may provide further information on gender mainstreaming and gender-sensitive reporting within the environment and sustainable development portfolio: Climate change Bridge- Gender and Climate Change Overview Report : Provides an overview of the cross cutting issues of gender and climate change and their many intersections.

This has been particularly the case with former colonies where at the time of independence almost all the members of the judiciary have been citizens of the respective colonial power. A number of countries in Africa, Asia and the Pacific have had the services of expatriate Judges continued even after they became sovereign and independent. However, the general trend in all of these countries has been to phase out the services of expatriate Judges and prescribe the requirement of citizenship for appointment to judicial office. At the same time, there have been circumstances in some countries in recent years where courts have been staffed with expatriate Judges usually for reasons of legitimacy or because of the lack of capacity locally or both. Considering the experiences of some of these countries mentioned below, it would not be extraordinary or in any way improper, if East Timor appointed expatriates as judges, for such time that the government thinks it is necessary in order to set standards of excellence and good performance in the judiciary, and until citizens of East Timor are able to acquire the professional skills and experience necessary to hold judicial office. In an increasingly globalised world compliance with international norms and standards are expected even in courts having domestic jurisdiction. Section 1. Expatriate Judges and National Courts Seychelles http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2001/af/8401.htm: All judges in the Seychelles are appointed for 7 years and can be reappointed by the President on the recommendation of the Constitutional Appointment Committee. All sitting judges were hired from other Commonwealth countries, including Mauritius, India, Sri Lanka, Nigeria, and Zambia; none are citizens, with the exception of the Chief Justice, who is a naturalized citizen. The Seychelles Bar Association has criticized the Government for not advertising domestically that judicial positions are available, since 30 citizens practice law either domestically or abroad. Some observers criticized expatriate judges for a perceived lack of sensitivity on issues such as human rights. Hong Kong Hong Kong is another example of a situation where even though sovereignty over the territory passed to the People's Republic of China, the judiciary and laws of the former British colony were continued in the Special Administrative Region. The continuity of the judiciary was achieved on 1 July 1997 when the Chief Executive, acting in accordance with the recommendations of the independent Judicial Officers Recommendation Commission, re-appointed all judges who were in service on the previous day. Many of these are expatriate judges whose nationality is immaterial to their continuing employment. Most of the judges retiring after the 1 July 1997 served well beyond their retirement age. The only judges who must be Chinese citizens are the Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal and the Chief Judge of the High Court. Substantive Research Piece - East Timor August, 2002 Bangkok SURF Team 3 Macao http://www.usconsulate.org.hk/usmo/hr/2000/022501.htm: Before the handover of Macao to China local judges were appointed for life; expatriate judges were appointed under temporary contracts. A local law is yet to be passed determining the term of office for judges for the SAR. In October the Chief Executive-elect announced the names of three judges (two from Macau and one Portuguese) recommended by the commission, who constitute the SAR Court of Final Appeal. After the handover, a Commissioner for Auditing replaced the Court of Auditors. The law provides for the right to a fair trial and the judiciary vigorously enforces this right. Trials are open to the public. The Criminal Procedure Code provides for the accused's right to be present during proceedings and to choose an attorney or request that one be provided at government expense. A 1997 law on combating organized crime provides that \"certain procedural acts may be held without publicity\" and that witness statements read in court are admissible as evidence. There are also additional restrictions on the granting of bail and suspended sentences in organized crime cases.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7f80529b-e0c0-43ce-99c8-7b6329ca85a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "7f80529b-e0c0-43ce-99c8-7b6329ca85a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/substantive-research-piece-east-timor-global-experiences-using-expatriate-judges", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Substantive Research Piece - East Timor: Global Experiences Using Expatriate Judges", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/substantive-research-piece-east-timor-global-experiences-using-expatriate-judges", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c7fbcdec45ad17fc31019d54d86b47ebb6a13b5aea59e0b7611974e63b2f69a6"}, "2": {"node_id": "38743e16-591e-41af-9477-483c33b515e0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/substantive-research-piece-east-timor-global-experiences-using-expatriate-judges", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ea2a203149d71c5d552a76fde826786ddfaf8e12e90222612be3966e0b4045a8"}}, "hash": "355c49e95644de43cacb4b97b4f957d48a7222297ac166eebdc8aa41eeee8f36", "text": "There are also additional restrictions on the granting of bail and suspended sentences in organized crime cases.

Namibia The President of Namibia on the recommendation of the Judicial Service Commission appoints all the judges of the Supreme Court and the High Court in Namibia. Once a judge has received the presidential commission of a judge, he or she becomes a Namibian judge. There are \"no foreign judges\" on the Namibian bench. Where a non- Namibian national is appointed a judge of the Supreme Court or High Court, he or she assumes his office and works as a Namibian judge on the strength of the presidential commission (appointment). Such a judge does not need and is not issued with a work permit. Judges of the Supreme Court and the High Court who are not Namibian citizens are Namibian judges. Some have been assigned to the Namibian judiciary at the request of the Namibian Government and on agreement with their respective governments. Notwithstanding the fact that most of these judges were already senior judges in their respective jurisdictions, the President of Namibia appointed them to the Namibian judiciary on the recommendation of the Judicial Service Commission. Substantive Research Piece - East Timor August, 2002 Bangkok SURF Team 4 Kenya Kenya continued to retain the services of expatriate judges long after its independence. And there are some voices that can be heard today in that country that would argue that the quality and independence of the judiciary has been compromised by the departure of expatriate judges. Swaziland Swaziland is another country that continues to have expatriate judges, including the Chief Justice: http://www.africaonline.com/site/Articles/1,3,4485.jsp. Judicial powers are vested in a dual system, one independent and based on Western law, the other based on a system of national courts that follows unwritten traditional law and custom. In treason and sedition cases, the King can circumvent the regular judiciary by appointing a special tribunal, which may adopt rules and procedures different from those applied in the High Court; however, this power was used last in 1987: http://www.nationbynation.com/Swaziland/Human.html: The Western judiciary (distinct from the traditional courts) consists of the Court of Appeal (composed entirely of expatriate, usually South African, judges), the High Court, and magistrate courts. The expatriate judges, often distinguished members of their respective bars, serve on the basis of 2-year renewable contracts. Local judges serve indefinitely on good behaviour. Fiji Fiji is a case in point where issues of national and international legitimacy prompted the involvement of non-Fijian judges. In May 2000 there was a coup led by George Speight (now convicted for that offence), which seized Parliament by force and displaced the elected government. In November 2000, Justice Anthony Gates of the High Court of Fiji delivered a judgment, which declared the 1997 multiracial constitution was still the supreme law of the country, and called for the elected Parliament to be reconvened to form a legal government. (Incidentally, Judge Gates is available for consultancies through the Bangkok SURF) This decision went in appeal to a Court of Appeal made up of five expatriate judges, Sir Maurice Casey, a retired New Zealand Court of Appeal judge, who headed the panel, Sir Mari Kapi, Deputy Chief Justice of Papua New Guinea, Sir Ian Barker, a retired New Zealand Court of Appeal judge, Justice Gordon Ward, the Chief Justice of Tonga, and Justice Ken Handley, of the New South Wales Court of Appeal. In circumstances of the kind that obtained in Fiji, with divisions between the indigenous population and the Indian settler community having become wider in the wake of the coup, the Court of Appeal comprising of judges who could be seen to be objective, impartial and disinterested had the legitimacy to make a decision that is fundamentally political, but based on the Rule of Law and principles of constitutional jurisprudence. However, after the elections in September 2001 that were regarded as free and fair by UN observers a new government was sworn into office. In July 2002, Justice Daniel Fatiaki was appointed the Chief Justice, setting at rest the speculation that Fiji would opt for an expatriate chief justice because of controversy amongst judges following the May 2000 coup crisis.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f0dc6c9-afa9-414c-9ec6-b957426db4dd": {"__data__": {"id_": "4f0dc6c9-afa9-414c-9ec6-b957426db4dd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/substantive-research-piece-east-timor-global-experiences-using-expatriate-judges", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Substantive Research Piece - East Timor: Global Experiences Using Expatriate Judges", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/substantive-research-piece-east-timor-global-experiences-using-expatriate-judges", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4c28a95138e1bd279f34e6954a2306ed0f6a0e5f165b700d15e0ba1b0f848651"}, "2": {"node_id": "5d4053e7-e3cf-4491-a4e6-4833b93395b6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/substantive-research-piece-east-timor-global-experiences-using-expatriate-judges", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "317d8ced85f3ab7aec620cd5632ff513ebf0a3d50b5f22a460e0eb03d487dfa9"}}, "hash": "4cae8d54d75b1743ab7230695989e80b3f90ecbd34e0c0d5811483f88c44f21c", "text": "Please also see the following link: http://www.pl.net/8politics/fijicourt.html.

Programs events are held in conjunction with Mexico's Federal Judicial Council, UNAM's Juridical Research Institute, as well as the U.S. Federal Judicial Center and several other U.S. and Mexican universities. A main component of NCSC's Judicial Exchange Program involves a series of conferences, seminars and meetings bringing together judges from the U.S. and Mexico to exchange information about each other's legal systems and to exchange ideas on how to improve the legal and judicial systems in each country. At the forefront of these exchange activities are a series of Judicial Border Conferences. These conferences bring together state and federal court judges from the U.S. and Mexico and include an overview of each Substantive Research Piece - East Timor August, 2002 Bangkok SURF Team 8 country's legal system, a presentation on each country's criminal justice system, and a presentation of the selection, training, and disciplining of judges. Additionally, the participants, including judges and a small number of lawyers and academics, work in small discussion groups in areas of vital importance to that border region including criminal law, immigration, environmental law and trade/commerce. In addition to the Border Conferences, the Judicial Exchange Program includes meetings of an advisory Committee, federal judges from both countries, as well as a variety of other speakers programs.

Over the past 100 years, fourteen of the hottest summers have occurred since 2000 and the world is already facing climate change-induced impacts, such as rising sea levels, changing rainfall patterns, increased droughts, and more erratic storms. These stresses have exacerbated existing economic, political and humanitarian issues around the world. Hard-won gains that have helped communities increase access to food, health, education and other needs are at risk. In particular, for the poorest and most vulnerable, climate change can undo decades of development. However, the global response to climate change has never been stronger. 2015 has ushered in a new era of action on climate change and development. The outcomes of the Sendai World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction, the Financing for Development Conference in Addis Ababa, the approval of the Sustainable Development Goals, and the forthcoming COP21 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) present new opportunities for countries to transition their economies toward zero-carbon, sustainable development. The challenge before us is to turn the bold words of these global agreements into concrete action on the ground. UNDP, with a presence in over 177 countries and territories and a portfolio of mitigation and adaptation projects of over US $2.3 billion, is committed to doing all it can to help countries bring their visions to life. UNDP will do this by providing ambitious and comprehensive support to scale up proven solutions and to pursue new climate change action that enhances resilience and spurs zero carbon development pathways. For UNDP this means responding to climate change under the umbrella of sustainable development. This is achieved through a broad range of adaptation and mitigation development actions, including de-risking financing, and supporting national partners to adopt practices such as ecosystem based approaches and sustainable forestry. Our vision is driven by inclusivity and equity, ensuring action for all countries, and with recognition that it is the Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States that are the most vulnerable to climate impacts and need the greatest support to adapt. Working together with national and local partners, support will likewise be targeted for groups within countries most at risk and who have the potential to be agents of change, including women, girls and youth. This infographic report provides a snapshot of the breadth and depth of UNDP\u2019s climate change work in the hope that our experiences and expertise can be beneficial to countries as they deliver their climate change and development goals in 2016 and beyond. The portfolio is based on UNDP\u2019s role as an implementing agency of Global Environment Facility-managed funds, an implementing entity of the Adaptation Fund, and a partner in numerous multilateral and bilateral programmes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4079ce15-dbc0-416b-99d6-33ba72557977": {"__data__": {"id_": "4079ce15-dbc0-416b-99d6-33ba72557977", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-and-climate-change-zero-carbon-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP and Climate Change: Zero Carbon, Sustainable Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-and-climate-change-zero-carbon-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "789ae4892289a3e28c9cf6bc63f56100fb0d134f0152e403ae1e675eea70b36b"}, "2": {"node_id": "5a03947c-8df6-48ea-9fa0-2bbd07c11149", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-and-climate-change-zero-carbon-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d69e2a736d7501f863da77258d94765c96885e6cf9148d9b2f45400ca081b71e"}}, "hash": "a1d5a4b46854af0c1aeba6ccff515962696f0909d64324db329a290320966dea", "text": "UNDP is also an accredited entity of the Green Climate Fund.

TO ACHIEVE THIS VISION, COUNTRIES MUST RAPIDLY TRANSFORM THEIR ECONOMIES, SUCH AS BY GREENING THEIR ENERGY, INFRASTRUCTURE, AGRICULTURE AND OTHER SECTORS. This requires large volumes of capital. The UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) estimates that the total investment needs for Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)- related sectors (including those related to climate change) in developing countries alone range from US$3.3-$4.5 trillion annually. Based on today\u2019s level of public and private investment, developing countries will still need to bridge an annual funding shortfall of as much as $2.5 trillion from 2015-2030. The ambitious shift toward sustainable and risk- informed development not only requires scaled up and stable levels of finance from international, national, public and private sources, but also an effective environment made up of sound policies, strong institutions and adequate budgetary frameworks. This includes leveraging scarce public finance to attract private investment. DRAWING ON DECADES OF EXPERIENCE IN ACCESSING CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENTAL FINANCE, UNDP SUPPORTS ACTION AT ALL LEVELS SO THAT COUNTRIES HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO TRANSITION TOWARD ZERO-CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENT DEVELOPMENT. Climate change and associated finance are at the heart of UNDP\u2019s Strategic Plan, and our portfolio supports opportunities for countries to take action under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process. In partnership with the Global Environment Facility (GEF), Adaptation Fund (AF), as well as other multilateral and bilateral partners, UNDP has provided decades of strategic assistance in catalyzing and leveraging climate investment into climate policies, technologies, practices and enterprises. A STRONG FOUNDATION FROM WHICH UNDP WILL ACHIEVE ITS VISION. From Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs), National Adaptation Plans (NAPs), climate finance readiness and other programmes, UNDP has helped countries access and deliver over $2.3 billion in mitigation and adaptation initiatives. UNDP works across all regions\u2014over 130 developing countries, including all 48 Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and 39 Small Island Developing States (SIDS). UNDP also works with vulnerable populations within countries, including women, girls, youth, indigenous people and remote communities. UNDP WILL CONTINUE TO COLLABORATE WITH PARTNERS TO EXPAND THE WORK ALREADY UNDERWAY AND DEVELOP NEW AND INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE. The organization continues to promote an integrated approach to achieve sustainable development that tackles the connected issues of multidimensional poverty, inequality and exclusion, and sustainability, while enhancing knowledge and skills to reduce risks and sustain development gains. By building on the programmes and initiatives described in this report, UNDP aims to scale up support so that countries can achieve transformational change. \u00a9 UNDP / Dylan Lowthian Executive Snapshot \u2014 7 Ambitious Intended Nationally- Determined Contributions pave the way toward bold climate change action on the ground. INTENDED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTIONS (INDCs) WHAT IS AN INDC? Globally, countries have agreed to publicly outline the post-2020 climate actions they intend to take under a new international agreement to be reached in Paris in December 2015. These are referred to as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs). UNDP SUPPORT FOR INDCs: UNDP is a key partner to countries in developing and submitting their INDCs. UNDP has provided INDC financial and/or technical support to 43 developing countries; developed a guidebook on \u2018Designing and Preparing INDCs\u2019 with the World Resources Institute; and organized 12 INDC regional dialogues, global forums and sub-regional training workshops in partnership with the UNFCCC Secretariat and other partners to exchange lessons learned and provide guidance on INDC preparation. Through these activities, UNDP reached over 1,000 participants from 130 countries.

AFRICA \u2014 19 CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES \uecd6 Most African governments are initiating governance systems for adaptation. In particular, LDCs have initiated comprehensive adaptation planning processes by developing National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs).10 \uecd6 However, the development of national and local adaptation plans has not been accompanied by implementation budgets; finance needs to be redirected to enable implementation. \uecd6 Effective national frameworks must include multiple institutions that cover all aspects of climate change and enable ownership and accountability. \uecd6 The capture of climate data is important but lacks funding. \uecd6 Even though mitigation is a lower priority than adaptation in many African countries, there are many opportunities for mitigation actions; especially encouraging the scaling up of renewable energy. There is keen interest from donors to support mitigation efforts in the African region, especially efforts in LDCs and SIDS. Many regional and subregional actions are underway. UNDP has invested $611 million in 41 countries across the African region, supporting: 19% 8% 22% 51% AFRICA ADAPTATION $311 MILLION CROSS- CUTTING $48 MILLION MITIGATION $137 MILLION FORESTS $115 MILLION \uecd6 Ghanaian law now requires that all new refrigerators carry official energy efficiency labels. At the same time, a ban on the import of used refrigerating appliances in 2013 prevented over 260,000 inefficient units from entering the country. \uecd6 Annual energy savings achieved are enough to power more than 11,000 households for a year. UNDP also continues to support the Government to promote the country\u2019s transition towards a green, low-carbon and climate resilient society. As part of the UN\u2019s Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) initiative, Ghana has embarked on a UNDP-supported action plan to provide universal energy access, improve energy efficiency and increase renewable energy for all Ghanaians by 2030. 20 \u2014 AFRICA \ue68c SCALING-UP ACTION \uecd6 National climate change investment plans and monitoring and evaluation frameworks assist in the prioritization of climate actions and bring together public, private and civil society partners to deliver climate investments. \uecd6 Commercial weather index insurance is helping poor rural farmers avoid significant losses and provides a good example of mobilizing private sector investments. \uecd6 The development of more affordable WMO-certified weather stations can improve government capacities to participate in larger climate infrastructure programmes, complement international assistance and attain higher quality/more reliable weather and climate information. \uecd6 The systematic documentation and archiving of national GHG inventory reports in DRC, Kenya, Uganda and Zambia has encouraged the sustainability and transparency of emissions monitoring. \uecd6 Ghana has launched an online climate change database under its LECB project that captures all GHG emissions data and also includes a dashboard of progress on national climate policies and measures, as well as provides a registry of all past and present climate initiatives. \uecd6 Subnational strategies have integrated adaptation and mitigation for low-carbon climate resilient development (as is being done in Delta State, Nigeria). \uecd6 The South African government has reduced investment risks for private sector investors in wind energy using UNDP\u2019s de-risking framework. \ueb01 THE FUTURE AND ON-GOING EFFORTS \uecd6 A regional initiative is planned in partnership with the African Union to enhance disaster risk investment by the public and private sectors.

LEBANON SOLAR POWER INCREASES THE RESILIENCE OF SYRIAN REFUGEE HOST COMMUNITIES Lebanon is the world\u2019s largest host of Syrian refugees, with refugees now making up about a quarter of the country\u2019s population. One challenge among many is that, as a result of a changing climate and increasingly severe winter weather, many host communities struggle to heat their homes, a situation further compounded by lengthy power cuts. Communities often rely on diesel-fuel stoves; diesel is highly flammable and often expensive, leaving many families vulnerable. But with the support of the Government of Germany, UNDP has helped introduce renewable energy solutions to Lebanon. New stoves (which use sustainably- produced briquettes made from carpentry and agricultural waste) are now being used by over 594 households across northern Lebanon.

DISASTER RISK MANAGEMENT AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE \uecd6 In Vietnam, women are represented in communal and provincial disaster prevention and relief committees in 63 provinces.27 \uecd6\ufffd\ufffdIn Bhutan, the Disaster Management Act was formulated and enacted, which decentralizes disaster risk management (DRM) activities and empowers subnational institutions to implement DRR strategies more effectively. The Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) EWS covering 90 percent of households in the 21 vulnerable communities downstream from the Punatsangchu River was also installed. Training was conducted on mainstreaming DRR\u2014including information on national DRM frameworks and GLOF risks\u2014targeting 70 national and district DRM focal points (40 percent of which were women).

INDIA INDIA BRINGS SUN INTO THE KITCHEN A UNDP-supported project promotes the use of concentrated solar heating technology in a range of industries, commercial establishments and religious and philanthropic institutions. It aims to promote and develop a viable and strong market for solar concentrators in order to reduce or replace the use of conventional fuels that degrade the environment. \uecd6 Solar-powered cooking systems are feeding more than 10 million people. Over the last two years, the rate of installation of solar concentrated heating systems has more than doubled in the country. Since 2012, 10,469 square metres of systems have been installed, saving 5.982 million units of electricity (equivalent to 645 tonnes of fuel oil) and reducing CO2 emissions by 2,976 tonnes per year. \uecd6 Over the next 3 years, the project aims to install 45,000 square metres of concentrated solar technology based systems across India, saving 39,200 tonnes of CO2 emissions and 3.15 million litres of fuel oil each year. \uecd6 Ramakrishna Mission\u2019s Students\u2019 Home in Chennai, one of the institutions benefitting from this project, has been able to halve the consumption of liquefied petroleum gas, reducing expenditures by approximately $8,000 every year. The ARUN\u00ae100 system installed at the Mission is designed to capture the maximum heat from the sun and use it to continuously turn water into steam, which is piped to an accumulator and then to the kitchen. The accumulator is a key innovation, allowing for unused steam to be stored in a large insulated storage tank as high-pressured hot water. The innovation in solar technology means that not only is cooking quicker, thanks to the continuous supply of steam at constant optimum pressure, but that heat is available for cooking at any time (important for institutions like the Mission, which provides up to 3,000 meals each day).

enhance inter-sectoral dialogue and coordination at national and subnational levels to improve synergies between mitigation and adaptation interventions. \uecd6 Similarly, REDD+ national strategies should be designed to encompass major drivers of deforestation outside the sole forest sector. \uecd6 There are immense data, technology and institutional capacity needs related to climate and mitigation scenarios and the understanding of risks and impacts. \uecd6 Engaging the private sector in adaptation is constrained by a lack of awareness and capacity, as well as by a lack of an enabling policy and regulatory environment. \uecd6 An increased shift towards non-grant financing in the scale up of energy access, energy efficiency and renewable energy and an increased availability of public and private investments in sustainable cities and urban transport. \uecd6 Governments have a short-term energy development vision and weak commitment to enforcing GHG mitigation policies.
