 students within their homes and community. Children's clubs for DRR, environmental management, water monitoring, animal care, etc, are a great way of using children's potential and energy in an effective way for the benefit of the community. Creating such clubs in school and providing them with the means to make their community safer is an important step towards empowerment, especially if girls can be given key roles. Some countries have Disaster Museums that act as a fun and interesting learning resource for children. A similar idea is to encourage children to research a particular recent local or national disaster and get them to produce display boards to educate their fellow community members about it and the lessons to be learned. Internet resources are too a powerful tool. The presentation now moves on to more practical examples of methods. Each should take around find minutes to explain - remember to allow time for handing out sheets The first is Risk RED's \"Go Bag\" hunt activity. Please give each of the teachers the 2-page handout on this activity provided by Risk RED. Spend a few minutes explaining the process of Making Schools Safer 134 the activity. The points on the accompanying slide are there to indicate the benefits and effective aspects of the activities. The materials required for the activity can be collected by most schools - the only extra material required is the Family Disaster Plan. You should hand out these 13-page plans to the teachers in the group that express a real interest in conducting that activity at their school. The next example is the board game developed by UNISDR and UNICEF, named \"Riskland\". For this example, two handouts should be given to the teachers - a small paper version of the board of play, and the instructions of the game. This will give them a good idea of how the game works. Again, the slide points out the benefits of using this game. One of the biggest factors is the element of fun involved. Many forms of entertainment that intend to educate children are often passive - something they listen to or watch. A board game such as this is an active learning experience, concerning decision-making, so they have fun while thinking about the disaster situations. The game is available in many languages already and UNISDR has set itself the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f48f72b8-0496-4ebd-82de-4476f8a337a0": {"__data__": {"id_": "f48f72b8-0496-4ebd-82de-4476f8a337a0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making Schools Safer", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7d85b79893039878dc84e9c273f82029ddba65f750994951b1031e2f6fd51a09"}}, "hash": "7d85b79893039878dc84e9c273f82029ddba65f750994951b1031e2f6fd51a09", "text": "task of spreading the game into as many languages as possible. Therefore, they are happy to respond to requests and suggestions to translate the materials into more languages, whether local or national. The game is also adaptable to local conditions. Be sure to make the teachers aware of the web address where they can download the full materials for the game. The same web address presents a document named \"Let's Learn to Prevent Disasters! Fun ways for kids to join in risk reduction\" which is presented on the next slide. This is a booklet of materials on ways of getting children involved in DRR in the school and community. Suitable for children aged 8 to 12, the content of the booklet can be used to supplement other courses within the existing curriculum. The booklet includes: some scientific disaster education, environmental and natural resource management, disaster and risk concepts, and fun and practical ways for children to learn about and reduce the risk of disasters. The booklet is also suitable due to its use of appropriate language, pictures and colours. The American Red Cross has developed an online series of learning materials, entitled \"Masters of Disaster\". Suitable for children of school entry age until the end of secondary school, the series aims to empower young people by providing with the ability to be prepared for disasters, thus reducing the risk. They aim to eliminate students' fear of natural disasters. The materials are also available for download and come in the form of ready-made lesson plans. However, there are also materials for parents and families to use. This is key for spreading the knowledge into the home and wider community. There are different sets of resources for 3 different age groups - the difference manifests itself as though varying emphasis on games, activities, scientific knowledge, preparedness measures, etc. 4.

The TLC aims to strengthen the capacity of training institutions and universities by reviewing existing and developing new learner- centred learning materials and methodologies. The TLC enhances learning through South-South knowledge and solution exchanges, with a focus on addressing systemic gaps and topics in training and education that would benefit from a sector-wide approach. All India Disaster Mitigation Institute (AIDMI) is promoting and facilitating the formation of TLC in India, and Asia, together with the ProVention Consortium, the Asian Disaster Preparedness Centre (ADPC), the Centre for Disaster Preparedness (CDP) in the Philippines, and the UNDP's Special Unit for South-South Cooperation. iii Table of Contents Reaching New Heights in Training and Learning Foreword Why Create a Knowledge Product on Microinsurance?

Presentation Guidelines 92 List of Contributors in Curriculum Review and Pilot Testing 96 Microinsurance for Disaster Risk Reduction vi Reaching New Heights in Training and Learning Training and learning around Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and humanitarian studies has been steadily picking up across India. All India Disaster Mitigation Institute (AIDMI) receives several requests each month from universities and training institutes to help them design a course, identify a suitable research topic or case study, develop a module, or receive their students for an internship. AIDMI receives so many requests because of the organisations leading role in disaster risk management since 1989 and its partnerships with UNDP, ADPC and ProVention under the Training and Learning Circle (TLC). The TLC is a group of 39 training institutions, universities, and CSOs in India that share knowledge and expertise regarding disaster risk management. These requests come in as the general conditions of India's universities remain a serious cause for concern, even 60 years after independence. Though remarkable exceptions exist, including the much celebrated IITs and IIMs, the educational standards in many universities should be much higher to reflect the talent of their teachers and students. Yet economic expansion over the past five years has not been matched by suitable investments in universities or expanded opportunities for either students or faculty. The traditional learning modalities of universities can incorporate many of the key functions involved in the advancement and transmission of DRR knowledge, including research, innovation, teaching, training and continuing education. Beyond these core activities, there is one additional component unique to this area of study: the globalisation of DRR and humanitarian response. Despite the crucial need for applied research around international DRR and humanitarian response, these topics lack interest and investment within our universities. Too much of the research that is conducted on the topic follows international interests and priorities identified in Geneva, London or New York. This research if often borrowed by our authorities and unsuccessfully applied to India's distinct context. Unfortunately, the flow of resources strongly influences the issues researched. The need for research on uniquely Indian issues becomes secondary to the priorities set by people thousands of miles away. Need-based research rooted in India's experience, but that is globally relevant, can easily originate with India's faculty and students. I have met these faculty members and students throughout India; they are consistently involved in both post-disaster response and in planning and preparedness initiatives between disasters. Yet attendant research has yet to develop a suitable profile or substantial following. Meanwhile, young people's hunger for university education and opportunities is rapidly expanding. Whether they come from small towns or larger cities, youth seek both knowledge and professional prospects. Developing a standardised system of student skills and course equivalents has also become an important issue as universities develop courses in the relatively new fields of DRR and humanitarian response. vii In addition to understanding what needs to be researched and why, we must recognise the formidable challenges in financing education. Unfortunately, the Tata's investment of Rs. 100 crores in the Disaster Studies Institute is a rare exception. Several other corporate houses can repeat such investments in knowledge. AIDMI's efforts towards this have remained fruitless. There is an apparent deficit of resources to support research and courses on risk management; valuable, badly-needed innovations by teachers cannot be implemented without increased financial commitment to education in these areas. As Indian universities rush towards the future, meeting the challenges of expanding the academic base of humanitarianism becomes more urgent. We must tackle these dilemmas within the next five years if India's university system is to keep up with the nation's rising leadership in the global humanitarian system. Regular training should now include conceptual and applied topics on natural and social risks. Discussions should focus on the unique aspects of the Indian context and how these conditions influence humanitarian relations with other nations and international organisations. It is with these thoughts in mind that AIDMI supports the efforts of Indian universities in DRR. AIDMI's Mehul Pandya and Tommy Reynolds create this ToT Module on Microinsurance for Disaster Risk Reduction with Dr. Vedant Pandya of Bhavnagar University, Rakhi Bhavnani of ISDR, and Kuldeep Sagar, an international consultant. The ToT Module has been pilot tested in December 2008. I welcome others to join TLC in our efforts to develop and use knowledge to make India safer from disasters. Mihir R.

This manual was developed by the All India Disaster Mitigation Institute (AIDMI) based on its long experience on the subject. The development of this manual came about as a result of a process of identification of priority knowledge products by the core members of the Training and Learning Circle( a network of trainers and learners on CBDRR facilitated by the SU-SSC). While there is an increasing demand from various partner agencies on inputs on micro insurance, a recent review (September 2009) of existing training materials on CBDRR undertaken by AIDMI revealed that there is a dearth of reference materials on this relatively new topic. The production of this manual is therefore very timely and relevant for India and for other developing countries as well, particularly at this juncture when recovery from disasters has been a painful process for the poor. Micro insurance is designed for the poor people to help them recover after the onslaught of a disaster. The CBDRM and Micro insurance Training Manual covers the following modules: Micro insurance' relevance to CBDRR; Guidelines for developing community driven micro insurance products; and, Assessing Micro Insurance Demand. The manual also includes four case studies of micro insurance initiatives in India, one of which is administered by AIDMI. These cases provide different micro insurance models which are tried and tested as well as lessons learnt. The special Unit for South-South cooperation would like to once again thank the partners under the TLC project for this collaboration. Yiping Zhou Director Special Unit for South-South Cooperation in UNDP ix Why Create a Knowledge Product on Microinsurance? AIDMI has conducted a review of a selection of training materials from participating agencies in the TLC network, and has identified a number of gaps in the subjects covered. Based on these gaps, AIDMI intends to develop a series of knowledge products that can be used by training institutions in the network to address key issues of CBDRR, as suggested by the TLC's key objectives, activities and outcomes. As microinsurance for CBDRR was identified as one of the key gaps in training material, AIDMI has produced this knowledge product. Training modules are designed to increase the level of awareness about microinsurance amongst organisations. They emerge from AIDMI's experience with it's Afat Vimo (disaster insurance) work in India and in the region. In India, personal, household and small business assets are often unprotected against disasters. The costs for relief and rehabilitation often rely on aid; but support from outside entities is often unpredictable\u2014leaving the damaged assets of the poor difficult to replace and making recovery difficult. Groups that fail to recover are more vulnerable to subsequent disasters. Insurance covers many losses but is often unavailable to the poor due to the high transaction costs. Microinsurance is one of a number of methods that has emerged to allow the poor to access risk transfer products. Microinsurance puts cash into the hands of people so they can better lead their own recovery. Microinsurance has emerged in a policy environment that has made recent progress towards disaster risk reduction. Recent insurance regulatory reforms within the Government of India and the dedication of global donors have contributed to the advancement of microinsurance for the poor. The promotion of microinsurance across India and Asia has enormous potential for offsetting economic losses faced by the poor. The knowledge product on microinsurance will help trainers to promote a culture of risk management within their organisations and with those whom they serve. Microinsurance for Disaster Risk Reduction x Overview of the Microinsurance Development Series The \"Microinsurance Development Series\" has been developed by the All India Disaster Mitigation Institute as one of the key activities of the Training and Learning Circle. This module uses the experience of key microinsurance providers in India. By providing participants with examples of good and successful practice, this module should give them a good introduction into practical design and delivery mechanisms. After reviewing the case studies, teachers will be encouraged to identify elements that they could use in their own organisations, as well as developing new ideas. How to Use this Course Material The four modules in the knowledge product may be used in isolation as singular training seminars, or alternatively used together within a daylong training session. Each module is designed to last 1h 30mins, so a daylong session of 4 modules will last at least 6h, plus at least 1h in breaks. The modules are designed for delivery to a group of participants, whether they represent one or a variety of different organisations.

What kind of risks do those you work with face? Loss of property? Loss of life? 3. Do they buy insurance? Why (not)? What inhibits provision to them? 4. What makes the insurance we will discuss \"micro\"? Can you make a definition? * A glossary of key microinsurance terms is available in Annex 1. + Annex 2 includes a more comprehensive list of differences between traditional insurance and microinsurance. 1 ILO, 2005 2 Churchill, 2006, p. 12 3 Peppiatt, 2006 \"Traditional\" insurance products are familiar to many households in both developed and developing countries. These insurance products are purchased for the periodic payment of a premium* and reimburse an individual an agreed amount for losses covered under the specific policy. Common examples in India include life insurance sold by the Life Insurance Corporation of India, property insurance policies sold by ICICI Lombard and a wide range of other policies available from both private and state enterprises. Yet the majority of these products are only purchased by the wealthy and middle class and do not adequately service the needs of lower income households. Present studies estimate that more than 90% of the Indian population does not benefit from any kind of social protection, including insurance.1 To address this gap, both governments and private companies have begun to develop a range of insurance products that target the poor and prioritise their needs. These products have come to be referred to as microinsurance. Although various institutions involved with the provision microinsurance adopt slightly varied definitions, a durable definition describes microinsurance as \"the protection of low-income people against specific perils in exchange for regular premium payments proportionate to the likelihood and cost of the risk involved\"2. In this sense, microinsurance is distinct from traditional insurance in that it focuses on low-income people and the risks that they face. The intent of microinsurance providers is to offer products accessible to the poor that cover small- scale assets (i.e. a small home, tools, trade stock, etc.) at affordable premiums by keeping transaction costs low.3 The following table offers a glimpse of key similarities and differences between microinsurance and the more familiar traditional insurance.+ Introduction to Microinsurance and its Relevance for CBDRR 5 The Microinsurance Market The recent growth in popularity of microinsurance is due in part to the opportunity it simultaneously offers to private insurers and social service organisations. On one hand, microinsurance seems to allow private companies to sell their products and grow; on the other hand, microinsurance provides a valuable risk transfer service to the poor and complements poverty reduction efforts of governments, NGOs, and MFIs. 1.2 Importance of Microinsurance for Pro-Poor Disaster Management Despite the high levels of economic growth seen in India over the past decade, the cycle of disasters and vulnerability deprives many millions of poor of the human development that might have accompanied such growth. Within Asia, 24 percent of deaths due to disasters occurred in India because of its size, population, and vulnerability.4 Within India, poor households are more severely affected and often lack savings and access to other social safety mechanisms. Microinsurance is one of several risk management tools that allows the transfer of some of these risks from poor households to insurance and reinsurance markets, and can result in lower recovery costs for those affected. The concept is based on the fact that by forging relationships with other community members, low income households can reduce vulnerability reduction more holistically than they could through individual strategies. As such, risk is transferred from one household to the community or inter-community level with groups in different geographic locations that are not exposed to the same disaster risks.5 Despite the importance of insurance as a central aspect of disaster risk management, individuals in developing countries often remain uncovered. When disasters strike, poor households can be forced into situations where they forgo investments in education, sell livelihood assets, or take on high interest loans. Differences Focus: Microinsurance focuses on low-income people and the risks they face. Maturity: Where traditional insurance products, systems, and awareness are fairly well established among their target locations, those for microinsurance are still emerging. Provision: When risk transfer suits their missions, microinsurance may be distributed by NGOs or MFIs instead of as key distribution channels.

As such, it can offer several advantages, including: \u2022 predictable financial resources for recovery, \u2022 post-disaster liquidity for continuation of livelihoods6, \u2022 promotion of investments in productive assets7, \u2022 incentives to reduce risks if insurers offer tiered premiums8, \u2022 more local decision making about recovery investments 9. Yet, due to complexities involved with calculating accurate pricing and avoiding fraud, adverse selection, and moral hazard, insurance products have remained expensive and only accessible to large businesses and wealthier households. To address the gap between the demand for appropriate risk transfer from the poor and the few relevant products offered at the time, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India began to require that Indian insurers meet quotas in service to rural and low-income households. According to the policy, regulated providers that begin insurance provision following 1999 must meet certain quotas. This quota system has put considerable pressure on insurance companies to service traditionally excluded families and areas. The result has been exploration into microinsurance as a mechanism to meet regulatory quotas at lower costs. The leadership of pioneering insurance companies, civil society intermediaries, and the private sector has resulted in microinsurance policies that now cover over 30 million individuals in India10. Although it is not yet known to what extent the different products really benefit the poor, the combination of the regulatory requirements and dedicated practitioners has helped make India a laboratory for microinsurance product testing with more policyholders than any other country.11 1.3 Common Microinsurance Products In India, the first microinsurance schemes developed from traditional informal cooperative models and cover against funeral expenses, unemployment, accidents, and loss of life. In the past 10 years, application has expanded to include a wide variety of distribution channels including community-based savings groups, microfinance institutions (such as SEWA, BASIX et al.), credit unions, chambers of commerce (including Gujarat's Chamber of Commerce and Industry for Small Businesses), commercial insurance companies, and government social protection services. 6 Mechler et al. 2006 7 Cole and Topolova, 2007 8 ProVention Consortium (forthcoming) 9 Scheper et al. 2006 10 Roth et al. 2007 p. 19 11 Reynolds and Pandya, forthcoming Introduction to Microinsurance and its Relevance for CBDRR 7 The range of available and potential microinsurance products can help low-income households manage risks related to their priorities. According to comprehensive research by the International Labour Organisation12, primary self identified risks among small-scale entrepreneurs related to financial losses that resulted from: \u2022 the death of a family member, \u2022 illness or injury, \u2022 natural disasters, or \u2022 theft or property damage. Addressing these risks requires accurate selection of insurance products. The following list includes the most common products for the Indian market as well as brief descriptions provided by Microfinance Gateway13. Life Insurance Life Insurance covers the policy holder and his/her family on the event of death and disability. It is an important measure of financial security for low-income households and the insurance product currently most widely available. Life insurance is a relatively low-risk product for the provider. Health and Disability Insurance Health insurance covers health care related costs linked to illness, injury and medical treatment. Health policies offer many different options and combinations. Insuring health risks is a complex task and highly dependent on access to the existent health care infrastructure. Disability insurance protects the policyholder and his/her family in case of disability. Examples include that of CARD MBA14 of the Philippines. Agriculture Insurance Insurance products for agriculture can be categorised as livestock insurance, crop insurance, weather insurance. Agricultural insurance aims to reduce the vulnerability of low-income households faced by natural disasters like drought, flood or livestock affecting epidemics. Group Discussion: 1. What risks do you face on a daily basis? 2. Again, think of risks faced by people you work with (loss of property, loss of life, etc.). What consequences would arise if these risks occurred, immediately, and in later months and years? 3. Do mainstream insurance providers have products for their risks? 1.3.1 Different Products for Different Needs 12 Churchill et al. 2003 13 For additional information on microinsurance products, see: http:// www.microfinancegateway.org/resource_centers/insurance/products#8. 14 McCord and Buczkowski, 2004 Microinsurance for Disaster Risk Reduction 8 Livestock Insurance Livestock insurance is an agricultural insurance and covers against loss of livestock owned by the policy holder(s).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b14103e4-01ba-4eaf-8ef3-ae77913e1759": {"__data__": {"id_": "b14103e4-01ba-4eaf-8ef3-ae77913e1759", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/microinsurance-disaster-risk-reduction", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Microinsurance for Disaster Risk Reduction", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/microinsurance-disaster-risk-reduction", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7cb281315783b194374262ae0b230732cfa2828ea68ab111e46500ff027e168a"}, "2": {"node_id": "268fbaf9-3864-4534-9690-fd758ae21383", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/microinsurance-disaster-risk-reduction", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e97a10b1897371271e811367a339c096ab696c901d381bb21e002d3e3aa77bd3"}}, "hash": "fc6b11209abc48ef5ed75ee4d3a35a60ac852a9c9aaf380c7141b7e1d4790596", "text": "Most livestock insurance schemes insure against a specific peril and can be paid out in the form of a lump sum payment or livestock replacement.

Weather Insurance Weather or climate Insurance is an agricultural insurance product and like crop insurance, often linked to index insurance. A key issue, for example, with weather index insurance is to have a strong correlation between the index (the rainfall) and the output expected (the harvest). Property and Asset Insurance Property and asset insurance covers against damage of property and damage and/or loss of assets in the event of the covered perils. Deposit insurance, addressing the risk of bank or MFI solvency problems as a type of asset insurance, is especially important for low-income households. 1.4 Microinsurance Roles and Models Organising and streamlining microinsurance for client needs is a complex effort; it requires contributions and commitments from a range of different institutions, including insurers, intermediary community organisations, and target households. This section of the training discusses the critical stakeholder groups and some of the most successful models for microinsurance provision in India. A microinsurance system involves the following stakeholder groups15: \u2022 Insurer- who carries the risk, finalises premium and product design and ultimately pays claims \u2022 Delivery channel- who sells the insurance policy and provides basic after-sales services; they are in contact with the policyholder and should be close to poor people (this role may be assumed by the insurer, an agent, an MFI, etc.) \u2022 Policyholder- who buys the product (may be an individual or a group) \u2022 Covered lives- those who benefit from coverage (may be family or group member) \u2022 Reinsurer- provides insurance to insurers for catastrophic risks (reinsurers are not always involved in microinsurance) 15 Roth et al. 2007 Introduction to Microinsurance and its Relevance for CBDRR 9 Understanding how these groups work together to streamline their systems and information flows is key to efficient insurance provision. The following four models are the most common mechanisms for providing microinsurance in India. They help us to understand how each of these actors can play a role. Organisations considering taking up microinsurance initiatives should consider the advantages of each into account in order to achieve the best fit with the context of their clients. Partner - Agent Model Commercial or public insurers together with MFIs or nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) collaboratively develop the product. The insurer absorbs the risk, and the MFI/NGO markets the product through its established distribution network. This lowers the cost of distribution and thus promotes affordability. This model of collaboration has become the dominant approach to microinsurance in India and has encouraged many microfinance institutions to switch from a full service model to the partner-agent model. Examples of this scheme are AIDMI's Afat Vimo as well as SEWA, a microinsurance pioneer, who offers its life, health and asset coverage in partnership with various insurers. Community-based Model A group of people or local communities, MFIs, NGOs and/ or cooperatives develop and distribute their own product, manage the risk pool and absorb the risk. The Swayamkrushi Youth Charitable Organisation (YCO) in Andhra Pradesh is an example of a community-based model. It is primarily a savings and credit association with added insurance features. The cooperative's 8,100 members pay a yearly premium of Rs. 100 ($2.22) into a pool managed by the cooperative and receive cover for death and property loss. The life insurance benefit is Rs. 15,000 ($333) for a natural death and Rs. 30,000 in the event of an accidental death. In-house or Full-service Model In the full-service model, an MFI or NGO runs its own insurance scheme for its clients and any profit or loss is absorbed by the MFI. The system is not very common anymore but it still exists in some organisations such as SPANDANA, located in Guntur, Andhra Pradesh. This scheme started in urban areas and then moved to rural ones and has expanded enormously in recent years. Provider Model Banks and other providers of microfinance can directly offer or require insurance contracts. These are usually coupled with credit, for example, to insure against default risk. This model is used widely in the general insurance market but high transaction costs and low ability to pay premiums inhibit its extensive use in the field of disaster insurance for the poor.

Microinsurance development is a cycle that flows from conception to roll-out and renewal. More specifically, it involves the following seven steps.16 The Microinsurance Development Cycle Product development Pricing Develop systems Implement Monitor the claims experience Institutional assessment 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 Market research Source: Churchill et al. 2003 1. Institutional assessment of capacity to develop a product and assemble the required team. 2. Market research to determine the need and demand for insurance, and to gather information about prospective clients. Information about any products offered by competitors is also required. 3. Product development, including the definition of insured event, benefit, eligibility criteria, term, etc. and assessment of operational requirements, legal compliance, capital requirements. 4. Pricing of risk premiums: \u2022 Estimate the probabilities of the insured events, based on other insurers' experience, general population data or any other sources of information adapted for the anticipated market; \u2022 Combine with the desired benefit design to obtain risk premiums; and \u2022 Determine the allowances for administration expenses, surplus, contingencies, cost of capital and investment income. 5. Develop systems, marketing material, staff training. 6. Implement the product. 7. Monitor the claims experience as it emerges: 16 Churchill et al. 2003 Introduction to Microinsurance and its Relevance for CBDRR 11 \u2022 Compare the actual claims experience to that expected in the premium basis using an experience investigation; and \u2022 Return to step 2, adjusting the expected premium basis in light of the experience investigation and any other new information about the market, new factors affecting the risk and so on. 1.6 Issues for the Future Reaching Scale In spite of the limitations identified above, microinsurance products remain a powerful tool for managing risks faced by the poor. Between 2006 and 2007 alone, it is estimated that the number of low-income people with access to microinsurance grew by 50%.17 To continue to expand their reach and provide quality service, current and future products will have to be \"scaled up\" to reach more people. The potential is huge, but there is insufficient experience with current programs to judge their future viability. Current efforts of MIA, the Microinsurance Innovations Facility of the ILO, and research by the ProVention Consortium with IIASA and AIDMI are collecting evidence and lessons and providing support to emerging schemes. New products: Index Insurance18 Index-linked insurance products have recently emerged as an additional tool for transferring risks facing the poor. By conservative estimates, 56 out of 100 people in India are employed directly in agriculture. Through their work, ownership, or support to small farms, many of the 147.9 million rural households in the country depend on satisfactory harvests to provide (directly or indirectly) for their needs19. Indexed insurances are a key step forward specifically for disaster insurance. This is because indexed products have qualities that overcome some of the most significant challenges facing traditional insurance and microinsurance when they are applied to transfer disaster risk. While index insurance does not actually reduce the risk of a disaster occurring, it should, through proper pricing and design, incentivise clients to reduce their disaster risk. This has so far not been the case with traditional indemnity-based microinsurance. By de-linking losses from payouts by using an independent index, farmers still have incentives to use risk reduction measures in the hopes of saving their crop and yet still collecting an index insurance payment. Second, de-linking losses from payouts also reduces moral hazard\u2014the threat that policyholders will neglect their insured assets and can even intentionally increase their risk as the insurance payment will cover any losses. Third, index insurance mechanisms allow a large number of policyholders to be covered with lower administrative costs to the insurance company, thus reducing premiums. This is critical 17 McCord, 2008 18 Reynolds and Pandya, forthcoming 19 UNDP 2007 Microinsurance for Disaster Risk Reduction 12 when the value of assets to be insured is low and administrative costs are more or less the same as for administering policies to middle-class urban dwellers. Fourth, compared with traditional insurance, adverse selection is reduced because policyholders seldom have more accurate information about the risk in the index than insurers. Finally, as there is no claim assessment or processing, indexed insurances can provide payment quickly after an adverse weather event\u2014a time when liquidity is critical for affected households. In summary, indexed insurances: \u2022 have lower transaction costs; \u2022 have no moral hazard; \u2022 have fewer asymmetric information problems and less adverse selection; \u2022 involve simpler contract design and enforcement; \u2022 can more easily transfer covariant risks out of country into international", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "43c41ed5-a769-40d9-85ad-a90c33265a9d": {"__data__": {"id_": "43c41ed5-a769-40d9-85ad-a90c33265a9d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/microinsurance-disaster-risk-reduction", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Microinsurance for Disaster Risk Reduction", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/microinsurance-disaster-risk-reduction", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ffb9e86aca6899a6fb2587c0ee3df0161966c10c64bff11702180dc20168dc44"}, "3": {"node_id": "dbdb3013-aa33-4713-add6-696d8a6f0529", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/microinsurance-disaster-risk-reduction", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4e01aa8320a49ab45ba2fe067870cd0afdad5c6f7380e9947824ee27df17f101"}}, "hash": "d1a926ae716df7158b381cef1a1a3f2575c2fd84911a72dbb81cca51d07a30d8", "text": "market; \u2022 require no claims; payments are automatic.

(2007) The Landscape of Microinsurance in the World's 100 Poorest Countries. The insurance industry, public and private, in India started in the 19th century when the British government set up state-run social protection schemes for its colonial officials. Many of these schemes evolved into the companies that still operate to this day. In 1956, the Indian government nationalised the life insurance industry. One of the reasons given at the time was a desire to spread insurance more widely. As Prime Minister Nehru noted in parliament, \"We require life insurance to spread rapidly over all the country and to bring a measure of security to our people\". The government combined 154 insurers and formed the Life Insurance Company of India. Despite Nehru's hopes, in the decades following nationalisation, insurance products continued to be designed primarily for those in formal employment\u2014 overwhelmingly men in urban areas. The poor, living mostly on agriculture, were for the most part overlooked by the new companies. There were a few crop insurance schemes run by the state, but generally these reached only a small percentage of poor households. Though the poor were effectively excluded from insurance markets, at least one significant example of microinsurance stands out, which was to have some impact on the legislation that was to come. The Self-Employed Women's Association recognised the importance of insurance for their low-income members in the early 1990s. Their successes and lessons helped to exemplify the importance of insurance within the low-income market. Their experiences helped to inform government plans in the early 2000s to expand insurance access by fiat to the rural and socially-deprived sectors of the economy. In the early 2000s, the Indian government liberalised its insurance markets. In part, as means of alleviating fears surrounding foreign insurers, the government forced all new insurers to sell a percentage of their products to the de facto poor. From having almost no access to microinsurance bar the work of CBO insurers and a few NGO insurers, commercial insurers eager to compete in the Indian market were suddenly scrambling over themselves to design and sell microinsurance products. India now has over 130 microinsurance products and reaches many millions of poor clients, through innovative schemes. Nothing globally has so dramatically changed the face of microinsurance as India's regulatory compulsion. Whether its costs outweigh its benefits remains an unanswered question. Microinsurance for Disaster Risk Reduction 18 Facilitator's Note 1. Suggestions for Facilitators prior to Training Although the most effective trainers are able to address the emerging needs of trainees in a flexible manner, the following notes offer a basic outline of activities that TLC facilitators may use to lead trainings. To prepare for training, facilitators may find it useful to: \u2022 Review the Module Learning Objectives listed above, \u2022 Review the Suggested Methods and Activities listed below, \u2022 Assess the anticipated knowledge needs, interests, and constraints of trainees, \u2022 Identify", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f85e53f-ea74-4ace-a264-648514c056a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f85e53f-ea74-4ace-a264-648514c056a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/microinsurance-disaster-risk-reduction", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Microinsurance for Disaster Risk Reduction", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/microinsurance-disaster-risk-reduction", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2bce03b75aa9bd40a5317f920879937e688ad3c888929b7ccb35c0dc44fb2737"}}, "hash": "2bce03b75aa9bd40a5317f920879937e688ad3c888929b7ccb35c0dc44fb2737", "text": "additional potentially effective activities suitable for their particular trainees, \u2022 Review related background literature on Microinsurance in India, this can include but is not limited to the resource material listed at the end of this document and the modules, o Prepare your own notes so that you may convey the relevant information in a way that is comfortable for you. o Do not feel constrained by the information on the slides\u2014they are merely a guide and you may adapted them for your needs \u2022 Prepare materials for the training, including: o Powerpoint or other presentation materials including revisions if desired o Print-outs or any other necessary handouts o Tools and props needed for activities o Rewards or treats to encourage involvement and participation \u2022 Ensure that all arrangements regarding venue are prepared \u2022 Ensure that the training duration is appropriate for material to be covered \u2022 Be familiar with the SWOT analysis tool and how it can be applied (http:// en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis) 2. Facilitator Requirements during Training Total Time: Approximately 1hour 30minutes Items and Materials needed: \u2022 PowerPoint presentation and related projection equipment, \u2022 Print-out of \"India's Microinsurance History\" from Module 1 Annex 3, \u2022 Whiteboard and marker OR blackboard and chalk, \u2022 Module materials, \u2022 Pens and notepads for participants, Introduction to Microinsurance and its Relevance for CBDRR 19 \u2022 Your own notes based on those materials, \u2022 Rewards for participation, \u2022 Blank name badges, \u2022 SWOT analysis worksheets 3. Suggested Methods and Activities: 3.1 Arrival and Introduction Arrive with plenty of time available to prepare the room and make sure all materials are ready. When the group is small, many trainers find that arranging the seating in a circle is conducive to open and equal communication. As the participants arrive, ensure that each has the necessary materials, including module(s) and supplies for note taking. This is also a good time to disseminate the one-page handout of \"India's Microinsurance History\" for participants to read before the session begins. When participants have arrived, or at the appropriate time, open the session with an introduction of yourself. You may wish to share your relevant work and life experiences and connection with microinsurance. Help them feel comfortable with you, in the environment, with the other trainees by showing that attentive participation and questions are a valuable aspect of the training package. If one trainee has a question, it is likely that someone else has the same question. Next, give a brief overview of the course, especially including the module objectives. You may use the first three slides of the presentation for this. A clear understanding of the objectives will help participants know what to expect from the training. You may also want to hint at the types of activities planned. Now that everyone has had a peek at what is to come, it is time to meet the trainees. Ask everyone to introduce themselves, including their name, how their work is related to microinsurance, why the attended the course, and what they hope to take away from the session. You may also ask that each rate their current knowledge of microinsurance on a scale of 0 to 10 to get an understanding of their expertise. Make a list of the things they hope to learn, preferably on a chalk or white marker board. When everyone is introduced, identify which items this course will cover. If they list things beyond the scope of the course try to recommend resources where they may answers. If the group is small, one good way to introduce everyone is to have each person recall the names of all those that have already introduced themselves. This often helps build an open atmosphere and everyone hears the names several times. 3.2 Course content Activity 1: 15mins Ask each participant to write down a definition of what microinsurance is and three characteristics that differentiate it from traditional insurance. When they are complete, ask Microinsurance for Disaster Risk Reduction 20 who wants to share their definition. Write key aspects of their definitions on the board. Ask questions and try to guide the group to definition or an agreed understanding. Reveal the Powerpoint slide with the definition. Compare this to the definition you identified as a group. Proceed through the remaining slides in Section I, on What is Microinsurance? Activity 2: 15mins Lead a discussion around the following, or similar questions: 1. What risks do you face on a daily basis? 2. What are the key risks that face people you work with (loss of property, loss of life, etc.).

Do mainstream insurance providers have products for their risks? Why or why not? Continue the presentation with Section II, on the Importance of Microinsurance for Pro-poor Disaster Management, and Section III, on Common Microinsurance Products. Ask for a show of hands for those participants that are currently working with each product. Activity 3: 10-15mins + trainer presentation time Have the trainees read the excerpt on \"India's Microinsurance History\". Lead a discussion on the recent growth of microinsurance products offered by asking the following, or similar, questions: 1. What prevented insurers from offering products to the poor? 2. What change occurred that has spawned a range of new products to service the poor? 3. What factors drove that change? 4. Does anyone know approximately how many low-income individuals are now covered by microinsurance in India? Correct answer is 30+ million. Continue the presentation with Section IV, on Microinsurance Models and Roles. Emphasise that the changes in Indian insurance regulations discussed in the article have encouraged many new products to be offered through the Partner-agent Model. Activity 4: 25mins Organise the participants into groups of approximately five people. Give each group a particular microinsurance beneficiary or target policyholder group (could be a federation of MFI participants, a trade union of textile workers, or a dairy cooperative. Explain that they are now responsible for developing a microinsurance product to suit their target group. Their first task is to work in their group to develop a process for designing and implementing their product. Tell them they have 15 minutes to: 1. Identify a microinsurance delivery model, from those discussed above. 2. A process map or series of generalised steps that they will follow in the conception and implementation of their product. Introduction to Microinsurance and its Relevance for CBDRR 21 3. A list of key relationships that will need to be cultivated for their product to be complete and successful. When their group work is complete, have each group choose a leader. The leader should explain their choice of microinsurance delivery models and explain the rationale for their choice based on their target group. They should draw their process map on the board and explain the key steps. Finally, they should identify the key relations that they will need to develop. Continue the presentation by showing the slide under Section V, with the diagram of the Product Development Process. Explain the steps in this process and highlight similarities between this diagram and the process maps created by the trainees. Ask participants to identify a list of key areas that will be important for microinsurance in the future. Write the list on the board. Continue the presentation with Section VI, on Issues for the Future. Activity 5: SWOT Analysis: 20mins Hand out the blank SWOT Analysis table. Explain the SWOT Analysis tool to the trainees. Explain that their task is to take their current organisation and fill in the SWOTs for either: 1. Initiating a new microinsurance product for a key constituency or 2. Expanding their current microinsurance product into a new frontier (such as up- scaling to new policyholders, or providing appropriate complementary services). Finally, they should make a list of actions they can take, based on opportunities listed in the SWOT, if they were to implement their new/revised microinsurance product. The resulting SWOT Analyses are for them to keep for their own use and application. Encourage them to ask questions in order to really understand and apply the tool. Especially encourage them to take the SWOT tool back to their organisations to discuss with colleagues how it can help them with their current work. 4.

Importance of Microinsurance for Pro-Poor Disaster Management \u2022 Disparity of Insured Risks \u2013 Chart: Indicates lack of asset coverage in Asia (From MunichRe). Still, most is held by the wealthy. \u2013 Within Asia, 24 percent of deaths due to disasters occurred in India because of its size, population, and vulnerability (From GoI 2002 5YP). \u2013 In India, poor households more severely affected and lack savings and access to social safety mechanisms. \u2013 Direct natural disaster losses amount to 2% of India\u2019s GDP and up to 12% of central government revenues. Not including informal sector losses (From World Bank). \u2022 Microinsurance, Risk, and the Poor \u2013 Characteristics of the Insurable Poor: Vulnerable to risks, Often work in the informal economy, Irregular cash flows, Manage risks through myriad of informal means, including social networks, Limited familiarity with formal insurance, May not trust insurance companies \u2013 Key risks: Death of family member, Natural disasters, Theft or property damage, Illness or injury \u2013 Microinsurance transfers some of these risks: From poor households to insurance markets and Can result in lower recovery costs for those affected. \u2022 Advantages of MI for Disaster Risk Management \u2013 Predictable financial resources for recovery, \u2013 Post-disaster liquidity for continuation of livelihoods, \u2013 Promote investments in productive assets, \u2013 Could offer incentive to reduce risks if insurers offer tiered premiums, \u2013 Could allow for more local decision making about recovery investments than top-down recovery programming seen after 2004 tsunami. III. Common Microinsurance Products \u2022 Life Insurance \u2013 Covers the policyholder on the event of death and disability. \u2013 Most widely available insurance product due to simplicity. \u2013 Typically a low-risk product for provider.

Microinsurance Models and Roles \u2022 Partner - Agent Model \u2013 Commercial or public insurers together with MFIs or NGOs collaboratively develop the product. \u2013 Insurer absorbs the risk, and the MFI/NGO markets the product through its established distribution network.

Presentation Guidelines Assessing Microinsurance Demand Microinsurance for Disaster Risk Reduction 30 2.1 Importance of Proper Demand Assessment Effective microinsurance products are built to address the needs of the poor. Even organisations that work with the poor on a regular basis will find designing effective products difficult without a suitably comprehensive assessment of the risks communities face and their preferred strategies for addressing this risk. Conducting a thorough demand assessment prior to product design or implementation will help you address critical questions: \u2022 Should we be involved in microinsurance? \u2022 What types of products should we offer, and to whom? \u2022 How can our product be refined to better address local preferences and capacities? \u2022 Will our product be attractive to others? With what revisions? \u2022 What complementary activities should we pursue to support our MI product? 2.1.1 Community Needs and Microinsurance Opportunities Although the number and variety of microinsurance products available is expanding rapidly, many products available are not suitable for low-income communities or are of low quality1 .

Demand for microinsurance products is based on two general aspects: the suitability of product supplied and how this product compares with alternative coping systems. Although developing a suitable product requires knowledge of the low-income market that commercial insurers and even NGOs typically lack, a systematic demand assessment can help address this. Effectively designed products will be both financially viable (suitable for the insurer) and appropriate for the risks that the poor face (suitable for the policyholder). As such, not all eventualities are insurable. Before considering aspects of efficient delivery, the following criteria must be met. Is the Risk Insurable? \u2022 Does the loss occur by chance? \u2022 Is the loss definite in time and amount? \u2022 Does the loss create significant hardship relative to income? \u2022 Are a large number of similar units exposed to the risk? \u2022 Is it possible to estimate the possibility of the loss occurring? \u2022 Will the risk pool attract sufficient numbers of clients who are unlikely to present claims (does it meet the criteria for adverse selection)? \u2022 Is the loss a genuine loss to the insured (no house, no house insurance)? \u2022 Is the loss one that will not be catastrophic to the insurer? Does the same risk affect more than one person or household at a time? Is it idiosyncratic? Source: MicroSave in USAID 2006 1 Roth et al. 2007. Assessing Microinsurance Demand 31 2.1.2 Risks and Related Products Microinsurance is one option among several that can be used by the poor to cope with adversity. It is typically effective for moderate anticipated losses. Alternative strategies such as savings and credit are more appropriate for smaller losses. Similarly, microinsurance is not a suitable strategy for catastrophic losses as the premiums would often make the product unaffordable. Catastrophic losses are often excluded through coverage limits. Different Risk Management Strategies for Different Risks Source: Brown and Churchill. (2000) In Mechler, et al. (2006) 2.2 Factors Influencing Demand The decision to purchase microinsurance will depend on a combination of product appropriateness and product appreciation. The following diagram illustrates the components of product appreciation and appropriateness that are discussed in this section. Microinsurance Product Value is Based on Appreciation and Appropriateness Source: McCord (2007) Microinsurance for Disaster Risk Reduction 32 Appreciation Purchasing insurance requires giving up something now, a premium for a possible payback in the future. This can be especially difficult for low-income households with very little discretional income and little experience with commercial insurers. To enter into such an arrangement requires an understanding and positive perception of the value of insurance. Additionally, it requires the policyholder to trust that the agreed amount will be paid if the risk is realised. Experience following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and 2005 South Asia earthquake indicate that communities that have recently experienced disasters may be more likely to purchase insurance than those that have not faced a similar hazard. Appropriateness The second component of community demand relates to the perceived appropriateness of the product for addressing real needs. This is also influenced by the ease of payments and claims procedures, the cost of the policy, and the availability of money to make the regular premium payments. Enabling Environment In the case of microinsurance, supply and demand influence each other. Both the appropriateness and the appreciation for the product are influenced by contextual factors that can be influenced by legislation and other stakeholders. In India, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority has made servicing the poor a necessity for many commercial insurers. Additionally, factors such the existence of service or sales taxes on such policies affect the cost- effectiveness of providing products at very low rates. The current service tax of 10.2% might be reduced or lowered to encourage more uptake. 2.3 Assessment Process: Developing a Demand Study This section highlights the key steps involved in designing and conducting an assessment microinsurance demand. A comprehensive demand assessment will include efforts to understand client needs and a trial of the product prototype that is designed on the preliminary assessment.

Specifically, you will need to gather information on: 1) demographic and geographic characteristics i.e. age, health, location in a flood plane, etc.; 2) economic characteristics i.e.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eb519df9-dcf5-499f-b842-503da2061a3a": {"__data__": {"id_": "eb519df9-dcf5-499f-b842-503da2061a3a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/microinsurance-disaster-risk-reduction", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Microinsurance for Disaster Risk Reduction", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/microinsurance-disaster-risk-reduction", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "695dc3847f3906385863cc594f9bc071bff21872ae19ba4e549be3c1a9784a06"}, "3": {"node_id": "6bdcfbd0-17e1-402c-91a7-5d90db8094ec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/microinsurance-disaster-risk-reduction", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "980e1568cf5c16775d01aed0c15173045ce1e173bc320aa205adb767eedf52f3"}}, "hash": "e80c1b9ccdd0ff4c04a43afb6007bfddc4b2ffffe5e7d1a253c8d501ab522c86", "text": "income and expenditure as well as distribution throughout the year; 3) the nature of risks faced; 3) typical life cycle stresses and anticipated expenditure i.e. sending children to school, starting a business, etc.; 4) the extent of impact of anticipated risk events; 5) coping strategies used to address manageable risks i.e. savings, borrowing from moneylenders, etc.; 6) how the community prioritises the risks that they face; and 7) how the community understands and perceives insurance.2 2.3.2 Basic Information Needs in Product Design and Delivery During the second phase, research should look at: 1) coverage and exclusions; 2) premiums; 3) methods and timeliness of premium collection; 4) methods of claims processing; 5) the impact that the insurance has on policyholders; 6) changes in understanding and perception of insurance; and 7) level of client satisfaction. 2.3.3 Using the Results Finally, the findings and analysis of the collected information need to be communicated effectively to improve the product and delivery mechanism. You may want to set up a short briefing session to communicate key results with the project team and the insurer and project team. This team meeting can provide a good opportunity to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the product and possible improvements to delivery.

Facilitator Requirements during Training Total Time: Approximately 1hour 30minutes Items and Materials needed: \u2022 PowerPoint presentation and related projection equipment, \u2022 Whiteboard and marker OR blackboard and chalk, \u2022 Module materials, \u2022 Pens and notepads for participants, Microinsurance for Disaster Risk Reduction 38 \u2022 Your own notes based on those materials, \u2022 Rewards for participation, \u2022 Blank name badges, 3. Suggested Methods and Activities: 3.1 Arrival and Introduction Arrive with plenty of time available to prepare the room and make sure all materials are ready. When the group is small, many trainers find that arranging the seating in a circle is conducive to open and equal communication. As the participants arrive, ensure that each has the necessary materials, including module(s) and supplies for note taking. When participants have arrived, or at the appropriate time, open the session with an introduction of yourself. You may wish to share your relevant work and life experiences and connection with microinsurance. Help them feel comfortable with you, in the environment, with the other trainees by showing that attentive participation and questions are a valuable aspect of the training package. If one trainee has a question, it is likely that someone else has the same question. Next, give a brief overview of the course, especially including the module objectives. You may use the first slides of the presentation for this. A clear understanding of the objectives will help participants know what to expect from the training. You may also want to hint at the types of activities planned. Now that everyone has had a peek at what is to come, it is time to meet the trainees. Ask everyone to introduce themselves, including their name, how their work is related to microinsurance, why the attended the course, and what they hope to take away from the day's session. You may also ask that each rate their current knowledge of microinsurance and product development on a scale of 0 to 10 to get an understanding of their expertise. Make a list of the things they hope to learn, preferably on a chalk or white marker board. When everyone is introduced, identify which items this course will cover. If they list things beyond the scope of the course try to recommend resources where they may answers. If the group is small, one good way to introduce everyone is to have each person recall the names of all those that have already introduced themselves. This often helps build an open atmosphere and everyone hears the names several times. 3.2 Course content Activity 1: 15mins (Activity #1 is useful for any microinsurance training. If this module is used in combination with the introductory module on microinsurance, you will probably not want to repeat this activity and will skip to Activity 2.) Assessing Microinsurance Demand 39 Ask each participant to write down a definition of what microinsurance is and three characteristics that differentiate it from traditional insurance. When they are complete, ask who wants to share their definition. Write key aspects of their definitions on the board. Ask questions and try to guide the group to definition or an agreed understanding. Then share the following definition: \"the protection of low-income people against specific perils in exchange for regular premium payments proportionate to the likelihood and cost of the risk involved\" Activity 2: 15mins Initiate a discussion with the participants on the importance of building a policy to fit specific community risk management needs. Organise the participants into three groups i.e. community, NGO/service provider, and insurance company for a role-play if time allows. Remember, participants love role-plays and it always take more time than intended. Encourage the NGO/service provider group to facilitate discussion between the remaining two groups to understand expectations from each other. This exercise will also help understand and clarify role of the NGO/service provider. Activity 3: 10-15mins + trainer presentation time Organise the participants into groups of about five people. Now designate each group as either \"Demand-side\" or \"Supply-side\". Have each group discuss together and make a list of characteristics that would affect decision-making on their side. For example, those on the demand side may list \"appropriateness for my needs\" or \"affordability\" as desirable characteristics, while those on the supply side may list \"potential profitability\", and \"simplicity of administration\".", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ab35c8b1-bb37-4778-81c2-2df49d4a3c93": {"__data__": {"id_": "ab35c8b1-bb37-4778-81c2-2df49d4a3c93", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/microinsurance-disaster-risk-reduction", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Microinsurance for Disaster Risk Reduction", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/microinsurance-disaster-risk-reduction", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7d76790e4a87e06363ddbe3055bd4caeedac10fcbc3086dfe53d5e8e8cbc5eb4"}, "3": {"node_id": "1a840e49-b005-4e02-a997-e05ecd7f7990", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/microinsurance-disaster-risk-reduction", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a531e6dd62c792a8c7d5556503852587b8c45de459a7455d916cd846d6714a58"}}, "hash": "0ce2880fbafc99e96caf1551a91884cd99f68a922dc7138ada62ab7c695b69cf", "text": "Divide the marker board into two sections: Supply, and Demand.

Presentation Guidelines \"The following presentation guidelines are intended as a resource that may be adapted for training facilitators that are teaching this module. They may be used to create a visual presentation or handouts for participants.\" Objectives By the end of this module you should be able to: \u2022 Explain the relevance and process of effective microinsurance demand assessment \u2022 Identify key factors that influence potential policyholder demand for a product \u2022 Outline a process for assessing demand for microinsurance among your constituency Contents I. Importance of Proper Demand Assessment II. Factors Influencing Demand III. Assessment Process: Developing a Demand Study I. Importance of Proper Demand Assessment \u2022 What Demand Assessment Can Do Help you answer key questions: \u2022 Should we become involved in microinsurance? \u2022 What types of products should we offer, to whom? \u2022 How can our product be refined to better address local preferences and capacities? \u2022 Will our product be attractive to others? With what revisions? \u2022 What complementary activities should we pursue to support our MI product? Addressing Community Needs \u2022 Many products available are not suitable for low-income communities or are of low quality. \u2022 Some products are mandatory or quota driven (most in India), \u2022 Demand is based on: Suitability of what is supplied and Comparison of this with alternative coping systems. \u2022 Developing a suitable product requires knowledge of the low-income market that commercial insurers and even NGOs typically lack. \u2022 A systematic demand assessment can help address this. II. Factors Influencing Demand Understanding Low-income Households \u2022 Factors affecting demand: Knowledge of risks, Affordability of product, Supply of suitable products, Trust of insurer and intermediary, Recent experience with disasters. Assessing Microinsurance Demand 41 Creating an Enabling Environment \u2022 India\u2019s IRDA promotes investment in MI (sustainable?) \u2022 Taxing premiums makes policies less affordable \u2022 Forming a microinsurance network for: Sharing lessons, Spreading awareness, Developing related tools, Advocacy III.

Presentation Guidelines Microinsurance for Disaster Risk Reduction 46 3.1 Concepts for Product Development 3.1.1 Common Challenges in Product Design Despite the growth of opportunities for microinsurance provision, several challenges inhibit the spread of this risk management product from reaching even more households. Currently, most products offered cover only the lives of the policyholders. While important, loss of life is only one of several risks facing the poor. A greater diversity of products will help better meet special needs of the poor. Developing a product that can be disseminated and serviced at an extremely low cost is an additional challenge. There is an inherent trade-off between suitably customised products that meet specific needs and those that can be efficiently designed for provision to millions. The current low level of insurance awareness and experience among the low-income market inhibits product provision. Additionally, developing the social and physical infrastructure for microinsurance relationships and delivery is a slow process, often involving collaboration between government, NGOs and the private sector. 3.1.2 Addressing Challenges through Systematic Product Development Following a systematic process for developing microinsurance products offers several benefits. Foremost, a well planned process helps the insurer and intermediary offer products that address client needs. Second, it helps to prepare the institution(s) to develop necessary systems and to offer products effectively. Third, it minimises the likelihood of product failure. Finally, it helps improve policyholder satisfaction and retention over the course of the product offering.

The following diagram illustrates the components of product appreciation and appropriateness that are discussed in this section. Microinsurance Product Value is Based on Appreciation and Appropriateness Source: McCord (2007) Appreciation Purchasing insurance requires giving up something now, a premium for a possible payback in the future. This can be especially difficult for low-income households with very little discretional income and little experience with commercial insurers. To enter into such an arrangement requires an understanding and positive perception of the value of insurance. Additionally, it requires the policyholder to trust that the agreed amount will be paid if the risk is realised.

Appropriateness The second component of community demand relates to the perceived appropriateness of the product for addressing real needs. This is also influenced by the ease of payments and claims procedures, the cost of the policy, and the availability of money to make the regular premium payments. 1 Module 2 in the Microinsurance Development Series, \"Assessing Microinsurance Demand\", is devoted exclusively to understanding this topic. Microinsurance for Disaster Risk Reduction 48 Enabling Environment In the case of microinsurance, supply and demand influence each other. Both the appropriateness and the appreciation for the product are influenced by contextual factors that can be influenced by legislation and other stakeholders. In India, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority has made servicing the poor a necessity for many commercial insurers. Additionally, factors such the existence of service or sales taxes on such policies affect the cost- effectiveness of providing products at very low rates. The current service tax of 10.2% might be reduced or lowered to encourage more uptake. Supply-related Factors The supply side development of your microinsurance product will be based on your identification of: 1) relevant products that suit your clients' needs; 2) relevant delivery channels; 3) potential mechanisms to service claims that will be made; and 4) environmental opportunities and threats that you will need to manage. Some of these factors may be influenced by the partner that you choose to underwrite your policy. Choosing an insurer is an important process. You should contact several companies to see which relationships are most mutually beneficial2. 3.2.3 Product Development Once you have assessed the demand for related risk management strategies among the community, you will begin to develop (or probably co-develop) your policy. This technical process will require an actuary's expertise. Although the specific pricing calculations will be conducted by the actuary, input from your demand assessment and knowledge of the target community will be of assistance. The insurer will want to look at the common risks faced by members i.e. sickness, disability, death, loss of assets. They will also consider the probability of occurrence i.e. percentage of those covered to be affected each year as well as the average financial payout for occurrence of each risk. 3.2.4 Systems Development Marketing, Distribution, Premium Collection and Claim Processing Microinsurance needs to be sold. Considering low levels of product awareness and the need to implement products at very low overhead mean that marketing is both necessary and difficult. One division of labour that has been successful in India is for the commercial insurer to use existing design and printing facilities to create small fliers for the microinsurance products. The leg-work of distributing and explaining the policies can then be done by the intermediary at the same time they meet with their constituents in the course of their ongoing work. Similarly, the intermediaries are typically responsible for collecting premiums and processing claims. Early in the product design phase, Terms of Reference can be shared between partners to help assign responsibilities for the most important groups of foreseeable tasks. 2 Annex 1 includes a list of questions that you should consider while making this important decision. Guidelines for Developing Community-driven Microinsurance Products 49 3.2.5 Piloting After the product is designed, a pilot phase will help identify and work out some of the challenges in the devised scheme. Pilot phases usually last 1-3 cycles of the product. A thorough multi-partner review should be conducted during this period to assess the market acceptance, the financial viability, the effectiveness of developed systems, and additional opportunities. ADA4 has developed a set of quantitative indicators that can be used to assist the evaluation of pilot or up-scaled microinsurance products. A training programme for key staff on the product as well as discussing frequently asked questions will help to ensure a more efficient pilot experience. Beyond field staff, exposing project managers, supervisors, and directors to other international microinsurance efforts will promote discussion and help identify additional opportunities. 3.2.6 Rollout The final stage in the product development cycle is the rollout or up-scaling of the scheme that has been improved since the pilot. As early as the first cycle, project managers should identify ways to reduce any remaining subsidies so that the product can be self-sustaining as rapidly as possible. This may include reduced dependence on intermediaries for service provision as the clients become more familiar with using microinsurance products. If the product is managed well and continues to meet community needs, opportunities will come for expansion through infrastructure and increasingly qualified personnel.

Guidelines for Developing Community-driven Microinsurance Products 51 Annex 1: Due Diligence Checklist for Identifying an Insurance Provider6 What is the reputation of the insurance provider? How is the insurer currently financed? What is the claims experience of the insurer and its history of claims payouts? How interested is the insurer in serving the low-income market? Will the insurer adjust its products to suit the preferences of the poor? Is the insurer willing to make a medium- or long- term commitment to the MFI? Is the insurer willing to pay a commission to the MFI for performing the agent role? Are there issues related to regulatory compliance by the insurer? Will the insurer give the MFI responsibility for verifying claims? Can the insurer minimise the number of exclusions without jeopardising the sustainability of the plan? Questions What an MFI Should Look For It should be a strong institution that pays claims on time. Check with policyholders to see if they have had a positive experience. The insurer should be financed from its earnings, and it should have a stable, conservative asset portfolio. They should pay most claims within a month and be willing to guarantee a fast turnaround (within two weeks guaranteed with an effort to pay within one week) on claims from MFI clients. The MFI should track this once a relationship is finalised. They should not only express interest but also have examples of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9fdb912c-2628-4655-8f02-dc30fca890dc": {"__data__": {"id_": "9fdb912c-2628-4655-8f02-dc30fca890dc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/microinsurance-disaster-risk-reduction", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Microinsurance for Disaster Risk Reduction", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/microinsurance-disaster-risk-reduction", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ee7fca9bc02a9019e305b31fc6f75c5b8f36effb58c9beb78f8012fa3a027ead"}}, "hash": "ee7fca9bc02a9019e305b31fc6f75c5b8f36effb58c9beb78f8012fa3a027ead", "text": "current work with this market or at least examples of efforts to work with this market. They will likely need to reduce the coverage, reduce the price proportionately, and even adjust some procedures to facilitate the transactions between the MFI and the insurer. This type of relationship will take time to mature. If the insurer is not willing to make a commitment for at least three years, it is not worth the MFI entering the arrangement. Note: the insurer is not tied to the original terms of the insurance for that period, just to continue to work with the MFI and its clients. On short-term group life business, insurers typically pay an agent five to twenty percent of the premium. The MFI should get a substantial portion of that amount. An MFI should review the insurer's annual report and discuss its regulatory compliance with the insurance commission. Some insurance companies employ an ombudsman to interact with the public. If one is available, the MFI should discuss with her issues related to regulatory compliance and common customer complaints. It is not recommended for the insurer to verify claims. The two partners should have a written understanding regarding what proof the insurer requires. The agreed documentation should be accessible to the poor, yet conclusive. Generally, MFIs have difficulty informing clients about complex products. Insurance will be the same. Not only will MFIs have to explain the concept of insurance (risk pooling), but they will also have to help clients understand the product. The simpler the product, the easier it will be to sell and administer the product. 6 AIDMI, 2006 Microinsurance for Disaster Risk Reduction 52 Facilitator's Note 1. Suggestions for Facilitators prior to Training Although the most effective trainers are able to address the emerging needs of trainees in a flexible manner, the following notes offer a basic outline of activities that TLC facilitators may use to lead trainings. To prepare for training, facilitators may find it useful to: \u2022 Review the Module Learning Objectives listed above, \u2022 Review the Suggested Methods and Activities listed below, \u2022 Assess the anticipated knowledge needs, interests, and constraints of trainees, \u2022 Identify additional potentially effective activities suitable for their particular trainees, \u2022 Review related background literature on Microinsurance and product development in India, this can include but is not limited to the resource material listed at the end of this document and the modules, o Prepare your own notes so that you may convey the relevant information in a way that is comfortable for you. o Do not feel constrained by the information on the slides\u2014they are merely a guide and you may adapted them for your needs \u2022 Prepare materials for the training, including: o Powerpoint or other presentation materials including revisions if desired o Print-outs or any other necessary handouts o Tools and props needed for activities o Rewards or treats to encourage involvement and participation \u2022 Ensure that all arrangements regarding venue are prepared \u2022 Ensure that the training duration is appropriate for material to be covered \u2022 Be familiar with the SWOT analysis tool and how it can be applied (http:// en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis) If this module is combined with others in the Microinsurance Development Series, the trainer may skip the introduction activities and continue with the activities relating to the course content directly. 2. Facilitator Requirements during Training Total Time: Approximately 1hour 30minutes Items and Materials needed: \u2022 PowerPoint presentation and related projection equipment, \u2022 Whiteboard and marker OR blackboard and chalk, Guidelines for Developing Community-driven Microinsurance Products 53 \u2022 Module materials, \u2022 Pens and notepads for participants, \u2022 Your own notes based on those materials, \u2022 Rewards for participation, \u2022 Blank name badges, \u2022 SWOT analysis worksheets 3. Suggested Methods and Activities 3.1 Arrival and Introduction Arrive with plenty of time available to prepare the room and make sure all materials are ready. When the group is small, many trainers find that arranging the seating in a circle is conducive to open and equal communication. As the participants arrive, ensure that each has the necessary materials, including module(s) and supplies for note taking. When participants have arrived, or at the appropriate time, open the session with an introduction of yourself. You may wish to share your relevant work and life experiences and connection with microinsurance. Help them feel comfortable with you, in the environment, with the other trainees by showing that attentive participation and questions are a valuable aspect of the training package. If one trainee has a question, it is likely that someone else has the same question.

You may use the first slides of the presentation for this. A clear understanding of the objectives will help participants know what to expect from the training. You may also want to hint at the types of activities planned. Now that everyone has had a peek at what is to come, it is time to meet the trainees. Ask everyone to introduce themselves, including their name, how their work is related to microinsurance, why the attended the course, and what they hope to take away from the day's session. You may also ask that each rate their current knowledge of microinsurance and product development on a scale of 0 to 10 to get an understanding of their expertise. Make a list of the things they hope to learn, preferably on a chalk or white marker board. When everyone is introduced, identify which items this course will cover. If they list things beyond the scope of the course try to recommend resources where they may answers. If the group is small, one good way to introduce everyone is to have each person recall the names of all those that have already introduced themselves. This often helps build an open atmosphere and everyone hears the names several times. Microinsurance for Disaster Risk Reduction 54 3.2 Course content Activity 1: 15mins (Activity #1 is useful for any microinsurance training. If this module is used in combination with the introductory module on microinsurance, you will probably not want to repeat this activity and will skip to Activity 2.) Ask each participant to write down a definition of what microinsurance is and three characteristics that differentiate it from traditional insurance. When they are complete, ask who wants to share their definition. Write key aspects of their definitions on the board. Ask questions and try to guide the group to definition or an agreed understanding. Then share the following definition: \"the protection of low-income people against specific perils in exchange for regular premium payments proportionate to the likelihood and cost of the risk involved\" Activity 2: 15mins Ask each participant to consider why making effective insurance cover for the low-income market is difficult. Have them write down share key current challenges related to the designing effective. Have them share their ideas with the group and write down the issues they identify and organise them around key areas that you choose: i.e. pricing, developing relationships, etc. When the list is complete, reveal the Powerpoint slide on \"Common Challenges in Product Design\". Compare the issues identified here with those listed by the class, discussing any differences. Continue with the subsequent slide, explaining the benefits of using a systematic approach for product development. Activity 3: 20mins The point of this activity is to have participants understand that microinsurance may not be appropriate for all organisations and communities. Rather, that it may be one component of Risk Accidental death of a family member, Loss of own property to a flood, Loss of neighbour's property to a flood, Poor sales for a vendor during a particular week Generally microinsurable?

One by one, list the risks in the following table. Don't share the second and third columns with them yet! Ask trainees to identify what strategies may be used to address the risk, and specifically if microinsurance is appropriate for addressing the particular risk among the poor. Explain that the insurance policy depends on a balance of supply and demand. Insurers would not supply a policy that is grossly unaffordable for them. Likewise, there would be no community demand for inappropriate or expensive policies. Continue the presentation on \"Understanding Supply and Demand\" and continue through the end of section II, on \"The Product Development Process\". Activity 4: 25mins Organise the participants into new groups of approximately five people. Each is an established NGO.

Their first task is to work in their group to develop a process for designing and implementing their product. Tell them they have 15 minutes to: 1. Identify a microinsurance delivery model, from those discussed above. 2. A process map or series of steps that they will follow in the conception and implementation of their product. This should be based on the processes they've learned today and include details on activities they will conduct. 3. A list of key relationships that will need to be cultivated for their product to be complete and successful. When their group work is complete, have each group choose a leader. The leader should explain their choice of microinsurance delivery models and explain the rationale for their choice based on their target group. They should draw their process map on the board and explain the key activities they will perform under each step. Finally, they should identify the key relations that they will need to develop. Now, complete the Powerpoint presentation with Section III. Activity 5: SWOT Analysis: 20mins This final project should be done when presentation and all other questions and discussions have run their course. Hand out the blank SWOT Analysis table. Explain the SWOT Analysis tool to the trainees. Explain that their task is to choose two of the main steps in the microinsurance development process discussed today (i.e. institutional assessment, market research, product development, pricing, development of systems, implementation, and monitoring). They should take two of these steps and fill in two SWOTs for their current organisation's strengths and weaknesses in working on these steps. Microinsurance for Disaster Risk Reduction 56 Finally, they should make a list of actions they can take, based on opportunities listed in the SWOT, if they were to develop a new microinsurance product. The resulting SWOT Analyses are for them to keep for their own use and application. Encourage them to ask questions in order to really understand and apply the tool. Especially encourage them to take the SWOT tool back to their organisations to discuss with colleagues how it can help them with their current work. 4.

This familiarity provides a level of trust among potential insurance clients that is critical for a successful microinsurance product. AIG is one of the world's largest insurers and offers technical and strategic guidance through its Hong Kong office. In addition to in-house capacity to administer a wide range of insurance products, AIG has experience with microinsurance products in Uganda. Though Tata-AIG had a well-established brand name, they lacked presence or alliances in many of India's remote areas. As a result, Tata-AIG needed to establish a network of partner organisations to penetrate rural areas for promoting sales of microinsurance. Tata-AIG senior managers saw microinsurance as a multi-fold opportunity. Microinsurance would allow them to fulfil regulatory obligations to service low-income and rural households, to enter relations with thousands of new customers, and to provide a financially viable social service. 4.1.2 Product Administration In contrast to most microinsurance providers in India, Tata-AIG has created a single department to develop, sell, and service all microinsurance products. This helped ensure appropriateness of policy design for the product's unique low-income market. Tata-AIG has NGO partnerships with over 50 NGOs. Over 40% of its 35 000 social sector policies were sold through the partner-agent model. In this model, the NGO/MFI partner performs the sales and servicing functions, primarily for its current microfinance clients. The outsourcing of these front-end processes helps to keep costs lower than if Tata-AIG staff would work in the field directly. The two other models, the business associate model and the Community Rural Insurance Groups (CRIGs) model, account for the remaining 60% of the business. Local partners were invited upon recommendation to Tata-AIG by donors and others working in community development. When partners were selected, partners proposed community \"micro-agents\" to administer the products locally. The micro-agents established and led CRIGs. These groups consisted of five members, the leader of which was trained and licensed as an insurance agent. CRIG responsibility included promotion, sales, premium collection, and record keeping. They are monitored by the partner NGO and were able to receive commission, bonuses, and other incentives. 1 Much of the following section is taken from a case study published by the CGAP Working Group on Microinsurance. Their report, \"TATA-AIG Life Insurance Company Ltd.: India\", Good and Bad Practices, Case Study No. 14, was published in September, 2005 and was written by James Roth and Vijay Athreye. The full version is accessible at: http://microfinancegateway.org/content/ article/detail/28285. Four Case Examples of Successful Microinsurance Initiatives in India 65 Community field agents are selected based on criteria chosen by Tata-AIG for an ideal microinsurance leader2 and are evaluated through a written exam that is mandated by the regulator. The exam is administered by an external examiner. Subsequently, the agent is trained on processes for marketing and servicing the microinsurance product. After being licensed and forming their CRIGs, the agents start selling. Training is provided to many agents after three months. Three retraining modules are conducted over a period of a year and each lasts three days. These modules cover basic knowledge on retail finance including insurance, analysing company data, advice on objection handling, team building, communications development, leadership practices, as well as general instruction on the relevance of microinsurance to the poor. Training is also provided on computer usage, particularly the Internet to facilitate the use of the agent's portal. Training programmes are offered in local languages. The amount insured under the microinsurance products is considered too small to pose systemic risk to Tata-AIG. As such, microinsurance policies are not reinsured. 4.1.3 Products Offered Tata-AIG has designed its products to relate to requirements of legislation aimed at social and rural sectors.

Tata-AIG Microinsurance Products All products are voluntary and offered to individuals (as opposed to whole households). Microinsurance for Disaster Risk Reduction 66 rural sector policies can be more easily sold to high-income rural families. For example, rural sector obligations can be met through selling tractor insurance to wealthier clients. 4.1.4 Distribution Channels The most interesting and innovative aspect of Tata-AIG's work lies in the development of the micro-agent delivery model. There are essentially two types of micro-agent models used. One is that of groups of micro-agents called CRIGs and the other of individual micro-agent. Both are supervised by NGOs (termed business associates) who perform a range of tasks including the recruitment of agents, frontend administration, and mentoring. The CRIG, which is essentially a firm of insurance agents, is supervised by a nearby rural organisation, like an NGO. The CRIG's members are involved in promotion, sales and collection of premiums, and maintaining records. The CRIG leader documents all fortnightly meetings with the NGO and all weekly CRIG meetings. At the weekly CRIG meetings, the leader records the microinsurance activities of CRIG members related to premium collection. Aside from this, the CRIG members discuss the operations of their firm. The fortnightly meetings are used by the NGOs to collect proposal forms, premiums and renewal notices. The NGO also provides policy documents for the CRIG to pass onto its clients. For every policy sold, the NGO gets 10% in the first year. The CRIG itself receives commission income, but not the individual CRIG members. The CRIG decides how to divide up commission income. The standard model is that the member of the CRIG who sold the policy gets all the commission income due to them except for 5% of the commission in the first year, which they give to the CRIG leader for the extra work she does in preparing and submitting the policy. Generally, the CRIG commission per policy is 26 to 30% of the premium for the first year, and between 5.5% and 6% for the 2nd and 3rd years. From the forth year onwards commissions vary between 4 and 5 percent. In addition, there are various bonuses and incentives. CRIGs that build a client base of 600 policies gets a bonus of Rs 10 000 and the NGO gets a Rs 5 000 bonus. There is no time limit for achieving these goals. In an MFI partner-agent model, the MFI collaborates with an insurance company and sells its products. The sales are usually linked to loans; typically, loan officers sell and service these policies. Compared to the MFI partner-agent model, the CRIG model has a number of advantages: 1. The CRIG model creates an insurance distribution infrastructure in low-income neighbourhoods; it creates a new profession, the micro-agent, with new livelihood opportunities for poor women. 2. The CRIG model can draw from many suitable NGO partners, while not being dependant on a few good MFIs. 3. The CRIG model creates a cheap distribution channel that is not linked to a loan, that can easily serve an NGO existing client base, but is not limited to it. 4.

Unfortunately, it was not actuarially feasible to offer very significant returns to counter inflation at such low premium levels. The two \"term return of premium products\" (TROP) were designed to be sold for an annual premium of US$7 (Rs 300) and US$17 (Rs 720). These TROP products essentially return the cumulative premiums paid over 15 years plus 25 percent. A further issue emerged once the products were priced. The death cover at higher ages of entry worked out very low. To keep the premium low, it was decided to increase the death benefit and reduce the maturity benefit. This is the reason for the decreasing savings element for the Karuna and Jana Suraksha Yojana products (see Tables 4.3 and 4.4). The agents have been trained to emphasise the death benefit while selling. The third social product is a 5-year term product where there is no return on maturity, but only a death cover capped at Rs 15000 ($333) with an entry age of between 18 and 40 and at Rs 10,000 ($222) if they enter the scheme in the more risky age group of 41to 55. This offering was designed to suit the needs of pure term cover at the lowest cost so that even the poorest could afford it. Part of the motivation for the product came not from client demand but rather from MFIs that wanted insurance to cover their loans. By far the most successful products have been those offering a TROP, perhaps indicating the importance that clients attach to savings. The premium was calculated by the in-house actuary. The lack of actuarial data caused difficulty in calculating the premium. In the initial design, the actuaries simply assumed that mortality figures were significantly higher for rural areas and low-income clients. Future life insurance policies will be calculated with greater accuracy using the experiences generated by the initial policies. 4.1.6 Conclusions While most insurers in India tried to fulfil their regulatory obligations to sell microinsurance by partnering with an MFI, Tata-AIG realised that the total number of MFIs was limited with respect to both quantity and quality. Relying solely on MFIs to sell one's products would not be sufficient in the Indian context. This led them to explore other distribution channels. Partnering with MFIs or NGOs nonetheless remained a crucial component in Tata-AIG's distribution strategy. They relied on MFIs and NGOs for information about the local community, to help build trust with the local community, and finally Tata-AIG outsourced some operations to the MFI/NGOs to lower servicing and selling costs. Microinsurance for Disaster Risk Reduction 68 The development of micro-agents and their firms (CRIGs) is the most significant innovation of Tata-AIG's microinsurance work. Microinsurance is a high volume, low cost business. In such businesses, cheap and efficient distribution is crucial. It is too early to make a judgement on whether the model is successful. If it is successful, the model will provide a major new means of overcoming the microinsurance distribution problem. Microinsurance is never likely to be a significant contributor to profits, therefore the CEO's support can never be assumed. Without the CEO's support from the inception, the project would not have taken off. There are a number of reasons why the CEO may be motivated to support microinsurance. In the case of Tata-AIG they included: \u2022 Partial fulfilment of Corporate Social Responsibility \u2022 Marketing \u2014 getting one's brand into the market early and creating a positive association with the brand. \u2022 Future profitability \u2014 in a growing economy like India, today's microinsurance clients may be tomorrow's high premium clients \u2022 The promotion of microinsurance often helps develop a good relationship with the local regulator. This is especially important for entrants into a foreign market, which was the case with AIG in India. Many insurance companies make the mistake of assuming that microinsurance is simply a matter of reducing the price and benefits of existing policies. Microinsurance requires specialised staff and different distribution channels. The CEO of Tata-AIG realised this and created a specialised rural and social products channel within the company. It was also important to give the team a degree of latitude to be entrepreneurial and innovative. The staff chosen to run the microinsurance section were young and enthusiastic, with little or no previous experience in insurance, but often some experience working with low-income communities. This has been important because of the dramatically different approach that was needed to sell and service microinsurance products. The insurance business requires trust from policyholders, especially among the India's rural poor. Much of the Indian microinsurance market is unaware of insurance.

VimoSEWA has a mission \"to provide social protection for SEWA 8 Much of the following section is taken from a case study published by the CGAP Working Group on Microinsurance. Their report, \"VimoSEWA: India\", Good and Bad Practices, Case Study No. 16, was published in October, 2005 and was written by Denis Garand. The full version is accessible at: http://microfinancegateway.org/content/article/detail/28653. Four Case Examples of Successful Microinsurance Initiatives in India 69 members to cover their life cycle needs and the various risks they face in their lives, through an insurance organisation in which they themselves are the users, owners and managers of all services.\" The initial product was offered in 1992 as a social security scheme operated by the SEWA union. Participation in the scheme, which integrates life, accident, health, and asset protection, is voluntary. As SEWA is a federation of self-employed women in the informal sector, many members have lower income and face higher risk than more \"typical\" insurance clients. In nearly 15 years, to 2005, participation in the scheme grew to over 120,000 policyholders, with the largest growth occurring just after the 2001 Gujarat earthquake. Initially SEWA offered insurance products to members that were underwritten by the public insurance monopolies that administered life and general insurance. In the late 1990s, as the economy liberalised, VimoSEWA chose to maintain the products but to create a regulated insurance company and that was owned by SEWA members. The transition to self-insurance initially brought financial and service benefits. The earthquake, though, caused considerable strain as it affected thousands of policyholders (a large proportion of the total) simultaneously. That year US$75000 was required to satisfy policy claims compared with earlier year averages of US$662. After the earthquake, VimoSEWA returned to the partner-agent model, where National Insurance Company would underwrite and make payments on health and asset claims. A post 2001 surge in demand for earthquake insurance combined with a range of new private insurers and a more experienced VimoSEWA team. Now VimoSEWA was well positioned to negotiate with insurers to establish a more efficient policy model. The team developed a business plan to reach financial viability of the products. The new model would be based on providing insurance for a wider community a voluntary basis over the long term.

Membership in SEWA continues to rise and in 2005, the federation had over 700,000 members. Target policyholders are both urban and rural, and include a range of workers in the informal economy, such as manual labourers, home-based workers, small scale vendors, and small scale farmers. Many members earn less than US$1 per day and are some of the society's most vulnerable. Their informal employment offers no protection from health or natural hazards. VimoSEWA is designed to transfer some of this risk. The initial coverage included life insurance on the member, widow insurance in the event of the spouse's death, and accidental death. These were expanded to include asset protection, health insurance, maternity coverage and most recently, health insurance for children.

Four Case Examples of Successful Microinsurance Initiatives in India 71 4.2.4 Results A well-developed database has helped VimoSEWA progress in recent years. The database allows the team to access information on clients rapidly and to contact policyholders for renewal. A separate database is maintained for claims. Both databases are used for reviewing progress vis-\u00e0-vis the business plan and for monitoring trends.

Workers in the informal economy cannot access the formal sector pension, health and other benefits. However, the informal economy does have access to a subsidised health insurance programme. However, few participate as the premium is too high for most of the population below the poverty line; in addition, the health insurance has too many exclusions and is not communicated clearly. The government has provided funds to LIC to subsidise 50% of the cost of providing life insurance to populations below the poverty line. Access may be difficult as a group of a least 10 people must be formed to get the benefit. 4.2.5 Summary of Key Lessons The outreach in 2005 is over 120,000 adults insured, a large increase from the 30,000 insured in 2000. Moreover, members have a much better understanding of benefits. The insurance scheme has enhanced benefits while increasing premiums, responding to members needs and staying within their ability to pay. Innovative marketing skills have been developed with proper messages conveyed to the target audience. Now, insurance is marketed as a risk management tool and not a benefit scheme. Significant improvements in the speed of reimbursing members' claims have been achieved over the last three years, while maintaining insurance standards. The MIS is now well established, providing vital and accurate management information and developing links with other SEWA systems to improve outreach. The team running the system has improved its skills and speed of entering data. Regular reports, financial and otherwise have become valuable management tools. Microinsurance for Disaster Risk Reduction 72 Risk Management It is extremely dangerous for an organisation to provide insurance without reinsurance, as VimoSEWA experienced with its asset benefits following the earthquake. Based on that experience, almost all of VimoSEWA coverages are provided via insurance companies. Maintaining an accurate database is vital to an insurance operation. VimoSEWA can track claims costs by benefit and by various parameters, helping it to understand how to price each benefit in the package and negotiate with partners. For health insurance, a well-designed cashless system should contain claims costs. Health claims have increased substantially for VimoSEWA on a reimbursement basis. Moving to a cashless system will lower claims costs while improving customer service. Organisation and Management A separate organisation, even if it is a division of the existing NGO, should be given responsibility for the microinsurance operation. It has only been possible to manage VimoSEWA effectively once it had its own business plan, financial statements and performance reports. Management needs to be focused. With the development of the VimoSEWA business plan, key benchmarks were developed and responsibilities assigned.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b4631891-861b-46d2-9772-7d4a0b297712": {"__data__": {"id_": "b4631891-861b-46d2-9772-7d4a0b297712", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/microinsurance-disaster-risk-reduction", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Microinsurance for Disaster Risk Reduction", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/microinsurance-disaster-risk-reduction", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "76194c042d2453dd36098cedabcb25043b4d2c290d74e346a249ff46b2b8e36a"}, "2": {"node_id": "8a0209af-3f62-46b3-9c0e-a2471bd72780", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/microinsurance-disaster-risk-reduction", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d8f5fe78115dd81ded8cf22cdb10c6b86e2e3b96f086349bb19ba7b6945e29ac"}}, "hash": "e32ac7e40f522c1d069403593564620b0aa5aac71ca14461663701bb5feb820c", "text": "Periodic monitoring alerts management that adjustments to procedures are required.

Management information systems should be adequate to develop useful reports for management and other users. Insurance companies that have developed good information systems with clean relevant data have superior performance. Now that VimoSEWA has a well- maintained database, it is easier to monitor results and make appropriate modifications to achieve targets. Quick, efficient claims service is necessary for a microinsurer. Initially VimoSEWA's claims reimbursement took months, however today claims are paid in a timely manner. Donors have an important role to play in supporting the development and expansion of microinsurance; however, their efforts should be coordinated. The lack of a common donor reporting method imposed inefficiencies on VimoSEWA. Product Design Product design and features should be revisited on yearly a basis to make the scheme marketable and innovative. VimoSEWA collects feedback from members and other SEWA divisions to determine if it should implement any changes. The most viable microinsurance product is life insurance that is tied to microcredit; however, that coverage does not deal with the greater community's need for health insurance or other benefits, nor does it protect people when they are not borrowing money. Four Case Examples of Successful Microinsurance Initiatives in India 73 VimoSEWA's integrated product is an innovative and risky means of addressing the real risk management needs of poor women (and their families). Even though viability remains a distant dream, it should be clear that VimoSEWA's multi-benefit product is both more challenging and more needed than most microinsurance products. Integrating benefits in one product helps reduce adverse selection in a voluntary scheme. If the microinsurer offers health coverage, staff has to have health knowledge and skills. VimoSEWA staff with health knowledge has been able to detect fraud from both health care providers and members. Preventative measures to promote good health practices ultimately reduce claims costs. Distribution Insurance is sold, not bought. To sell insurance, an organisation has to have the trust of the community. Hiring sales promoters with the appropriate skill set will improve results. VimoSEWA has seen an increase in renewal rates as the Vimo Aagewans have increased their skills and communication has focused on clear messages about product benefits, exclusions and claims procedures. Obtaining a high participation of a target population is essential to achieving viability in health insurance. VimoSEWA has found that results improve when whole families are insured and when there is a large percentage of the target community insured. 4.3 Case Study 3 : Taking Risk off the Backs of the Poor: A Case Study of Afat Vimo: Disaster Insurance10 Mihir R. Bhatt with Mehul Pandya and Tommy Reynolds Abstract In India, risk of personal, household and small business assets are often unprotected against disasters. The costs for relief and rehabilitation often rely on aid, but support from outside entities is often unpredictable-leaving the damaged assets of the poor by natural hazards difficult to replace-and making recovery difficult. Groups that fail to recover are more vulnerable to subsequent disasters. Insurance covers many losses but is often unavailable to the poor due to the high transaction cost to affordable premium ratio. Microinsurance is one of a number of viable methods that has emerged to provide the safety and preparedness benefits of insurance to the poor. Microinsurance puts cash into the hands of people so they can begin rebuilding their own livelihoods. Microinsurance has emerged in a policy environment that has made recent progress towards disaster risk reduction. Recent insurance regulatory reforms within the Indian Government and the prioritisation of risk reduction by the UNISDR, the ProVention Consortium, and DFID have contributed to the viability and advancement of microinsurance for the poor. 10 This text is an excerpt from a case study published by Tudor Rose in their book Real Risk.

The operating system is detailed as well as procedures of claims settlement. Successes have included the design of an affordable product, transparent payout, and linking microinsurance with disaster preparedness education. Challenges include the fact that the administrative cost currently falls on the implementing agency, and is not paid by the insurance market. The demand for the Afat Vimo product has been growing: it currently covers over 5500. Background Due to the combination of high exposure to natural hazards and high human vulnerability, South Asia experiences significant losses to disasters perennially. Present studies estimate that more than 90% of the Indian population does not benefit from any kind of social protection.11 Despite high and steady growth in the country, the cycle of disasters and vulnerability deprives many millions of poor of the human development that might have accompanied such growth. Within Asia, 24 percent of deaths due to disasters occurred in India because of its size, population, and vulnerability.12 Since 2004 alone, India has faced two major disasters\u2014the Indian Ocean a tsunami, and the South Asia earthquake\u2014which killed more than 10,000 and 2000 people in India respectively. Each year, India suffers disaster losses of US$1 billion according to World Bank studies13. On average, direct natural disaster losses amount to 2% of India's GDP and up to 12% of central government revenues14. These estimates do not fully include losses incurred by informal sector businesses and workers, which constitute a major proportion of the economy in India. The Calamity Relief Fund of the Government of India spends US$ 286 million towards providing relief to the victims of disasters. Over the past 35 years, India has suffered direct losses of US$30 billion; losses are also increasing, US$9 billion in direct losses were suffered between 1996 and 2000 alone15. The 2001 Gujarat earthquake alone has been to the tune of US$2.7 billion16. The price tag of the tsunami and South Asia earthquake are surely enormous but are yet to be seen. Assuming that the impact of natural disasters remains so high, and many estimates expect them to increase, how will India be able to cope, not to mention use the benefits of economic development to uplift the millions of poor? Just as it is the poor countries that are most adversely affected by natural hazards, the poor within countries face the greatest difficulties. Their small but important assets are often not secured, reinforced, and their financial risks are not spread across insurance markets. Four Case Examples of Successful Microinsurance Initiatives in India 75 Diagram 1: Financial losses to disasters in Asia have significantly less coverage than losses experienced in America and Europe. 17 Churchill, C.; Liber, D.; McCord. M.; and Roth, J. (2003). \"Making insurance work for microfinance institutions: A technical guide to developing and delivering microinsurance\". Geneva: ILO. 18 Vakis, R. (2006). \"Complementing Natural Disaster Management: The Role of Social Protection.\" World Bank SP Discussion Paper No. 0543. Washington, DC: World Bank. Diagram 1 indicates the lack of disaster insurance coverage of assets in Asia. According to the Munich Re Group's Annual Review: Natural Catastrophes 2005, the proportion of disaster losses in 2005 covered by insurance were 51% and 30% for the Americas and Europe, respectively. Over the same period, only 5% of losses faced in Asian countries were covered by insurance. Moreover, even within Asia, it is mostly the wealthy that purchase and use insurance. All India Disaster Mitigation Institute It has been the experience of All India Disaster Mitigation Institute that the poor, especially the poor amongst disaster victims, are repeatedly exposed to and affected by disaster. They are also perpetually restricted in their access to vital financial services. This increases vulnerability to future disaster-induced loss, and impedes sustainable recovery and long-term development. AIDMI have found that there is a substantial lack of viable options for reducing and transferring risk made available to the most vulnerable sectors of society, and this is true before disasters but particularly acute during relief provision. Background of Afat Vimo Microinsurance is the protection of low-income people against specific perils in exchange of regular monetary payments (premiums) proportionate to the likelihood and cost of the risk involved as with all insurance, risk pooling allows many individuals or groups to share the cost of a risky event.17 Microinsurance products are becoming increasingly important for disaster risk reduction. They transfer financial risk from vulnerable individuals to the insurance market.

Afat Vimo is a version of microinsurance designed for the poor among vulnerable.

Afat Vimo is a project that has arisen under the Regional Risk Transfer Initiative of the ProVention Consortium; it builds upon the significant work done on risk identification undertaken by the ProVention Consortium through the Disaster Management Facility and Hazard Management Unit of the World Bank and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. The main objective of Afat Vimo is the convergence of micromitigation, and microinsurance as a precondition for effective local, low-cost risk transfer. Demand for Insurance In 2002, a majority of relief beneficiaries from Gujarat earthquake relief were still exposed to disaster induced financial losses. Studies including the Gujarat Community Survey of 2002 by AIDMI and the ProVention Consortium revealed that access to risk transfer is correlated with sustainable economic recovery among victims.19 Yet, AIDMI found that only 2% of those they surveyed had insurance. As a result, they designed a microinsurance scheme to augment their ongoing Livelihood Relief Fund20 activities. The resultant scheme was the product of extensive discussions and negotiations with insurance providers who might be interested in supplying low-premium insurance policies to poor clients. This was a challenge. Product Description and Client Profile Afat Vimo policyholders are covered for damage or loss up to the value of US$ 1744 for non-life assets and US$ Rs. 465 for the loss of life \u2013 giving a total coverage of US$ 2209. Current Afat Vimo clients include individuals from low-income households with annual income of US$ 280. These households are mainly involved in small enterprises in the informal sector and have assets worth approximately US$ 209. Disasters such as fire, explosion, riots, malicious damage, aircraft damage, cyclone, tempest, flood, inundation, earthquake, lightening, implosion, strike, impact damage, storm, typhoon, hurricane, tornado, and landslide are covered under the scheme. Afat Vimo policyholders are also supported with micro-mitigation measures such as fire-safety training, seismic-safe construction practices, and business development services.

Once this is complete, AIDMI pays the premiums to the insurance companies on behalf of the beneficiaries, ensuring immediate coverage. Subsequently, the Afat Vimo team begins to collect the premiums from the beneficiaries. The process is effective but time consuming and costly, especially when renewal is optional. When disaster strikes, the beneficiary first informs the Afat Vimo team immediately of the occurrence who then respond quickly to process claim. AIDMI assist beneficiaries in filing claims properly. Since many of the Afat Vimo beneficiaries are illiterate or have poor literacy skills, thus they require such assistance. The need to build this general capability among policyholders is recognised. Therefore training is provided to help policyholders understand exactly how they can best use the policy. Claims Settlement Feedback from beneficiaries who have made claims under the Afat Vimo policy has been very positive and encouraging. To date, 41 claims have been made to insurance companies. To date, 23 of these claims have been successfully settled, giving a combined payout of US$ 5635. Of the claims that have been made, 10 have been made for life loss, eleven have been for personal accident (some resulting in fatality, others causing loss of earnings), two for house fires, and 18 for damage to property and contents as a result of monsoon flooding.

India: An Inventory of Microinsurance Schemes. Geneva: ILO. 23 Anderson, M. and Woodrow, P. [1989](1999). Rising from the Ashes: Development Strategies in Times of Disaster. London: IT Publications. Success Microinsurance offers several advantages. It can be a transparent means of providing compensation against damage. It decreases the need for humanitarian aid. Additionally, microinsurance offers the disaster affected a more dignified means to cope with disasters than relying on the generosity of donors after disaster strikes.21 Microinsurance may also make tracking trends in vulnerability and hazards easier when claims are charted with geographic information systems. Part of the success of Afat Vimo can be attributed to the affordable premium negotiated on behalf of the clients by AIDMI. This puts insurance within the reach of those who otherwise would not be able to access conventional insurance services. Similarly, AIDMI have had a great deal of success in the prompt settlement of claims, which has translated into client satisfaction and a good relationship with the insurance companies. It has also contributed to the good policy renewal rate. The renewal rate is currently 88%. From an original membership of 829 beneficiaries at the launch of Afat Vimo in August 2004, coverage has grown to a staggering 5519 members in only 20 months. Afat Vimo policyholders are now spread across several districts in Gujarat, as well as in Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry in South India. A particular strength of the Afat Vimo scheme is the unified policy design. Under Afat Vimo, life and non-life coverage is brought together under one policy. According to a recent study by the International Labour Office22, 45% of the microinsurance schemes researched cover only a single risk. Only 16% of schemes cover three risks, making Afat Vimo one of the most simple and comprehensive products in India. This not only makes the policy more attractive to clients, but also makes investment in the policy more efficient in economic terms. Another aspect of Afat Vimo that sets it apart from other microinsurance policies is the extensive range of eventualities covered under the policy. To combine micromitigation with microinsurance, community capacity building and involvement in Afat Vimo has provided more stability and viability. Reducing an entity's disaster risk is possible through increasing that entities physical/material, social/organisational, and behavioural/motivational capacities23 (Anderson and Woodrow 1989).

AIDMI have engaged in a commercial partnership with the Life Insurance Company of India to provide life insurance, and the Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. to provide non-life insurance cover under the Afat Vimo scheme. They also continue to raise awareness of the opportunities and benefits of insurance provision to the low-income strata of communities. There is additional scope within microinsurance to motivate private sector insurance companies to develop and provide products for low-income individuals as initiatives for their own corporate social responsibility. Challenges Though defrauding is one of the most common challenges for the microinsurance sector, AIDMI has experienced only one incident of a false claim. Similarly, premium defaulting is another such challenge. The retrospective collection of premium payments from clients can be seen as a threat to the long-term sustainability of the Afat Vimo scheme. At present, AIDMI must The poor face disasters on a day-to-day basis. Afat Vimo covers risks that have impact on a small and large scale. \"Victims\" manage the majority of disaster recovery themselves. Microinsurance can help accelerate their efforts. Microinsurance for Disaster Risk Reduction 80 absorb all of the operating costs of the programme, and recovers only the premium total from the beneficiaries. They must therefore shoulder all of the administration costs and costs of premium collection, field visits, supervision, and claims assistance. In terms of long-term sustainability, this means that unless the clients meet the operating costs, the scheme is not financially self- sustaining. In addition, there are a number of reasons why beneficiaries do not renew their policies. Migration, the inability to pay, and low desire to renew are believed to be factors. On a broader scale, commitment among donors and international organisations should exist for similar risk transfer initiatives to refine and thrive. AIDMI is a core manager of the Tsunami Evaluation Coalition's forthcoming thematic evaluation on \"The Impact of Tsunami Response on Local Capacities\". Under this initiative, stakeholders in Maldives and Sri Lanka (in April 2006) have clearly identified the need for risk transfer. This need, however, is not articulated broadly and remains latent. The 2005 Community Survey by AIDMI and the Disaster Emergency Committee identified low levels of risk transfer awareness among communities of India, Sri Lanka and Indonesia. Organisations across the Asian Region should identify and initiate opportunities for similar experiments for transferring risk from the poor. Next Steps However, there is clearly scope for additional capacity building exercises designed to instil in beneficiaries the long term benefits of insurance coverage, and the importance of continued coverage. Additionally, greater emphasis on adherence to the correct procedures for making claims to the insurance companies should perhaps be made to reduce the likelihood of claims being rejected which would decrease client dissatisfaction. The Afat Vimo scheme has tremendous potential for rapid expansion. Currently, microinsurance coverage under the Afat Vimo scheme is only available to communities where AIDMI has presence. Offering a similar policy in earthquake-affected Jammu and Kashmir and tsunami- affected areas is being considered. An emergent area of experimentation and international debate, weather-indexed insurance is being explored as a means of effective management of catastrophic risk, particularly in vulnerable rural areas. Based on the round table meeting with Agriculture Insurance Company of India (AIC) and a group of farmers from Kutch, Patan, and Surendranagar, AIDMI will be covering 1000 small and marginal farmers for the period of June 2006 monsoon. In addition, AIDMI is about to launch insurance coverage for school children and school staff. Conclusion Converging interests of civil society, corporate world, and insurance regulators In India partnerships between the commercial sector and NGOs are increasing emerging for microinsurance provision.

The impact of Afat Vimo has been strengthened through national policies that encourage private insurance companies to provide support to poor clients. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority also plays an important role in the provision of insurance to the poor.

Available at: www.microfinancegateway.org/section/resourcecentres/microinsurance. applicable to insurance companies operating in India, entitled \"Obligations of Insurers to Rural Social Sectors\". Essentially, these regulations establish quotas of insurance provision to low- income clients. The quotas for provision to \"disadvantaged people\" are as follows: Obligations of Insurers to Rural Social Sectors Rural areas: density of population > 400/km2 or 25% of men work in agricultural persuits \u2022 Life insurance: 5% of total policies in Year 1, up to 16% in Year 5 \u2022 General insurance: 2% of gross premium income in Year 1. 3% in Year 2. and 5% thereafter Social Sector: unorganised workers, economic vulnerable or backward classes in urban and rural areas. \u2022 5000 policies in Year 1; up to 20,000 in Year 5 for both life and general insurance Source: Roth et al. (2005) 24 The establishment of such regulations has greatly increased the volume of microinsurance policies, which are being supplied to poor clients. The quota rises each year reaching a maximum of 16% after 5 years of the total number of life policies sold for life insurance, and 5% of premium income for other types of insurance. This condition has generated massive pressure on insurers, as without selling microinsurance they cannot sell their more profitable products. To date the IRDA has fined a number of insurers for failing to meet their targets. However, there have also been a number of perceived and reported problems associated with the imposition of quotas. Pro-poor financial risk transfer initiatives combined with risk reduction measures such as Afat Vimo are rare in South Asia region. There is a \"real\" potential for disaster risk management at community level through insurance. The 2004 tsunami and the 2005 Jammu and Kashmir earthquake provides a huge opportunity for local institutions to transfer future financial risks of victims by facilitating access to the microfinance services. However, this is not easy. It is a great struggle to do such projects as pilot, even more difficult to upscale action and advocacy with government and international bi-lateral institutions. This needs planning, awareness building, suitable services, and long-term commitment.

With 1,281 staff operating in 7 states across India, BASIX is present in more than 10,026 villages and serves approximately 200,000 customers, of whom 151,862 are active borrowers. On average, BASIX's customers have farm incomes of Indian rupees (Rs) 12,000-30,000 per year, or less than US$1 a day. 4.4.2 Why Index Insurance?26 Index insurance is a relatively new form of microinsurance. As opposed to traditional insurance were indemnity is based on claims after losses, usually requiring adjusters for verification, the product provides insurees with payouts based on objective and independent measures of a pre- determined threshold on an index that is highly correlated with loss. A common example of an index is rainfall as recorded by a public meteorological station. Four Case Examples of Successful Microinsurance Initiatives in India 83 Index insurance is a relatively newer type of insurance product in India. Like traditional insurance, it can help the poor by transferring the risk of asset and income losses that result from medium and large-scale hazards. Index insurance makes use of pre-determined independent measurements to calculate payouts instead of the administrative-heavy claim submission, verification and adjustment system used to determine payouts in traditional insurance. For example, in Gujarat, some farmers have purchased index-based insurance policies that provide payouts if pre-determined thresholds of rainfall are exceeded (correlated to crop losses due to flooding). Regardless of their actual crop loss, the farmers receive payments (or do not receive payments) based on precipitation measurements taken by the public meteorological association. With traditional insurance, payments would only be made following claims and field or output inspections\u2014a process that drives up transaction costs and can take a long time. Like traditional insurance, index-based products are designed by regulated insurance companies on an actuarial basis. Indexed insurances are a key step forward specifically for disaster insurance. This is because indexed products have qualities that overcome some of the most significant challenges facing traditional insurance and microinsurance when they are applied to transfer disaster risk. While index insurance does not actually reduce the risk of a disaster occurring, it should, through proper pricing and design, incentivise clients to reduce their disaster risk. This has so far not been the case with traditional indemnity-based microinsurance. By de-linking losses from payouts by using an independent index, farmers still have incentives to use risk reduction measures in the hopes of saving their crop and yet still collecting an index insurance payment. Second, de-linking losses from payouts also reduces moral hazard\u2014the threat that policyholders will neglect their insured assets and can even intentionally increase their risk as the insurance payment will cover any losses. Third, index insurance mechanisms allow a large number of policyholders to be covered with lower administrative costs to the insurance company, thus reducing premiums. This is critical when the value of assets to be insured is low and administrative costs are more or less the same as for administering policies to middle-class urban dwellers. Fourth, compared with traditional insurance, adverse selection is reduced because policyholders seldom have more accurate information about the risk in the index than insurers. Finally, as there is no claim assessment or processing, indexed insurances can provide payment quickly after an adverse weather event\u2014a time when liquidity is critical for affected households. 4.4.3 Programme Development Weather risk is the predominant source of income instability for BASIX customers whose agricultural activities depend on rainfall. Like farmers, BASIX is financially vulnerable to weather risk: weather-induced crop failure, primarily resulting from rainfall deficit, often caused overdue crop term loans threatening the institution's portfolio quality. BASIX gained confidence in the insurance approach through its successful experience in livestock insurance. As a result, BASIX applied the insurance solution to the systemic weather risk affecting customers and the institution's portfolio.

Evolution of BASIX-ICICI Lombard Weather Insurance Product 2004 The product is sold in three districts with 10 product variations, linked to five weather stations. Three out of these stations were block-level (Mandal) weather stations. Excess rainfall product was introduced in one location. The premium is charged on a per acre basis, making the product linked to the quantum of agricultural activity rather than loan size and gives the farmer the flexibility to buy multiple units based on affordability.

One product is designed for each agro- climatic region, which covers the minimal risk for all the principal rain-fed crops in the region. BASIX retains the per acre system from 2004. BASIX adds two new features to the 2004 design based on farmers' feedback: (1) Minimum rainfall level (2 mm per day) is considered for arriving at the rainfall received during a period.

The pilot experience proved to be valuable for BASIX and ICICI Lombard in understanding the crop-rainfall relationships and the product design. In addition, interactions with farmers Microinsurance for Disaster Risk Reduction 86 indicated the potential for commercial expansion and highlighted the necessary factors in offering the right weather insurance products to farmers. In the 2005 scaling-up phase, BASIX and ICICI Lombard further improved the product by adding new features recommended by farmers. These new features included (1) dynamic starting dates, and (2) the exclusion of daily rainfall of less than 2 millimetres (mm) and greater than 60 mm from the cumulative total that determines the payout. Another important change was the contract application. Instead of crop- specific policies, BASIX began to sell area-specific generic weather insurance products that were suitable for all principal rain-fed crops within the same agro-climatic region. These products were sold to farmers in 36 locations in 6 Indian states. BASIX planned to reach a minimum goal of 5,000 policies, with a target of 10,000 policies. By year-end, 7,685 policies were sold. 4.4.4 Product Marketing and Delivery Villages chosen for marketing had to satisfy four main criteria: (1) the presence of BASIX customers residing in the village to ensure some degree of trust in the institution; (2) preferably 200 to 300 acres of groundnut and/or castor bean in the village to ensure a market for the weather insurance; (3) a reasonable number of small- and medium-size farms with 2 to 10 acres of land each; and (4) a village location less than 20 kilometres away from the nearest rainfall reference station, to reduce the basis risk born by the buyer.

As a result, not all of the villages that BASIX wanted to reach were actually targeted. BASIX had only 10 days to market and sell the insurance product before the start of the kharif season and thus of the coverage period. The product was marketed by first talking to a trusted opinion leader or progressive farmer in the village and explaining the insurance product to him or her. The selected leader or farmer would motivate the village and inform fellow villagers about the product and the upcoming marketing meeting, which would occur a few days later. Most people who heard about the meeting decided to attend; of those, 35 percent attended because they trusted BASIX and another 35 percent because friends and neighbours attended. A list of the attendants was made at the marketing meeting. After a general introduction to the insurance products at the meeting, BASIX representatives would visit interested attendants in their home. Policies were sold at the meeting and during these home visits. However, only 27 percent of the buyers purchased the insurance during the marketing meeting. Apart from the initial meeting with the selected motivator, BASIX agents would spend one day in each village for marketing and sales. In 2004, the insurance product covered three periods and payouts were decided by the end of each period. Payouts could take two forms: (1) a payout per millimetre of deficient rain or (2) a lump-sum pay out. These two options were provided to tailor the product as carefully as possible to the farmers' situations, but the options required considerable explanation. Meeting participants understood the crop to which the rainfall insurance was linked and the premium and payouts, but they did not understand the trigger levels. In fact, insurance trigger levels are expressed in millimetres of cumulative rainfall, but most farmers do not understand the concept of a millimetre. Most farmers determine when to sow by analysing the moisture in the ground, and, indeed, only 10 percent were able to estimate in millimetres the minimum accumulated rainfall required to sow. Four Case Examples of Successful Microinsurance Initiatives in India 87 4.4.5 Expected Weather Insurance Impact Because the product is newly introduced and buyers may not fully understand its potential, its impact is unlikely to be instantaneous. Therefore, future rounds of data collection will be necessary to determine how the availability of a formal insurance affects risk-coping strategies and the informal insurance mechanisms of the households. In theory, with the introduction of formal insurance, the crop mix should change because cash crops, which were profitable but risky, will now be safer. For those who understand the potential for hedging risk, a shift in the cropping patterns toward the insured crops is expected. By reducing the degree of risk in agricultural production, farmers will be less apt to resort to ex ante risk-coping mechanisms. Increased specialisation and higher profits are also expected, because farmers will focus on maximising the output of the insured crop, rather than on diversifying the weather risk through the cropping system. The analysis finds some evidence in this regard, especially among those who have purchased other forms of insurance and thus understand their benefits. But overall, the results are rather weak. The best evidence that the product is attractive comes from the fact that most farmers in treatment villages reported that they would like to purchase the insurance for the next kharif season in June 2006. Once the benefits of the product are fully understood, farmers will be able to alter their production strategies toward maximising output, rather than diversifying risk, and to shift their demand for credit from consumption loans to investment loans. This shift is likely to result in increased specialisation and investment, and to contribute to increased profits and the well-being of the rural population. 4.4.6 Lessons for Up-scaling Weather Insurance Several factors account for BASIX's ability to dramatically scale up its weather insurance business. First, the pilot stage was used not only as a feasibility experiment but also as a platform to raise customer awareness and improve the product. As a result of the pilot programme, BASIX was able to achieve the following: (1) design an economical product that suits the weather risk management needs in different rural areas; (2) devise an effective product communication strategy that sustains and boosts customer demand; and (3) make the necessary trade-off between product specialisation and scalability. Second, BASIX's holistic approach to livelihood promotion contributes directly to the capacity to deliver a large number of weather insurance policies to rural customers. BASIX takes advantage of its existing strong", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a984498d-2bec-45fd-bc1e-2abcc7a621a7": {"__data__": {"id_": "a984498d-2bec-45fd-bc1e-2abcc7a621a7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/microinsurance-disaster-risk-reduction", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Microinsurance for Disaster Risk Reduction", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/microinsurance-disaster-risk-reduction", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f7c0e9d7dbaaa35b04aca25337feab8ee055f4927cf75ccd1c4186d2b5afa93b"}}, "hash": "f7c0e9d7dbaaa35b04aca25337feab8ee055f4927cf75ccd1c4186d2b5afa93b", "text": "delivery channel by adding weather insurance to a comprehensive set of livelihood services. This maximises staff productivity and cost- effectiveness while increasing the impact of microinsurance in improving farmer livelihoods. Third, scalability is a product of BASIX's consistent attention to details and of the effort to convert the product details into the necessary administrative and technical infrastructure. Such infrastructure is instrumental to the weather insurance process, which targets smallholder farmers, requiring the capacity to process small but critical details. BASIX identifies the following issues as major challenges in further expanding the weather insurance business. First, BASIX and partner insurance companies must work together to Microinsurance for Disaster Risk Reduction 88 formalise a multiyear continuity plan to ensure common speed and matching energy in the business expansion. Second, as customer demand increases, BASIX must seek to build partnership with multiple insurance companies to overcome the underwriting limitations naturally incurred by reliance on one company. Third, there is a need for more investment in the network of weather stations throughout the country, especially in distant rural areas. The Indian government, private companies, and insurance companies should invest in the weather data infrastructure to facilitate the growth of the domestic weather risk market and the placement ability of domestically underwritten weather contracts in the international markets. 4.5 Case Study Synthesis Microinsurance as a Tool for CBDRR The case studies of products offered by Tata-AIG, SEWA, AIDMI, and BASIX demonstrate that by transferring risk from policyholders to insurance markets, microinsurance serves as a unique tool for protecting the poor in India from the financial implications of natural hazards. Though a range of strategies are currently used by organisations to address disaster risk, microinsurance is a step ahead in reducing the burden facing poor households. Requirements of India's Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority stipulating quotas for service to social and rural sectors have initiated a range of pilot microinsurance initiatives that target poor clients. These requirements have encouraged the development of risk management tools that integrate local community development with formal insurance protection. Beyond the products themselves, microinsurance delivery systems used in the case studies have been offered as complements to other social/economic services that increase access to capital and may reduce risk through livelihood opportunities Products Offered The case studies demonstrate that key assets of the poor\u2014including health, life of income- earning family member, home, and livelihood tools\u2014are insurable. By transferring some financial costs associated with the loss of these assets, microinsurance products can minimise the impact of disasters on the poor. As the case of Afat Vimo shows, specialised products can also be designed to cover policyholders and their assets against a range of natural and man- made hazards. Delivery To minimise the insurer's exposure to adverse selection, three of the four microinsurance cases examined deliver services to members of groups that were not formed to access insurance. SEWA offers VimoSEWA to its members; BASIX focuses on those involved in its microfinance activities; AIDMI offers their products to members of CCISB. Using such membership criteria has helped keep products affordable to the poor. The use of microinsurance can also encourage additional \"financial literacy\" among the poor as receipt of payments often requires creation of bank accounts. In the case of the BASIX weather insurance product, payouts are triggered by rainfall thresholds and time-consuming verification procedures are avoided. Four Case Examples of Successful Microinsurance Initiatives in India 89 Benefits for Providers and Clients In the case study examples, insurers found several benefits of offering microinsurance products. These include increasing corporate social responsibility, expanded marketing to new classes of clients, anticipated increases in profits accessing new markets, and strengthened relations with the IRDA. Products that are offered as complements to microfinance programmes are further believed to protect loan portfolios by decreasing the risk of disasters causing client default. For policyholders, microinsurance offers benefits beyond the transfer of financial risk, including strengthened connections with social service providers. Innovations The case studies demonstrate that efforts to insure large numbers of poor households have resulted in new approaches to selling insurance. Creative products have been developed that simplify transactions and manage information efficiently. In the case of weather insurance, the challenges of moral hazard and adverse selection are also reduced. Further, through effective design, weather insurance clients retain incentives to reduce their risk\u2014overcoming the challenge that insurance does not actually reduce risk but only transfers it. As microinsurance products in India mature, these factors are likely to combine to produce additional microinsurance products that are financially viable and available to a large number of poor households.

Suggested Methods and Activities Spend the first 5 minutes explaining the purpose of the module and introducing the titles of the four case studies. 20 minutes should be spent on the presentation of each case study (so approximately 5 minutes per slide). 1st Case Study: The Tata-AIG (credit Life) case focuses on the poor and rural areas. The most unique feature of the case is its unique delivery model. It is also promoted as an example of corporate social responsibility (CRS). This example should give participants a glimpse of how CSR initiatives can help the poor in India transfer their risks. 2nd Case Study: Microinsurance at SEWA has a long history. The Vimo SEWA (credit life) example has many valuable lessons to offer. The key feature of this case is the full-service partner-agent model and a massive scale. 3rd Case Study: The Afat Vimo (non-tied, life and non life) initiative is administered by the AIDMI. Use the supporting documents about the initiative to explain the activities and the areas of good practice. This example has a strong focus on disaster victims and CBDRR. Special attention is given make the microinsurance scheme affordable to the poor. 4th Case Study: The BASIX indexed weather case is an unique example of an indexed insurance product for microfinance participants in Tamil Nadu. Explanation on the unique aspects and rapid roll out of the scheme will help participants understand the usefulness and relevance of indexed schemes in India. The case studies should consume all of the allotted time for this module. If, however, you find that you were able to cover the examples valuable and you find yourself with a spare 10 minutes, there following a valuable short activity you can lead. End Activity - SWOT analysis: Form the participants into 4 groups and allocate one of the case studies to each of them. Hand out a blank SWOT sheet to each group and explain the purpose of a 'Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats' analysis. In the remaining time they should fill out their forms with suggestions in the four categories for their particular case study. Microinsurance for Disaster Risk Reduction 92 4.

Activities in this direction were initiated in March 2005. The member States decided that the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System (IOTWS) would be a coordinated network of country systems in which each country has the responsibility of identifying hazards, assessing risk and issuing warnings to its own population. In this respect they will be assisted by regional tsunami warning centres to be established in some of the Indian Ocean countries. India, Indonesia and Australia are establishing centres for this purpose. In order to assist the establishment of the IOTWS, six working groups were formed, one of which was dedicated to risk assessment within a multi-hazard framework. The Working Group on Risk Assessment (WG-RA) conducted a survey of the needs of its membership and it was evident that there was", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c0b12bc-c2d5-4091-ae79-98ccecaa54cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c0b12bc-c2d5-4091-ae79-98ccecaa54cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/risk-assessment-and-management-tsunami-hazard-case-study-port-city-galle", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Risk Assessment and Management for Tsunami Hazard: Case Study of the Port City of Galle", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/risk-assessment-and-management-tsunami-hazard-case-study-port-city-galle", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5d34e068f9b1f5eb3a8781a881e2df04776d3869ca11a7c5521f98db2ab0e14d"}}, "hash": "5d34e068f9b1f5eb3a8781a881e2df04776d3869ca11a7c5521f98db2ab0e14d", "text": "a demand for a clear understanding of tsunami hazard in order to develop uniform guidelines on tsunami risk assessment. It was suggested that the guidelines be developed in full consultation with the member States and considering the existing knowledge base. In addition it was requested that training programmes be offered to member States for capacity building in tsunami risk assessment and mitigation. The WG-RA adopted a three-pronged approach to its tasks: 1 The Indian Ocean tsunami hazard map was prepared by Geoscience Australia based on probabilistic tsunami hazard modelling, with funding from AusAID, and in full consultation with regional and external experts. Geoscience Australia provided leadership for this activity. 2 A tsunami risk assessment guide was prepared and published as UNESCO Manual and Guide No. 52. This guide was prepared over a two-year period after several workshops with regional and external experts. The UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre (APRC) in Bangkok, the World Agency of Planetary Monitoring and Earthquake Risk Reduction (WAPMERR) in Dubai and IOTWS provided funding for these activities. UNDP supported the development of the guideline. In doing so, priority was given to understanding the existing risk assessment framework in Indian Ocean countries and to ensuring that the guidelines captured the existing knowledge base of Indian Ocean States. 3 Several seminars and workshops were held during the preparation of the tsunami hazard map and the risk assessment guide. After the successful preparation of these two documents, a seminar and workshop were conducted in Bangkok in November 2009 to provide training to member States on the use of the tsunami hazard map and the risk assessment guide. The UNDP APRC in Bangkok, the Indian Ocean (IO) Coast Map Project and IOTWS provided funding for this activity. UNESCO/IOC has also undertaken a strong initiative within the IO-COAST MAP Project to assist nations in the acquisition of nearshore bathymetric data and development of shallow water maps which are essential for modelling of both episodic and chronic hazards and also for coastal development activities. The WG-RA and UNDP APRC in Bangkok worked in collaboration with the IO-COAST MAP project to organize a successful 2 Risk Assessment and Management for Tsunami Hazard training workshop in Bangkok in August 2009 on coastal mapping, modelling and risk assessment. UNDP also sponsored two more national workshops in Sri Lanka and Indonesia in 2010 to provide training and develop national capacity in tsunami risk assessment. At the first global meeting of the tsunami warning systems, held in Paris in March 2009, the WG-RA proposed that case studies of tsunami risk assessment be conducted in cities and regions covered by tsunami warning systems in the Indian Ocean basin and other ocean basins. This report presents such a case study of tsunami risk assessment and management in the Port City of Galle in Sri Lanka. Risk Assessment and Management for Tsunami Hazard 3 1. Risk \u2013 Components of risk and its assessment Coastal communities all over the world are under severe pressure resulting from planned and unplanned development, population growth and human-induced vulnerability. Coastal hazards are increasing in magnitude, with greater frequency of extreme weather events and other impacts of global climate change. These unprecedented changes are placing communities at increasing risk from coastal hazards such as severe storms, tsunamis leading to coastal erosion, flooding and environmental degradation. Planning and implementation of post-tsunami rehabilitation and conservation of coastlines should ideally be undertaken within a multi-hazard coastal risk assessment framework giving due consideration to all coastal hazards. Even when risk assessments are undertaken specifically in relation to tsunami hazard, it is important to conduct such studies on a platform that can accommodate other coastal hazards. 1.1 Risk Risk is primarily a function of hazard and vulnerability. It is usually expressed by the notation Risk = Hazard x Vulnerability. Hazard is understood as a potential natural or human-induced threat to people and their welfare, while vulnerability is their exposure and susceptibility to losses in terms of deaths, injuries, property, livelihoods, disruption of economic activity or environmental impacts. Therefore, in this equation, risk can be quantified as hazard associated with the probability of occurrence, and with people\u2019s vulnerability to potential damage and losses. Another popular expression for risk incorporates capacity and is expressed by the notation Risk = (Hazard x Vulnerability) / Capacity. Capacity represents the means by which the community utilizes available resources, abilities and their knowledge base to confront adverse conditions that could lead to a disaster. In this respect community preparedness is considered the pivotal factor. The strengthening of coping capacities usually builds resilience to withstand the impacts of hazards, both natural and human-induced. Capacities thus focus on", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eb38176f-cb7d-4833-843d-5ec53f0c2e25": {"__data__": {"id_": "eb38176f-cb7d-4833-843d-5ec53f0c2e25", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/risk-assessment-and-management-tsunami-hazard-case-study-port-city-galle", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Risk Assessment and Management for Tsunami Hazard: Case Study of the Port City of Galle", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/risk-assessment-and-management-tsunami-hazard-case-study-port-city-galle", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ea99b0ed9a039aea86a08c9833c342dbf851b679427f1fcb8d43f9a7d4ea705e"}}, "hash": "ea99b0ed9a039aea86a08c9833c342dbf851b679427f1fcb8d43f9a7d4ea705e", "text": "group measures that are in place to cope with an event. Prior to the Indian Ocean Tsunami (IOT), Sri Lanka had not adopted a planned approach towards preparedness and response in relation to mega-disasters, an aspect which is considered vital in saving lives. Hence it seemed more appropriate to focus on the importance of preparedness in relation to capacity. In this notation risk is expressed as Risk = Hazard x Vulnerability x Deficiencies in Preparedness. The additional term represents certain measures and tasks, the absence of which could increase the loss of human lives and property in the specific interval of time during which the event is taking place. This term is also commonly identified as the inverse of capacity. f risk and of risk and its nder s nts of risk and its ass world are under severe pressure nd human-induced vul ess ltin ty.

R 1 4 Risk Assessment and Management for Tsunami Hazard For a detailed assessment of risk it is necessary to quantify the three main components of risk, which is a challenging task. When risk is expressed in the form Risk = Hazard x Vulnerability. it is possible to quantify risk in terms of loss. However with the introduction of capacity or preparedness it is difficult to adopt direct quantification methods. There is no standard technique for such assessment of risk and a number of methods have been used by researchers including quantitative and qualitative methods. Quantification based on qualitative description (ranking methods) and quantification based on detailed analysis of respective parameters have both been successfully adopted. Although studies relating to risk will be able to capture the significance of all the three components, there are limitations in the assessment process. However, it is important that risk assessment studies are conducted within the framework defined by the above formula. This aspect has to be kept in mind when reviewing the outputs from studies on risk assessment. 1.2 Hazards A hazard can be defined as a potentially damaging physical event, phenomenon or human activity that may cause the loss of life or injury, property damage, social and economic disruption or environmental degradation. Hazards are either of natural origin or induced by human activities. Hazards also include latent conditions which may represent future threats. Each hazard is characterized by its location, intensity, frequency of occurrence and associated probability. Therefore, hazards represent the possibility of occurrence of a natural or human-induced event of a probable magnitude or intensity over a specific geographic area. \u2018Exposure\u2019 refers to the geographic area, human life, ecosystems and infrastructure potentially affected by the hazard. The Indian Ocean Tsunami (IOT) focused global attention on the severe impacts of tsunamis. It was also recognized that coastal communities are increasingly at risk from a number of hazards, broadly classified as episodic and chronic hazards. These hazards, which may arise from natural phenomena or human-induced events, have severe impacts on coastal communities, ecosystems and infrastructure. Episodic hazards include severe storms, earthquakes, tsunamis and oil spills, all of which have limited predictability and may result in major disasters. The communities should be made aware of these hazards, their vulnerability and risks, and should be educated on the importance of preparedness in responding to potential disasters which usually require long-term post-event recovery efforts. Chronic conditions include shoreline erosion, flooding, sedimentation, sea-level rise and coastal environmental and resource degradation. These conditions, which may result or increase from disasters arising from episodic hazards, relate to processes which can be measured and monitored. They require long-term planning measures and restoration efforts to reduce risks. 1.3 Vulnerability Vulnerability represents conditions determined by physical, social, economic and environmental factors or processes which increase the susceptibility of a community to the impact of hazards. Vulnerability can be broadly classified into several components, including human, physical, socio-economic, environmental, functional and administrative. Hence vulnerability is dependent on several factors relating to these Risk Assessment and Management for Tsunami Hazard 5 components. These include, among others, population density, building density and status, distance from the shoreline, elevation and evacuation time. Assessment of vulnerability is complex and can be implemented at different levels, commencing from very basic to highly sophisticated databases. Several models of vulnerability are available. 1.4 Capacity, preparedness and improvement of community resilience The assessment of risk is an important element of coastal community resilience. In this respect,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "58dde101-d476-43ee-976f-7583e9870304": {"__data__": {"id_": "58dde101-d476-43ee-976f-7583e9870304", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/risk-assessment-and-management-tsunami-hazard-case-study-port-city-galle", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Risk Assessment and Management for Tsunami Hazard: Case Study of the Port City of Galle", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/risk-assessment-and-management-tsunami-hazard-case-study-port-city-galle", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ba27061df29a54e578ca27f27914d229818943b73c360cb5905d00ad0afec125"}}, "hash": "ba27061df29a54e578ca27f27914d229818943b73c360cb5905d00ad0afec125", "text": "coastal community resilience is identified as the capacity to absorb and withstand impacts of hazards, emerge from disaster events and adapt efficiently to changing conditions. Economic and social development pressure in coastal areas, increasing population density and distribution, and other human-induced vulnerabilities, together with increasing frequency and duration of storms, long-term sea-level rise and other hazards, have created conditions for disasters of high severity to occur more frequently. Under such circumstances, communities have restricted capacity and reduced time to recover. Global observations also reveal that the period of time between disasters and recovery is becoming smaller. Therefore some communities are continuously facing disasters, event after event, depriving them of time to plan and achieve long-term recovery. In effect, they lead a life of continuous response to varying disasters. Such communities should be identified as high-risk areas and special area risk assessment and management studies should be undertaken. While vulnerability represents the extent to which a community is prone to be affected by the hazard, deficiencies in preparedness represent the absence of measures and tasks which could reduce the loss of human lives and property during disaster. In this respect, communities must be made aware of the hazards, their exposure, vulnerabilities and capacity. The key areas requiring attention are awareness and education, preparedness, early warning, response, evacuation, safe places and evacuation structures, and hazard- resilient infrastructure. Enhanced coastal community resilience enables populations at risk to \u2018live with risk\u2019, thus facing a wide range of coastal hazards with a greater degree of confidence. The United States Agency for International Development in Asia (USAID/ASIA), in support of the IOTWS, promoted a strategic approach to strengthening coastal community resilience to tsunamis and other coastal hazards. This approach, which has been developed via a consultative process with national stakeholders, provides an effective way of assessing coastal community resilience and is recommended for application. It reflects community understanding of critical risk issues and therefore is linked to capacity. The approach primarily deals with eight generic elements of coastal community resilience which are considered of pivotal importance in reducing risk from coastal hazards, efficient recovery and adaptation to change. Resilience has to be built up in each of these areas to ensure a well-balanced approach to strengthening community resilience. 1.5 Tools and methods for tsunami risk assessment Although a considerable amount of work has been carried out relating to tsunami risk assessment of whole countries, regions and cities, there is no uniform approach to the definition of risk assessment and to methods of risk assessment. The capabilities of the respective countries vary considerably with respect to the availability of expertise, tools for analysis and quality of data used for such analysis. 6 Risk Assessment and Management for Tsunami Hazard Having recognized the existing knowledge base, the WG-RA of the Intergovernmental Coordination Group for the establishment of the IOTWS produced two important guidelines with the support of member states and donor agencies. \u2022 Probabilistic tsunami hazard assessment of the Indian Ocean nations (Burbidge et al, 2009) \u2022 Tsunami risk assessment and mitigation for the Indian Ocean (UNESCO, 2009a) The latter was published as a UNESCO/IOC Guide. In addition UNESCO/IOC also published a broad guideline on coastal hazards, entitled Hazard Awareness and Risk Mitigation in Integrated Coastal Area Management (ICAM) (UNESCO, 2009b). The three guidelines above provide a broader understanding of coastal hazards in the context of ICAM, probabilistic tsunami hazard analysis, and tsunami risk assessment and mitigation for the Indian Ocean states. They provide useful guidance to implementing tsunami risk assessment and mitigation studies within the broader framework of integrated coastal area management. The guidelines provide sufficient flexibility in implementing such studies, giving priority to critical variables as applicable to the region or city under consideration. The case study presented in this document for the Port City of Galle has made use of these guidelines, focusing attention on critical parameters and the development of cost- effective risk assessment studies with the active participation of stakeholders. 2. City of Galle \u2013 damage and mechanics of tsunami wave impact Many coastal cities of Sri Lanka, particularly in the east and the south of the island, were severely affected by the Indian Ocean tsunami, due to their exposure to the hazard. One of the principal coastal cities devastated was the historic Port City of Galle located in the southern province of Sri Lanka. Incidentally, the first recorded tsunami to have affected Sri Lanka was on 27th August 1883, arising from the eruption of the volcanic island of Krakatoa. On this occasion too, unusually high water levels followed by receding water were observed in Galle around 1.30 pm.

The reported time of the occurrence corresponds well with the travel time for tsunami waves that would have been generated by the largest eruption of the volcano earlier in the morning. However, unlike this previous occurrence, on 26th December 2004 Galle received the severe impact of tsunami waves, their magnitude having increased due to nearshore transformation processes. Five hundred persons were killed, 90 others disappeared, 1000 were injured and 8120 people were affected in total. Houses and other buildings damaged numbered 1600 and 1300 respectively. Galle is one of many coastal cities around the world remaining heavily exposed to tsunami hazard. The presence of poorly constructed buildings and inadequate drainage contributed towards increased vulnerability. The tsunami waves which reached the offshore waters of Galle were primarily diffracted waves, diffraction having taken place around the southern coast of Sri Lanka. In the context of tsunami hazard, the location of Galle is heavily exposed. It lies beside a wide bay and a natural headland on which is located the historic Galle Fort with very reflective vertical non-porous walls on all sides.

The waves in the vicinity of Galle, which were increasing in height due to reduced water depths, were further subjected to a series of nearshore processes which increased wave heights even further. The canal was a facilitator in conveying the massive wave and associated flow towards the city centre. In the vicinity of the headland on which the Galle Fort is located, the wave energy concentrated due to refraction. These waves then reflected from the vertical solid walls of the fort and moved around the headland. The walls reflected almost all the incident wave energy with very high wave heights at the wall itself. There was hardly any dissipation. On the west of the headland the waves moved ferociously into the Dutch Canal. On the east they moved along the bay. The wide bay in Galle further contributed to the increase in wave heights by modifying the shoaling process via reduced wave crest width to accommodate the bay shape. The combined effect of this phenomenon and the wave coming around the eastern side of the fort caused a massive wave of destruction along the Marine Drive (see Figure 1). It is certainly not surprising that many survivors referred to a large black moving wall similar to that of the Galle Fort. The City of Galle is therefore not only exposed to tsunami waves which diffract around the southern part of Sri Lanka, it is even more exposed to nearshore coastal processes which further increase wave heights. This aspect is identified as increased exposure within the risk assessment framework.

Tsunami hazard analysis 3.1 Approaches to tsunami hazard analysis Tsunami hazard analysis focuses on three areas: the tsunami hazard sources, exposure and the potential impact on land. Tools and methods available to study the hazard include field investigations, image analysis and mathematical modelling. The latter includes both deterministic and probabilistic tsunami hazard modelling. With respect to tsunami hazard sources, attention is focused on previous events (their location, magnitude and sequence), seismic gaps and the identification of \u2018credible scenarios\u2019. When examining the exposure at a given location, due attention must be focused on submarine geological features, the regional location that will identify the influence of key wave transformation processes, and the location with respect to continental shelf and shoreline geometry. Depending on these aspects, the amplitude of the tsunami wave may be enhanced, as was observed in the City of Galle. Tsunami impact on land can be studied by measurements from field instruments, post- event field observations and satellite images. In the aftermath of the IOT, attention has also focused on paleo-tsunami research work. 3.2 Post-tsunami field investigations Several studies were undertaken to measure the impact of the tsunami.

The results from modelling of \u2018different credible scenarios\u2019 provide a database of the key parameters relating to inundation and the flow regime. Inundation height, length, distribution, run-up and velocity are some of those parameters. These parameters can then be used for the development of critical hazard scenarios by relating them to threshold values for the security of people and infrastructure. The modelling studies generated a valuable database which can be used for multi scenario-based risk assessment. It was evident that the IOT represented a worst-case scenario. The numerical modelling procedure is described below for a few alternative scenarios. Numerical modelling of tsunami phenomena was carried out to obtain information on the coastal region of Sri Lanka that could be affected by potential tsunamis. General coarse-grid modelling was carried out for the coastal region in the southern parts of the island and detailed fine-grid modelling, including tsunami run-up and inundation, was carried out for the City of Galle. The results of this exercise were used for the preparation of hazard maps for the City of Galle for different scenarios based on mathematical modelling. Generation and deepwater propagation of the tsunami waves were modelled using the AVI-NAMI model. The module for co-seismic tsunami generation of AVI-NAMI uses the method developed by Okada (1985) and the module for tsunami propagation solves Non-linear Shallow Water Equations. The ANUGA fluid dynamics model based on a finite-volume method for solving Shallow Water Wave Equations was used for the inundation modelling. In the ANUGA model the study area is represented by a mesh of triangular cells.

Modelling results give valuable information about the coastline of Galle that could be affected by potential tsunamis. The model results are very useful for the preparation of hazard maps. Figure 7 gives the inundation modelling results in four scenarios.

These probabilities are expressed in terms of expected return periods. A probabilistic tsunami hazard assessment of Indian Ocean nations was carried out under the leadership of Geoscience Australia (Burbidge et al, 2009). Two views quickly emerged in discussions among the panel of developers. The hazard assessment should, on the one hand, avoid over-estimating the hazard by considering only those sources for which there is solid evidence for generation of large tsunamis. On the other hand, the assessment should be careful not to miss source zones that may generate large tsunamis even if they have not done so historically \u2013 as was the case for the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami (IOT). The panel decided these two views could best be accommodated by developing two assessments, referred to here as low-hazard and high- hazard end-member assessments. This Figure 7: Deepwater propagation and inundation modelling for Galle (a) 2m_20min tsunami wave (c) 4m_20min tsunami wave (b) 3m_20min tsunami wave (d) 5m_20min tsunami wave 0.5\u20131 1\u20131.5 0 0\u20130.5 1\u20132 2\u20133 3\u20134 4\u20135 Inundation depths in metres 14 Risk Assessment and Management for Tsunami Hazard affords a clear expression of uncertainty in the degree of hazard, shown as the difference between the two end-members. It was hoped that any blurring caused by the application of the two assessments to mitigation would be manageable. The geographic pattern of the low-hazard assessment is broadly reflective of the impact of the IOT. The high-hazard assessment, on the other hand, highlights areas potentially threatened by local tsunamis, such as the western Makran and southern Java coasts, which are the areas of highest uncertainty in the hazard assessment.

For risk assessment against the tsunami hazard it is important to assess scientifically and establish the basis and criteria on which such an exercise is carried out. In developing hazard maps for risk assessment, it is necessary to develop hazard levels for which many approaches are available. In a multi-scenario-based approach, the superimposition of the impact of scenarios will clearly indicate areas which have a greater likelihood of being affected. The probability of inundation and its magnitude can be assessed by several methods. In an event-based approach, attention is focused on individual events, for example, on a worst-case event with specific frequencies of occurrences and impacts. After a mega-tsunami such as the IOT, it is customary to focus attention on planning strategically for such events, for example, considering the location of hospitals, power stations, water treatment plants and other critical facilities. Even if planning is based on observations arising from a single extreme event, it is important to analyse the impacts of credible scenarios and operate within a framework of multi-scenario-based approaches. This provides a justification for the use of an event- based approach. Risk Assessment and Management for Tsunami Hazard 15 For the City of Galle, it was decided to develop an initial risk assessment based on the IOT, which represents the worst-case hazard scenario. Results from both field investigations and deterministic tsunami hazard modelling were available, and a good comparison existed between the two. These results could be used for long-term strategic planning and location of important buildings, and for the identification of evacuation routes and safe places or buildings, preparation of evacuation plans and placement of signposts for the benefit of the community at risk. Hazard levels were developed based on inundation and flow speeds. The four hazard levels were classified as given below. \u2022 High \u2013 Inundation level above 0.5m with high flow/current speeds (>1.5 m/sec) \u2022 Medium \u2013 Inundation level between 1m and 2m with low flow speeds \u2022 Low \u2013 Inundation level less than 1m and low flow speeds \u2022 Very low (zero) \u2013 Very small or no inundation impacting humans Results from investigations conducted by the Ports and Airports Research Institute, Japan, on the resilience of both men and women against tsunami currents, were considered in developing these hazard levels. Figure 8 shows the hazard map developed from this analysis. Figure 8: Hazard map Hazard level High hazard Medium hazard Low hazard Zero hazard 1 km 16 Risk Assessment and Management for Tsunami Hazard 4. Vulnerability 4.1 From a single dimension of susceptibility to a three-dimensional sector approach The assessment of vulnerability remains a complex area, in view of the widely varying parameters associated with a detailed analysis, and also due to the difficulties in defining and quantifying certain parameters. The basic components of vulnerability can be broadly classified as human, physical, socioeconomic, environmental, functional and administrative. This approach is primarily a one-dimensional approach. Reviews of recent post- tsunami vulnerability studies indicate that the greater focus has been on potential loss of life and damage to houses and dwellings. Only a few studies have considered other aspects in detail. Villagran de Leon proposed a framework to break down vulnerability assessment into components by analysing how disasters can impact the different sectors of society (Villagran de Leon, 2008). The sector approach identifies dimensions of vulnerability in three areas, namely dimensions of susceptibility, sectors and scale. In effect, the dimensions of sectors and scale are added to the existing dimension of susceptibility. Typical sectors identified are housing, communications, education, health, energy, government, industry, commerce, finance, transportation, public infrastructure, environment, tourism etc. Figure 9 illustrates this concept. The framework proposes differentiation within each sector in terms of several areas relating to susceptibility, namely human, physical, socio-economic, environmental, functional and administrative factors. These areas relate to factors identified by the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) as sion of suscept ity t dim th ty ng -d bility a e rabil ro io nera 1 al ulne .

The third dimension of scale expands consideration from household to national level, including city, district and provincial levels. The advantage of this approach, in particular from a policy point of view, is that it promotes the effective assignation of responsibilities relating to the reduction of vulnerabilities. This approach was applied in detail to a benchmark project for the City of Galle and its advantages are clearly seen. In particular, it is easy to understand the factors that maintain, reduce or increase vulnerability levels. The application of this method requires a great deal of data and time. However, on the strength of this study, it is possible to adopt a simplified approach with reduced but critical parameters, and then compare the output of both single-dimension and three- dimensional studies. 4.2 Simplified approach to vulnerability A simplified approach will focus attention on critical parameters of interest identified in consultation with all stakeholders. The critical parameters applicable to the City of Galle were: \u2022 population and its distribution \u2022 buildings, infrastructure and their status \u2022 exposure to the hazard \u2022 distance from the sea \u2022 elevation \u2022 capacity to evacuate (within the broader framework of awareness, preparedness, early warning, response and safe evacuation) \u2022 impact on livelihoods. In addition, attention was focused on the profile of the occupants, their sources of income, household economic levels, conditions of buildings and infrastructure, and community knowledge. Based on the above, it is possible to develop four levels of vulnerability, namely high, medium, low and very low (zero). According to this approach, a level of high vulnerability can be classified as the presence of a large population within short distances of the seafront, at low elevations with direct exposure to the sea, within an environment of easily damaged infrastructure, with easily disrupted livelihoods and without the capacity to evacuate quickly. Similarly it is possible to identify other levels of vulnerability. Figure 10 presents the vulnerability map developed from this analysis. A comparison between this study and the detailed study using the sector approach indicated that, provided the critical parameters are duly identified and evaluated, the simplified approach provided an effective method for vulnerability analysis, based on which risk assessment can be undertaken with confidence. The selection of critical parameters, through a process of scientific analysis and stakeholder consultation, has to be given high priority in the simplified approach. 18 Risk Assessment and Management for Tsunami Hazard 5. Risk assessment The risk map can be prepared by superimposing the hazard and vulnerability maps. In doing so, the method adopted must be clearly identified so as to recognize potential limitations in applications. In this study, the hazard and vulnerability maps, each comprising four levels of classification \u2013 high, medium, low and very low (zero) \u2013 have been prepared. For superimposing them, it is necessary to establish the criteria for risk levels. A high level of hazard superimposed on high, medium or low levels of vulnerability (or vice versa) is classified as a high level of risk. A medium level of hazard with a medium level of vulnerability is also rated as a high level of risk. A medium level of hazard with a low level of vulnerability is rated as a medium level of risk or vice versa. Finally a low level of hazard with low-level vulnerability is rated as a low level of risk. If either the hazard or vulnerability is very low (zero), then risk is considered to be zero. Figure 11 shows the risk map developed using the above analysis. It is emphasized that other criteria can also be used for this type of analysis. It is noted that sufficient information is available to conduct a multi-scenario-based hazard analysis and levels of risk could have been developed using such an analysis. This study focused on event-based hazard analysis, which can be used for strategic planning of buildings and infrastructure, and preparedness for safe evacuation. The IOT certainly represents a worst-case scenario but other scenarios can be used to identify the potential impacts from events with a higher possibility of occurrence. perimposing the hazard and v to rec ecog ogninize ze pot o e abil tat atioi fi nt ed titififie h ap p app men pr arlrly do on ssm an b so th sess ma m e m ud asse ris op ho he sk a T Risk 5.

These include early warning systems, regulatory interventions in the form of extending existing setback defence lines, and physical interventions such as the protection of structures and utilizing the full potential of coastal ecosystems. These should be supplemented with public awareness of disaster preparedness and efficient evacuation procedures incorporating planned evacuation routes. Measures for risk management can be broadly classified into three categories, namely, those that mitigate the impact of the hazard, those that mitigate exposure and vulnerability to the hazard, and those that promote successful evacuation. 6.1.1 Measures that mitigate the impact of tsunami hazard 1. The implementation of artificial measures for protection, including tsunami breakwaters, dikes and revetments 2. The effective use of natural coastal ecosystems including coral reefs, sand dunes and coastal vegetation (mangrove forests) 3. Hybrid systems of artificial and/or natural systems 6.1.2 Measures that mitigate exposure and vulnerability to the tsunami hazard 1. Land-use planning 2. Regulatory interventions such as setback of defence lines 3. Hazard-resilient buildings and infrastructure Figure 11: Risk map Risk level 1 km High risk Medium risk Low risk Zero risk 20 Risk Assessment and Management for Tsunami Hazard 6.1.3 Measures that promote successful evacuation from tsunami hazard 1. Early warning systems (local and regional) 2. Public warning systems 3. Evacuation routes and structures 4. Community education, including community maps and other measures for community preparedness Hazard, vulnerability and risk maps play a vital role in risk management. In view of the benefits of risk management measures, it is important to upgrade these maps regularly. These maps can be used for the production of disaster preparedness or management maps. 6.2 Planning risk management measures via policy and management options Post-disaster planning should be undertaken in the context of overall coastal hazards, including tsunamis. Although the chances of an extreme event such as that of 26th December 2004 taking place are low, the impacts of such events set the agenda for strategic planning and location of key infrastructure. It is recognized that a coastal hazard protection plan for the city should be an integral part of an overall coastal zone management plan based on various policy and management options. These options should reflect a strategic approach to achieving long-term stability, in particular for sustaining multiple uses of the coastal zone and giving due consideration to the threats and risks of hazards. Policy and management options should be formulated on a sound scientific basis, preferably within the prevailing legal and institutional frameworks. However, if the need arises, institutional improvements should be effected and new laws should be imposed. In this process, a high priority should be given to stakeholder participation. Extreme care has to be exercised when obtaining the active participation of stakeholders who have witnessed disaster and suffered heavily in loss of lives, property and livelihoods from one of the most severe natural disasters to have affected the region. Most of them require a long period to recover completely from their traumatic experiences. Policy options identify possible courses of action on shoreline, such as: \u2022 Maintenance of the existing defence line \u2022 Setback of the defence line \u2022 Retreat \u2022 Advance In order to implement the policy options, various management options are proposed that may be appropriate for the coastal area. They are summarized as: \u2022 Do nothing \u2022 Reinstate previous conditions \u2022 Modify the existing design \u2022 Develop new design Once the risk assessment study is completed, mitigation options should be developed within the framework of policy and management options, giving due consideration to stakeholder consultations. Risk Assessment and Management for Tsunami Hazard 21 6.3 Classification of physical interventions (artificial and natural) In light of the discussion in Sections 6.1.1 and 6.2, mitigation by physical intervention is classified into three types, depending on location and function in protecting the coast. These interventions may be achieved by artificial methods via coastal engineering design, and also by harnessing the full potential of natural coastal ecosystems. The types of interventions and typical examples for each category are listed below. 1. Reduce the impacts of tsunami waves prior to reaching the shoreline e.g. tsunami breakwaters, coral reefs 2. Protect the coastal zone by preventing the inland movement of tsunami waves e.g. tsunami dikes, sand dunes 3. Mitigate the severe impacts of tsunami waves on entry to the shoreline e.g. tsunami dikes, revetments, mangrove forests On many occasions, both artificial and natural methods can be adopted", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "19a94949-a3ab-4add-972d-febd324c139f": {"__data__": {"id_": "19a94949-a3ab-4add-972d-febd324c139f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/risk-assessment-and-management-tsunami-hazard-case-study-port-city-galle", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Risk Assessment and Management for Tsunami Hazard: Case Study of the Port City of Galle", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/risk-assessment-and-management-tsunami-hazard-case-study-port-city-galle", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "213b9370b22d43c23884458979d60f9e061d1f60ae3a3e103a5a4e6ff36edf63"}}, "hash": "213b9370b22d43c23884458979d60f9e061d1f60ae3a3e103a5a4e6ff36edf63", "text": "in parallel to achieve well-integrated hybrid solutions satisfying environmental concerns. 6.4 Development of guidelines for tsunami-resistant buildings The coast is an area of high economic activity and it is not possible to transfer all activities to areas that are completely free from potential tsunami hazards. For some areas of the coast, safe evacuation areas may be too far away for citizens to reach on foot, thus necessitating vertical evacuation structures. Therefore there is a need to develop design guidelines and construction manuals for tsunami-resistant housing and infrastructure for the benefit of the public. Given the background of discussion in Sections 6.1.2 and 6.2, two types of guidelines are required: \u2022 Overall design guidelines providing advice on location, layout, orientation, structural configuration, geo- technical considerations and other considerations relating to good design practice. \u2022 Detailed design guidelines on hydraulic and structural loads, geo-technical issues and detailed design information. The overall design guidelines could be developed from the experience gained by damage assessment in different parts of the country. Such assessment should be analysed in the context of the hydraulic regime generated by the tsunami at that location. In particular, local effects which can enhance the impact of tsunamis have to be taken into consideration. Relevant information from other countries affected by tsunamis will be very useful for this exercise. It is important that damage assessment should cover a variety of infrastructure that was destroyed or damaged, or that survived with fewer impacts. 7. Mitigation and its integration with development projects In 2000, Japanese Port Consultants (JPC) developed a master plan for the development of the Port of Galle. In view of environmental issues, they recognized that development should be restricted to a two-berth medium- sized harbour. In order to maintain healthy tidal flows for the well-being of the coral reef system located on the eastern side of the bay, JPC in consultation with environmental specialists incorporated an offshore detached breakwater, which coincidentally has all the characteristics of an effective tsunami breakwater (see Figure 12). It must be admitted tsunamis were not part of the agenda of the engineering and environmental terms at that stage. egration w ntegration wit veloped a ma ts integration with d s (JPC) developed a master plan fo cognized that development tid l fl eve de d be well-be d it ul s, th intai elop pm cte f th and t C al i er t opm of a t l on an se m In men Po be ys tion apa nv rb rb ent p of me lo gatio 00 w e pro le. m d itig In rojec Miti ects 7. M ts 7 22 Risk Assessment and Management for Tsunami Hazard On analysing damage in the aftermath of the IOT, the proposed development of Galle harbour and the use of the offshore breakwater were revisited. Through numerical modelling it was determined that by implementing this project with a slightly extended offshore breakwater in the direction of Galle Fort, the City of Galle would have the benefit of a tsunami breakwater as part of a port development project. Considerable reduction of the inundation area could be achieved. Once this extension is designed, it may be possible to reduce the length of the revetment protruding near the berth. The construction of a small offshore breakwater in front of the channel located west of the headland would provide additional protection. A protection wall (tsunami dyke) of modest proportions along the coastline could supplement the tsunami breakwater. The design details and the structural configurations can only be determined after carrying out mathematical modelling and physical modelling to assess the performance of the proposed configuration. A hybrid approach using both artificial and natural methods seems very appropriate for this situation. These are some of the physical mitigation measures which can be successfully adopted as feasible options for the protection of the City of Galle. These measures will also be effective against potential coastal hazards that have a greater probability of occurrence than an extreme tsunami wave event (see Figure 13).

Preparation of disaster management maps Hazard, vulnerability and risk assessment maps were prepared based on the investigations conducted in Sections 3, 4 and 5, and public consultations via meetings with officials of the government and non- government organizations, affected people and questionnaire surveys.

Coastal community resilience 9.1 Coasts at risk The coastal zone, comprising coastal communities, the built environment and ecosystems, are exposed to a wide range of hazards arising from natural phenomena and human-induced activities. Cities within this zone are centres of economic development with heavy population density subjected to immense development pressure. On most occasions this has resulted in unplanned accelerated development leading to high vulnerability. It is not surprising that coastal communities are increasingly at risk from coastal hazards. This was evident from the experience of disasters such as the IOT of 2004, storm surges resulting from Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Cyclone Nargis in 2008. The events exposed a lack of knowledge regarding hazards and vulnerability, and deficiencies in preparedness and response. Since then there have been several initiatives to improve disaster risk assessment and management. 9.2 Establishing the resilience of coastal communities Risk knowledge is a critical component of coastal community resilience and represents the awareness of the community regarding potential hazards, vulnerability and the extent to which the community is prone to hazard impacts. Risk knowledge therefore plays a vital role in building a hazard-resilient community. It requires a full understanding of hazards both episodic and chronic, the frequency of occurrence, the time scale over which they occur, and the geographic extent of impact. The community should be aware of the impacts on human life, ecosystems, agriculture and infrastructure. A hazard-resilient community can only be developed via an understanding of hazard and vulnerability, leading to improved preparedness. Lower levels of risk reflect a resilient community and this can be achieved via a three-pronged approach of reducing the impact of hazards, reducing vulnerability and improving preparedness. The community itself can harness the full potential of their indigenous knowledge in developing measures to improve preparedness. USAID/ASIA in response to the development of the IOTWS promoted a strategic approach towards coastal community resilience to tsunamis and other coastal hazards. This approach was developed in consultation with national stakeholders and presented as a practical guide, entitled, \u2018How resilient is your coastal community?\u2019 (USAID IOTWS, 2007). The guide provides an effective way of assessing the resilience of coastal communities and is recommended as a very useful rapid assessment undertaken by all stakeholders to identify strengths, weaknesses and opportunities to improve resilience. The approach primarily deals with eight generic elements of coastal community resilience considered to be of pivotal importance in reducing risk from coastal hazards, and in promoting efficient recovery and adaptation to change. Resilience has to be built up in each of these areas to ensure a well-balanced approach towards community resilience. This is an ongoing process which in turn will enable the community to \u2018live with risk\u2019 arising from a wide range of coastal hazards, with an equally high degree of confidence. The eight fundamental elements of coastal community resilience identified in the USAID guide to reduce risk from coastal hazards, accelerate recovery, and adapt to change are: 1. Governance: Leadership, legal framework, and institutions provide enabling conditions for resilience through community involvement with government. nity resilience muni mmu ris omm s al com oa stal c 1 oast Co 9.

Coastal resources management: Active management of coastal resources sustains environmental services and livelihoods and reduces risks from coastal hazards. 4. Land use and structural design: Effective land use and structural design complement environmental, economic and community goals and reduce risks from hazards. 5. Risk knowledge: Leadership and community members are aware of hazards, and risk information is utilised when making decisions. 6. Warning and evacuation: The community is capable of receiving notifications and alerts regarding coastal hazards and warnings for at-risk populations, and individuals are able to act on such alerts. 7. Emergency response: Mechanisms and networks are established and maintained to respond quickly to coastal disasters and address emergency needs at the community level. 8. Disaster recovery: Prior to hazard events, plans are in place to accelerate disaster recovery, engage communities in the recovery process, and minimize negative environmental, social and economic impacts. Figure 16 gives the results from a survey on coastal community resilience carried out in an area of Galle District. Figure 16: Coastal community resilience Socio-economic status and livelihoods 3 2 1 0 Coastal resource management Land use management and structures Risk knowledge (a) Middle-level managers Governance Disaster recovery Emergency response Warning and Evacuation (b) Villagers Socio-economic status and livelihoods Coastal resource management Land use management and structures Risk knowledge Governance Disaster recovery Emergency response Warning and Evacuation 3 2 1 0 1 0 28 Risk Assessment and Management for Tsunami Hazard The results indicate that both middle-level managers and villagers had a good understanding on warning and evacuation because it has been a major area of community awareness-raising after the IOT. In comparison, community knowledge regarding land-use management and disaster recovery is comparatively low. Based on this analysis, appropriate action can be taken to enhance the knowledge base in other areas. It is recognized that risk knowledge represents one of the key elements on which a hazard-resilient community can be built. Without this knowledge, the community cannot establish pathways towards resilience. Risk knowledge is strongly linked to all aspects of coastal community resilience and, as identified in the guideline (USAID IOTWS, 2009), this knowledge base enables the community, government agencies and other stakeholders to work in collaboration: \u2022 to incorporate risk-related issues in the decision making process \u2022 to identify measures to reduce impacts of hazards on social, economic and cultural resources \u2022 to manage coastal and environmental resources in an effective manner for sustaining multiple uses, including for disaster risk reduction \u2022 to adopt safe construction in accordance with hazard-resilient design standards, and to identify safe locations and construct safe evacuation structures \u2022 to develop effective warning systems, warning dissemination and evacuation plans \u2022 to identify highest-risk areas for immediate disaster response \u2022 to develop disaster recovery plans and mitigation methods against potential hazards. One of the principal ways of improving the resilience of coastal communities against hazards is to implement risk assessment studies. This enables them to understand exposure to hazards and issues of vulnerability, and to undertake planning of emergency response and recovery as well as overall hazard mitigation measures. In effect, risk assessment studies provide an opportunity to understand hazards before they are translated into disasters. The outcome of such studies can be used effectively to adopt measures to improve the resilience of coastal communities. It is emphasised that risk knowledge is the foundation on which all other elements of coastal community resilience are developed, and community resilience can only be built by giving a high priority to risk knowledge. 10. Concluding remarks This report has described in detail and presented the results of an investigative study on tsunami risk assessment for the Port City of Galle in Sri Lanka. The paper focuses on hazard, vulnerability and capacity analysis, the principal components of risk assessment followed by risk management measures. Hazard analysis comprises both probabilistic and deterministic hazard analysis. The probabilistic tsunami hazard analysis revealed that for Sri Lanka the low-hazard and high-hazard maps are very similar in character, being subject to influence by events in North Sumatra and the Nicobar Islands. The use of deterministic tsunami hazard modelling permitted a multi-scenario-based analysis. In terms of hazard impacts, the IOT represented a worst\u2013case scenario which may be used for long-term strategic urban development planning, in particular to identify locations for critical infrastructure and installations. However, there are no constraints on the use of multiple scenarios in preparing an overall hazard map. The multi-scenario modelling carried out for this study may be used for such an exercise, with the adoption of weightage factors.

The sector approach demands a very detailed analysis based on an extensive database. It was evident that the simplified approach provides an effective vulnerability analysis on which risk assessment can be undertaken with confidence. The risk assessment has been achieved via the superimposition of hazard and vulnerability maps. It is recognized that the frequency of tsunamis which may severely affect the Sri Lankan coast is small, and this aspect has to be given due recognition when adopting measures for risk management. It is in this respect that the extreme scenario of IOT has been considered, and the results used for strategic planning, as noted earlier. The report then focuses on tsunami risk management. It presents a three-pronged strategic approach and identifies the importance of operating within a multi-hazard coastal protection plan. Such an approach considers measures to: \u2022 Mitigate the impact of the hazard \u2022 Mitigate exposure and vulnerability to the hazard \u2022 Promote successful evacuation from the hazard In the case of the City of Galle the report presents a case for integrating national port development with tsunami hazard protection. It recommends that the breakwaters of the proposed new port in Galle be utilised to provide protection against the tsunami hazard, and that modelling will have to be carried out to estimate the desired crest height of the breakwater in order to achieve the expected level of protection. The report has identified the overall approach to be adopted for the design of tsunami-resilient buildings. Appropriate techniques are being developed under the leadership of the Disaster Management Centre of Sri Lanka. The report includes disaster management maps that were developed to show safe places and routes. The report has also focused on the evaluation of the resilience of coastal communities, which is considered one of the most important goals in risk management. 30 Risk Assessment and Management for Tsunami Hazard References 1.

Capacity development is UNDP\u2019s overarching contribution to development programming to facilitate achievement of the MDGs and support sustainable human development. Disaster risk reduction is an equally urgent area of focus for UNDP, given that the development context remains marred by disasters that pose a threat to development gains. This primer has been developed in support of these important overarching frameworks and commitments. It is a result of collective endeavours and contributions by experts and specialists in the fields of both disaster risk reduction and capacity development in the region. It is a product of a thorough and participatory process of consolidating inputs, ideas and contributions from countries that are implementing disaster risk reduction efforts. It has been shaped by real experiences and case studies on the ground that illustrate the importance of a systematic approach to strengthening capacities for disaster risk reduction and the current trends in doing so. The substance and design of this primer come from a structured process of optimizing engagement from practitioners and drawing on existing knowledge and experiences in the region. The primer remains a work in progress. The authors invite inquiries and feedback on the document. This is in recognition that capacity development for disaster risk reduction is continuously evolving over time. To ensure that this primer remains relevant to the changing environment where it is applied and used, the document will continue to be updated and revised. Process for developing the primer The primer was initiated through a brief survey carried out through the Disaster Reduction Management (DRM)-Asia Community of Practice inviting members to identify the need, purpose, audience and key themes for such a primer. This was followed by a compilation and analysis of relevant project documents to indicate the trends across UNDP projects and initiatives addressing capacity development in the area of risk reduction. The next phase was a regional \u2018write-shop\u2019 in which some practitioners contributed more actively to the development of the primer through written inputs as well as by providing real experiences that serve as case studies. The last stage of finalizing the primer has been through a virtual peer review involving practitioners across the region. iii Acknowledgements Strengthening Capacities for Disaster Risk Reduction A Primer Acknowledgements The process of developing the primer was facilitated by the UNDP Regional Crisis Prevention and Recovery Programme based at the Asia-Pacific Regional Centre (APRC).

Rationale for the primer Capacity development (CD) and disaster risk reduction (DRR) are currently placed at the core of UNDP\u2019s mandate and functions. These two practice areas have been formulating and implementing programmes and interventions alongside each other. However, there are few resources, reports and documents available that point to an integrated approach of implementing these two complementary areas of work. The primer seeks to address this gap through a participatory and collective effort by practitioners and experts of both sectors to develop an integrated framework for capacity development for disaster risk reduction or, as simply termed in this primer, \u2018CD for DRR\u2019. UNDP\u2019s corporate policy on CD for DRR is based on country-level experiences and demand. Practitioners in the region have pointed out strengths and weaknesses, and identified the key programming and operational issues often encountered in the \u2018business\u2019 of CD for DRR. This highlights the lack of an integrated approach to implementing CD for DRR (see Box 1). In strengthening capacities for DRR in the region, the Regional Crisis Prevention and Recovery (RCPR) team has carried out a number of initiatives in partnership with UNDP Country Offices (CO) and partners who serve as lead agencies in DRR efforts at the country level. Some of this work has entailed carrying out comprehensive capacity assessments in Indonesia, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Timor- Leste, which have shown varying levels of capacity. In 2008, a regional workshop was organized on CD for DRR by the Asia Pacific Regional Centre (APRC). At this workshop participants were familiarized with UNDP CD methodology, and identified the limitations of using a generic framework. This exercise highlighted the need for a package or tool Chapter I Box 1: Issues encountered by practitioners in implementing CD for DRR in UNDP programmes Weaknesses \u2022\ufffdDifficulties in defining and achieving \u2018combined\u2019 CD\u2013 DRR results. \u2022\ufffdDRR programmes/projects are activity-focused and rigidly process-oriented, relegating achievements in building DRR capacity to the sidelines. \u2022\ufffdThe prevailing practice of capacity \u2018substitution\u2019 places heavy reliance on external experts to undertake DRR responsibilities and tasks, leaving in-house and in-country capacities under-utilized. \u2022\ufffdDRR practitioners have limited access to CD innovations. \u2022\ufffdDRR programming and project development can sometimes be too ambitious, neglecting the basics of developing functional and technical capacities. \u2022\ufffdCompeting priorities among practice areas i.e. gender, climate change, democratic governance, poverty reduction, crisis prevention and recovery. \u2022\ufffdInterventions are often regarded as a time-bound project rather than a continuing programme, raising issues of sustainability and ownership.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b27f0c85-8234-46ed-aa51-40d4751db171": {"__data__": {"id_": "b27f0c85-8234-46ed-aa51-40d4751db171", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-capacities-disaster-risk-reduction-primer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strengthening Capacities for Disaster Risk Reduction - A Primer", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-capacities-disaster-risk-reduction-primer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "02f9c6e820c5f6b9b033c8e4ddfac2bfd32c3aadb963ddefe427ed666d6d4608"}, "2": {"node_id": "869a1389-fd95-4023-897d-e8f38368f91b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-capacities-disaster-risk-reduction-primer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a65ea1de50f4b85f35a80dd4cd1398968b0648628c066f835647d43bb9554f94"}}, "hash": "2f2712f37f693b314bef142cd52b9440f86cf5eaf92e14c7546020894426e58a", "text": "Strengths UNDP\u2019s internal DRM and DRR technical skills. \u2022\ufffdCountry presence of UNDP and its relationships with national governments at country level. \u2022\ufffdUNDP\u2019s position as a neutral broker and convening force in the development realm. \u2022\ufffd Presence of regional and global networks and partnerships. \u2022\ufffd Mobilization of cross-sectoral expertise.

Similarly, the project document analysis undertaken to inform this primer5 noted the need to embed CD in the programme/project formulation process and in the programmatic interventions for DRR. In doing so, the focus must be placed on developing both the technical capacities important for dealing with specialized subject matter on DRR, as well as the functional capacities needed for operationalization. The analysis also noted that DRR programmes and projects tend to set high-level outcomes: for example, the mainstreaming of DRR in development, the establishing of legal systems and frameworks for DRR, etc. However, there often remain critical functional capacity gaps in the very institution or organization that is expected to lead, coordinate and implement DRR initiatives. There is a glaring \u2018disconnect\u2019 between levels of ambition and the capacities required to achieve higher DRR goals and results. Thus there is a need to ensure that CD interventions and responses are integrated in the overall DRR programme or project approach and results framework. B. Who is the primer for? The primer is intended for UNDP use, particularly by the Crisis Prevention and Recovery (CPR) focal points in the Asia-Pacific region. More specifically, it is for the use of practitioners and programme staff who formulate, manage and implement DRR programmes, projects and activities. It is also intended to be a useful resource for UNDP managers who provide oversight and quality assurance for programmes, projects, processes and products aiming at the reduction of disaster risks and adaptation to climate change (CC). DRR and CC focal points in the country offices could act as disseminators in providing and sharing relevant content with partners involved in similar initiatives. C. What does the primer offer? The primer consolidates information about current practice on CD for DRR initiatives in the region. It seeks to be a reference and source of guidance on the fundamentals and basic concepts of applying an integrated approach to CD for DRR. It is not however an encyclopaedia of DRR concepts or CD approaches. The primer provides foundational knowledge on how to formulate and monitor CD strategies and interventions for DRR. It views DRR through a CD lens, identifying where best practices, tools and methodologies for CD are being utilized in DRR programme and project development, in the hope of improving the practice of CD in DRR. It is intended to be a readily accessible collection of references that specifically responds to users\u2019 needs, builds on existing toolkits, and is shaped directly by the experiences of and contributions from practitioners in the region. Information in the primer regarding programme formulation, implementation and monitoring can be contextualized as needed. 5 The Project Document Analysis is a brief report which involved the analysis of 11 project documents from 11 countries in South East, South West and South Asia. Its primary aim was to compile and produce an analysis of practices and real experiences of capacity development initiatives in DRR programmes and projects. 4 Introduction to the primer D. Framework: CD for DRR The primer applies UNDP\u2019s CD methodology to DRR programmes and initiatives. During the process of developing the primer, the term \u2018Capacity Development for Disaster Risk Reduction\u2019 (or CD for DRR) has been coined and is used extensively. CD for DRR is a process through which the abilities of individuals, organizations and societies to minimise vulnerabilities to disaster risks, to avoid (prevent) or to limit (mitigate and prepare for) the adverse impacts of hazards are obtained, strengthened, adapted and maintained over time. The philosophy, principles and substance of an integrated approach to CD for DRR are captured in the framework below (see Figure 1). Figure 2: Framework of CD for DRR The framework attempts to answer some of the following questions: Whose capacities do we need to develop? To what end do we need to develop this capacity? What kinds of capacities need to be developed for this? What will be their purpose? How do we measure and monitor these capacities and the results that they are meant to achieve?

CAPACITY FOR WHAT? TYPES OF CAPACITIES LEVELS OF CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT CAPACITY FOR WHOM? Individual Organizational Enabling Environment The systematic incorporation of risk reduction approaches into the implementation of emergency prepareness, response and recovery programmes 5 Introduction to the primer Strengthening Capacities for Disaster Risk Reduction A Primer The HFA i.e. its five priorities for action, the three levels of capacity (the enabling environment, organizational and individual levels), and the types of capacities (functional and technical) are cited throughout this primer and form the basis of an integrated approach to CD for DRR. E. How do we use this primer? As noted in the preceding section, this primer is intended as resource material for users \u2013 primarily UNDP staff who are directly or indirectly involved in DRR work. While it provides suggestions and guidance to improve the practice of CD in the field of DRR, the options for formulating initiatives and programmes are neither exhaustive nor prescriptive, as they are based on a mapping of existing practices in a set of countries in the region.7 The use of any of these options will depend upon the contextual realities at the country level. To best understand the content and flow of this primer, it is recommended to have a closer look at the framework of the primer as detailed in this introductory section. The chapters are arranged according to a logical sequence of the key elements essential for programming and project formulation. \u2022\ufffd Chapter I provides a brief introduction to the primer itself. \u2022\ufffd Chapter II describes the scope of CD for DRR. It makes extensive reference to the HFA when discussing the underlying reasons for doing CD for DRR. It also provides a brief narrative on levels and types of capacities. \u2022\ufffd Chapter III provides an overview of the CD process, using the UNDP approach. \u2022\ufffd Chapter IV refers to the HFA priorities in describing CD for DRR results according to priorities for action. Functional and technical capacities for each priority are also identified across the three tiers of capacity development \u2013 enabling environment, organizational and individual levels. \u2022\ufffd Chapter V introduces CD strategies for addressing capacity gaps in DRR programs and interventions. \u2022\ufffd Chapter VI looks at evaluating CD for DRR interventions, and provides examples of outputs and indicators for measuring CD results. \u2022\ufffd Chapter VII provides a typology of capacity builders for both functional and technical capacities, classified according to the HFA Priorities for Action. This primer should be read in conjunction with the UNDP Practice Notes on Capacity Development and Capacity Assessment, the UNDP CD Primer as well as the Hyogo Framework for Action, as they provide explanations of the terms and concepts used in this document. 7 Full set of analysis is referred to in the ProDoc Analysis 1 6 The scope of CD for DRR The scope of CD for DRR This chapter attempts to introduce the concept of CD for DRR. It discusses what CD means when applied in the context of DRR. The first part of the chapter outlines the relevant references in corporate policies and international frameworks as well as the ProDoc Analysis report,8 the CCA- UNDAF and Capacity Assessment Reports of selected countries in the region. The chapter also covers the types of capacities, the three levels and core issues of CD. A. Why CD for DRR? CD and DRR are both at the core of UNDP\u2019s priorities. UNDP considers CD to be the \u201chow\u201d of development, at the heart of the organization\u2019s mandate and functions.9 Numerous UNDP corporate policies, international commitments and frameworks emphasize the significance of CD for DRR in achieving sustainable development. These can be viewed in Annexes: \u2022\ufffd UNDP Strategic Plan (2008\u20132013)37 \u2022\ufffd Hyogo Framework for Action \u2022\ufffd Common Country Assessment (CCA)/UN Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) Guidelines \u2022\ufffd Global Assessment Report (GAR) 2009 \u2022\ufffd Integrating DRR into UNDAFs (Powerpoints). Lessons learnt from past experience demonstrate the importance of local leadership and ownership of CD interventions \u2014 outside actors can support but should not drive the process. When undertaking CD work, two critical questions need to be asked: whose capacity, and capacity for what? The UNDP goal is to support partners in developing their own capacities to lead, manage, achieve and account for their priorities. This emphasis is highly relevant for DRR, given that: (a) disaster risk will only be effectively reduced if there is strong national and local ownership/capacity; and (b) effective emergency response,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "af0b61e1-25fd-40b6-ab52-41dd78dc2ecc": {"__data__": {"id_": "af0b61e1-25fd-40b6-ab52-41dd78dc2ecc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-capacities-disaster-risk-reduction-primer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strengthening Capacities for Disaster Risk Reduction - A Primer", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-capacities-disaster-risk-reduction-primer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "35a552c9437671a15bfc7528ab2b1d82fa47b2ac22daca3992c432210bd2b20f"}, "3": {"node_id": "84d302e2-8239-4d79-ae87-10d4f5e858c7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-capacities-disaster-risk-reduction-primer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a7b3ecc97e0d72c654a6bdc679f27d95bf592938307d66aadce9a35d5f2dba49"}}, "hash": "7c78d00de0bf8c4cb0b4723c44230a7a349196f292e980fa560cebe61ef22d79", "text": "when disasters do occur, relies on the appropriateness and timeliness of national and local interventions. The HFA makes specific reference to empowering communities and local authorities to manage their own development by supporting their access to necessary information, resources and authority to implement DRR actions as a part of their decision-making. CD should be at the centre of DRR planning and programming, not inserted as an afterthought or add-on.10 Strengthening governance arrangements, improving management of investments and developing capacities are key requirements for addressing the underlying risk factors, and for ensuring investments for DRR are in place. Investing today to strengthen risk-reducing capacities is critical to making a safer tomorrow. 8 See Analysis of UNDP CO DRM/DRR project documents to inform the development of the primer on \u201cStrengthening Capacities for DRR\u201d 9 Refer to UNDP Strategic Plan (2008\u20132011) 10 Ibid. Chapter II 7 The scope of CD for DRR Strengthening Capacities for Disaster Risk Reduction A Primer The Global Assessment Report (GAR) 200911 highlights the causes of underachievement of most of the HFA indicators which, among other factors, points to the lack of technical, financial and human resource capacities. Examples of challenges directly owing to low levels of capacity (across indicators) are outlined in Box 2. These challenges clearly highlight the relevance of an integrated approach for CD and DRR. 11 Link to United Nations (2009).

While the results of these processes still remain to be seen in the near future, the initial findings and recommendations with regard to capacity assessment and CD have already proven useful. The analysis of project documents carried out to inform the primer also indicates that most projects designed and implemented have shown relatively weak application of CD, although the term is often tagged and used frequently in the project titles. Projects often do not explicitly identify what types of capacities require strengthening (i.e. functional or technical), nor do they identify whose capacities are to be strengthened and at which level \u2013 whether at the level of enabling environment/ institutions, organizations or individuals. B. Capacity for what? UNDP\u2019s CD approach recognizes two types of capacities: functional and technical. These capacities reside across the structures of government, the private sector, and civil society or the non-state actors in both formal and informal institutions. Functional capacities are a set of skills related to planning, implementing, monitoring and evaluating initiatives for DRR.14 UNDP has identified five functional capacities that are central to the outcome of development endeavours. The functional capacities are as follows: (a) Capacity to engage with stakeholders (i.e. to build and manage partnerships, to foster an enabling environment for civil society and private sector); (b) Capacity to assess a situation and define a vision and mandate (i.e. to gather information and conduct evaluative analysis, to adapt global knowledge to the local context, and to translate this into a vision and mandate for the future); (c) Capacity to formulate policies and strategies (i.e. to set objectives, to develop appropriate policies, to develop strategies and draw up action plans); (d) Capacity to budget, manage and implement (i.e. to develop budgets for CD strategies and actions, to implement strategies, action plans and policies, and to mobilize and manage resources); 12 Refer to UNDP\u2019s The Story of an Institution, Series 1, January 2010; see also Report on Assessing Capacities of the NDMO, Lao PDR (2007) 13 Refer to Strengthening the country\u2019s capacity to address and prepare for disasters http://www.undplao.org/ newsroom/Strengthening.php 14 See UNDP (2007) Capacity Development Practice Note 9 The scope of CD for DRR Strengthening Capacities for Disaster Risk Reduction A Primer (e) Capacity to monitor and evaluate (i.e. to monitor and measure progress, and to evaluate planning, implementation and results).15 Technical capacities are associated with particular areas of professional expertise or knowledge, such as engineering, agriculture, education, etc. They vary and are directly related to the sector or organizational context in focus, in this case DRR. DRR technical capacities are further categorized according to strategic results, as identified in the HFA (see Annexes to Chapters IV and VI for examples). Examples of DRR-related technical capacities include: utilizing physical, social and economic sciences and technologies such as geographic information systems (GIS), modelling, database development and information management systems (IMS) for early warning systems (EWS) and risk assessment; integrating DRR with responses to climate change and environment; mainstreaming DRR into agriculture, health, economics, and infrastructure and land-use planning. C. Whose capacity? Capacity resides at different levels \u2013 in the enabling environment, organizations and individuals \u2013 and thus needs to be assessed and addressed across these levels. It is these three tiers which define the realm of whose capacities need to be developed. UNDP distinguishes between these different levels of capacity (see Figure 2): The enabling environment is the broad social system within which people and organizations function. It includes all the rules, laws, policies, power relations and social norms that govern civic engagement. It is the enabling environment that sets the overall scope for CD. 15 Ibid. Enabling environment (policies, legistation, power relations, social norms) Individual level (experience, knowledge, technical skills) Organizational level (internal policies, arrangements, procedures, frameworks) Figure 3: Levels of capacity 10 The scope of CD for DRR The organizational level refers to the internal structures, policies and procedures that determine an organization\u2019s effectiveness. It is here that the benefits of the enabling environment are put into action and a collection of individuals come together.

It also encapsulates UNDP\u2019s CD approach as a conceptual basis for doing CD in DRR. It contextualizes the basic CD principles, the CD process, the capacity assessment process, CD core issues and CD responses to the DRR field. A. Basic CD principles The practice and application of CD for DRR is contingent upon existing principles, processes and tools that have been extensively used and applied across different situations and development streams (see Box 3). In undertaking CD initiatives, UNDP promotes ten basic principles that inspire ownership, transform leadership and help ensure progress in CD efforts.16 These are also fundamental when a CD approach is applied or practiced in DRR initiatives. B. The capacity development cycle For UNDP, supporting CD is a process that consists of a five-step cycle embedded into a programming process (Figure 3): 1. Engage stakeholders on capacity development 2. Assess capacity assets and needs 3. Formulate a capacity development response 4. Implement the response 5. Evaluate capacity development. When used and applied in the context of DRR, these entail: Step 1: Engage stakeholders CD for DRR begins with the engagement of those who stand to benefit the most from enhanced capacity. They are the key stakeholders who are mandated, tasked to, or expected to contribute to the efforts of reducing disaster risks. Enhanced capacity is best achieved when the decision to undertake capacity development is organic or made internally by key actors and players in DRR, rather than when it is imposed by external forces and interests. Therefore, engaging stakeholders is a fundamental step in initiating the CD process. When key stakeholders are engaged right from the beginning, it promotes a sense of ownership and accountability over the process of CD. 16 See UNDP (2007) Capacity Development Practice Note Chapter III Box 3: The Basic Principles of CD \u2022\ufffdDon\u2019t rush.

Conduct the assessment: The capacity assessment compares desired capacity against existing capacity. People may be tempted to set the level of desired capacity at the highest level attainable. It is important to define realistic goals with a realistic timeframe for developing capacities. 17 See UNDP CD Primer, p. 23 Step 1: Engage stakeholders on capacity development Capacity Development Process Step 2: Assess capacity assets and needs Step 5: Evaluate capacity development Step 3: Formulate a capacity development response Step 4: Implement a capacity development response 13 CD for DRR: The process Strengthening Capacities for Disaster Risk Reduction A Primer Summarize and interpret results: Comparing desired and existing capacities provides the basis for formulating capacity development responses. When interpreting the results of the assessment, the assessment team will be able to discern patterns in capacity gaps to identify whether a gap is consistently large across a core issue or across a specific capacity. It is important to gather a variety of perspectives and take into account different points of view. Step 3: Formulate a CD response A good CD response builds on existing capacity assets to address the gaps identified in a capacity assessment. Most stakeholders prefer to play to their strengths \u2013 their capacity assets \u2013 and use what they are doing right in order to do other things better. Sometimes it may be important to define \u2018quick win\u2019 or short-term CD activities to help shore up support while the foundation is being laid for longer-term CD initiatives. The design of a CD response should therefore contain a combination of quick-impact initiatives (less than one year) and short- to medium-term (one year or longer) initiatives. This is particularly critical in post-crisis and transition situations.18 Step 4: Implement the response The implementation phase is where the real action occurs. This is the point where all the thinking, planning, assessing, analyzing and designing is tested in the real world. For the most sustainable long-term results, implementation should be managed through national systems and processes rather than through the parallel systems of external partners. The very fact of using national systems can help strengthen essential capacities such as project management and procurement. Partner countries are more likely to have a sense of ownership of CD initiatives when their own systems and procedures are used for implementation. It is therefore important to help strengthen these systems.19 Step 5: Evaluate CD Measurement of CD success cannot be reduced to an increase in input resources such as human, financial, or physical resources. The input of resources does not guarantee their contribution to development objectives. Progress and results are reflected by changes in performance, which can be measured in terms of improved efficiency and effectiveness.20 All the steps outlined above are critical in recognizing that CD is a long and on-going process. Most CD for DRR interventions do not follow a systematic approach, and most interventions and activities are aimed at providing one-off trainings or buying specific equipment. However, adopting a systematic approach to CD for DRR is an evolving process, where needs and gaps can be assessed, interventions can be planned and proposed accordingly, and change can be measured across a continuum. 18 See UNDP CD Primer, p. 27 19 See UNDP CD Primer, p. 29 20 See UNDP CD Primer, p. 32 14 CD for DRR results CD for DRR results A. Overview CD for DRR results are DRR outputs that have been achieved through the process of developing capacities (both functional and technical) across the three tiers of enabling environment or institutional, organizational and individual levels. DRR outputs are more systematically achieved and therefore sustained when the capacities of DRR institutions, organizations and individuals have increased. A CD process in the context of DRR is pursued in order to facilitate and manage change in capacity levels\u2013from existing or current levels of capacities (functional or technical), to the desired levels of capacities for risk reduction. Existing and desired levels of capacities are identified in more detail during the capacity assessment process.21 Programmatic responses for developing capacity are intended to increase the capacity of an entity (most frequently an institution). The resulting change enables it to increase its contribution to improving people\u2019s lives.22 DRR results are achieved when the capacities of DRR institutions, organizations and individuals have increased from an existing state to a higher state. CD interventions should therefore be directed at institutions, organizations and individuals involved in the whole cycle of planning, implementing, monitoring and evaluating DRR initiatives.

The results matrix The following section of this chapter presents a matrix of CD for DRR Results (see Annex). It is arranged based on the HFA Priorities for Action and each HFA priority has a list of recommended CD for DRR Results. The list is neither exhaustive nor prescriptive and the choice of CD for DRR results largely depends on the country context. The CD element is emphasized by identifying the functional and technical capacities required to attain DRR results, building on those identified in UNDP\u2019s CD methodology and the technical skills relating to HFA priorities. This framework presupposes that the logical consequence of investments in developing both functional and technical capacities will be stronger, better and more resilient institutions and organizations, which are able to implement and attain higher DRR outcomes. 21 See UNDP CA methodology 22 See Measuring Capacity, Capacity Development Group, Bureau for Development Policy, UNDP (2010) Chapter IV 15 CD for DRR strategies Strengthening Capacities for Disaster Risk Reduction A Primer CD for DRR strategies A. Overview Achieving CD for DRR results will require identifying and strengthening both functional and technical capacities. In order to attain the level of capacity required to achieve DRR results, it is necessary to design CD strategies that are both relevant and robust, and which target specific capacity gaps. As outlined in the UNDP Practice Note on Capacity Development, UNDP has identified four core issues. These four core issues, which are described in more detail below, are also sometimes referred to as \u2018levers of change\u2019 or \u2018drivers of change\u2019. They represent areas where, on the one hand, capacity constraints are often observed, but on the other hand, where positive and sustainable change in capacity can take place. B. Core issues Within the UNDP approach to capacity development, four core issues have been identified; these four core issues represent broad categories of development challenges that UNDP sees most commonly encountered across a variety of sectors: public, private, non-profit, civil society, etc. During the capacity assessment process, specific functional and technical capacities are identified and analysed in relation to the following four core issues: Institutional arrangements are the policies, practices and systems that allow for effective functioning of an organization or group. These may include \u2018hard\u2019 rules such as laws or the terms of a contract, or \u2018soft\u2019 rules like codes of conduct or generally accepted values. Leadership is the ability to influence, inspire and motivate others to achieve or even go beyond their goals. It is also the ability to anticipate and respond to change. Leadership is not necessarily synonymous with a position of authority; it can also be informal and can be held at many levels. Knowledge or literally \u2018what people know\u2019, underpins their capacities and hence capacity development. Seen from the perspective of our three levels, knowledge has traditionally been fostered at the individual level, mostly through education. But it can also be created and shared within an organization and within the enabling environment. Accountability exists when rights holders are able to make duty bearers deliver on their obligations. More specifically, it is about the willingness and ability of public institutions to put in place systems and mechanisms to engage citizen groups to capture and utilise their feedback as well as the capacities of the latter to make use of such platforms. C. CD response strategies The four core issues also link closely to UNDP\u2019s CD responses, and are often the basis for formulating strategies to address identified capacity gaps emerging from an assessment. As seen in the table below, the four core issues correspond directly to the four CD responses: Chapter V 16 CD for DRR strategies Core issue CD response 1. Institutional Arrangements \uf0e8 Institutional reform and incentive mechanisms 2. Leadership \uf0e8 Leadership development 3. Knowledge \uf0e8 Education, training and learning 4.

In the matrix to this chapter, CD for DRR strategies have been organized by core issue and also sub-divided by the three levels of an enabling environment, organizational and individual levels. Specific country case examples are also provided in order to highlight one or a combination of CD strategies that have been implemented for DRR and have led to concrete results.

Core issue: INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS CD response: Institutional reform and incentive mechanisms | LINK TO MATRIX Annex to CHAPTER V | Institutional arrangements refer to the policies, procedures, and processes that allow systems to function and interact effectively and efficiently in an organized setting. Within the enabling environment, institutional arrangements are policy and legal frameworks; at the organizational level, they include an organization\u2019s strategy, processes, and technology that enable its operation. Internal accountability mechanisms also fall under this core issue. There are a number of strategies to address institutional arrangement issues.23 These include, but are not limited to, the following: \u2022\ufffd Mandate and role clarifications \u2022\ufffd Streamlined business processes \u2022\ufffd Horizontal and vertical coordination mechanisms \u2022\ufffd Integrated monitoring and evaluation (M&E) frameworks. Core issue: LEADERSHIP CD response: Leadership development | LINK TO MATRIX Annex to CHAPTER V | Leadership is the ability to influence, inspire and motivate people, organizations and systems to achieve and, in many cases, go beyond their goals. It is a catalyst for achieving, enhancing and sustaining development objectives. It is also the ability to be open to, anticipate and respond to change, irrespective of whether this is internally initiated or externally imposed. A key determinant 23 See UNDP (2010) Measuring Capacity, p. 17 17 CD for DRR strategies Strengthening Capacities for Disaster Risk Reduction A Primer of leadership is whether it is able to rally others around a common goal.24 Strategies for leadership development include the following: \u2022\ufffd Joint visioning exercises; systems thinking \u2022\ufffd Identification and support to champions and change agents \u2022\ufffd Setting priorities; sequencing and strategic planning techniques \u2022\ufffd Coaching and mentoring Core issue: KNOWLEDGE CD response: Education, training and learning | LINK TO MATRIX Annex to CHAPTER V| Knowledge refers to the creation, absorption and diffusion of information and expertise towards effective development solutions. Knowledge can be developed at a variety of levels (national and local, secondary and tertiary) and through a variety of means (education, technical training, knowledge networks, and informal learning).25 There are a number of CD actions to strengthen knowledge acquisition and retention, including: \u2022\ufffd Institutional twinning arrangements \u2022\ufffd Linking to regional educational and learning networks \u2022\ufffd Expertise on training and learning methodologies \u2022\ufffd Brain gain and retention strategies Core issue: ACCOUNTABILITY CD response: Accountability and voice mechanisms | LINK TO MATRIX Annex to CHAPTER V | Accountability exists when two parties adhere to a set of rules and procedures that govern their interactions and are based on mutual agreement. It allows organizations and systems to monitor, learn, self-regulate and adjust their behaviour in interaction with those to whom they are accountable.

Overview As noted in the preceding chapter, CD for DRR results are achieved through the process of developing capacities of the enabling environment or institutions, of organizations and of individuals. Developing capacities means increasing the capacity of an entity (most frequently an institution) from an existing level (or state) to a higher level (or state). The capture of this change in capacity is the measurement of capacity developed from an existing state to a higher state. Measuring capacity is looking at the change in institutions \u2013 are they stronger, better, more resilient? UNDP has introduced a Capacity Measurement Framework (see Figure 2) using a results-based management approach. It recognizes three levels of measurement:27 1.

Indicators at this level tend to be quantitative and limited in number; and although data may sometimes be costly or otherwise difficult to attain, there is strong incentive and often international support for gathering such data and reporting on progress at this level. See UNDP (2010) Measuring Capacity, p. 8. 29 Measuring Outcome (Change in Institutional Performance, Stability and Adaptability): Key to the achievement of development goals is a continuous improvement in the performance, stability and adaptability of national institutions responsible for development. Improvements can be measured by an institution\u2019s ability to: a) Convert inputs to productive use (performance); b) Seek resolution to problems and remove barriers (stability); c) Adapt to changing realities and demands (adaptability). See UNDP (2010) Measuring Capacity, p. 8. 30 Measuring Output (Products Produced and Services Provided based on Capacity Development Core Issues): Institutions can become stronger when they have in place the policies, systems, processes and mechanisms that allow them to do what they do better. The formulation, establishment and implementation of these assets are the essence of capacity development. See UNDP Measuring Capacity 2010, p. 9. 31 Ibid.

Measuring capacity changes brought about through CD response strategies Also based on the CD for DRR results identified in Chapter IV, the matrix in the annex for this chapter presents a menu of options on CD for DRR outputs and output indicators. The outputs and output indicators have been organized to correspond to the four CD response strategies that were introduced in Chapter V: Institutional Reform and Incentive Mechanisms; Leadership Development; Education, Training and Learning; and Accountability and Voice Mechanisms. These CD strategies offer a starting point for formulating and implementing programmatic CD responses whose outputs can contribute to stronger institutions for DRR in a particular country context.

Overview When enhancing capacities for DRR it is critical to identify service providers or capacity builders that can serve as partners for implementing activities. This chapter deals with a set of suggested criteria for identifying and selecting the most appropriate service providers for CD for DRR \u2013 simply termed in this primer as \u2018capacity builders\u2019. It also discusses briefly the types of capacity builders and the pros and cons for utilizing their expertise. The chapter also includes a menu of options of capacity service providers for both functional and technical capacities that UNDP country offices and government counterparts could engage. B. Criteria for choosing capacity builders The type of service provider or partner to engage depends on the task at hand (requirement), the target group, complexity of the task and the coverage area. In order to guide those who are embarking on CD for DRR initiatives or projects, the following set of criteria can be used as a reference. Criteria for finding the appropriate partner may include the following: \u2022\ufffd Target audience (duty bearers, rights holders, journalists, etc.)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "354b6dc7-9c6f-4cad-83b5-ac2ed1b9992b": {"__data__": {"id_": "354b6dc7-9c6f-4cad-83b5-ac2ed1b9992b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-capacities-disaster-risk-reduction-primer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strengthening Capacities for Disaster Risk Reduction - A Primer", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-capacities-disaster-risk-reduction-primer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e914c679d468258b240e59a148d33ac8dc60bd00a67438d217627286e2a92230"}, "2": {"node_id": "c16f332c-b784-4a8e-8fb8-9eed91391725", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-capacities-disaster-risk-reduction-primer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ab5fc00d2b8f171ff3df8d1a4920590ee6ea349fac2a972fada1b3e667ceddc3"}}, "hash": "c5186a1b0b683ac71f703305def1b08ef1b42f7d3b6500b8de7f0ee349b6eafd", "text": "\u2022\ufffd Cost-effectiveness \u2022\ufffd Scalability \u2022\ufffd Knowledge \u2022\ufffd Know-how (practice) \u2022\ufffd Implementation capacity (human resources, systems and procedures, infrastructure) \u2022\ufffd Networks with decision-makers/policy-makers \u2022\ufffd Political clout/neutrality \u2022\ufffd Credibility/reputation/references \u2022\ufffd Permanence/duration of engagement (short, medium, long term) \u2022\ufffd Demonstrated ability to organize/mobilize community \u2022\ufffd Demonstrated ability to innovate and be creative C.

Capacity builders should meet UNDP\u2019s core values and mainstreaming requirements, for example, in the areas of gender equality, inclusion, human rights and climate-change resilience. This should be emphasized in the terms of reference and/or conditions of service right from the inception phase. The following are broad categories of capacity builders that may be engaged in the implementation of Chapter VII 21 Capacity builders Strengthening Capacities for Disaster Risk Reduction A Primer capacity development responses. Services they provide could include academic research, monitoring and evaluation, policy advocacy, knowledge sharing, training and project execution, among others. \u2022\ufffd Regional platforms (inter-governmental and non-governmental) \u2022\ufffd International agencies (government or non-government) \u2022\ufffd National agencies (government or non-government) \u2022\ufffd Sub-national/local agencies (government or non-government) What are the options, and the pros and cons for each option? Under what conditions would one decide for or against one or more of these options? This list is not exhaustive but indicative in nature. Types Pros Cons Regional platforms (Intergovernmental and non-governmental) Would bring in regional good practices and could add value through lessons learned from similar countries in the region, ability to influence policy decisions, strengthening of south-south engagements National priorities may not get adequate attention as the focus would be regional, level of engagement may not be sufficient, difficulty to ensure long-term commitment and follow-up International agencies (those based outside the country) Would bring in global good practices and could add value through lessons learned from these practices. Challenge of adapting to the local context without compromising good practice, difficult to ensure follow-up National resource agencies Ability to contextualise the requirements and use national resources, sustainable, cost-effective, close to policy/decision makers, enabling scalability Influenced by political powers, could be detached from ground realities Sub-national/local resource agencies Would build local capacities (sustainable), highly contextual, would be responsive to local-level changes, cost-effective Issues with quality, systems , procedures and infrastructure; difficult to monitor activities of multiple partners with small footprints; difficult to scale up D. Existing or potential capacity builders This is a menu of options of existing and potential capacity service providers for both functional and technical capacities. The minimum criteria are also identified to guide the users of this primer in their selection.

(2009). Capacity Development: A UNDP Primer 26 Annex to Chapter IV Annex to Chapter IV While this matrix outlines specific CD for DRR results for each HFA priority area, for the purpose of providing a succinct set of examples against the types and levels of capacities, the National Disaster Management Organization (NDMO) has been selected as the focus for several CD interventions. While a good CD intervention should have a multi-sectoral approach for DRR, the same trend is also seen through the ProDoc analysis, where most countries adopted a single-agency approach and targeted the NDMO as the focus agency/institution for CD interventions. CD FOR DRR RESULTS MATRIX HFA priority 1: Ensure that DRR is a national and local priority with a strong institutional basis for implementation CD for DRR results: 1. National government takes a multi-stakeholder and cross-sector approach to addressing DRR issues, increasing both efficiency of policy formulation and effectiveness of policies. 2. All levels of government have explicit responsibilities and mandates for DRR provided for by legislation. 3. The legal framework for DRR facilitates increase in national and/or institutional capacity for DRR. 4. Inclusive and integrated DRR mechanisms are created and strengthened through a multi-sectoral national platform, DRM/DRR steering committee, disaster coordinating councils/committees. 5. DRR is integrated into development policies and planning at all levels of government, including in sectoral and multi-sectoral plans and policies. 6. Increased resource allocation (financial, human, and technical) for the development and implementation of DRM policies, programs, and laws.

The trend from these examples is a good indicator of where most of the CD for DRR strategies are currently focused. For example, there are many instances of CD interventions that target institutional arrangements, whereas there are fewer that improve accountability. Similarly, leadership as a core issue and at the individual level seems to have received much less attention, whereas addressing the core issue of knowledge at the individual level seems much more common, through individuals attending trainings, etc. This matrix provides some insights into areas where investments may be needed, but so far have been accorded lower priority in many countries. 1.

China 1. China Capacity development for community-based DRR (CBDRR) \u2013 a breakthrough in China Situation China is a disaster-prone country. Disasters affect China's most impoverished population, particularly those in poor rural areas. The massive earthquake in 2008 not only killed nearly 70,000 people in southwest China, but also had a big impact on more than 360,000 rural poor. Very often poor rural communities are fragile due to weak DRR infrastructure and low capacities for effective community- based response to disasters. In the country, community disaster prevention and reduction is at an inception stage and there is limited guidance or support from the Government on CBDRR. In support of the post-earthquake recovery, UNDP China implemented an integrated early recovery project in 19 poor, affected villages. One component of the project was to strengthen the capacity of the communities in emergency response and preparedness for future disasters. Response UNDP worked at different levels to address the issue. It employed a combination of CD responses to address the weak and low capacity levels of communities in disaster response in the following ways: Assessment and policy studies: At national level, UNDP supported the National Disaster Risk Reduction Center of China (NDRCC) in conducting an assessment of CBDRR with a focus on poor rural communities; Leadership building: At local level, based on the findings of the assessment, UNDP designed and organized a series of training workshops for local leadership building in CBDRR, targeting local government officials and community leaders. Direct technical assistance to communities: At community level, technical support was provided to pilot villages to initiate their own contingency planning and conduct drill exercises. Results Using a combination of CD responses to enhance communities\u2019 capacity for disaster preparedness and response, the following intermediate results were achieved: \u2022\ufffd An analytical report was produced on the capacity for CBDRR in rural communities of China; it was the first such report ever done by Chinese DRR authorities with a focus on rural communities. \u2022\ufffd CBDRR models were introduced, piloted and integrated in the post-disaster early recovery process; 7,671 villagers participated in the community contingency planning and emergency drills, including 3,437 women and 1,146 children \u2022\ufffd One of the pilot CBDRR villages was recognized by the Ministry of Civil Affairs in China as a model community for comprehensive DRR, among more than 400 other communities.

Nepal 2. Nepal Fostering a culture of strong partnerships for a risk- resilient Nepal Nepal has made remarkable progress in DRR in the recent years. While the state apparatus and mechanisms at all levels are still very much preoccupied with post-disaster response, the combined efforts of development partners and the government has opened up new avenues for CD to reduce risks in advance of disasters. Given the transitional stage of governance long prevalent in Nepal, CD efforts have experienced several difficulties on the way to making the policy and institutional reforms that are necessary for DRR. Nevertheless, the coherent and collaborative efforts of partners have brought some changes, considered prerequisite for working on DRR, in the mindset of policy makers. The institutionalisation of these efforts\u2013for example, the joint policy advocacy and development of advocacy tools\u2013has gradually started with the adjustment of mandates of existing institutions including the ministry of home affairs, traditionally responsible for disaster preparedness and response, and the government agencies responsible for development planning. Further progress will depend upon how institutions evolve during the political transition in the country. In coming years, capacity development for DRR should focus on developing the functional and technical capacities of the existing government institutions to foster a culture of strong partnerships with non-government actors to achieve the DRR goals outlined in Nepal\u2019s national strategy for disaster risk management. Following are a few successful examples of combined partners\u2019 efforts and multi-stakeholder approaches adopted in Nepal for working on disaster preparedness and risk reduction issues. a) A long-term strategy for DRR formulated Following the five priorities identified under the HFA, UNDP Nepal took the lead in developing a long- term risk reduction strategy for Nepal, to be used as a guide for necessary policy and institutional reforms required for DRR. The process of strategy formulation took almost two years (2007-2008) to complete and more than a year (2009) to get the endorsement of Nepal\u2019s cabinet. Along with strategy formulation, the process of sensitizing the concerned authorities to the urgency for taking proactive pre-disaster measures was also initiated. An analysis of risk and capacity gaps against the 5 HFA priority areas was done for each of these nine sectors: agriculture and food security; health and nutrition; education; housing, infrastructural and physical planning, livelihood protection; water supply and sanitation; forest and soil conservation, information, communication, coordination and logistical capacity; and search and rescue. Cross-cutting themes were identified as environment; gender and social inclusion; staff safety and security; and climate change. A series of sector-specific consultations was conducted at national and regional levels to discuss capacity gaps and strategies to meet those gaps. The consultations involved stakeholders from various government ministries including administrative and security agencies. They also involved policy-making bodies, the donor community, UN agencies, non-government actors, civil society, academic and research institutions, experts, and local government authorities directly involved in disaster management planning and implementation. 51 2. Nepal Strengthening Capacities for Disaster Risk Reduction A Primer A steering committee led by the Ministry of Home Affairs and comprised of senior government officials at joint secretary level from various ministries including the National Planning Commission of Nepal and national disaster management experts, provided necessary guidance, oversight and co-ordination to the strategy formulation process. A sectoral task force led by thematic experts consisting of the lead UN agency, an academic institution and the relevant government partner agency worked on an analysis of gaps and drafting strategies for each sector.

Due to the wide participation of stakeholders and key partners in the process from beginning to the end, the National Strategy for Disaster Reduction and Management (NSDRM) is a widely accepted document. The document is extensively used by the government, UN agencies, multilateral and bilateral donors and development partners as the reference for developing short and long-term implementation plans for DRR in Nepal. Capacity Development Matrix Institutions that developed capacity: Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA), and the members of the Steering Committee Capacity developed for: MoHA developed capacity to co-ordinate with the line ministries, including the National Planning Commission of Nepal, and to build consensus around the drafting of a new policy to shift the focus from post disaster response to pre-disaster mitigation and prevention measures. The members of the steering committee representing various government ministries were sensitized to risk reduction approaches and theirs linkages to development processes. Results of the CD: The government developed a long-term national disaster risk management strategy in 2008, which was approved by the Government of Nepal in October 2009.

The consortium, comprised of the ADB, IFRC, UNDP, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), UNISDR, and World Bank, was formed to support the Government of Nepal in developing a long-term DRR action plan building on the NSDRM. The overall role of UNDP is to facilitate coordination among the consortium partners and provide support to the government for steering of flagship programmes identified by the consortium. In addition, the consortium initiated a multi-stakeholder participatory process with the Government of Nepal and civil society organizations to identify DRR priorities that are both urgent and viable within the current institutional and policy arrangements in the country. Based on the priorities determined by multi-stakeholder groups, five flagship areas of immediate intervention for DRM in Nepal were identified, which include: a) school and hospital safety i.e. 52 2. Nepal structural and non-structural aspects of making schools and hospitals earthquake-resilient, b) emergency preparedness and response capacity, c) flood management in the Koshi river basin, d) integrated community-based DRR/DRM and e) policy/institutional support for DRM. In developing the programme concepts, the flagship areas have also taken into account the priorities outlined in the \u2018Hyogo Framework of Action 2005-2015: Building the resilience of nations and communities to disasters\u2019, and the Chair\u2019s summary of outcomes of the 2nd session of the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction, which sets out specific targets for reducing losses from disasters. The estimated total budget of the proposed programme is USD 131.32 million. The MoHA has formed a National Steering Committee for the consortium under the leadership of the Secretary of MoHA, represented by consortium partners and lead government ministries. The main role of the steering committee is to co-ordinate with the partners on implementation of flagship activities and resource mobilisation. UNDP is supporting the MoHA in establishing a secretariat for the Consortium which will work under the guidance of the steering committee.

Measures of CD results: The approach paper and sector plan documents of the government were published in 2010. d) DRR advocacy tools developed Development partnersv working on disaster issues in Nepal combined their resources and expertise to produce a DRR Tool Kit in 2010 as a joint policy advocacy tool. The DRR Tool Kit is a professionally designed information pack on DRR, specially designed to inform the Constituent Assembly (CA) members about DRR, sensitize policy makers to disaster issues, and solicit their informed involvement and leadership to strengthen the DRR framework in Nepal. The tool kit comprises an overview of the disaster situation in Nepal, a 2009 paper on the need for a revision of Nepal\u2019s disaster management legislation, a proposed Disaster Management Act, the NSDRM, the Hyogo Framework for Action, information on mainstreaming DRR into development, a \u201cpeople\u2019s declaration\u201d on DRR, a disaster fact sheet, a disaster map of Nepal and a proposed flood early warning strategy. The tool kit advocates strengthening DRR and preparedness through the necessary policy and institutional reforms, and focuses on strengthening the DRR framework through an inclusive approach addressing special needs of vulnerable people. The joint efforts to sensitize CA members resulted in the formation of an informal committee within the parliament called \u201cParliamentary Action on Environment, Climate and Disaster (PACED)\u201d comprised of 40 active CA members. The objective of this group is to ensure that DRM, climate change and environment concerns are sufficiently addressed in the drafting of the new national constitution as well as to urge the bureaucracy to address the immediate challenges of DRR. As a result of advocacy by PACED with the support of development partners, each of the eight parliamentary sub-committees have prepared separate thematic papers raising DRR and climate change for further discussion in the parliament. 54 2.

UNDP also supported 11 such districts. A multi-level partnership approach was adopted for disaster preparedness planning, through: a) selection of vulnerable districts, b) sharing of resources among the partners to cover 67 districts and c) an agreement on a uniform format and step-by-step process to be followed for plan preparation. The actual planning process in the district started under the leadership of the District Disaster Relief Committee (DDRC) and thoroughly engaged DDRC members including district line agencies, security personnel, international and local NGOs, academic institutions, civil society, the business community and political leaders in wider consultations. As a result, each district developed a flood preparedness calendar; resource maps; response capacities of the stakeholders; a geographical division of responsibilities; mapping of vulnerable areas and potential shelter locations; assessment of stocks of basic supplies of food, medicine and shelter kits; transport and communication facilities; contact lists of stakeholders; and response plans for the following established clusters: Food, Health and Nutrition, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), Education, Logistics, non-food items (NFIs) and Shelter, Protection, Search and Rescue, Information and Coordination, and Agriculture and Livestock.. The key objective was to help DDRC prepare a plan of action for effective response so as to minimize disaster impacts. The DDRC would be able to adopt the same process for preparedness planning in the following year. The DDRCs are very effective in coordinating and responding to ongoing emergencies in the districts such monsoon flooding and diarrhoea outbreaks. Due to the proactive preparedness planning process conducted just before the start of the monsoon, the local authorities were able to handle the emergency on their own. 55 2. Nepal Strengthening Capacities for Disaster Risk Reduction A Primer Capacity development matrix Institutions that developed capacity: MoHA, DDRC and a consortium of partners working on DRR issues in Nepal Capacity developed for: MoHA developed capacity to lead the collaborative efforts of the non-government actors active in disaster preparedness and response at the national, regional and local levels; DDRC developed capacity for disaster preparedness planning and mobilizing locally available resources for making effective response. Results of the CD: District authorities developed capacity for creating synergistic partnerships with district-level agencies and non-government actors for effective disaster preparedness and response. This capacity will remain with the DDRC as they will replicate the process in coming years. Measures of CD results: 67 out of 75 districts in Nepal developed district disaster preparedness and response plans for 2010. The DDRC will be able to develop and update such plans in future with minimal external support. Emergency Situation Reports of UNOCHA rated the 2010 local-level responses as much more effective than in the past, and the need for central-level resources and responses to recurrent disasters from reduced considerably. f) Engaging non-state actors in DRR planning and implementation: Non-government institutions have several advantages over government-led institutions in managing disasters with regard to their outreach capacity, ability to mobilize resources and flexibility to operate under difficult circumstances. UNDP has been engaging in CD of the Disaster Preparedness Network of Nepal (DP-Net)vii , a non-government organisation established in 1996 as a loose network of institutions and individuals working in DRR that was registered as an NGO in 2007. The main aim of DP-NET is to coordinate the government and non-government organisations working on disaster management issues in Nepal and to develop their capacities for disaster preparedness and response. DP-Net has been supporting its network organizations to enhance their outreach at district and community levels, and develop capacity to support the district authorities and community groups for effective responses to disasters. Currently, DP-Net has 69 member organizations representing government ministries, international and local NGOs, professional organizations, academia and community organizations working in the field of DRR. DP-Net has been acting as a resource and information centre for DRR in Nepal. It has conducted several disaster-related training activities for its member organisations in the areas of disaster research, database management, contingency planning, awareness and mitigation, vulnerability and risk assessment, preparing hazard profiles, developing training materials and conducting training of trainers.

DP-NET is recognized as the initiator of district-level disaster preparedness planning every year. g) Engaging community disaster management groups UNDP has been implementing disaster preparedness and community mitigation activities with the support of various partners as technical service providers, facilitators or supervisors of community work. These institutions include local development authorities, district chapters of the Nepal Red Cross Society, ActionAid Nepal and government line agencies such as the department of soil conservation and water-induced disaster prevention. The benefits of working through these institutions on community-based disaster management are manifold. At the district level, the DDRC co-ordinates all community-based activities to optimise resources and ensure synergy based on the comparative advantages of each institution working at the community level. For example, in current UNDP community-based activities implemented in three districts, the NGO Practical Action was involved in supporting establishment of a community-based EWS, while ActionAid was involved in community mobilization and capacity development of the community- based disaster management group and the local government was involved in monitoring of mitigation work. 57 2. Nepal Strengthening Capacities for Disaster Risk Reduction A Primer Local communities in the selected districts are organized into disaster management groups and trained in vulnerability assessment, contingency planning, EWS, and community mitigation work. Each community group, after receiving basic skills training, selects an area in the village that is prone to flood and landslides, and makes plans for a mitigation structure using locally available materials. The communities also learn skills to replicate the mitigation structure in other sites identified during the hazard and vulnerability mapping exercise. In 2010 alone, at least 15 such community mitigation structures were built including spurs and 9embankments, retrofitting of school and community buildings, bio-dikes and culverts, raising the ground level of community buildings, and drilling tube wells for drinking water. These structures were primarily designed to mitigate the direct impact of floods and landslides, reduce earthquake vulnerability and provide shelters to the flood victims. The supporting organizations provided necessary skills training to the community groups, and helped in the design of civil structures and supervision of construction work, while the local community were engaged in resource mobilisation and physical construction. The site selection was based on hazard and vulnerability mapping done by the community, the available district profiles, and the priorities outlined in the district disaster management plans. Since the local communities were involved in design and construction of mitigation structures and local materials were used as far as possible, the work quality was good and per unit costs relatively low, with the advantage that the community remains committed to future maintenance and replication.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e5919eae-14c9-46eb-818a-d7b77edceccd": {"__data__": {"id_": "e5919eae-14c9-46eb-818a-d7b77edceccd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-capacities-disaster-risk-reduction-primer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strengthening Capacities for Disaster Risk Reduction - A Primer", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-capacities-disaster-risk-reduction-primer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2bb52a73e6933031301f3b59f822a04d60145e86d1247a4d3276339d2bcb007c"}, "2": {"node_id": "a2bbd849-b992-433f-9438-26a0fcf893bb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-capacities-disaster-risk-reduction-primer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "33e8eb08f45d55f70a34e5685eac66f302ab5d880044fedea17e2e3154104275"}}, "hash": "34909fa205e971a20140a2f0ba1ee2bfec42af2dfd03f0771cd4770b783b05f3", "text": "Various training events relating to disaster preparedness, vulnerability assessment, contingency planning and EWS conducted at the community level, combined with community mitigation work, have shown higher impacts on reducing the risks.

Vietnam 3. Vietnam From a partnership mechanism to a National Platform for DRM and Climate Change Situation Natural disasters such as typhoons, storms, floods, droughts, mudslides, forest fires and salt-water intrusion present recurring risks to the people of Vietnam, especially for children, women, and the elderly. More than one million people require emergency relief each year. As a result of regular flooding, particularly in the central region, Vietnam has experienced great losses in productivity for food staples and thwarting efforts to cut rural poverty (One Plan, 2006-2010). The country will also bear disproportionately severe impacts of climate change compared to its relatively small contribution to global carbon emissions. This further emphasizes the need to tackle natural disasters and climate change through effective planning, preparedness and public investment (One Plan, 2006-2010). This situation in Vietnam began to change in 2001 when the preparatory phase of the partnership mechanism for DRM was launched. The mechanism was developed after the historic flood of 1999 and has been growing in different forms over the last ten years, from a Partnership for DRM to a National Platform for DRM and CC. Capacity assessment There were several rounds of capacity assessment conducted through UNDP-supported projects over the last ten years, to shaping appropriate mechanisms. Beginning in 1999, after historic floods in the central provinces, a multi-donor mission to assess the impacts of the floods and local government capacity in DRM was initiated. The assessment paved the way for a partnership at national and provincial levels. The first phase of the Natural Disaster Mitigation Partnership (NDM-P) commenced in 2001 with the participation of 20 core members from the central government, donors, INGOs, and provinces. The objectives of the partnership during that time were rather ambitious, including: (i) policy development (ii) project financing mechanisms for DRR at provincial levels and (iii) coordination and information sharing. Due to limited CD strategies, the NDM-P\u2019s main successes were in information sharing, initiating coordination practices and piloting project formulation models linking DRR with local participatory planning process and sustainable livelihood development. The second round of capacity assessment was conducted in 2004. It focused on assessing the capacity of the secretariat, drawing lessons, and consulting on the future of NDM-P with multiple donors and actors. The next phase of the NDM-P was initiated based on the recommendations of stakeholders, which emphasized (i) coordination, information sharing and an information management system on DRM, (ii) policy and institutional capacity development for DRM, and (iii) knowledge building. 59 3.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ca94c4bf-de40-4197-8d9b-03662e8c2dd8": {"__data__": {"id_": "ca94c4bf-de40-4197-8d9b-03662e8c2dd8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-capacities-disaster-risk-reduction-primer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strengthening Capacities for Disaster Risk Reduction - A Primer", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-capacities-disaster-risk-reduction-primer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "105d33040b87a981c1bafc1456963761b7bca00fa07a8a0b287b412342882401"}, "2": {"node_id": "5795018b-7364-405d-8f74-e1ed474a61c2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-capacities-disaster-risk-reduction-primer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3f31128110a95b2ab3c1569359d3c51bfc78d16f0da17d5e26e291fbc55b93ef"}}, "hash": "550a09efa6ce58f564640d217deab5926d852ecfb26227a8e764f8db307a9597", "text": "59 3.

From the period 2008-2009, the government had taken the ownership of the mechanism and started to enhance the partnership mechanism. NDM-P has taken the relevant direction, although it still experiences constraints in its financial mechanism. At the end of 2009, a further review and consultation was undertaken by the government to formulate and elevate the NDM-P as a national platform, in line with the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA). In early 2010, the final design, functions and mandates of the National Platform for DRM and Climate Change were developed based on experiences and lessons. Results As a result of these processes that have taken place in Vietnam with direct UNDP support, the following achievements in DRM were made during the last decade: \u2022\ufffd Measures to mitigate the impacts of natural disasters are gradually improving and have been strongly supported by the UN, ranging from national and local capacity building, small-scale infrastructure improvements to improved EWS and disaster preparedness. \u2022\ufffd Improved data and communications have supported situations such as the large- scale and timely evacuation of people from areas seriously threatened by typhoons and storm surges. \u2022\ufffd Vietnam is held up as an excellent example in containing the avian influenza epidemic due to its coordinated response and partnership with the UN and donors. \u2022\ufffd The government developed the National Strategy for Disaster Mitigation and Management 2000- 2020 from which the National Disaster Management Partnership was launched in 2001. The partnership supported the development of a master plan for disaster management and mitigation in central Vietnam, with direct UN support. CD Response Following these developments and the need to support NDM-P and later the National Platform, UNDP has put further emphasis on capacity gaps, both functional and technical. UNDP has employed the following CD response strategies: \u2022\ufffd Build national multi-stakeholder mechanism for coordination, policy development and information sharing in DRR \u2022\ufffd Build capacities on policy knowledge, consultation and negotiation skills, advocacy and communication, human resources and adequate roles and responsibility following the business development plan for the mechanism/platform. 60 4. Bangladesh 4. Bangladesh Reorienting mindsets \u2013 A CD response strategy to enhance capacities for DRR in Bangladesh DRR Results Bangladesh is extremely vulnerable to natural hazards. Around 57 million people, consisting of about a third of its population, live in chronic poverty. This, combined with the country\u2019s geographical location, its topography and dense population, means that natural hazard events often result in disasters with a high loss of life and economic damage. Historically, deaths from single events, such as cyclones, reached into the hundreds of thousands in Bangladesh. But this trend is reversing with data suggesting that preparation for and responses to disasters are improving over time. There have been massive reductions in the number of lives lost. Cyclone Sidr in 2007, for example, bears ample testimony to this improvement. Cyclone Sidr was the most powerful cyclone to impact Bangladesh since 1991, when a reported 140,000 people perished. The death toll from Cyclone Sidr was of less magnitude, where approximately 3,406 people were killed and 1,000 were reported missing (CDMP II). This significant achievement is attributable to the enhanced capacity of the Bangladesh government in managing and reducing disaster risks and improved response and recovery management over the past few years. This improved government capacity is demonstrated by the performance of its host ministry and division (the MoFDM and DMRD respectively) as well as more broadly across ministries. As a consequence of this improved performance and functioning of institutions, Bangladesh has established a national disaster management legislative framework. This further led to important milestones in DRR in the country such as review and redrafting of the Disaster Management Act, National Disaster Management Policy, National Plan for Disaster Management 2007-2015, Standing Orders on Disasters and introduction of a revised Allocation of Business for the Disaster Management and Relief Division, MoFDM to include risk reduction functions. CD Response The improved functioning of institutions such as the MoFDM and its three operational departments, namely the DMB, DRR and Directorate General of Food (DGoF), was facilitated by a deliberate reorientation of mindsets of both the organization and the individual officials and staff working on DRM, specifically shifting paradigms from a reactive relief and response approach towards a proactive risk management culture. The following have been undertaken to improve organizational and individual capacities for management and coordination: \u2022\ufffd Developed the MoFDM 5-year corporate plan; DMB, DRR and DGoF 3-year strategic plans \u2022\ufffd Developed a training plan for MoFDM 61 4.

This assessment served as the baseline in measuring enhancement of capacity for DRR in later stages. 62 5. Pacific 5. Pacific SOPAC as a regional platform for DRM in the Pacific Situation In the Pacific, the challenge of achieving sustainable development goals is dependent on a number of factors including effectively addressing the underlying risks to national development and reducing the social, economic and environmental costs of disasters. In this context, the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders endorsed the regional DRM framework, entitled the Pacific Disaster Risk Reduction and Disaster Management Framework for Action 2005-2015: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters, and included its implementation as a regional priority requiring immediate attention under their Pacific Plan. The Regional DRM Framework and the Pacific Plan received endorsement at their meeting of October 2005 in Madang, Papua New Guinea. The vulnerability of Pacific Island Countries (PIC) varies according to the range and type of natural hazards and the degree of exposure. A common feature is that mechanisms to reduce risks in almost all Pacific countries are still very weak. Despite the fact that much has been done to support and strengthen DRR and disaster management planning, a number of problems still exist. These include, amongst others: poor institutional arrangements for mainstreaming DRM into economic planning; limited (and in many instances inadequate) capacity for hazard analysis and vulnerability mapping; outdated national disaster management plans and supporting legislation; limited focus on prevention and mitigation planning; limited sphere of influence and resources at NDMOs; uncoordinated response and recovery arrangements; lack of political support, and lack of engagement and commitment to national disaster management committees. Compounding these specific challenges are the generic yet highly significant challenges facing the region such as the tyranny of distance and the lack of institutional and technical capacity and resources, including financial resources. SOPAC is the Pacific regional intergovernmental organization tasked by Pacific leaders in 1995 to lead and coordinate implementation of DRM actions and priorities. SOPAC has 21 member countries and territories, and delivers services across three key technical programme areas of Ocean and Islands, Community Lifelines and Community Risk. Although the Community Risk Programme activities have largely focused on building the capabilities of NDMOs in member countries, under the SOPAC Strategic Plan 2005-2009 the focus of the Community Risk Programme has been oriented toward assisting governments to mainstream DRM into national development planning processes, including both risk reduction and disaster management dimensions. Technical assistance support will be provided by other partners. UNDP is a key partner of the SOPAC in this endeavor. For example, the UNDP Pacific Centre based in Fiji has already recruited staff to support NAP development and implementation. CD response The regional programme of support was developed through consultations and assessments of key priority needs and the underlying root causes of increased risk at the regional and national levels. 63 5. Pacific Strengthening Capacities for Disaster Risk Reduction A Primer The assessment was carried out through consultations with key stakeholders at national level and across regional and international organizations active in the field of DRM in the Pacific. To ensure effective and efficient functioning of the SOPAC, the UNDP Pacific Center provided support through the regional initiative with the overall objective of enhancing the capacity of the SOPAC, as the regional organization responsible for DRM in the Pacific Region, to support countries in mainstreaming DRM into planning and budgetary processes. The technical support was intended to develop SOPAC\u2019s capacity at organizational level to undertake regional DRM mainstreaming, and particularly to design and implement mainstreaming across", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fdbb42e4-d201-4945-8696-553598841e11": {"__data__": {"id_": "fdbb42e4-d201-4945-8696-553598841e11", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-capacities-disaster-risk-reduction-primer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strengthening Capacities for Disaster Risk Reduction - A Primer", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-capacities-disaster-risk-reduction-primer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "94724bd1743f72dfe89734f15c185d5f0dda6be3786a5c0f35b286cc8ab71215"}}, "hash": "94724bd1743f72dfe89734f15c185d5f0dda6be3786a5c0f35b286cc8ab71215", "text": "all Pacific Island Countries. Specific CD response strategies were employed to facilitate the above processes. They include the following: \u2022\ufffd Working as part of team with SOPAC and other regional partners to jointly provide support to countries on mainstreaming DRM \u2022\ufffd Development of guides and knowledge products Results As a direct effect of a strong and capable regional mechanism i.e. SOPAC, the following intermediate and medium to long-term results have been achieved thus far: At output level: \u2022\ufffd DRM National Action Plans (NAP) with UNDP assistance were developed in Vanuatu, the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) and the Cook Islands \u2022\ufffd A DRM National Action Plan guide was developed through substantive support provided by UNDP \u2022\ufffd A sector-level plan was developed and endorsed by Fiji Government for DRM in agriculture At outcome level: \u2022\ufffd Influencing a strategic approach to mainstreaming DRM in the region: UNDP has helped to shape a strategic approach to mainstreaming DRM by applying good practices from the international level to the Pacific region, through its support to SOPAC \u2022\ufffd Wider application of DRM mainstreaming methodology: Guidance developed on mainstreaming DRM is now being used as the basis for formulating DRM plans at the sector level, for example, in the agriculture sector in Fiji and the education sector in PNG \u2022\ufffd Increasing emphasis on risk reduction: at national level, emphasis for DRM work is shifting away from just focusing on response and preparedness\u2013the domain of NDMOs\u2013and moving towards risk reduction \u2022\ufffd Gender and vulnerable communities: from a recent review of the DRM mainstreaming programme facilitated by UNDP and UNISDR, a major finding has been the need to better incorporate the needs and participation of vulnerable communities in the DRM mainstreaming/planning process. \u2022\ufffd Climate change adaptation: the mainstreaming programme is now being used as a platform for countries to integrate climate change adaptation in to the DRM planning and policy process. To illustrate this, the governments of Cook Islands and RMI have recently submitted formal requests to UNDP and SOPAC for assistance with the development of integrated national policies and plans for DRR-CCA. 64 6. Indonesia 6. Indonesia Strengthening capacity of the enabling environment Situation Indonesia is populated with over 200 million people living across a widespread archipelago. Many are vulnerable to natural and man-made disasters. Natural disasters are common and frequent phenomena in Indonesia causing loss of lives and livelihoods, destruction to property and environmental damage. The country is vulnerable to a high level of seismic activity due to its location at the intersection of three seismic plates, with much of this activity just offshore, bringing added risks of tsunamis. As a nation, Indonesia has more earthquakes per year than any other country on earth. A part of the \u201cRing of Fire\u201d, Indonesia has more than 500 volcanoes, 128 of which are considered to be active. Many parts of the country are susceptible to drought caused by a strong correlation with the El Nino/La Nina (ENSO) phenomenon resulting in crop failure and uncontrolled bush fires exacerbating the forest fires from the extensive forest logging. Added to this is the fact that there are over 5,000 rivers, 30% of which pass through high density population centers and regularly cause floods\u2013the most commonly recurring natural hazard in Indonesia (SCDRR in Development Project Document). The 26 December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and earthquake, with its unprecedented impact on Indonesia followed by a series of well publicized disasters since then, has created both national and international determination to make the changes needed to save lives, protect livelihoods and property, and reduce developmental setbacks. As a result, new initiatives by the government of Indonesia to reform and strengthen its disaster management system have come as part of its overall reform programme. It has committed to accelerate the disaster management legal reform process in the country, being urged by CSOs and supported to do so by UNDP. This reform has changed the way the business of disaster management is done, from ad hoc arrangements to structural configurations with permanent personnel and a dedicated budget to undertake disaster management functions, from prevention and mitigation preparedness to emergency response and recovery stages. CD response Owing to the dearth of institutional experience and knowledge of disaster management, the government of Indonesia badly needed the technical support and capacity to initiate the process of policy formulation. Through the Aceh Recovery Project, UNDP Indonesia provided the necessary support and technical assistance. It has initiated a number of CD responses to develop both technical and functional capacities of the government, such as: \u2022\ufffd Capacity to formulate policy i.e. drafting of the law and preparation of the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "02f53712-5a9f-40f4-9ddd-936d0f74f390": {"__data__": {"id_": "02f53712-5a9f-40f4-9ddd-936d0f74f390", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-capacities-disaster-risk-reduction-primer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strengthening Capacities for Disaster Risk Reduction - A Primer", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-capacities-disaster-risk-reduction-primer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4b29e3cc5ba72264df2ddb511c631f9dd6996bd0a50471a20147119c974ef5d8"}}, "hash": "4b29e3cc5ba72264df2ddb511c631f9dd6996bd0a50471a20147119c974ef5d8", "text": "legal document \u2022\ufffd Capacity to facilitate consultations and advocacy with the members of legislature \u2022\ufffd Capacity to engage wider stakeholders in dialogue and consultation on the policy document \u2022\ufffd Capacity to engage international stakeholders and partners 65 6. Indonesia Strengthening Capacities for Disaster Risk Reduction A Primer \u2022\ufffd Capacity to exert external pressure; advocacy by civil society and non-government organizations on the legislature to consider the DM policy document in the parliament Results As a consequence of the enhanced capacity of the government, there is a substantial paradigm shift in disaster management in Indonesia, from a focus on emergency response and relief, to prioritizing prevention, mitigation and preparedness. The enactment of the Disaster Management Law (Law No.24/2007) paved the way for integration of DRR into policies and development initiatives. From the law emerged ancillary regulations to support its full implementation. The government of Indonesia has decreed DRR as one of nine national development priorities in 2007, indicating its commitment to adopt DRR as development approach. Lessons learned The engagement of multiple stakeholders in developing the policy document was important in generating adequate political backing to enact the Disaster Management Law in Indonesia. It should come with strong political commitment from the government. The role of CSOs in advocacy and coordination with members of the legislature was another essential factor. 66 7. India 7. India Substantial drop in loss of lives to disasters: A dividend of increased capacities for DRR in India Situation The Indian sub-continent is highly prone to natural disasters. Frequent disasters lead to the erosion of development gains and restricted options for disaster victims. Major disasters have illustrated the need for multi-hazard prevention, response and recovery plans in order to minimize threat to human life and property. A response-oriented approach to disasters has long been the practice of the Government. Capacity development is too focused on the government level, relegating communities\u2019 capacities on the sidelines. Analysis of past disasters and consultations with Government in the recent past have pointed out that this approach is not really helping communities in quickly responding to natural hazards of severe intensity. In the 1990s, UNDP support to post-disaster events in India showed that there is a need to engage communities and empower them to deal with risk management. However, soon after, it was felt that stand-alone projects focusing on communities would not be sustainable. Review of the community- based preparedness initiatives of NGOs and the Red Cross in various parts of the country revealed that the capacities created are not sustainable in the absence of any formal structure to provide continuous impetus. This has gradually changed when UNDP piloted a project that aimed both at strengthening communities\u2019 capacity for DRM and establishing DRM institutional structures and systems to ensure sustainability. Response UNDP initiated a pilot project to strengthen the DRM capacities of communities in selected blocks in Orissa. This pilot project was anchored by the district administration. This project was evaluated and based on the lessons learned and studies to upscale the project. A larger DRM programme was formulated, based at the Ministry of Home Affairs. UNDP India provided country office support to the ministry for the implementation of the programme. The programme started with a modest investment of US$ 2 million by UNDP, subsequently expanding within a US$ 41 million multi-donor framework. UNDP\u2019s support to government under the DRM programme was to strengthen community, local governments and district administration responses, preparedness and mitigation measures in 176 districts most prone to multi-hazards. The programme has created an enabling environment to undertake DRM activities in the rest of the country and has already been recommended for scaling up in the latest (2007-2012) Five-Year Plan document of the government of India. Specifically, the programme embarked on a number of CD response including: \u2022\ufffd National capacity enhancement to institutionalize the system for natural disaster risk management 67 7.

Results As a result of the CD responses, the following were achieved as direct project outcomes: An administrative and institutional framework for DRM was created in the Ministry of Home Affairs by establishing a management board and steering committee to oversee DRM activities in the states. The ministry also established a technical committee to develop project proposals addressing various DRR concerns as well as to develop institutional, legal, techno-legal, communication and policy guidelines. \u2022\ufffd An Integrated Operations Centre with a scientific warning dissemination system was established at the Ministry of Home Affairs to provide adequate and timely support to the implementing agencies. \u2022\ufffd Local communities in 176 hazard-prone districts are aware and informed about DRM and mitigation. \u2022\ufffd 176 hazard-prone districts have multi-hazard DRM response and mitigation plans based on vulnerability and risk assessment of women and children in natural disasters. \u2022\ufffd There has been increased participation of elected women representatives of local governments in 176 districts in the process of disaster preparedness and risk management. \u2022\ufffd There is enhanced capacity among government staff of the nodal agency at state level and in all selected districts to develop and update the risk management and response plans for different hazards in the future. \u2022\ufffd Women have better knowledge of First Aid, shelter management, water and sanitation and rescue evacuation. \u2022\ufffd There are well-equipped emergency operation centres in selected states and districts. \u2022\ufffd Manual, training module and awareness strategies are available for replication in other areas. \u2022\ufffd Skilled masons and engineers have learned to build hazard-resistant housing. \u2022\ufffd Models for dissemination of best practices in disaster -resistant construction are available. \u2022\ufffd A platforms for knowledge and information sharing about available resources has been established i.e. the India Disaster Resource Network Beyond project results, the CD responses also reaped higher DRR outcomes as evidenced by evaluation and \u2018lessons learned\u2019 studies. The external evaluation undertaken in 2008 by the Asian Disaster Preparedness Centre (ADPC) noted that in the targeted districts, the loss of life has been reduced substantially due to the capacities built through the programme. It has also been documented that during the tsunami, one of the coastal villages in Tamil Nadu was able to save about 100 people mainly because of the preparedness capacities established through the same programme.

Our special gratitude is owed to the former UN Special Envoy for Tsunami Recovery, President William Jeffer- son Clinton, for his inspiring leadership and support throughout the undertaking of the study. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Although the partners and supporters of this project are too numerous to name, particular recognition goes to the Hon. Minister I Periaswamy, the Government of Tamil Nadu, India; the senior management team of BRR, Government of Indonesia; Hon. Minister Abdulla Shahid, the Government of Maldives; Hon. Minister Abdul Bathiyutheen, the Government of Sri Lanka; and Hon. Minister Chavarat Charnvirakul, the Government of Thailand. Their inspiring support and unstinted cooperation have been instrumental in the preparation of this report. A particular word of thanks goes to the IFRC, an ardent supporter of the TGLL Project from its inception, and an invaluable contributor to the depth and breadth of this report. Thanks are due in great measure to the many national and international non-governmental organizations, as well as bilateral and multi-lateral institutions that have contributed to the report and shared their experiences in or- der to make this a well-informed document of lessons learned from tsunami recovery. Last but not the least, we thank all the members of the international community who are too numerous to men- tion here. We would especially like to express our gratitude to the donor community without which the hopes and dreams of millions of tsunami affected people to begin their lives afresh would be left unrealized. The United Nations has played a major role in bringing together the knowledge, expertise and experience of a wide range of recovery actors. The UN Office of the Recovery Coordinator for Aceh and Nias (UNORC) played a stellar role as a constant and valued support mechanism of the TGLL Project by collaborating closely with numerous partners in government, bilateral and multilateral agencies, civil society actors and the IFRC to coordinate the inputs and reflections of the international and national community into mandated TGLL deliver- ables. This report was developed under the leadership of Dr. Kuntoro Mangkusubroto, Chair, TGLL Steering Committee and Director of BRR, the ministerial entity that oversaw Indonesia's response to the tsunami. In doing so, he had the unqualified support of the governments of the five most tsunami-affected countries, the United Nations and the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). Coordination and formulation of this study was critically facilitated, with our appreciation, by the UNDP Regional Centre, Bangkok. 3 FOREWORD T he 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was an unprecedented event of global proportions: from India to Indonesia, Yemen to Somalia, the magnitude and scope of the destruction ranks it as one of the greatest natural disasters in recent history. The subsequent outpouring of concern from across the world in support of relief and reconstruction efforts within the affected communities was equally extraordinary. The nations most affected by the tsunami \u2013 India, Indonesia, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand \u2013 each adopted their own approaches to managing the specific circumstances that confronted them. Innovative solutions were identified to unique (but often common) challenges; solutions that deserve to be highlighted and known. The same is true for the mistakes: the complexity and scale of the task necessarily meant that not all efforts worked as planned. As one of the biggest recovery and reconstruction efforts to date, the knowledge amassed by communities and recovery actors alike is both impressive and rich. But while there is no dearth of learnings from the post-tsunami recovery operations, these have not always been shared\u2013 the urgency of rebuilding and reconstructing having taken precedence.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9b2370e3-5067-424a-bbe3-8fd16b94c9b0": {"__data__": {"id_": "9b2370e3-5067-424a-bbe3-8fd16b94c9b0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Tsunami Legacy: Innovation Breakthroughs and Change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "14a0da1098b604728776a7bc50057b42105a88b8368e46d23a53681f4d4a1277"}, "2": {"node_id": "422db8b7-f93a-4b88-8a30-d283cbee0136", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a4539b6e4e0b5c0983be2e256bc1254f4b5e37000def9696883fa906ce3c017b"}}, "hash": "027fbacc3b1a6a1b7674a343f16e371b1c9388b05d5c2751abb0ea906dd1fb52", "text": "Now, more than four years after the tsunami, as many organizations wrap up their recovery operations or begin to make the transition to more long-term projects, a unique opportunity presents itself for recovery partners to engage in cross-border learning: to take stock of the lessons learned and to share best practices.

This report is therefore an attempt to offer the global community an overview and some broad insights into how a huge cast of governments, organisations and people responded to one of the world\u2019s great natural disasters. In so doing, it identifies some of the main elements involved: challenges, successes and lessons. It also is an attempt, not only to acknowledge the tremendous work of so many people who contributed to the recovery, but to thank the world for its enormous contributions to the devastated communities across the Indian Ocean rim. What better way to thank those who dedicated their time and effort to helping affected countries and communities build back better, than ensuring that the world learns from our journey, avoids our pitfalls, and build on our success. Introducing the report, the TGLL Steering Committee hopes that disaster mitigation and response continue to be recognised by the international community as priority areas for ongoing policy attention. Since disasters tend to happen without warning, and frequently impact areas where the response capacity is either weak or nonexistent, ensuring that global efforts to strengthen response and mitigation mechanisms reach all corners of the world remains of paramount importance. All governments have a responsibility to look after their citizens \u2013 particularly the most vulnerable, including women and children \u2013 by preparing for any natural disasters that may occur. Likewise, multilateral institutions have a responsibility to help when national capacities are overwhelmed by a disaster and where disasters occur across national borders, both of which were the case with the tsunami. Such thoughts are easily said but less easy to put into practice, particularly in the context of a global financial crisis that will divert attention to reshaping and rebuilding the world\u2019s financial architecture while simultaneously diminishing the financial resources available to fight and respond to future disasters, natural or manmade. Yet relief and reconstruction continue to be pivotal to international development and prosperity. With this in mind, the messages from this report may be more relevant than ever. 3 4 This report is general in nature, inevitably skimming the surface of events while drawing some broad abstractions from them. It could be criticised, therefore, as much for what it leaves out as for what it attempts to touch upon. Naturally, no document of this nature can seriously lay claim to recognising either the pain felt by those affected by the tsunami or the hardships and risks experienced by those who responded. Nor can it adequately capture the breadth of the team effort involved, by governments; international and national organizations; the thousands of individuals, young and old, men and women, in affected countries and elsewhere, who donated their time, energy and money. In highlighting breakthroughs by certain countries with regard to certain themes, we do not mean to downplay that other countries working on similar issues achieved significant gains as well. Many believe that those who help are praised for their efforts, when in fact the opposite is often the case. In offering to help, many organisations face complaints that they are doing too little too late, for the wrong people and in the wrong way. Such criticism is sometimes justified but frequently misplaced. As important and justifiable fair criticism may be in helping us learn how to improve post-disaster recovery, it also risks leading those in positions of accountability to wonder if their contributions are really worthwhile. Former United Nations Special Envoy for Tsunami Recovery, President Bill Clinton has noted: \u201cOur tools have yet to catch up with our aspirations, true, but the effort has been genuine and widespread\u201d. We concur. Finally, before you delve into the report, there is one more thing that it is not \u2013 that is, a \u201chow-to\u201d manual. Ultimately, any lessons drawn from this and other tsunami recovery documents must be embedded in operational practices if they are to have lasting impact. The authors hope they will be. Meanwhile, the first priority is simply to learn from the tremendous range of experiences encompassed by the many actors in tsunami recovery.

The unique situation warranted intensive strategic coordination for the recovery to be effective as well as considerable pressure to deliver tangible results. Closest to the epicentre, the Indonesian Province of Aceh faced one of the most complex situations with a massive loss of life, extensive destruction of infrastructure, and an extraordinary influx of actors. In response, a dedicated body, the Aceh-Nias Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Agency (BRR), was set up in April 2005, with a 4-year mandate to coordinate all recovery activities as well as implement a number of government projects. Elsewhere, in Sri Lanka, the tsunami was a catalyst for creation of the Ministry of National Disaster Management and Human Rights in 2006. The Government of Maldives moved swiftly to set up a similar structure. On the same day as the tsunami, it created a National Disaster Management Centre (NDMC) to coordinate activities. This development of lead governance mechanisms for relief and recovery, tasked with coordinating ministries, donors, agencies, communities, women\u2019s groups and others, and with building national and local capacities to manage the process, turned out to be a critical breakthrough in all these countries. Carefully connecting the local body to a broader, global coordinating infrastructure \u2013 as was done in Indonesia via the Global Consortium for Tsunami Recovery, the Multi Donor Fund (MDF) and the UN Office of the Recovery Coordinator for Aceh and Nias EXECUTIVE SUMMARY meaningful development and reform. The report 9 10 10 (UNORC) \u2013 was key to facilitating coordination in a complex recovery context involving countless international and national stakeholders. As new structures, void of institutional baggage, these agencies also benefited from the ability to be flexible and quickly adapt to local circumstances. In India, too, where no new body needed to be created, the government seized on the moment by devolving significant authority to local administrators, a crucial aspect to the Tamil Nadu recovery effort. A network of state- and district-level knowledge centres provided the infrastructure for disseminating vast amounts of information and reliable village-level data; it also became a focal point for NGOs on how they could contribute to recovery. The key to coordinating recovery here and elsewhere was maintaining speedy, flexible and accountable coordination systems and procedures, including at the local level. Recovery partners in Indonesia learned a similar lesson. By giving the coordination structure full authority and basing it \u2018close to the action\u2019 it was able to become more responsive to the local context. Importantly, BRR was given full authority to manage all aspects of the tsunami recovery in Aceh on behalf smoother coordination process, devoid of any potential inter-ministry politics. Significantly, BRR Headquarters was located in the capital of Aceh, and not in Jakarta. Flexibility and know-how, coupled with a culture of risk-taking, was a central aspect of BRR\u2019s success and led to several important breakthroughs and innovations. These included the Tim Terpadu (a one stop shop for processing all visa, customs, tax and other clearance requirements for thousands of aid workers and equipment) and a mandatory Project Concept Note (PCN) format for all programmes, which helped avoid unnecessary duplication and ensured efficient use of funds. Similarly, when Maldives faced a shortfall of nearly US$100 million in recovery funds, a number of innovative partnership strategies were implemented to secure additional funding. The unique \u201cAdopt-An- Island\u201d initiative implemented by UNDP, emerged as a particularly powerful marketing tool under which donor support could be matched directly to a specific project. By mid-2006, 44 percent of the US$41 million that UNDP had raised was mobilised through Adopt-An-Island. In both cases the willingness to be opportunistic and take risks with \u201cbreakthrough initiatives\u201d accelerated recovery and facilitated \u2018building back better\u2019. In the final analysis, however, lack of local capacity has remained an issue, throughout. In the Maldives, the National Disaster Management Centre (NDMC) was set up to coordinate activities in a similar vein to BRR.

Achieving Equity In Recovery While international codes and principles guide relief and recovery efforts, many tsunami affected communities were still unable to adequately access assistance immediately after the disaster because of barriers associated with their gender, ethnicity, age, class, religion or occupation. Often, tight deadlines imposed by the need to deliver fast had the effect of dropping equity issues \u2013 or of the wrong projects being taken up by the wrong organisations for the wrong reasons. Many people could not access assistance after disasters simply because of their gender, ethnicity, age, class, religion or occupation. In particular, it is women and the poorest whose needs tend to be overlooked. Yet the tsunami also provided an important opportunity to address underlying social inequities and strengthen human rights protection for vulnerable groups, a task quickly seized upon by India\u2019s strong civil society and of the central government, which allowed for a much vibrant media. Combined with a state government in 11 11 Tamil Nadu that displayed swiftness, responsiveness and openness, this made the difference in bringing all survivors back on the road toward recovery much faster. As recovery actors in all five locales quickly realised, there could be no more business-as-usual when dealing with a disaster of such unusual proportions. Responding to the initial exclusion, they were quick to catch up in innovative ways, many employing a human rights perspective to create an enabling environment for participation. In India, the State openness to working with representatives of different social groups in addressing flaws stands out as particularly praiseworthy. Authorities in Tamil Nadu did not simply respond to practical needs but offered real opportunities for change, through several key steps. Breakthroughs in India included the implementation of disaster-resistant construction and the institution of inexpensive, 10-year housing insurance against all forms of disasters. Houses were built for indirectly affected families who were also given housing assistance and rights to land ownership. Women benefited from opportunities for strategic change in their status, such as joint housing rights for spouses and funds for the education and resettlement of orphaned adolescent girls and unmarried women, amongst other initiatives. Across the waters, in Sri Lanka, strong emphasis was placed on equity and the targeting of vulnerable groups after the tsunami, especially with regard to permanent housing, road building and highlighting of issues such as human rights, participation and the environment. Along these lines, a number of successful \u2013 and flexible \u2013 interventions were initiated, with many partners coming to see the importance of addressing conflict and post-conflict issues in the post-tsunami setting as a consequence. affected in permanent housing under its Unified Assistance Scheme or had their houses upgraded. Hallmarks of the scheme included clear eligibility criteria, management at local and provincial levels, and significant community involvement. For equity gains to be sustained it was necessary to anchor innovative practices in the institutional infrastructure of the recovery \u2013 good intentions can only do so much if systems are not in place to track and identify vulnerable groups. Rather than a piecemeal approach, then, countries succeeded best when there was a commitment from high-level managers to ensure equity. In India, a series of independent equity audits were carried out in 2005 and 2006, at the request of local and international NGOs, by the Social Equity Audit Secretariat and trained auditors. The success of the audits is reflected in the fact that amongst some NGOs, the percentage of budget that went to directly support interventions for the excluded rose from 10 or 12 percent to 60 percent. Building on women\u2019s grassroots activism, recovery actors in Indonesia, among other things, sought to ensure that gender issues were considered in all development sectors through a special unit that formulated a comprehensive gender policy. UNIFEM placed a gender advisor in BRR to provide sustained input and guidance and BRR also employed gender- specific data for monitoring and evaluation, developed practical checklists for use in health, housing, education, livelihoods and institutional change, and promoted active participation of tsunami-affected women in plans for their future. Successes in India and Indonesia underscore the importance of developing institutional anti- discrimination capacity by reviewing organisational culture and offering training to staff on rights-based approaches, including awareness and understanding of gender-sensitive international codes, guidelines and principles. Depending on the context, this was not always an easy goal to achieve across the board. In Sri Lanka and Aceh, both regions affected by conflict, there was a need to also address the victims of conflict as well as those of the tsunami. However, most post-tsunami organisations largely ignored the post-conflict context, in part due to donor-stipulated restrictions", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b0c37be-ca50-425d-af93-ae5a2b1d44ad": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b0c37be-ca50-425d-af93-ae5a2b1d44ad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Tsunami Legacy: Innovation Breakthroughs and Change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7b9be587b321449831b1152ba37a9b440e4447f0bc70a3435cdb84742dfeb8ab"}, "3": {"node_id": "1731910c-b174-451b-99bc-db315e68e973", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f927f54d1125e55fc4f73f2b7267afa4d0e03cf7ed89b5ffe9566e9daf752d26"}}, "hash": "58b93000b0e587406e139be99de8095a1d206a75e7cbb9bdf6508d8c27e784ea", "text": "government\u2019s timeliness, responsiveness and For example, the government resettled the conflict- 12 on how they could use their funds. This led to numerous grievances raised by conflict-affected communities and perceptions of rising inequalities in aid provision. If conflict sensitivity had been more widespread and funds not restricted to tsunami victims only, building back better could have been more equitable all along. The provision of \u201duntied\u201d donor funds that offer flexibility to modify assistance packages to suit local needs would have enabled more flexibility to address these issues in a straightforward manner. Creating a \u2018Virtuous Loop\u2019: Embracing People\u2019s Participation While citizen participation is widely considered a cornerstone of democratic governance and efficient programming, too often those most in need after the tsunami were not seriously consulted about planning or implementation of relief and recovery. Concerted efforts were made in all countries affected by the disaster, however, to curb this initial trend. Perhaps the most valuable benefit of promoting participation was something that, in the end, is not easily quantifiable: a feeling of individual empowerment, of \u201cownership\u201d of community resources, and the unleashing of people\u2019s own capacities to cope. Efforts to overcome the lack of consultation were particularly successful in Sri Lanka, Maldives and Thailand, where recovery actors employed participation by both women and men, through extensive people\u2019s consultations, beneficiary surveys, Help Desks and community monitoring of projects. The Government of Sri Lanka empowered the national Human Rights Commission to conduct people\u2019s consultations in more than 1,100 tsunami- affected communities in 13 districts. Although it was not always easy to ensure community participation, in cases where participation was enforced, projects were more successful. As a result of the thousands of complaints received during the people\u2019s consultations, United Nations could provide support to the Human Rights Commission in establishing Help Desks in each district to raise awareness among communities on their rights and entitlements and to follow up on grievances. In the Maldivian context, community consultations had rarely occurred before to the extent instituted after the tsunami. Beneficiary surveys deepened knowledge of important qualitative dimensions of recovery, increasing accountability to affected communities, and were hailed as \u201cone of the most significant innovations of the tsunami response.\u201d Thailand, too, made it a priority to give communities a strong voice. Local authorities took the lead in many reconstruction efforts and were supported to improve community consultation, including training to strengthen women\u2019s leadership and decision making. One of the most successful such initiatives was the restoration of indigenous livelihoods in Koh Lanta, an island district of 30,000 in Krabi province. Taking into account the traditional livelihoods of the many ethnic groups on the island, the island was developed by community mobilisation, savings schemes, and cooperatives. Still, it was not always easy to ensure community participation, especially as some agencies and organisations sometimes tended to approach the issue with only limited enthusiasm. Many, it appears, tacked on consultations as a programmatic afterthought, and did not approach it as a key component of the project\u2019s success. Indeed, several NGOs have acknowledged that mistakes could have been avoided if a more participatory approach had been used earlier on. Many had to readjust along the way to respond to realities and needs on the ground. A key requirement for these organisations was to decentralise authority within the organisation to the local levels. Both CARE and World Vision, for example, put their field offices in the driver\u2019s seat, reasoning that they would be best able to deal with the needs and demands of the tsunami affected people. Some other NGOs, on the other hand, found it more difficult to implement effective participation since many key decisions were being made back in their headquarters, rather than in the field. Similarly, the success in the Maldives did not come 12 13 easy. For one, it proved difficult to engage communities in disaster risk management awareness, given that many Maldivians saw the tsunami as a \u201cone- off\u201d event that would not recur. Critically, however, the Government and recovery partners were persistent, even translating basic disaster risk management terminology into the local Dhivehi language. Countering Corruption and Ensuring Accountability From the first days of the recovery, then, steps had to be taken to ensure anti-corruption and accountability would inform all levels of operations, starting with the institutions themselves.

Complementing the process-based RAND, a \u201csurvey-based\u201d Housing Geospatial Database (HGD) was created to provide a snapshot of recovery by verifying and digitally mapping the vast housing reconstruction sector. The HGD was recently merged with a third database, covering all other assets \u2013 bridges, hospitals, schools, roads, etc. \u2013 creating a combined information system which is one of the most comprehensive and \u201cleak-proof\u201d in the recovery spectrum. As Indonesia realised, however, good systems will not deliver \u2018on their own\u2019. Accountability mechanisms need to be client oriented. After being slow to get off the ground, international and national partners, and provincial and district governments were contacted to identify what types of analytical products, as well as what information and in which format, would be useful. Then, RAND changed accordingly \u2013 absorbing a major lesson in ensuring participation. A strong complaints mechanism is equally important. Early designation of grievance focal points and an adequate budget for grievance facilitation are critical for reporting of abuses and corruption, as is empowering affected communities, including the most vulnerable, in understanding and using these mechanisms. Affected people must be empowered to articulate community claims, actively monitor and evaluate reconstruction and make their own choices. Recovery data, however complex it may be, should be shared in layperson terms to the extent possible. In Sri Lanka the establishment of an effective complaint mechanism through local Help Desks (in response to input solicited in consultations) was a particular breakthrough. The public could here question eligibility for assistance, report potential cases of corruption, or file a complaint. By October 2006, the DRMU had received 17,000 complaints and successfully resolved most. In addition, UNDP Sri Lanka set up an AidWatch initiative to enable communities to closely monitor projects. Such vital linkages contributed to increasing responsibility and accountability toward the community and laid groundwork for continued networking. Many organisations, notably BRR, responded to the threat of corruption by putting in place more With large amounts of cash and goods in motion, corruption is always a threat during a crisis. But despite the influx of billions of dollars in tsunami-affected countries, corruption levels across the board were kept remarkably low. Key to this success was a commitment to view corruption, not as a nuisance or unfortunate side effect of the recovery, but as a core threat to the reconstruction effort as a whole. In Aceh, where an unprecedented US$6.4 billion were pledged for recovery, Dr. Kuntoro Mangkusubroto, the Director of BRR, urged the recovery community to set the bar high: \u201cWe see the fight against corruption in Aceh and Nias as advancing Indonesia\u2019s wider struggle against corruption.\u201d A punitive focus on \u201cfinding corruptors\u201d would not be enough. 13 14 stringent anti-corruption policies than required by national law. To tackle graft and fraud, BRR became the first government agency to have an autonomous Anti-Corruption Unit (SAK) set up to work with other government institutions, international institutions like the World Bank, and civil society organisations such as Transparency International Indonesia in carrying out its primary objectives of prevention, investigation and education. Since its inception in September 2005, SAK has received 1,530 confidential complaints. What if it Happens Again? Innovations in Disaster Risk Management The tsunami has precipitated a critical shift in the minds of policy makers and communities alike. It is no longer tenable to view disasters as isolated events and respond without taking into account the social and economic factors that aggravate the situation. The tsunami drew attention to the importance and urgency of reducing the enabling causes of disaster. In all tsunami-affected countries, a newfound enthusiasm for securing the country and community against future disasters has engendered the creation of disaster preparedness institutions and policies, new regional and national early warning systems, and concerted efforts at promoting community-based disaster awareness and preparedness at every turn. Critically, new disaster preparedness structures have been established in four out of the five tsunami- affected countries and a regional tsunami early warning system has been operational since 2006, complementing the global commitment pledged by 168 governments to reduce multi-hazard risks and vulnerabilities under the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015. Thailand in particular has been a leader in numerous disaster risk management initiatives, and its early warning system is well-positioned to become a regional role model. Through ASEAN, the Thai government swiftly proposed a regional tsunami early warning centre that would coordinate with various nations\u2019 early warning systems to ensure complementarity.

Thailand was also quick to create a \u2018one-stop map server\u2019, combining databases that previously could not be used together into one. This clearing house of information includes high-resolution satellite images, aerial photographs and base infrastructure maps, all available at the touch of a button in an emergency. Maldives\u2019 first disaster risk profile, created after the tsunami and based on Geographic Information System mapping, represents another innovative approach to profile as a key source for development strategies to mitigate climate change and future disasters, particularly in developing a \u201cSafer Islands\u201d programme, which provides incentives for voluntary migration to safer islands. Sri Lanka, too, has come a long way in establishing comprehensive disaster management-related systems. Organised around 7 key themes, a \u201croad map\u201d has been developed, identifying over 100 investments to reduce disaster risk. Under it, numerous innovative initiatives have begun toward developing a multi- hazard approach for disaster management. In addition, the Disaster Management Act that had been under discussion for about a decade prior was passed in May 2005. Following intensive efforts by 29 governments around the Indian Ocean, a regional tsunami early warning system has been operational since 2006 as part of a coordination plan by UNESCO-Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission. However, preparedness is not just about high-tech early warning systems. Community participation in disaster risk mitigation is also a necessity. Women, in particular, are well-placed to participate in risk assessments and the promotion of disaster risk reduction, ensuring consideration of gender-specific concerns. Training of a number of community leaders, teachers, local disaster managers and media personnel has demonstrated the use of response techniques. Even before the tsunami, large community-based disaster risk management programmes existed in vulnerable areas in countries such as India \u2013 where disaster management. The government has used the 14 15 they have been credited for capacity strengthening in search and rescue, first and evacuation methods that resulted in saving countless lives during the disaster as Post-tsunami, excellent opportunities have been presented for deepening community disaster risk management across the region, setting up local and national partnerships. In Thailand, for example, the early warning system was taken to the local level, linked with loudspeakers in rural villages and with more than 100 warning towers along the coast. The tsunami, finally, brought an increased awareness on the importance of natural defence barriers. Healthy coastal ecosystems, such as mangroves, estuaries, wetlands and sandy beaches, are able to provide good protection against the force of tsunamis and storm surges and contribute to disaster risk reduction while providing diverse livelihoods, sufficient nutritious food, shelter and access to goods for communities. Several organisations and programmes, such as Mangroves for the Future, now focus on the humanitarian implications of failure to protect coastal ecosystems. But while most people are aware of the importance of resource-based industries such as ecotourism and fisheries to coastal economies, there is less comprehension of just how important these goods and raw materials are in terms of their multiplier effects nationally and locally. Will We Do Better Next Time? If another tsunami happened tomorrow, would the response from governments and the international community be stronger and better? Can we multiply our successes, learn from our shortfalls and apply this in the future for both emergency relief and longer- term recovery? You only know lessons have really been learned when you stop thinking about them and simply do them. Particularly in light of the current global financial crisis, many believe that whatever innovations we think are replicable have to be at a low-cost level. Luckily, the most important lessons we have learned are not necessarily those that depend on the availability of large amounts of funding. Effective leadership and coordination, beginning at the development organisations alike, can go a long way in ensuring an efficient and sustainable recovery. And while coordination and leadership may be more easily talked about than put into practice, they remain particularly important in a disaster context where chaos goes hand in hand with calamity. respond to the voices of those most affected \u2013 including those normally not consulted, especially solving the leadership equation. The many delivery partners who make up the reconstruction community must also develop the quality and effectiveness of their leadership. We have learned that accountability and preparedness are critical, as is a willingness to take risks and embed institutional as well as cultural reform amid disaster response. This must include serious reflection and be a continuous process through which weaknesses are overturned and strengths capitalised upon.

What stands out in this report is that governments in all five of the most tsunami- affected countries embraced change as a core ethic to confront this catastrophe. The challenge now is to constantly build on and improve these new institutional arrangements. Change must be embraced, not for its own sake, but rather because in a disaster, organisational weaknesses are severely tested and exposed. Continuous improvement is the only way to ensure all new institutional arrangements remain robust and relevant. well as minimising damages to assets and livelihoods. We have learned that governments need to listen and grassroots and involving governments and women. However, governments cannot be alone in 15 16 I t has been over four years since the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Those affected by that day of devastation still work to get past the pain, with steps both large and small. Amid an irrevocably altered physical and mental landscape, there will be an aching familiarity to the rituals marking the fifth anniversary of the catastrophe. Yet the need to remember is inextricably bound to a desire to move on \u2013 and so much has happened in these years, leaving a legacy of hope despite destruction. On 26 December 2004, when the fourth-largest earthquake in a century erupted underwater off the Indonesian province of Aceh, it struck a geologically violent region \u2013 a \u201chot zone\u201d where two of the plates that make up the Earth\u2019s surface collide. This powerful jolt, with a magnitude of 9.3, moved a 1,200-kilometre section of the sea floor, and released energy equivalent to that of 550 million Hiroshima atomic explosions. The entire planet vibrated up to 1 centimetre. Then the sea receded abruptly from land \u2013 and began to rise up in waves as high as a three-story building, accelerating to speeds of more than 600 kilometres per hour and barrelling one-fifth of the way around the Earth. Spanning continents, cultures and time zones, the deaths and destruction were, \u201cso brutal, so quick, so extensive that we are still struggling to fully comprehend it,\u201d as then-United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan said. None of the most affected countries had warning systems to detect the coming onslaught and alert people to move away from the coastline. And even if they did, national and local capacities were inadequate, given that disaster preparedness has traditionally received only a small proportion of international assistance. So from Banda Aceh to Batticaloa, Puntland to Phang Nga, and Noonu to Nagapattinam, entire coastal zones and ecosystems were destroyed, up to several kilometres inland, and thousands of villages simply washed away. The numbers are commensurate with the gargantuan force of the waves: More than 228,000 people died in 14 countries in Southeast Asia and South Asia, and as far away as Africa; most were women \u2013 in some places 3 times the number of men \u2013 the elderly and children. The dead included citizens of 40 nations, and the damage totalled nearly US$10 billion. In all, nearly 2.5 million people were affected, losing their families, their homes, and their means of making even a meagre living. All these people already were vulnerable, with many of them chronically poor, subject to wide inequalities within their own societies, displacement, environmental issues from over fishing and deforestation, human rights violations, and longstanding armed conflicts. Households headed by women particularly were pushed deeper into poverty. When the tsunami was finished, it was the most destructive disaster of its kind in history. The key to the full-scale recovery of these regions, which began in the early days of the emergency relief efforts and continues to this day in longer-term development programmes, has been the incredible efforts of the people and governments of the affected countries, supported by an extraordinary spirit of giving from individual citizens, national governments and multilateral institutions around the globe, which resulted in an estimated US$13.5 billion in aid. Donations from the general public, at an astonishing US$5.5 billion, broke many INTRODUCTION records; and an unprecedented 99 governments and two inter-governmental organisations also contributed. 16 17 The Red Cross/Red Crescent Movement and Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) also received more than $5 billion in pledges. Within one year, even nearest to the epicentre, in Aceh, hundreds of thousands of the homeless had a solid roof over their heads, even as greater quality of infrastructure naturally continued to be required. Four years on, basic services have been restored to a great extent. Children are now back in school and job opportunities have been created.

Yet building back better, as former United Nations Special Envoy for Tsunami Recovery, President Bill Clinton, framed it, has meant supporting and strengthening capacities to address not only the recovery itself but also complex poverty-related issues, including creating assets, making policies more gender-sensitive and seizing opportunities for peace building. Much progress also has been made in strengthening strategies for disaster risk reduction, including the establishment of tsunami early warning systems. Critically, relevant new disaster management policies and standards have been put in place by national legislatures and local governments. Thus, substantial investments since December 2004 are yielding positive results, even as capacities among countries in essential elements of early warning continue to be uneven. It is instinctive to search for the meaning of an event like this, once shock and grief have begun to subside. We have the ability to imagine a different future, going forward in a way that turns unthinkable challenges into extraordinary opportunities. Have we been able to achieve meaningful development and reform, employing evolving strategies and acting swiftly to address changing demands?

In the words of Secretary-General Annan, \u201cit\u2019s not enough to pick up the pieces. We must draw on every lesson we can to avoid such catastrophes in the future.\u201d To do this, we take a unique, country-based perspective, and our goal is modest: we want to share what we have learned and to look ahead in terms of what we know we still need to do. To help in illustrating our lessons from the long road to recovery, we put post-tsunami events in perspective using the words and recollections of many of those who have been central to the effort. These narratives provide the scaffolding that ultimately gives shape and meaning to the flow of experience over the years. So while this report is not a scholarly assessment, its stories, collected from a wide range of voices, show that in coming together after this tragedy people have found a way to tap into that most important of our renewable resources \u2013 human creativity. In this report, we focus on the development breakthroughs that have been instrumental in accelerating the recovery effort and building back better, even as we acknowledge some of the unforeseen consequences and missed opportunities. We have reviewed the findings of 183 reports, studies and websites, as well as interviewed 91 key stakeholders in the five countries. Our specific focus is on breakthroughs in five closely interlinked areas from which numerous useful lessons have been drawn. In all areas, special attention is paid to the role of women, who suffered disproportionately in numbers killed but who have also provided so much to tsunami relief and reconstruction and proactive disaster risk reduction. The first area is that of Leadership and Coordination, with a focus on Indonesia, where more than 168,000 people died (over half of the total) and nearly half of the total economic damage occurred. Here, a specially centralised 2005: UN Secretary General Kofi Annan speaking to tsunami victims at Kinniya central College, Sri Lanka 18 19 and multi-level coordination structure was created to lead the mammoth task at hand. The agency (BRR) and partners had to perform the delicate balancing act of navigating between high expectations and the need for a speedy recovery on the one hand, and the abiding importance of ensuring a measured and strategic approach to the recovery on the other. Appreciating the constantly changing pace of the recovery, flexibility was made the watchword of the operations here, enabling the recovery to evolve along with the rapidly changing conditions and needs. This ability to quickly identify and seize opportunities fostered many breakthrough initiatives, which were critical to accelerate recovery and build back better. All this work was informed by a strong commitment to transparency and accountability to affected people and international donors alike. Recovery with Equity spotlights India\u2019s great strides during the tsunami response to include people otherwise often left on the sidelines of development, such as women, tribal groups and people with disabilities.

In this section of the report, we explore the role that ordinary people and their initiated or led by women\u2019s groups at the grassroots level, which increased governments\u2019 openness to different needs. Crucial information sharing and culturally sensitive programming further underscored community partnerships. Looking at Indonesia again, we examine how the fight against corruption was made central to trust and integrity in the disbursement of tsunami funds, given that natural disasters often show human beings not only at their best, but also at their worst. A comprehensive, easily accessible information management system complemented competitive salaries, \u201cintegrity pacts\u201d and an in-house anti-corruption unit, leading to remarkable breakthroughs that are all reverberating throughout the country as a whole. Lastly, as in any humanitarian emergency, the experience has provided new opportunities to both test and enhance national and international capacities to reduce disaster risks and build back better in disaster-affected communities. While there have been numerous accounts of innovative practices in disaster risk management, Thailand has especially taken the lead in community-based initiatives, including public education and awareness, improved response capacities and linkages to a strengthened early warning system. Disaster risk reduction has been incorporated into development policies and programmes in Maldives as well, creating the islands\u2019 first disaster risk profile. Even with these positive examples, however, it remains to be seen whether the new emphasis on regional preparedness can be sustained in the coming years. For those in affected countries \u2013 and millions more around the world \u2013 the 26th of December 2004 remains a defining moment in their personal lives and in history. Even today, it is difficult to fully comprehend and account for the devastation and loss of life that resulted from this catastrophe. The world witnessed unprecedented generosity and multi-year assistance in response to that day of devastation. And we fervently hope that in another five years \u2013 or five generations \u2013 the only destructive tsunami the world will have to remember will be the one that rocked the globe that day in 2004. vibrant civil society helped the government of the state of Tamil Nadu embrace equity as a priority. organisations have played in Sri Lanka, Maldives and Thailand through extensive people\u2019s consultations, often 19 t the centre of the disaster in Indonesia, the setting up of a dedicated coordination mechanism, the Aceh-Nias Rehabilitation and Reconstruction more than 12,500 tsunami recovery projects from its headquarters in Aceh, the agency organisations.

An Urgent Need to Coordinate It was early March 2005, barely two months after the tsunami, and Sri Mulyani Indrawati, then the Indonesian Minister of Planning, was speaking at the Paris Conference on Aid Effectiveness. \u201cI wonder how history will judge us \u2013 a year or five years from now,\u201d she mused. \u201cWill the newspaper stories be full of how much money was wasted as donors competed against each other for together, we introduced a new way of doing business, in which we work in harmony for genuine results on the ground?\u201d She concluded: \u201cI believe it can be the latter, and that it can spread beyond Aceh to all our efforts to reduce poverty across the country.\u201d To achieve this, however, continuous coordination, both in the early emergency humanitarian phase and in the later reconstruction phase, was going to be key. The tsunami created one of the most complex coordination and logistical challenges ever, particularly in Aceh, the most heavily damaged area nearest the epicentre, where some 700 NGOs set to work. Critically, with this influx also came US$5 billion in funds to rebuild the province\u2019s destroyed area, which was 800km long and up to 6km wide. The availability of funding and manpower meant that the challenge in coordination was to ensure there was no duplication of projects and that funds were being used efficiently and equitably.

Overseeing the best projects, and the government failed to coordinate or lead the effort? Or will they record how, Indonesia, coordinating the humanitarian and emergency operations alongside the many government agencies, 21 22 Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). Naturally, given the pressurised environment, the high-profile task at hand, and the sheer size of the recovery community, coordination presented a number of challenges. Although numerous sectoral and thematic working groups were set up, coordination progressed in fits and starts and tended to address information sharing rather than strategic planning. A vicious spiral was at work here: When agency leaders were frustrated with a meeting that was not useful in terms of strategic planning, they were likely to leave these meetings in the future for more junior staff, which reinforced their orientation towards information-sharing instead of strategic planning. And as several NGOs have noted, any NGOs that took the lead in coordination did not have the authority or power to ensure compliance. Various other reasons also underlay the lack of cooperation: Hundreds of national and international organisations \u2013 some experienced, some inexperienced \u2013 were under pressure to show quick results amid relentless media attention. Vast differences existed in levels of expertise and experience among these organisations, and support for coordination was often in short supply. Unprecedented funding further limited the incentive to coordinate and led to competition among cash-rich agencies for projects and, ultimately, publicity. The pressing need for coordination continued into the reconstruction and longer-term recovery phase, when coordination in strategic planning as well as operations was crucial, among all concerned, if \u201cbuild back fast\u201d was to be transformed into \u201cbuild back better.\u201d1 Or, as President Bill Clinton, the former United Nations Special Envoy for Tsunami Recovery, put it, organisations \u201cneed to start \u2018practicing\u2019 partnering\u201d and how well they work together \u201ccan determine the quality and outcome of the recovery process.\u201d Tensions also in coordination continued into the early recovery and reconstruction phase. Different groups had different perceptions and aims, power plays were frequent, and different cultures needed to be sensitively McKerrow, head of the IFRC delegation in Indonesia notes, \u201cEffective coordination, even in decent circumstances, is difficult, while the scope of damage and communities affected by the tsunami presented an Bulletin Board of missing people in Aceh addressed. An urgent need existed for leadership that recognised these conflicting interests. However, as Bob 22 23 overwhelming context. In recent years too, with increased media and global communications, along with many humanitarian organisations being better known to the public, the pressure to deliver assistance or be seen as responding rapidly is notably higher.\u201d Coordination would also be needed to address complex gender issues that come into focus in any given emergency. \u201cWhen recovery and reconstruction programmes respond to the realities and needs of women and support their leadership and organising, many local and effective solutions can be scaled up and women\u2019s voices and networks empowered to build the policies and institutions necessary for a more just and sustainable future,\u201d observed Noeleen Heyzer, former Executive Director of the UN Fund for Women (UNIFEM) and now Under -Secretary-General of the United Nations and Executive Secretary of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific. All in all, the reasons for coordinating were many: the need to work together to share assessments; an equal need to engage with tsunami-affected people, particularly women; directing aid well, given limited information; working out appropriate housing designs and developing effective livelihoods solutions beyond contexts, which led to stereotyping of options for women, farmers and small entrepreneurs; \u201cpoaching\u201d of able local staff; working within a fragmented, sometimes duplicative legal framework; and addressing a shortage of recovery skills.

Pak Kuntoro brought to the role extensive distinguished track record in Government, the State enterprise sector and academia. According to Bill Nicol, who began working with Pak Kuntoro as a senior advisor even before BRR was established: \u201cHe undoubtedly saw the endgame more clearly than anyone else.\u201d Significantly, BRR Headquarters was in Banda Aceh, the provincial capital, and not in the national capital extremely well in Aceh and ought to be considered as a model for other complex disaster contexts. Thus from the start, BRR was equipped with a mandate and a Master Plan outlining rehabilitation and reconstruction operate beyond normal bureaucratic restrictions while remaining very much part of the internal Indonesian coordinated more than 12,500 other projects involving over 60 bilateral donors and multilateral agencies as well as around 700 NGOs. Recovery takes a lot longer than anyone expects it to. Early on, BRR anticipated the shifting focus of recovery over four years The Indonesian Government responded to the complex set of challenges by establishing through legislation the Badan Rehabilitasi dan Rekonstruksi (BRR), the Aceh-Nias Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Agency, in April 2005. In line with Government Decree in Lieu of Law No. 2 of 2005, BRR was given a four-year timeframe to lead coordination of all recovery projects regardless of funding sources and to implement all \u201con-budget\u201d projects, where funds were funnelled through the Government. central government, which allowed for a much smoother coordination process, devoid of any potential inter- experience in organisational management, project supervision and corporate restructuring, as well as a Jakarta: this was the equivalent of bringing central government to the centre of the action, a model that worked needs, as a dedicated government ministry with a powerful mandate to innovate and reform that enabled it to government structure. In addition to implementing over 5,000 of its own reconstruction projects, BRR 24 25 Key Coordination Mechanisms With such a complex recovery environment, how did BRR achieve breakthroughs in leadership and coordination? A key aspect of the answer lies in its organisational approach. Early on, it moved to obtain an understanding of the shifting focus of reconstruction: from housing development to infrastructure, from institutional and social development to economic recovery, with land issues underlying throughout. In the process, BRR worked to create viable coordination structures and mechanisms that could help carry the enormous load demanded by the vast array of recovery contributors who looked to BRR for guidance and support with their programs. While BRR emphasised facilitation rather than control in its endeavours to help its many delivery partners, there can be no doubt that its legal authority and political leverage were powerful tools in clearing the many serious obstacles that confronted this large-scale post-disaster reconstruction program. Expectations also needed to be managed. After the initial days and weeks, most people understandably wanted to get on with their lives. But \u201creconstruction is far more complex and takes far longer than anyone would like or might imagine,\u201d says Pak Kuntoro. \u201cThe public, the media and the rest of the world needed to be educated about the challenges and length of time required to deliver an effective post-disaster reconstruction programme.\u201d While it is extremely hard to win the battle to manage expectations, BRR was able with time to reduce (although never really overcome) some of the pressures to show faster (far too many wanted it to be instant) progress which could have led to bigger programmatic problems either for itself or its reconstruction partners. Armed with its coordination mandate BRR actively worked to clarify and approve donor/NGO projects by mainstreaming project concept notes through the Recovery of Aceh and Nias Database (RAND) that minimised turf battles among agencies and allowed the space for each agency to maximise its contribution. This included general direction, active facilitation and an extensive outreach programme to work with delivery partners in identifying and overcoming bottlenecks.

Regular coordination meetings in Aceh helped ensure funds were used efficiently 25 26 At the national level, other coordination hubs were established to act as relays to BRR. One of these was the Multi Donor Fund (MDF), facilitated by World Bank, for multilateral donor funding coordination. The MDF pooled donor resources to support a mutually agreed portfolio of programmes, with a system in place \u2013 integrated into the BRR process \u2013 to decide the most efficient allocation of funds. Guided by a Steering Committee of donors, the Government of Indonesia and civil society representatives, it also encouraged participation from observers including the Government of Japan, AusAID, the United Nations and international organisations such as Oxfam, CARE and Mercy Corps. The MDF successfully implemented a number of projects in Aceh and Nias but its impact was limited by the relatively small amount of pooled funds (about US$758 million) and, over time, its tendency to avoid risk, and focus on bureaucratic procedure. Despite its challenges, however, the MDF provided a handy platform for high-level donor dialogue. At a more practical level, BRR needed to strengthen its coordination capacity in the field. It did so by asking the UN to create the UN Office of the Recovery Coordinator for Aceh and Nias (UNORC). UNORC complemented the work of BRR by extending its coordination capacity to cover not only UN agencies but also international NGOs and some donors through the Inter Agency Standing Committee which met regularly to consider recovery issues. UNORC also played a high-value role as an interlocutor with local government, a cross- thematic program advisor to Pak Kuntoro and an institutional builder promoting such initiatives as the Aceh Recovery Framework, the Kabupaten/ Kota Recovery Forums, AcehInfo and Solutions Exchange. As an entity operating at arms length from BRR, UNORC was well placed to audit aspects of program delivery in a variety of areas \u2013 for example, the housing sector where UNORC field staff conducted an external count that independently verified the completion of the first 100,000 houses. As Satya Tripathi, United Nations Recovery Coordinator for Aceh and Nias, observed, UNORC has a very clear mandate and a finite timeline, and does not have vested interests in competing for allocation of funds because it does not implement projects. This allows it the credibility to enable coordination, given that it is not Successful Teamwork in Tamil Nadu The NGO Coordination and Resource Centre in Nagapattinam, supported by UNDP, has been recognised for success in promoting coordination, facilitating participation and ensuring transparency, and has become a model for disaster-affected districts. Now registered as Building and Enabling Disaster Resilience of Coastal Communities (BEDROC), it works on long-term disaster risk reduction at district level. Following the tsunami, the Coordination and Resource Centre worked to promote adequate and timely flows of information between all relief and reconstruction organisations and the district administration, which for its part set up 11 teams to manage efforts. Team leaders and members made use of their own capacity and experience, as well as the human resources and equipment under their control. These 11 teams continued to be involved in the recovery process in the areas of livelihood restoration, provision of temporary and permanent shelters, health monitoring, and psycho-social support. Protection of vulnerable groups such as orphans and girls at risk of trafficking, among others, was addressed in a coordinated way. \u201cAll officials from all departments involved in relief were divided into these teams,\u201d says K. Baskaran, Joint Commissioner of Relief and Rehabilitation for Tamil Nadu and former Deputy District Collector in Nagapattinam. \u201cEvery night at 9 we would meet to review the day\u2019s progress and plan for the next day.

Those who participated included ministers and elected officials from central and local parliaments, central and local government officials, heads of local, national and international recovery organisations, ambassadors from donor countries and activists from national and local civil society groups. Many of the discussions were forthright and robust. They helped keep BRR sensitive to broader concerns and allowed an airing of different perspectives with which the program was seen by various stakeholders. CFAN sessions helped identify some of the most pressing reconstruction obstacles as well as highlighting the importance of key areas such as gender and environment. Exercising the Coordination Mandate BRR realised quickly that breakthrough initiatives would be needed to build back better and respond to the twin challenges of accelerating project implementation during early reconstruction and at the same time ensuring that all funds were being used efficiently, duplication was minimised, gaps were filled and that geographical and sectoral coverage was balanced to the best extent possible. Speed was also essential. With this in mind, BRR spearheaded the fast-track project approval for up to 12,500 partner projects. Under the mandatory project concept note process, every agency submitted critical information on proposed projects, including funding sources, location, budget and performance indicators, before being given approval to work on tsunami recovery in Indonesia. Approval could be granted even within a few working days. Says BRR Special Advisor Kevin Evans: \u201cThe World Bank, with a $30-million project covering everything from village level upward, or a little NGO building a single school in a single village, was going through exactly the same process.\u201d Furthermore, all the information obtained on approved projects through the project concept notes was made available on the web-based Recovery Aceh -Nias Database (RAND), which was regularly updated by all recovery partners. Information on the recovery activities in Aceh and Nias was thus freely available to all. Key performance indicator data on RAND, including on women\u2019s participation, Women engaged in reconstruction in Balai Inong, Aceh 27 28 helped identify and monitor gaps. This kind of mandatory information sharing - unprecedented in disaster recovery - proved useful in coordination (See chapter 4 for details on RAND). The bi-weekly meetings of an Inter-Agency Standing Committee added to efforts at this level, as did cross-agency working groups facilitated by UNORC. Another unique and successful initiative in Indonesia was the establishment in December 2005 of a one-stop shop or \u2018Tim Terpadu\u2019 for processing international workers\u2019 visas and work permits, international organisations\u2019 import documents, and tax exemptions, among others. This helped greatly in cutting through administrative problems, which had led to delays during early recovery, and contrasted sharply with administrative difficulties faced by aid workers in other emergencies and in other parts of the world. Multi-year infrastructure, public service facilities and land acquisition. Building on women\u2019s grassroots activism, BRR also sought to ensure that gender issues were considered in all development sectors through a special unit within the Office of the Director that formulated a comprehensive gender policy. UNIFEM placed a gender advisor in BRR to provide sustained input and guidance and its Executive Director, Ines Alberdi, has called Aceh \u201ca rich model for post-tsunami gender- responsive reconstruction.\u201d BRR also employed gender-specific data for monitoring and evaluation, developed practical checklists for use in health, housing, education, livelihoods and institutional change, and promoted active participation of tsunami-affected women in plans for their future. Pak Kuntoro himself became widely respected as someone who saw women as the transformational agents of society and sought to innovate programs that would advance gender equality. The re-emergence of women\u2019s political leadership in Aceh reflects the upgrading of women\u2019s issues. A provincial women\u2019s congress, supported by UNIFEM, culminated in major legislative reforms, including a requirement for participating parties that 30 percent of their candidates be women; UNIFEM further consulted with local women to provide space for their self-help and political mobilisation in traditional \u201cwomen\u2019s houses.\u201d Already women represent one-third of those standing for election.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8ec840e4-266c-43b5-9211-e03adc2245e3": {"__data__": {"id_": "8ec840e4-266c-43b5-9211-e03adc2245e3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Tsunami Legacy: Innovation Breakthroughs and Change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d63cff1e7d5f7adffe3f95996b64daa718f9ff7749aeadad95437e0d66c6c2d2"}, "2": {"node_id": "668aa6c0-899b-4c27-b30d-129173665c0d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7154928d60fbab4b9eedc006e11a8ca4c316bf2ad03adcb834d1682141d25954"}}, "hash": "0286b950bf1f503cbf74fce22d4f2ed8b0a75ae5d6b17843ad3955eff4511874", "text": "In Banda Aceh, Vice Mayor Illiza Sa\u2019ajuddin Djamal attributes her election in part to increased awareness of gender concerns and points out that Banda Aceh is moving toward instituting a \u201cwomen-friendly city\u201d initiative. \u201cThe most remarkable outcome of the tsunami,\u201d Djamal declares, \u201cis women\u2019s", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29968182-9d03-4051-89b5-05819dae1bad": {"__data__": {"id_": "29968182-9d03-4051-89b5-05819dae1bad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Tsunami Legacy: Innovation Breakthroughs and Change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b6db98b7740d12f658accb50e24fb60e700aeaa2f7b331c47f1a4cfdb5c4a6d0"}, "3": {"node_id": "033e9a5a-bcea-463b-8b40-be41c0892d67", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ebf3bcc8208030c38b7dd09010a79e23075af586ea588c00c7e2848c85a7f2aa"}}, "hash": "3694fa5901e791b6ef694ed70026e15d7f36ee71c13471b955ca1682c7cf7243", "text": "empowerment.\u201d An additional breakthrough occurred when women in Aceh, strongly supported by GTZ, the German technical development agency, joined with local religious and civil authorities in adopting the first Islamic women\u2019s human rights charter, including rights to land, education, guardianship of children, and protection from violence.

Indeed, when the IFRC played a pivotal role in underwriting a massive operation in 2006 to move up to 70,000 IDPs out of tents and into quality transitional shelters, the international Tsunami Evaluation Coalition (TEC) described the operation as \u201cpartnership at its very best,\u201d with Government, NGOs and the United Nations all working closely. Coordination Catalysts in Other Countries Despite some gaps, national governments also took an early lead in recovery in the other most-affected countries, with special State structures instituted in Sri Lanka and Maldives. In India, devolving authority to local administrators was crucial to the Tamil Nadu recovery effort, which emphasised community participation and a multi-sectoral approach (see Box 1.1). India \u201cWhen the tsunami hit, within two or three days there was an all-party meeting, and what they agreed upon \u2026 was [the need] to be efficient. There was a whole reshuffle and appointment of people who had a track record of efficiency, competence and no corruption,\u201d explains Benjamin Larroquette, former United Nations Tsunami Recovery Manager in India. A network of state- and district-level knowledge centres provided the infrastructure for dissemination of vast amounts of information and reliable village-level data; it also became a focal point for NGOs on how they could contribute to recovery. While these centres had some weaknesses and did not always ensure maximum The United Nations, Delivering as One Post-tsunami coordination was boosted considerably by the United Nations operating as \u201cone UN,\u201d sometimes through a special structure such as UNORC in Aceh, and sometimes through a central focal point in the United Nations Resident Coordinator System, as in Maldives, Thailand and Sri Lanka. In India, a particular breakthrough was achieved for the seven Agencies participating in the UN team for Tsunami Recovery Support: FAO, ILO, UNDP, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNICEF and WHO. UNORC complemented the work of BRR by extending its coordination capacity to cover not only UN agencies with 2500 personnel implementing projects in excess of US$ 1 Billion but also international NGOs and donors through the Inter Agency Standing Committee which met regularly to consider key recovery issues. UNORC coordinated common services for the recovery community such as UN Humanitarian Air Services (UNHAS) and the WFP Shipping Services. It also played a high- value role as an interlocutor with local government, a cross- thematic program advisor to the national government and an institution builder promoting such initiatives as the Aceh Recovery Framework, the Kabupaten/Kota Recovery Forums, Solutions Exchange, AcehInfo and common communication platforms. \u201cWithin the UN system, we made big changes to our administrative system and we implemented joint programming tools to get much more focused,\u201d reflects Pieter Bult, the former UN Tsunami Recovery Manager in India and now Deputy Country Director for UNDP India. \u201cAs soon as these mechanisms were set up, we proposed a similar way of working with Government and other main players in the tsunami work.\u201d He adds: \u201cA lot of work focused on longer-term improvements. UNICEF, for instance, took the tsunami as an opportunity to expand its quality education initiative with pilots in the affected communities.

Still, the breakthrough of creating the Ministry elevated both disaster management and human rights issues to ministerial status, under the purview of the Prime Minister, and recognised citizen rights to access support, information, protection and recovery. The Ministry was tasked with the formulation of a National Disaster Management Plan based on a \u201crealistic approach to responses and recovery,\u201d as well as with coordinating activities related to people displaced by conflict. The Ministry also addressed some of the coordination problems that arose when, for example, the private sector -dominated organisation leading infrastructure and housing efforts was constrained by its lack of linkages to line Ministries.

Third, sectors, United Nations agencies 30 31 becoming focal points for coordination; for example, UNHCR accepted to be the lead agency for coordinating the transitional shelter programme. Technical assistance provided by the United Nations to district governments also has built capacity and facilitated oversight at this level. \u201cAt the beginning, there was nothing available in district offices of the divisional secretary to meet this kind of disaster. Forget about the knowledge \u2013 basic infrastructure was not there,\u201d says Y.K.H. de Silva, a consultant to the Disaster Relief Monitoring Unit, Human Rights Commission. \u201cToday that particular person is probably sitting at a computer. The latest technology is given to him with a database. \u2026 Before, this was only in Colombo. Now all districts are interconnected, and sharing of knowledge is very wide.\u201d Women who organised in village after village to voice common problems and seek solutions also shared knowledge (see Chapter 3). Maldives In Maldives, unlike elsewhere, no disaster preparedness existed in the Government or local communities, because there were no recorded national disasters of this magnitude. Few international NGOs worked there and compared to the rush of 700 NGOs into Aceh, Maldives\u2019 two dozen represented only a handful. But although Maldives suffered a lower number of fatalities, the relative impact on both the economy and the population was immense: Fully a third of Maldives\u2019 people were severely affected, with whole islands rendered uninhabitable and a substantial proportion of the population displaced.5 About 60 percent of GDP was destroyed, compared to less than 2 percent in Indonesia and Thailand. Given these challenges, the Government of Maldives set up a National Disaster Management Centre (NDMC) to coordinate activities. A Joint Tsunami Assessment by the Government, ADB, World Bank and UNDP formed the basis for much of the relief and recovery work. Somalia and Myanmar: The coordination problem Somalia was hit by the tsunami after four years of consecutive drought and continuing civil conflict. Some 300 people lost their lives and another 50,000 were missing or displaced.

Coordination of a huge number of entities was therefore not a challenge. However, Somalia still faced many problems with coordination, in contrast to the Maldives, which also found itself with extensive damage and a relatively small number of recovery actors. Why did Somalia struggle with coordinating a small number of recovery agents? Civil conflict and lawlessness with the subsequent chronic poverty, social and political unrest, and insecurity have plagued the country for years. While UN OCHA relied on tried and tested coordination methods in the initial humanitarian relief phase with some success, assistance in the recovery phase was hampered by the deteriorating security situation caused by rivalry between military groups particularly in the central and southern parts of the country. This volatility was further increased by the lack of a functioning government and countrywide administration. The leadership and management that proved pivotal in effective coordination in Indonesia and each of the other four most affected countries, was lacking in Somalia. A complex web of political and military rivalries, corruption and distrust served to undermine any efforts in achieving breakthroughs or substantial changes in the status quo. The pre-existing humanitarian crisis both overwhelmed and absorbed the crisis wrought by the tsunami. In Myanmar, meanwhile, although official figures vary, there were at least 61 recorded tsunami deaths with another 43 seriously injured. An estimated 601 houses were destroyed rendering 2592 people homeless and some 10,000 were in urgent need of basic food, water and emergency health assistance. Overall, the damage inflicted in this region was relatively minor compared with that sustained by other Southeast Asian countries, owing partly to the underwater mountains and offshore islands along the Myanmar coastline which provided a protective buffer against the waves. From the outset of the recovery response, however, sharp competition between agencies providing emergency aid and donor pressures to deliver visible post tsunami outputs in Myanmar at times obscured grassroots level needs and realities. Improved access and field-level coordination could have ensured more efficient use of resources, as would more effective partnerships between civil society and the host government. On a position note, the unprecedented impact of the 2004 tsunami prompted many organisations- initially concerned solely with post-disaster relief operations- to reorient their work to include longer term development programs. Box 1.3 31 32 Within three months, the government also produced a National Recovery and Reconstruction Plan, which quickly take up programmes, and it set up other coordination bodies, including the Housing and Infrastructure Redevelopment Unit. Since then, the government has drafted a civil defense bill, which is now in its final stages of approval. with support from UNDP. Based on this, the government has established an organisational structure for disaster response, including at atoll and island levels; drafted legislation on disaster management; and formulated a disaster management plan outlining roles and Similar to the MDF in Aceh, a trust fund for donors was set up. In 2006 the government convened the first Maldives Partnership Forum, inviting international donors to discuss critical development needs. \u201cOne lesson we learned was that the country was very vulnerable to natural disasters. But we never had a National Disaster Management Centre before, so we have developed this to ensure that it can take up this kind of coordinating work in case there is another disaster of such magnitude,\u201d says Mohamed Imad, Assistant Executive Director of the Department of National Planning. Simply setting up the centre is not sufficient, however, as Hon. Minister Abdulla Shahid, Director of the NDMC, points out: \u201cCurrently we have only 7 staff members at the NDMC. If there were another emergency tomorrow, the country would look to us for coordinating the relief effort. We must build up our capacity if this centre is to prove effective\u201d. The United Nations was the only international organisation in Maldives before the tsunami and therefore took the leading role with the government. It develope d a common UN Strategic Framework for Recovery, which aimed to transform the disaster\u2019s challenges into opportunities for sustainable long-term development. After the tsunami the IFRC also played a major role, contributing nearly US$150 million. But while coordination of a large number of NGOs was not an issue, resource mobilisation was: because affected islands were widely scattered, transportation costs were very high, which donors had not anticipated; moreover, the greater the delay in the start of repair, the greater the costs since, for example, a crack in a seawall, if left unattended, may cause a total collapse, but if attended early on, can be repaired at lesser cost.

Meanwhile, attention has been paid to the development of the private sector in Maldives, which had primarily consisted of small to medium enterprises. The National Development Plan includes a major focus on private sector development, and efforts have been taken to strengthen the National Chamber of Commerce. Support was also given to the Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship Council (WEC) to expand the handicrafts industry, create sustainable home- and island-based businesses and provide market access in resorts and overseas.

Ensuring local government preparedness to take over responsibilities, resources and assets has been a top priority in BRR\u2019s final months, structured primarily through the Aceh Government Transformation Programme, funded by the MDF and implemented by UNDP. Gaps were being addressed not only in technical capacity to implement recovery work, but also in broader institutional capacity to coordinate such work beyond the transition. From 2007 BRR began to regionalise its operations. This process of regionalisation was deepened as links with each individual local authority were strengthened through approaches such as Joint Secretariats (between local authorities and BRR and involving other reconstruction agencies active locally). Later mechanisms at local level were set up by local authorities, supported through the Kabupaten/Kota Recovery Forums (KRF) facilitated by UNORC, to ensure a successfully coordinated transition. These KRFs were led by the recently elected political leaders and focused on providing them with policy input and leverage from a wide diversity of local stakeholders including international reconstruction partners working at the local level. Says Pak Kuntoro: \u201cThe KRFs are now one of the most productive of all vehicles through which we engage with local governments.

Six Cluster Committees, which developed the road map, were chaired by the provincial Government and intensively supported by UNORC and other international partners.

In this sense, the tsunami was not different from other emergencies: social divides based on vulnerability and discrimination are often re-played \u2013 and sometimes exacerbated \u2013 in the emergency setting, a fact compounded by the surge of media attention and funds. While international codes and principles guide relief and recovery efforts,6 many people were still not able to access adequate assistance after the tsunami simply because of their gender, ethnicity, age, class, religion or occupation. Often, tight deadlines imposed by the need to deliver fast had the effect of dropping gender and other equity issues \u2013 or of the wrong projects being taken up by the wrong organisations for the wrong reasons. This led to further marginalisation of already vulnerable groups such as women and the poorest. But while these earlier efforts were sometimes exclusionary, the recovery setting also provided an important opportunity to address underlying social inequities and strengthen human rights protection for vulnerable groups, including those with HIV and AIDS (see Box 2.1). \u201cWithout a dedicated effort to change historic patterns of inequity, traditionally marginalised or disenfranchised groups will continue to lack both the political awareness and power to demand their fair share of recovery resources,\u201d former United Nations Special Envoy for Tsunami Recovery, President Bill Clinton, has noted. any people cannot access assistance after disasters simply because of their gender, ethnicity, age, class, religion or occupation. In particular, it is women and the poorest whose needs tend to be overlooked. Recovery actors in tsunami affected countries initially struggled with similar difficulties. In the medium-term, however, the disaster provided an important opportunity to address underlying social inequities and strengthen human rights protection for vulnerable groups, a task quickly seized upon by India\u2019s strong civil society and vibrant media. responsiveness and openness, this made the difference in bringing all survivors back", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ce421ac5-a29d-439b-9280-54497fee4eaf": {"__data__": {"id_": "ce421ac5-a29d-439b-9280-54497fee4eaf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Tsunami Legacy: Innovation Breakthroughs and Change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ad5bd0866b3aee8118ee09ab9a59a179d764b96d128610b0afcc932ce1e57517"}}, "hash": "ad5bd0866b3aee8118ee09ab9a59a179d764b96d128610b0afcc932ce1e57517", "text": "on the road toward recovery much faster. Combined with a state government in Tamil Nadu that displayed swiftness, 38 \u201cAnd the problem can be compounded by a post- disaster influx of new assistance providers who have little knowledge of the context in which they are operating, including structures of inequality, chronic poverty and vulnerability.\u201d In India, initial impact assessments revealed that more than 3 in 4 tsunami-affected people belonged to Tamil Nadu\u2019s coastal fishing communities. Of the houses damaged or destroyed, 80 percent belonged to fishermen.7 In addition to losing housing and working space, these people also lost livelihoods and economic assets, from boats and nets to markets. Initial relief efforts consequently focused on fishing communities, and compensation was given only to those who could provide proof that they had lost assets to the water.8 This resulted at first in the exclusion of many of those who did not have physical assets and were not registered owners of property, businesses, vessels or equipment, as well as those whose livelihoods were based on the use of their labour and skills in the fishing industry. Yet more than a quarter of the affected population in India belonged to underprivileged and marginalised social groups. They included those working in fishing-related activities, such as day labourers in ice plants, who were out of jobs as the fisheries sector came to a halt; landless labourers who were also jobless, as agricultural lands were salinised and crops damaged; and salt-pan labourers, many of them women, who lost income as salt-pan lands became mud flats. Since these groups \u2013 Dalits9 and tribal groups such as Irulas; people with disabilities; Muslim minority communities, and the elderly \u2013 tended not to stay in \u201cfrontline\u201d settlements where physical damages were greatest, they were overlooked in the first impact assessments. Thus, they initially faced difficulties in rebuilding their lives and securing relief and rehabilitation packages. Said one 75-year-old Tamil Nadu resident, Perumal: \u201cSome cars came by and just threw the [food] packets. The fastest get the food; the strong one wins. The elderly and the injured don\u2019t get anything.\u201d10 In addition, pre-existing gender-based divisions and prejudices placed a heavier burden on girls and women in comparison to boys and men, including in their lack of access to land ownership and exposure to gender-based violence, which often increases sharply when men\u2019s traditional breadwinner roles are challenged Box 2.1 HIV and AIDS Awareness Incorporated into Recovery Efforts In India, the tsunami-affected states were already reeling from a long-term battle with HIV and AIDS. In fact, the prevalence rates there, as the National AIDS Control Society pointed out, were the highest in the country. Taking this fact as their point of departure, the United Nations Tsunami Framework in India, decided to integrate HIV and AIDS components into their recovery and rehabilitation work, in as much as possible. With the government\u2019s inclusive and equitable approach in mind, UN and partners wanted to ensure that the benefits of recovery would reach this vulnerable group. Since HIV and AIDS programs are traditionally difficult to socialise and risk exacerbating stigmas attached with the diseases, the ability to mainstream them in the wider tsunami recovery effort provided a unique opportunity to improve the impact and reach of programming related to the diseases. HIV and AIDS elements were incorporated across the board in tsunami programs in India. In addition, partners ensured that HIV and AIDS patients had access to tsunami relief projects and were not excluded from vital services. Critically, the efforts were in line with the Indian Government\u2019s own campaign to address HIV/AIDS issues and therefore saw enthusiastic participation from a host of NGOs and civil society organisations as well. As detailed in the national plans, the affected states faced an urgent need to prevent further spread of the epidemic and to increase HIV/ AIDS awareness among the affected population. Health information available today indicates that the new approach \u2013 using the recovery as a conduit through which to expand ongoing programs \u2013 bore fruit. The infection rate in affected states dropped dramatically, in some places down by several percentage points.

A joint report by the United Nations, World Bank and Asian Development Bank, published two years after the tsunami, found: \u201cThe swiftness of the assistance brought survivors back on the road toward economic recovery much faster in comparison to many of their counterparts in other tsunami-affected countries.\u201d11 Yet while India\u2019s Central and State administrations began behalf of the marginalised, this was not without challenges: systems were not in place to track and identify vulnerable groups, compounded by an oversupply of sometimes inappropriate aid. In addition, powerful traditional panchayats (local governance structures), comprised exclusively of men, frequently acted as barriers, initially preventing women-headed households, unmarried women, and widows and elderly women from obtaining relief.12 Participatory processes were also few and far between. Taken together, a lack of gender concerns meant that many programmes fell short of properly understanding the special needs of women in particular.

That\u2019s when the government started shifting its position.\u201d The distinctiveness of India\u2019s situation is the State government\u2019s timeliness, responsiveness and openness to environment for the inclusion of equity issues in recovery. In all, the government called upon at least 10 working with a range of civil society organisations on 39 40 reflecting the gender-based division of labour \u2013 the tsunami simply passed under the fisherman at sea but badly affected the large number of women working in markets on the shore. At the same time, the visibility of men\u2019s economic losses \u2013 especially boats \u2013 eclipsed the reality of women\u2019s economic losses, such as the markets through which they sold fish.14 In addition to the need for stronger emphasis on women\u2019s livelihoods, lack of privacy and security for women was a serious concern, with dangerous living conditions found in temporary barracks. Gender stereotypes in relief aid likewise were common; one NGO, for example, distributed cell phones to men\u2019s self-help groups but not to women\u2019s groups in the Irula community, apparently feeling that technology was a \u201cman\u2019s\u201d concern.15 Coordination mechanisms were established at state and district levels to better focus the expertise of civil society organisations and the public toward equity issues and make best use of resources.16 This eventually allowed for better understanding of the differing needs and priorities and as a consequence previously excluded groups were targeted to address and meet their rights. Ironically, the devastation of the tsunami ultimately became an event through which the vulnerable felt they became more visible. A \u2018Core House\u2019 and Special Aid Packages Promoting equity also relies on other good practices such as participation of affected communities and transparent management of recovery. Further breakthroughs in Tamil Nadu included a key order from the state made eligible for assistance.

Besides the coastal-zone homes taken up for disaster-resistant repair and reconstruction, nearly 6,000 were built for indirectly affected families such as the tribal Irulas (see Box 2.3). Dalits also were given housing assistance and rights to land ownership. The United Nations implemented a project in Nagapattinam District to strengthen capacities of the district administration to be more pro- poor and equity-sensitive. One output was an \u201cEquity Charter\u201d for the district, developed by district officials and validated by parties involved, ensuring further work toward an equitable, participatory approach.17 A number of case studies18 illustrate other ways in which civil society groups took steps to try to ensure that the recovery counteracted patterns of vulnerability and disadvantage. These include: \u2666 Special aid packages for numerous groups to make livelihood activities more broad-based, including students, orphans, widows and people with disabilities; in the latter case, if a child was physically challenged, parents received assistance; \u2666 Targeting of marginal inland farmers, providing training and technical support on new methods of production, which allowed them to increase yields by up to 70 percent; \u2666 Policy changes allowing women to become joint owners of boats or working \u201cowners\u201d of salt-pan sites, or to start up new businesses; \u2666 Provision of physical structures such as schools, vocational training centres and orphanages, targeted at vulnerable communities;19 \u2666 Scholarships for more than 125,000 children from tsunami-affected families for 10 years, providing a sustained thrust for education of girls and those from marginalised families; \u2666 Establishment of self-help groups for the elderly to use donated grains to earn interest. This scheme has been replicated in 52 coastal villages and benefited nearly 6,000 elders; \u2666 Measures to improve transparency, including appointment of district and village monitoring and frequent interaction with mass media and the public; \u2666 Establishment of efficient complaints mechanisms; out of 188,000 complaints filed, 183,000 have been settled. Box 2.3 Build Back Better for the Marginalised Irula Tribe The semi-nomadic Irulas live in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh in southern India. These tribes made a living by catching rats and snakes but had to give that up after the Government introduced the 1972 Wildlife Protection Act. Some moved toward the coast. When the tsunami struck, 57 Irula villages were affected, and 90 percent of their livelihoods came to a standstill. Although they were among the poorest, most Irulas received no immediate post-tsunami support. As inland fisher folk, they were not listed as tsunami victims and also were not declared as Scheduled Tribes, which would have entitled them to specific welfare schemes. However, the district administration in Cuddalore, Tamil Nadu, took the lead to certify Irulas as Scheduled Tribes and also donated the land they lived on, working out a scheme to provide new permanent housing in collaboration with NGOs. A livelihood programme was introduced to diversify their income, including poultry farming, goat rearing and mud crab rearing. A literacy programme also was started, because nearly all Irulas were illiterate. In all, this represents an example of a \u201chabitat development\u201d approach, which focuses on fostering a healthy, safe living environment through construction of stronger houses, along with the provision of amenities such as drinking water, sanitation, roads, drainage, waste management facilities, and community facilities such as schools, child care centres and health centres. This approach also promotes equity, active participation of all parties and linkages with livelihoods, and was widely used by Government and NGOs in post-tsunami reconstruction. the government, international agencies and committees; publication of lists of beneficiaries in all villages and offices and on government websites; 41 42 Critically, the Government of Tamil Nadu did not simply respond to women\u2019s practical needs but offered real opportunities for change, through several key steps. It mandated joint housing rights for spouses and disallowed transfers of the wife\u2019s share to the husband and ensured that reconstruction work included consultations with women. In addition, it made abandoned and destitute women eligible for pensions; distributed initial relief packages to women family members; and provided INR300,000 each (more than US$6,800 at the time) to orphaned adolescent girls and unmarried women for education and officials identified vulnerable children who had lost their parents and addressed trafficking issues.

After initial training on an array of more than 200 skills, groups were linked with social support programme, more than 50,000 women were counselled and given better coping skills to deal with the trauma. Yemen: Learning to Make the Invisible Visible The Yemeni experience of tsunami recovery highlights the abiding need for accurate and reliable demographic data in dealing with natural disasters. Whilst the tsunami-related death toll in the country was comparatively low at two, the tsunami wave \u2013 and subsequent sea surges and currents \u2013 caused extensive damage to the local fishing industry as well as to marine life. The majority of the damage occurred in the coastal communities of the Al-Mahara district, and the island of Socotra, where some 2,000 families were affected. The fishing infrastructure was particularly damaged: storage sheds and jetties, 653 boats, 1,625 nets and 16,980 fishing traps were all destroyed. In addition, ground water wells were rendered unusable due to increased salinity, coastal erosion was exacerbated and an unquantifiable amount of marine life damage. Given the impact to the fishing infrastructure, the livelihoods of countless communities relying on the sector (fishing is one of the country\u2019s most important sectors) were affected. However, because the physical damage in Yemen was significantly less than those countries closer to the earthquake\u2019s epicentre, and not as readily apparent, the country received little assistance from the international community. Furthermore, since the loss of livelihood proved difficult to quantify, there was an insufficient understanding of the damage, especially in remote areas, and the initial damage was underestimated. Accordingly, Yemen made no calls for international assistance. When the reality of the amount of damage to livelihoods slowly emerged, compensation was put up for some fishermen, but it was often to be a case of \u2018too little too late\u2019 with the best case scenarios seeing compensation delivered six months after the crisis. The Government of Yemen has drawn important lessons from this experience \u2013 and translated their learning into practice. Since the lack of accurate demographic data in coastal communities effectively underestimated the impact and, by extension, slowed down the assistance, the Government partnered with the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) and the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) to carry out comprehensive field research of affected communities. With the data collected in the field as a baseline, government and international partners were not only able to implement targeted post-tsunami fishery rehabilitation projects, they also contributed to richer understanding of Yemen\u2019s disaster preparedness. The country now has measurable indicators that allow for comprehensive policy making \u2013 the communities that had previously slipped under the radar, are invisible no longer. Box 2.4 resettlement.

For example, CARE International had a strong focus on widows, the destitute, girls and people with disabilities; it also identified groups such as inland fishermen and seashell collectors for interventions.20 Such projects often faced an uphill battle, however: husbands had to be persuaded that wives could, and should, go for technical training, and not all women desired the kinds of changes envisioned in this very difficult period. Moreover, programming targeting women and men separately at times fostered unintended jealousy within families and villages.

This has been particularly necessary in light of the longstanding conflict in the north and east of the island, which bore the brunt of the tsunami there. In Sri Lanka as well as Aceh, where tsunami-affected people lived among large populations affected by decades of armed strife, numerous conflict victims had been waiting for housing assistance for years and had been provided aid far more modest than tsunami survivors, who in some cases managed to receive a new house for each family member. Women\u2019s needs had been particularly overlooked. Yet while in Aceh a peace agreement was achieved in August 2005 \u2013 albeit not directly because of the tsunami \u2013 in Sri Lanka the highly sensitive political and humanitarian context in which the tsunami unfolded continues to challenge policymakers and development partners. But in both situations, a wide divide among beneficiaries needed to be overcome, yet at least initially, most organisations working on post-tsunami reconstruction largely ignored the post-conflict context \u2013 or considered it only marginally. This arose from various reasons such as lack of technical expertise, limited mandates that did not include political issues, very high pressure to deliver visible post- tsunami results, and a large A conflict-affected family in Aceh receive support to rebuild their home 43 44 percentage of donations from the public being earmarked for tsunami recovery only. In Aceh, barely 3,000 out of more than 31,000 houses destroyed or damaged because of conflict have been rebuilt.24 Similarly, assistance that was provided was of poorer quality; the average house for a conflict victim cost only US$3,500, while for a tsunami victim it was about US$8,000.25 \u201cFor many agencies, conflict is considered only as a background issue, or perhaps as a threat to staff security and successful project implementation,\u201d wrote the authors of one report in Aceh. \u201cHowever, most reports, even relatively in-depth articles, did not mention the ongoing conflict and possible peace process, despite the direct impact on people\u2019s lives and the region\u2019s future.\u201d26 Addressing the needs of both tsunami- and conflict-affected people quickly became paramount to ensuring equity.27 But because the post-tsunami and post-conflict recovery dynamics evolved in almost parallel universes, numerous grievances were raised by conflict-affected communities in both Sri Lanka and Aceh. Moreover, rising inequalities in aid provision started to lead to significant tensions on the ground, with many local conflicts related to disputes over who was being targeted for development aid. If conflict sensitivity had been more widespread, building back better could have been more equitable all along. Despite the challenge of inequities, a number of successful \u2013 and flexible \u2013 interventions have been initiated, with many partners coming to see the importance of addressing conflict and post-conflict issues in the post- permanent housing under its Unified Assistance Scheme or had their houses upgraded. Hallmarks of the scheme included strict eligibility criteria, management at local and provincial levels, and significant community involvement. Some national and international non-Government organisations also stressed the importance of conflict-sensitive programming following the tsunami. One study highlighted best practices that promoted This conflict-affected family, sitting outside their new home, were one of the lucky ones that received aid in equal measure to tsunami victims tsunami setting as a consequence. For example, in Sri Lanka the government resettled the conflict-affected in 44 45 equity between conflict- and tsunami-affected groups: \u2666 The UK Disaster Emergencies Committee expanded its implementation timeframe from one to three years and its beneficiary focus from tsunami-affected people to tsunami-affected districts. This allowed conflict-affected IDPs and other groups more indirectly touched by the tsunami to access support. \u2666 The European Commission\u2019s Humanitarian Office (ECHO) similarly amended its beneficiary target group to mitigate the risk of discriminating against conflict-affected IDPs. In 2005, the Global Consortium on Tsunami Recovery (see chapter one) endorsed and further encouraged efforts in this direction. \u2666 The National Development Trust Fund, sponsored by ADB, ensured that all communities in the north and east of the island - the areas most affected by conflict - could access microfinance support. In Indonesia, a Presidential Instruction provided for an integrated policy to support the peace process; further, a special directive set up dedicated mechanisms to oversee peace and reintegration.

Cordaid conducted a conflict/social capital mapping exercise on the assumption that relief and rehabilitation programmes in particular, and development programmes in general, cannot be considered \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d in a conflict situation.29 For its part, KfW Entwicklungsbank sponsored an expert mission in early 2008 with the objective of exploring options to ensure full use of its programme\u2019s potential for stabilising conflict-affected areas.30 Overall, the post-tsunami effort may still play a helpful role for conflict-affected people and has already provided some with stronger assistance. Disparities in aid, and the realisation of what governments and development organisations can actually provide, may help stimulate new dialogue on enhanced support. An urgent need still exists to continue to shift from direct compensation toward longer-term economic empowerment and social cohesion for those affected by conflict.31 Whether this change in paradigm occurs effectively, however, remains to be seen. Joint Land Titles for Women In many instances, women who had lost their husbands and children faced an argument based on customary or religious practices that they had no rights to the land on which they lived, and that consequently they were not eligible for housing. In a move that will no doubt bring great benefits for long-term development in Aceh, a joint land titling policy for women and men was adopted in September 2006 \u2013 a first for Indonesia. Joint land titling, like titling of houses in both partners\u2019 names, has significantly increased women\u2019s economic security. \u201cAlthough there is no statement in shari\u2019a or adat (customary) law or Indonesian law that prevents women from owning land or being a signatory to a joint title, specific interventions are required to support full implementation and understanding of these rights,\u201d Kuntoro Mangkusubroto, the head of BRR, told the Jakarta Post. \u201cThe question of access to productive assets, including land for widows and the application of joint land titling for spouses, is a serious matter. \u2026 We hope that it [will be] a reality, not only for the immediate victims of disaster who have lost so much, but also for generations to come.\u201d million from the central government was allocated to reintegration schemes between August 2005 and 2008, 45 46 Ensuring land rights for women in Aceh was particularly crucial in a male-dominated society to enhance their agricultural productivity and security, increase access to productive resources and promote family welfare, says Dr. Jean D\u2019Cunha, East and Southeast Asia Regional Programme Director of UNIFEM. With strong support from UNIFEM, BRR acquired joint land titling for tsunami-affected married couples who had received land in a relocation area. Many people said joint land titling \u201cwas impossible to do because Muslim shari\u2019a law is very strong in Aceh,\u201d noted Eddy Purwanto, Chief Operations Officer of BRR. \u201cBut we saw the opportunity\u201d \u2013 as did many women at community level. Agrees Erna Heryani, BRR\u2019s Director of Land Administration and Mapping: \u201cPeople generally understand this as a good thing. Most wives or widows never expected they would get land in their name.\u201d Yet joint land titling has worked in only some places. Why? The quality of leadership and the legal framework, as well as partnerships with informal leaders from the women\u2019s and religious communities, were important determinants in making or breaking the initiative, BRR officials say. But it was difficult to safeguard women\u2019s participation when, for example, in town-hall discussions, husbands chose to represent the family while women stayed home. Nonetheless, BRR is hoping that the policy will eventually be implemented nationwide. Overall, Purwanto says, ensuring that gender issues are incorporated into all development plans \u201cis not something you have to do because someone tells you to do it.

Following the tsunami, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Thailand widely employed participation by both women and men, including massive people\u2019s consultations, beneficiary surveys, Help Desks and community monitoring of projects. Housing reconstruction provided particularly fertile ground for eliciting people\u2019s opinions of what they wanted. For many communities it was the first time they had ever been asked. Communities are the first responders after disasters, a fact which was evident after the tsunami. As a report by Global Alliance noted: \u201cThe unsung heroes were thousands of small merchants, hoteliers and enterprises situated away from the coast, with the assets, equipment and initiative to commit all to the humanitarian crisis long before outside help was at hand.\u201d Perhaps the most valuable benefit of this involvement is something that isn\u2019t easily quantifiable: a feeling of individual empowerment, of \u201cownership\u201d of community resources, and the unleashing of people\u2019s own capacities to cope and to share meagre resources at times of major threats. More broadly, citizen participation is a cornerstone of democratic governance. Without citizen involvement, democracy doesn\u2019t work, so change has to be both bottom-up and top-down. In the aftermath of the tsunami, people around the world made extraordinarily generous individual contributions, and global people\u2019s participation likewise came to the fore; thus creating a kind of virtuous loop. Yet too often, those most in need after a disaster \u2013 especially women and vulnerable groups \u2013 are not seriously consulted about planning or implementation of relief and recovery. In particular, women\u2019s steps toward effective participation and decision making in their communities elicited post-tsunami criticism from within their communities. Still, it wasn\u2019t long before women\u2019s groups organised to document gender concerns and identify opportunities for change (see Box 3.1). \u201cIn the weeks following the tsunami, these women could barely speak in front of their husbands,\u201d said Rebecca Reena of the Gandhian Unit for Integrated Development and Education (GUIDE), an NGO in Tamil Nadu. \u201cBut look at them now \u2013 they are sharing the same platform with their menfolk.

At least in the Maldivian context, such community consultations had rarely occurred before. Beneficiary surveys deepened knowledge of important qualitative dimensions of recovery, increasing accountability to affected communities, and were hailed as \u201cone of the most significant innovations of the tsunami response.\u201d34 49 50 With United Nations support, the Government of Sri Lanka empowered the national Human Rights Commission to conduct people\u2019s consultations in more than 1,100 tsunami-affected communities in 13 districts. The consultations provided a critical channel for identifying concerns and grievances of the tsunami-affected, highlighting their priorities. Nearly 850 focus group discussions were convened, with 15-20 representatives from each village participating. Consultations were also carried out with host communities to ascertain their needs and interests, and with local authorities, NGOs and community organisations in affected districts. Findings were channelled into district recovery plans and were supplemented by two reports, including a substantive analysis of the consultations and mapping of the most vulnerable communities within the tsunami-affected population. Despite the reports\u2019 wide distribution, however, it was agreed that even more could have been done to ensure that information was used by policymakers.35 As a result of the thousands of complaints received during the people\u2019s consultations, United Nations support also was provided to the Human Rights Commission to establish Help Desks in each district to raise awareness among communities on their rights and entitlements and to follow up on grievances, along with an AidWatch project to allow beneficiaries to monitor aid and hold organisations accountable (see Chapter 4). Furthermore, the establishment of Citizens\u2019 Committees in selected divisions and districts ensured continued community engagement. How Women Regrouped Without quick action by women's organisations in Sri Lanka, the situation for women victims of violence following the tsunami would have remained hidden. Just one week after the disaster, five women's groups \u2013 Mothers and Daughters of Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka Women's NGO Forum, Women's Alliance for Peace, Women's Alliance for Peace and Democracy, and Action Network for Migrant Workers \u2013 completed fact-finding visits to a number of devastated areas. They reported incidents of rape, molestation and physical abuse of women and girls in temporary shelters and unsupervised rescue operations. Hospital and relief workers identified many more abusive acts, though no police reports had been filed. But women are much more than victims \u2013 they are key to recovery and reconstruction. Women are often better able to work across ethnic, religious and political lines, especially important in conflict areas such as northern and eastern Sri Lanka and Aceh. The NGO GROOTS International facilitated a weeklong learning exchange between women leaders from poor communities in Sri Lanka and India. This highlighted learning from practice in tsunami-hit villages, providing a platform to share initiatives and make plans for the future. Pavithra, secretary of Rana Arunalu Women\u2019s Development Society in Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, said, \"We hope to develop livelihood activities, strengthen women\u2019s societies with markets and financial institutions, and run community centres and projects with local government support.\u201d Noting this, Kasturi, a GROOTS trainer, remarked, \u201cMoratuwa women groups were not confident to start activities when we met them a year ago.

Particularly in the area of housing reconstruction, a number of organisations were committed to people\u2019s participation. \u201cWhere survivors participate from start to finish in the construction process, we end up with homes that people want, a design that suits their lifestyle and a location that allows them to continue earning a living,\u201d according to ActionAid\u2019s Ravi Pratap Singh.36 followed a two-pronged approach: \u2666 An owner-driven housing programme, where homeowners reconstruct/repair damaged houses on-site, \u2666 implement permanent housing projects on relocation sites for families who had lived in the coastal buffer zone The owner-driven housing has proven quicker and simpler, and ensures a higher level of community input as people have been able to express their cultural preferences and traditions in the design of their home. For example, a partnership between IFRC, UN-Habitat and the World Bank supported 24,000 households in A Damrivi counselling graduate (See Box 3.1) The government's permanent housing policy has with cash grants and technical assistance provided by government and development organisations A relocation housing programme, where government, donors and development organisations 51 52 rebuilding homes on their own land. Married couples were required to open a joint bank account and payments deposited there to promote women\u2019s economic security and increase their control over household assets. Owners could build the houses themselves or engage local contractors, which often was the choice of women- headed households. Funds were released based on owners reaching agreed milestones.37 \u201cWe found that implementing the owner-driven housing programme has been easier, because you are basically giving people cash to rebuild their own houses on their own foundations, in a thriving community,\u201d says Paul Emes, Chief of Delegation, IFRC Sri Lanka. \u201cFor the relocation housing programme, you have issues with moving, particularly coastal fishing communities into the middle of inland farming communities.\u201d But, notes IFRC\u2019s Patrick Fuller, \u201cAs soon as the local authorities provide a list of beneficiaries for a [relocation] housing site, a series of consultative meetings begins. \u2026 Families are involved in the planning of each site and are brought together with members of the host community to \u2026 [reduce] possible tensions between old and new residents.\u201d38 Still, it was not always easy to ensure community participation, Emes says: \u201cI think an unfortunate thing about [IFRC] not doing a transitional shelter programme here was that we sometimes missed engagement with beneficiaries of the relocation housing programme because they were in somebody else\u2019s transitional camp. In some cases, beneficiary lists weren\u2019t confirmed until the last minute. We must plan community engagement better, right from the start.\u201d Other NGOs too acknowledge mistakes that could have been avoided if a more participatory approach had been used. A joint report by Oxfam, CARE International and World Vision highlights the decision by Oxfam, taken in Colombo, to supply water filters to each family in various communities in Matara, without any consultation with the community or the local office. Water filters are uncommon and generally not used in the area, and most of those supplied remain unused. A key requirement for effective community participation was decentralising authority to the local levels. Both CARE and World Vision effectively decentralised authority and their field offices were able to best deal with the needs and demands of the tsunami affected people. Oxfam, on the other hand, found it more difficult to implement effective participation since many key decisions were being made back in Oxford, UK, rather than in the field.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "55ac8d61-61ae-49b5-af6b-9d25034f09a8": {"__data__": {"id_": "55ac8d61-61ae-49b5-af6b-9d25034f09a8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Tsunami Legacy: Innovation Breakthroughs and Change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "66531c8546368a4c574a8b9558b54708821d6df160f2642363a59ee3c13f9f3c"}, "2": {"node_id": "c994bc17-1cbb-45a4-ae80-085fe34809b9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "54e0ac7de2bd259bacd9b96875955f3e366a9d11306b2fd8b7518fb1c43e3171"}}, "hash": "c6f3c0bee4fa02d8837b5607f8e7baab5a89c612c07c679dd0b19cf8f7178921", "text": "Women helping to dig new boundary lines in Aceh 52 53 Meanwhile, beneficiaries of the owner-driven housing programmes organised themselves, often with the assistance of the implementing agency, to form Community Development Councils (CDCs) that supported community members throughout reconstruction.

Yet a community\u2019s knowledge base and skills are often crucial to managing projects or, in case of disaster, making the right decisions. Government, United Nations Agencies, IFRC and other NGOs alike therefore initiated a huge number of community-led projects and undertook the nation\u2019s first extensive community consultations, particularly in house reconstruction, livelihoods and disaster risk management. Island-level consultations in the project planning stage allowed communities to identify and authenticate beneficiaries, ensuring transparency and preventing community tensions. They also allowed the setting of realistic goals and timings, based on local capacities and priorities; this was crucial to facilitate community ownership. Land use plans were developed in consultation with communities, and in the process, community awareness was increased on better environmental protection, management of resources, and mitigation and for CDCs in their operations. A total of 135 communities were registered as CDCs by the government. 53 A new housing development in the Maldives 54 adaptation measures. Under one United Nations project, nearly 3,000 house owners were given the opportunity to decide how to fully repair or rebuild their houses; owners were directly provided with funding following damage surveys on 45 islands and were trained in construction themselves. Many people had specific ideas about the structure of their houses: an outdoor rather than an indoor kitchen, a veranda, or front and rear Measuring Recovery: TRIAMS The concept for a Tsunami Recovery Impact Assessment and Monitoring System (TRIAMS) was discussed and endorsed by the Global Consortium for Tsunami-Affected Countries at meetings in June and September 2005. The process was taken forward by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, with the support of the United Nations Office of the Special Envoy for Tsunami Recovery (OSE) led by former US President Bill Clinton. The purpose of the TRIAMS initiative has been to assist governments, aid agencies and affected populations in assessing and monitoring the rate and direction of recovery over the recovery phase. TRIAMS represented an important breakthrough by proposing one framework of core indicators through which to monitor progress and assess impacts across different countries and locales. The framework looks not just at infrastructure, but also social services, livelihoods and vital needs remaining from the relief phase. The core components of the TRIAMS process have included: output and impact indicators across the primary sectors of recovery; both quantitative and qualitative data on beneficiary perspectives; and additional qualitative data to help explain findings of key output and outcome indicators. The overall aim of the TRIAMS process was to ensure that governments, donors, NGOs, civil society and other stakeholders were adequately informed on the progress of the recovery efforts in the tsunami-affected areas, so that adjustments could be made to the assistance programs in order to address the un-met needs and the existing inequalities. All four countries have made great strides in collecting and analyzing data using the TRIAMS framework. In Aceh, for example, BRR and UNORC have jointly produced three comprehensive Tsunami Recovery Indicator Package (TRIP) reports, using TRIAMS as the roadmap. The reports, which can be downloaded at www.unorc.or.id, specifically make use of available government census, survey, sectoral data and data from other development partners, rather than undertaking entirely new and time-consuming assessments. The methodology aids expediency, and enhances local ownership of the data and the assessment process. A database has also been created that contains over 700 indicators. Entitled Acehinfo 3.0, the database now provides local government with a fundamental set of baseline information for planners and policymakers, and enables GIS maps to be produced using appropriate software. An additional step forward has been to draw attention to whether recovery interventions are addressing pre-existing inequalities (or exacerbating them) by looking at more disaggregated, sub-district data. In practice, this has proven challenging, as administrative data compilation mechanisms may be weaker than required, even in education and health sectors. In retrospect, it is clear that TRIAMS and other information tools and methods should have been available from the outset of the recovery process. With this in mind, partners are working to document TRIAMS lessons to contribute to guidelines for future post crisis recovery managers, including: \u2666 Recovery monitoring should be nationally owned, drawing on routine administrative data and surveys adapted to over-sample the affected region \u2666 Such data can be complemented by qualitative, beneficiary perspectives \u2666 Data preparedness is an essential part of emergency preparedness \u2666 It is helpful for", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ad9cb0d-ccc3-453a-9a2c-1de625018954": {"__data__": {"id_": "2ad9cb0d-ccc3-453a-9a2c-1de625018954", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Tsunami Legacy: Innovation Breakthroughs and Change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bf19a8a779d9d1e54911997b653dca8d0114253e53f4601f9a629af78602b1a9"}, "3": {"node_id": "eaf050b3-12f2-45e9-b3bb-9446489a04f9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dc0203b089678a3cda48b13537e06c454b8936fa2efd5d05854b2d56d0880471"}}, "hash": "7b51ec67c5cd29e7b16034d975e71137d7a2a59ac665ef6623ea14f33d8a5a57", "text": "there to be a single national/local authority responsible for overall recovery monitoring \u2666 A consolidated database can be extremely helpful, not only in analysis, but in managing the many issues relating to data availability \u2666 There needs to be a context in which data and analysis are shared, e.g. through reports, websites, database tools and reviews. \u2666 Re-planning needs to be responsive to the analysis Box 3.2 54 55 doors in line, etc. Further, women and youth often had different ideas than men about what was needed. UNDP and UN-Habitat jointly ensured that people were consulted at all stages of the project and that Island Development Committees managed reconstruction funds. Some homeowners topped up recovery grants with their own funds to build larger houses for their extended families. International agencies also provided supervisory support and monitoring to ensure that reconstructed houses met industry standards and regulations. Such an approach laid the foundation for the long-term sustainable recovery of the housing sector as a whole: The project reported a 98 percent overall success rate, with 90 percent of islanders feeling better empowered. However, this success did not come easily. It was more difficult at first to engage communities in disaster risk management awareness, given that many Maldivians saw the tsunami as a \u201cone-off\u201d event that would not recur. \u201cOne thing is that the people lose their focus really easily,\u201d cautions Fathima Nizam of the Maldivian NGO Care Society. \u201cJust two years after the tsunami, when I visited the islands to do community consultations, I asked a lot of people, \u2018How do you keep your food supply?\u2019 Most people buy packs of rice, flour and sugar that are not waterproof. During the tsunami, almost all the food supply in houses was damaged because these packs are usually stored on the floor. That is why I ask them, \u2018Do you still keep it that way?\u2019 And then they say, \u2018Yeah, we still keep it that way, but then, we have always been doing it like this.\u2019 \u201d But the Government and United Nations were persistent, even translating basic disaster risk management terminology into the local Dhivehi language. They also assisted island communities in developing community preparedness plans and, significantly, were able to conduct the first disaster simulation exercises in Maldives. Similarly, local organisations were included in numerous livelihoods projects. \u201cInvolving the local organisations A house constructed in partnership with the Community Recovery and Reconstruction Partnership (CRRP) in Kalmunai shows how individuals are adapting designs to include their own personal touches. 55 56 was a successful approach,\u201d says Raniya Sobir of UNDP Maldives. \u201cFor every single activity, we made sure that we had a local partner to work with, so in that way it was easier for us to communicate with the communities and mobilize them. At the same time, by engaging them in the tsunami recovery process, we are now seeing these organisations become stronger, and they are able to contribute to development activities. Now local \u2018Recovery-Plus-Plus\u2019: A Harmonious, Eco-Friendly Model Thailand also made it a priority to give communities a strong voice, by promoting their empowerment and strengthen people\u2019s capacities as a means to longer-term development of tsunami-affected communities. Local authorities were mandated to take the lead in many reconstruction efforts, ranging from repair of infrastructure to livelihood restoration and promotion of the local economy, and were supported to improve community consultation, including training to strengthen women\u2019s leadership and decision making. their own accord and at their own pace. Experience and facilitation skills of project staff and communities involved in grassroots development were key factors in building trust and a willingness to work alongside one another in a spirit of cooperation. One of the most successful such initiatives has been the UNDP-supported project to restore indigenous livelihoods in Koh Lanta, a unique and culturally diverse island district of 30,000 in the tsunami-affected Krabi province. Krabi blends the heritages of four ethnic groups: The Moken and Urak Lavoy, or \u201csea gypsies,\u201d and Muslims are seafaring peoples, earning their living from fishing, while the Thai Buddhist population tends to Traditional Houses in a Moken Village, Thailand bodies are approaching the donors on their own and mobilising funds.\u201d Flexibility by government and international organisations alike allowed grassroots initiatives to take place of 56 57 work on or own rubber plantations.

Both villages were able to resume full-scale fishing after they built some 350 boats themselves. \u201cJust to show you the synergy among the people, the sea gypsies had an agreement that they would rather that everybody got their boat before they launched to fish,\u201d recalls Brett Tan, UNDP Project Management Advisor for Koh Lanta. \u201cSo everybody waited until the last boat was done.\u201d Houses also were rebuilt with the help of local knowledge and consultation, although not by all organisations. Professor Opart Panya, evaluator Reconstruction in Thailand Consultations on Housing Design 57 58 for the Koh Lanta project, states that one NGO was \u201cpretty much building houses with the \u2018urban vision,\u2019 on the land and also very modern. But afterward, people said they couldn\u2019t live there. They have to live close to the sea.\u201d The sea gypsies, many of whom have been living for decades on public land without secure tenure and access to basic services, also faced complex problems of land rights and resettlement that made recovery more difficult. The government set up a high- level national committee on resolution of tsunami-related land issues, with UNDP supporting investigation of historical and cultural land rights for about 80 villages. Again showing people\u2019s participation, local residents and authorities were vigorous in negotiations with the committee, ultimately leading to success. In addition to restoring land and livelihoods, the project has striven to rebuild the Lanta community\u2019s spirit by promoting its distinctive heritages. This enabled the project to expand its scope, with local initiatives ranging from education to environmental management (see Box 3.3 for a culturally friendly approach in Sri Lanka). Villagers donated antiques and artefacts to renovate the community museum, and numerous cultural and spiritual innovations, such as employing indigenous religious ceremonies, helped revive community pride. For example, \u201cbefore the tsunami, the sea gypsies were prepared to cease to exist,\u201d according to Tan. \u201cTheir younger generation all got employment in the resorts and forgot about their traditional ways of fishing. And the elders had stopped singing [traditional music]. But then the tsunami came, and the tourists did not come for two years. The young people came back and started to appreciate their traditional ways, even though it gives them only a little money. They think this is more secure than the tourist money, which comes and goes. The older generation started singing again, and the younger generation joined in, and then the spirit came back.\u201d Communities are taking greater responsibility for management of natural resources as well. Water is scarce on Koh Lanta, so with support from UNDP and the Coca-Cola Company, four villages with the strongest community organisations were selected for a pilot with different types of water resources and water user groups. These included a series of check dams, a gravity-fed water system, a small-scale irrigation system, and artesian wells. Successes are being applied island-wide. Thus, in the case of Koh Lanta, building back better goes beyond relief and recovery, enabling local people to build community-based organisations rooted firmly in their unique cultural identities and rich natural environment. It\u2019s been a learning experience for all. Says Tan: \u201cWhen we started, we didn\u2019t come in as if we knew what we wanted to do.

Stringent deadlines and supply-driven policy making, while satisfying reporting requirements and a home public eager for results, do not always make for measured and efficient programming.

How was this done? Early on, leaders at BRR, the overarching recovery agency for Aceh and Nias, were aware that corruption could not simply be treated as a \u201ccrosscutting issue.\u201d In theory, such a designation is meant to raise an issue\u2019s prominence and urgency, but in practice it often means just another box to tick from a long list. Dr. Kuntoro Mangkusubroto, who has directed BRR throughout its mandate, explains: \u201cWe see the fight against corruption in Aceh and Nias as advancing Indonesia\u2019s wider struggle against corruption. \u2026 We believe firmly that corruption both robs disaster victims of the support they need and also undermines ongoing and future support from generous external supporters. In this regard, corruption is both morally wrong and undermines programme success. Corruption does not grease the wheels: It is a spanner in the works.\u201d Kevin Evans agrees. A Special Advisor to the BRR Director, Evans says, \u201cThe issue of corruption wasn\u2019t seen as a target, but as a core threat. Rather than thinking that people would behave themselves since it was a disaster, or pretending corruption didn\u2019t exist, we asked ourselves what were the key threats to reconstruction.\u201d Evans continues, \u201cFirst would be another tsunami. Second would be a recommencement of the conflict. Third was corruption. There was not much we could do about the first issue \u2013 it is beyond anybody\u2019s control. The second was beyond the authority and mandate of BRR. But on corruption, we could set the parameters and have an impact.\u201d 62 With the media spotlight on Aceh, the fourth-poorest province in Indonesia, the pressure to succeed in recovery was huge. The main pressure for the government , however, was the fact that the world had displayed enormous generosity and goodwill, and this was a rare opportunity to build back better and allow some good to come from the tragedy. What a waste it would be, then, if the success of these efforts was dogged by corruption. In all, a more transparent, accountable process is less easy to corrupt, making sure agencies are kept on their toes, and several levels of mechanisms were put in place. First, BRR was set up, with Pak Kuntoro insisting on designing the organisation himself. Because part of BRR\u2019s mandate was to ensure coordination and strong leadership, this, along with its authority and autonomy bestowed through legislation, allowed it to tackle corruption well. From the beginning, it set out to pay BRR employees competitive salaries to make sure the agency could recruit the best and brightest and to break the long established pattern of civil service remuneration based upon top-ups, stipends and annuities. BRR employees are paid a single solid income with no availability of discretionary top-ups and also with unambiguous prohibitions on accepting \u201cgifts\u201d. One further impact was that unlike many other reconstruction locations where civil servants may be \u201cpoached\u201d by the incoming international agencies, BRR did not suffer a \u201cbrain drain\u201d to these agencies. Tracking of funds, where they are coming from and where they are going, also is essential. To track all \u201coff- budget\u201d funds, or those not channelled through the Government \u2013 which accounted for over half of funds received \u2013 BRR developed a prize-winning comprehensive information management system. The system was comprised of the online Recovery Aceh-Nias Database (RAND, http://rand.brr.go.id/RAND/) and, later, the Housing Geospatial Database. Regular meeting for project approval ensured that project duplication was minimised and accountability maximized 62 63 All agencies involved in tsunami recovery were required to register with BRR, set up an account on RAND and regularly update data on funds committed and disbursed. \u201cOn-budget\u201d funds42 were tracked by a special BRR department and the Ministry of Finance through SmartPro, a software similar to RAND but not yet available online.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "16349768-008a-47e3-ab62-e4271b38cbf4": {"__data__": {"id_": "16349768-008a-47e3-ab62-e4271b38cbf4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Tsunami Legacy: Innovation Breakthroughs and Change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a57f49419cfa791bb20ba73f506b6c9e458dbca6b4a2b9103fa6df3c7ccc178e"}, "2": {"node_id": "d5fa2e2c-5d09-4ffc-96cd-97acab0cbcb5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "be5f6c97b776319411767b5201365fb9a25127875ffa094f1ac62c97b9dd4d04"}}, "hash": "cc2c7238a567d4efa37fde0604a6967fd327ebf42b0406f950114319fa4e36f1", "text": "The decision to create RAND, an innovation available to anyone with Internet access, was made early on and it has served as the major source for information and reports on donor funded reconstruction activities: \u201cWe needed something that was very transparent so anyone in the world, including mums and dads in London, could use it,\u201d says SZM Shariful Islam, Aid Coordination Advisor of UNORC. \u201cIt is also a useful tool to pinpoint gaps and overlaps to policymakers.

Yet both Indonesia\u2019s RAND and DADs used in Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand faced the challenge of all countries trying to improve accountability \u2013 getting quick, comprehensive and sufficiently detailed inputs from NGOs and development agencies (see Box 4.1). \u201cWe ended up with \u2018DAD-plus\u2019, as significant customisation was done for meeting the objectives and requirements of BRR, including the project concept note approval and key performance indicators monitoring mechanisms\u201d Islam recalls. \u201cBut it was too much for the capacity of many agencies to comply with the requirements. There was a slow pick-up for some time.\u201d The database faced numerous challenges and fierce criticism. Indeed, one of the main criticisms, from World Bank and NGOs, among others, was that because each agency was responsible for updating its own entries, inaccurate data or misrepresentations of activities might be included. In the beginning, only about 33 percent of organizations on RAND were updating their accounts. Data entry errors and other factors cost RAND credibility for providing a timely, accurate picture; in 2006, for example, it did not capture even half of recovery efforts in Aceh and Nias. Box 4.1 The Challenges of Capturing Reliable Data With large-scale reconstruction activities after the tsunami, all tsunami-affected countries were in need of information systems through which everyone (Government, international organisations, donors, NGOs, media and beneficiaries) could track tsunami funds and ascertain the results of projects. UNDP, in partnership with ADB, worked to support governments across the region in customising the existing Development Assistance Database (DAD), which is a general aid information management system to track aid given for a multitude of purpose, both for the long-term and for short term emergencies. However, being a \u2018commercial off-the-shelf\u2019 tool, customization was required so it met each country\u2019s needs after the tsunami. In Indonesia, the changes were deepest and factored in how BRR worked and its accountability agenda. While almost US$8 billion of assistance was tracked, the customized systems were, as one observer from Maldives put it, \u201chigh-tech, but also high-maintenance.\u201d A major challenge facing all countries trying to improve accountability was achieving the cooperation of all parties to provide accurate, updated tracking of tsunami assistance online. Moreover, sometimes self-reporting by development agencies fell short. As a result, in Sri Lanka, for example, despite strong Government efforts to encourage development organizations to report expenditures, the system apparently had not captured between US$500 million and $1 billion as of March 2006, including funds already disbursed. Agencies struggled to break their contributions down by district. To go beyond a database and ensure systems really help lock in improved accountability, according to the Maldives observer, \u201cyou need a senior, seasoned person,\u201d with a clear vision of how the various pieces of the puzzle fit together. channelled through the government, meanwhile, was a very potent tool the government created to 63 64 At the same time, others such as Alex Schein, Chief of Party of Save the Children\u2019s Aceh office, noted that RAND was a web-based system at a time when many organisations were not yet on the web. \u201cIt was not user- friendly,\u201d Schein recalls. \u201cIt was difficult to make sense of it, and some indicators were valid for some NGOs but not all, like trying to compare apples to oranges.\u201d In early 2007, then, it was a make-or-break point for the system. Together, BRR and UNORC analysed various weaknesses and decided it was crucial to ensure that the database had sustainable support, so that it could serve its purpose of being a project-based43, real-time tool tied directly into the workflow, without waiting for reports to be produced. Now, by being flexible and persistent, BRR has managed to get nearly all agencies updating their RAND data, which gives the database meaning.

BRR established an Outreach Team, located at a drop-in centre in Banda Aceh, which is available for troubleshooting and to teach usage of RAND. The Outreach Team provided customised reports as requested by donors, other partners and BRR; this could also easily be done by users online. Thus, outreach not only enabled organisations to get on RAND, but also kept them on it, providing regular updates. Simple improvements such as a crackdown on data entry errors likewise went a long way toward helping RAND regain credibility. Screenshot of RAN Database showing recovery projects according to implementing partner 64 65 Eventually, all this helped RAND win the Innovative Government Technology Award in the Information Management category at the 2008 FutureGov Summit, the top annual forum involving all well-known international technology providers, who display their public-service best practices to the international community. RAND was chosen out of 450 nominations from 15 countries, including developed nations across the region. It was recognised as an innovative model of information management that has successfully promoted improvement in public services, modernisation of government administration and efficiency of public sector management. A Snapshot of Reconstruction, Available to All The other information system in Aceh and Nias \u2013 and one also with great potential \u2013 is the Housing Geospatial Database (HGD). As of October 2008, the number of houses built for the tsunami recovery in Indonesia had reached nearly 119,000. With such a high number of physical structures, answering even simple questions \u2013 Who built what? Where? Who owns the new house? \u2013 is not as easy as it may seem. A comprehensive information system was needed, capable of capturing and recording all information systematically. Enter the HGD, a unique tool that enables anyone interested in Indonesia\u2019s reconstruction to obtain unprecedented access to the way it has unfolded. A high school student in Kentucky who may have donated US$10 in 2005 to the American Red Cross, for example, will now be able to search online for all houses built by the IFRC in Aceh and Nias and view for herself the finished product \u2013 and its specifications. So how does it work? For a tour of the database, Eddie Daradjat begins with a normal map of Aceh, colour- coded by the area, the implementing agency, and the location of the houses. All this information is first gathered from RAND, verified by field teams working even in remote areas, then digitally mapped for GPS coordinates, followed by the building of a text database. Unlike the RAND, linked to real- time information, the \u201csurvey-based\u201d HGD provides a snapshot of housing Screenshot of the HGD\u2014An overview of Aceh Screenshot of the HGD\u2014zoomed in to the village level 65 66 sector reconstruction, since verifying and digitally mapping the vast amount of information takes a long time. Yet for ensuring transparency and accountability, both processes are necessary and complement each other.44 That makes this combined information system one of the most comprehensive and \u201cleak-proof\u201d in reconstruction and development work. If you want to take a closer look at a particular community or town on HGD, simply zoom in closer to get a better view. Keep zooming, and you\u2019ll find yourself at the neighbourhood level and, eventually, right down to an individual house, complete with a picture of the building, its GPS coordinates, the name of the house\u2019s present owner and the building contractor, as well as the organisation that helped build it. After initially being housed on BRR\u2019s intranet, the HGD is now being migrated to the web. Eventually, the system was merged with BRR\u2019s new database for all other assets \u2013 bridges, hospitals, schools and roads \u2013 which was also created in much the same way as the HGD. A complete online catalogue ensures an efficient handover of assets as part of BRR\u2019s exit strategy \u2013 and serves as another critical step toward achieving accountability and transparency in post-tsunami Aceh and Nias. Many believe that the HGD can be used as a model for other governments to create their own asset management systems. Performance Indicators and \u2018Integrity Pacts\u2019 The information management system incorporates a number of mechanisms to ensure accountability and transparency to BRR from development partners, with reduced corruption. The swift and comprehensive project approval mechanism, for example, incorporated an innovative Project Concept Note to enhance accountability, and reduce duplication in recovery projects (see Chapter 1). In addition, more than 200 key performance indicators were identified \u2013 numbers of schools, houses and bridges rebuilt, number of loans and livestock provided, women\u2019s participation, areas of mangroves restored \u2013", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "46550fe3-03d8-4c71-b484-26e2ffdc0df8": {"__data__": {"id_": "46550fe3-03d8-4c71-b484-26e2ffdc0df8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Tsunami Legacy: Innovation Breakthroughs and Change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "be352446372e525e4034218bc65fe0dc5cb3c3f551cee43fa3e45952614bedb3"}, "3": {"node_id": "d99b319e-5778-47cd-a1f5-977136d69250", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dce15c4c4fc75b7f1888cf5b2bb3467cc9789fbc650954c21a11e3a26187aa89"}}, "hash": "adf76a2ee32f6b07f4451c8a1d37f03b60d11de445469e5cd295a2d578886b12", "text": "that could be used by donors to show BRR and beneficiaries how well the funds were being used, similar to IFRC\u2019s TRIAMS (see box 3.2) system.

Furthermore, accountability from BRR to beneficiaries, the Government and donors also was a priority \u2013 and something new. For the first time, accountability to beneficiaries was treated on a par with that to donors. Save the Children\u2019s Alex Schein acknowledges this as a welcome change, declaring, \u201cIt has made immense improvements to aid effectiveness.\u201d BRR\u2019s accountability was first evident in the \u201cintegrity pact\u201d applied to each of its staff, an innovation later adopted by at least two leading State -owned companies, Telkom and Pertamina. Anti-Corruption Unit Established BRR also became the first Government agency to have an autonomous Anti-Corruption Unit, known as SAK, set up to work with other Government institutions, international institutions like the World Bank, and civil society organisations such as Transparency International Indonesia in carrying out its primary objectives of prevention, investigation and education. Since its inception in September 2005, SAK has received 1,530 confidential complaints. Of these, more than half related to violations of procurement processes for goods and services, while another 12 percent directly charged corruption or violations of the integrity pact. Critically, while SAK is an internal body of BRR, it also is autonomous, with authority to move freely throughout all divisions and monitor operations. This bold move has proven most useful in moving the anti-corruption agenda forward. In addition, the Corruption Eradication Commission, normally part of the central Government, for the first time set up a field office in Banda Aceh at the request of BRR. SAK worked with the Commission on oversight as well as public education. If SAK was not convinced that a case did not involve corruption, it would send it to the Commission for further investigation. SAK also developed links with other Government institutions such as the Fair Business Practices Supervisory Commission, local governments and police. It likewise worked with the central Financial and Development Supervisory Agency (BPKP), with more than 50 BPKP staff seconded to BRR as part of a dedicated national Treasury representative office. Accountability to Women Without sound information based on gender-specific data, programming for recovery \u2013 and hence, accountability \u2013 may not be as inclusive as intended or desired. Established in Sri Lanka, the Batticaloa Women\u2019s Disaster Management Coalition, or Gender Watch, arose along with a larger network of women\u2019s groups known as the Coalition to Assist Tsunami-Affected Women. In addition to providing a space for women to discuss their experiences, which led to awareness about rights as well as opportunities for collective action, it formed a network of women\u2019s organizations that provided legitimacy to question and challenge State officials and other agencies when women\u2019s rights were violated. In addition, a representative was present at all planning meetings of the post-tsunami psychosocial and protection task force under the district Government, and could raise concerns. The National Committee of Women, also in Sri Lanka, undertook a survey in early 2005 with UNIFEM support, involving more than 53,500 households and eliciting information on women\u2019s pre-tsunami livelihoods, psychological effects of the disaster and preliminary data on gender-based violence. Differential impacts were documented, including disparities in loss of life among women, especially women likely to have young children; obstacles to economic recovery faced by women; conditions facing female-headed households, and other concerns. Lastly, the IFRC in Sri Lanka also has made gender a key dimension of its recovery work, establishing a gender working group to increase awareness and accountability to women. Moving beyond the baseline of sex-specific data in programme planning and management, gender indicators and reporting mechanisms are being developed to strengthen this aspect of the organization\u2019s culture.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d99b319e-5778-47cd-a1f5-977136d69250": {"__data__": {"id_": "d99b319e-5778-47cd-a1f5-977136d69250", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Tsunami Legacy: Innovation Breakthroughs and Change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "be352446372e525e4034218bc65fe0dc5cb3c3f551cee43fa3e45952614bedb3"}, "2": {"node_id": "46550fe3-03d8-4c71-b484-26e2ffdc0df8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "adf76a2ee32f6b07f4451c8a1d37f03b60d11de445469e5cd295a2d578886b12"}}, "hash": "dce15c4c4fc75b7f1888cf5b2bb3467cc9789fbc650954c21a11e3a26187aa89", "text": "Box 4.2 67 68 But the role of SAK was not only to \u201cfind corruptors,\u201d since this approach could not be sustained, ignoring as it does the structural problems that often emerge within an organisation.

Other government agencies are also beginning to adopt SAK type approaches to raise their own internal standards of integrity and to prevent corruption. Key to the potential success of these initiatives will be the ongoing effectiveness of the national Corruption Eradication Commission as the key threat against corrupt practices. Now, communities themselves have begun to overtly protest about corrupt practices exposed in public life \u2013 a very positive development \u2013 and consider acts of corruption a social disgrace. Through the continued support of the public, religious leaders, civil society and mass media, SAK officials feel their efforts has helped to build and mobilise an effective anti-corruption movement. Importantly, to ensure needs-based responsiveness, grievance and complaints handling mechanisms also were put in place with regard to recovery projects, as well as in RAND and HGD. These covered not only corruption and fraud or other violations, but also poor quality of goods and work. When projects address several sectors and multiple groups in a complex environment \u2013 such as Aceh\u2019s post-conflict recovery, combined with a post- tsunami setting \u2013 such mechanisms swiftly give clear notice of problems and provide information on the quality of a project\u2019s design and implementation. Realising this, many NGOs, including Muslim Aid and Oxfam, set up their own grievance reporting and redressal mechanisms. Following complaints by beneficiaries regarding house design, Oxfam began the retro-fitting of many of the houses they had built. All this, ultimately, underpins accountability to beneficiaries. In addition to SAK, an independent Supervisory Board of BRR known as Dewan Pengawas, comprising leaders of various NGOs, universities and other leading institutions, addressed community grievances and provided oversight of recovery activities. In 2005, the immediate aftermath of the tsunami, the largest number of People\u2019s Consultation in Sri Lanka 68 69 complaints was from the education and health sectors, with a significant proportion also from agriculture and natural resources management. Complaints for all \u201con-budget\u201d projects were discussed in biweekly meetings of BRR, followed by a field visit, a meeting with the deputy in the relevant agency, and a response. Although BRR had its own complaints mechanism for on-budget projects, it developed sector-specific grievance mechanisms in conjunction with ADB for its Earthquake and Tsunami Emergency Support Project, initiated in April 2005. These grievance mechanisms, operating at different levels, incorporated community consultations and field visits. Help Desks and Community Monitoring In Sri Lanka, according to the Report on People\u2019s Consultations on Post-Tsunami Relief, Reconstruction and Rehabilitation,45 \u201cthe affected communities are keen on seeing more transparent delivery mechanisms. They propose establishing mechanisms that won\u2019t make them vulnerable to discrimination at the hands of individuals, and where beneficiary rights, entitlements and benefits are accessible and made public.\u201d The establishment of an effective complaint mechanism through Help Desks as a response to the people\u2019s consultations on recovery (see Chapter 3) was a particular breakthrough. Help Desks were set up in tsunami- affected areas to address human rights-related complaints, many of them from women. Working with the Disaster Relief Monitoring Unit (DRMU) of the Human Rights Commission, the Help Desks investigated complaints and recommended how to address them. The public could question eligibility for assistance, report potential cases of corruption, or file a complaint. The Help Desks raised communities\u2019 awareness on human rights entitlements, as well as liaised with community groups, NGOs and Government officials to promote human right principles.46 By October 2006, the DRMU had received 17,000 complaints and successfully resolved most.47 \u201cWhen people complained about a certain international non-Government organization, we quite often ended up mediating between the INGO and the community,\u201d a DRMU official recalled. \u201cThe preferred solution, of 69 70 course, is for the INGO to resolve the problem itself. But if not, the DRMU does not hesitate to make the charges public in the media.\u201d For its part, UNDP Sri Lanka set up an AidWatch initiative to enable communities to monitor projects. Collectives of housing beneficiaries were trained on rights with regard to development activities, along with being provided with advocacy and negotiations skills. These groups also were brought into contact with project field staff, local authorities and Human Rights Commission representatives. Such vital linkages contributed to increasing responsibility and accountability toward the community and laid groundwork for continued networking.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a86cf4ab-528f-4cce-be0f-158b36266750": {"__data__": {"id_": "a86cf4ab-528f-4cce-be0f-158b36266750", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Tsunami Legacy: Innovation Breakthroughs and Change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change", "Author":
