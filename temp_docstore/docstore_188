Anthropogenic methane: Methane emissions derived from human activities. Anthropogenic emissions sources include coal mining, agricultural practices, wastewater treatment, certain industrial processes, and oil and gas systems, among others. Baseline/reference: The state against which change is measured. In the context of climate change transformation pathways, the term \u2018baseline scenarios\u2019 refers to scenarios based on the assumption that no mitigation policies or measures will be implemented beyond those already in force and/or legislated or planned to be adopted. Baseline scenarios are not intended to be predictions of the future, but rather counterfactual constructions that can serve to highlight the level of emissions that would occur without further policy efforts. Typically, baseline scenarios are compared to mitigation scenarios that are constructed to meet different goals for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, atmospheric concentrations or temperature change. The term \u2018baseline scenario\u2019 is used interchangeably with \u2018reference scenario\u2019 and \u2018no-policy scenario\u2019. Carbon border adjustment mechanisms: Mechanisms that act to equalize the price of carbon between domestic products and imports, to eliminate financial incentives to relocate production outside regions with strong climate controls. Carbon dioxide emission budget (or carbon budget): For a given temperature rise limit, for example a 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C long-term limit, the corresponding carbon budget reflects the total amount of carbon emissions that can be emitted for temperatures to stay below that limit. Stated differently, a carbon budget is the area under a carbon dioxide (CO2) emission trajectory that satisfies assumptions about limits on cumulative emissions estimated to avoid a certain level of global mean surface temperature rise. Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e): A way to place emissions of various radiative forcing agents on a common footing by accounting for their effect on the climate. It describes, for a given mixture and amount GHGs, the amount of CO2 that would have the same global warming ability, when measured over a specified time period. For the purpose of this report, GHG emissions (unless otherwise specified) are the sum of the basket of GHGs listed in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol, expressed as CO2e assuming a 100-year global warming potential. Carbon markets: A term for a carbon trading system through which countries may buy or sell units of GHG emissions in an effort to meet their national limits on emissions, either under the Kyoto Protocol or under other agreements, such as that among member States of the European Union. The term comes from the fact that carbon dioxide is the predominant GHG, and other gases are measured in units called carbon dioxide equivalents. Carbon neutrality: Is achieved when an actor\u2019s net contribution to global CO2 emissions is zero. Any CO2 emissions attributable to an actor\u2019s activities are fully compensated by CO2 reductions or removals exclusively claimed by the actor, irrespective of the time period or the relative magnitude of emissions and removals involved. Carbon offset: See Offset. Carbon price: The price for a voided or released CO2 or CO2e emissions. This may refer to the rate of a carbon tax, or the price of emission permits. In many models used to assess the economic costs of mitigation, carbon prices are used as a proxy to represent the level of effort in mitigation policies. Conditional nationally determined contribution: A conditional nationally determined contribution (NDC \u2013 see below) proposed by some countries that is contingent on a range of possible conditions, such as the ability of national legislatures to enact the necessary laws, ambitious action from other countries, realization of finance and technical support, or other factors. Conference of the Parties (COP): The supreme body of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It currently meets once a year to review the UNFCCC\u2019s progress.

For example, emissions reduction credits from a country might be sold to another country, while those reductions are still counted towards achievement of the NDC in the country where the credits originated. Emission pathway: The trajectory of annual GHG emissions over time. Emissions trading: A market-based instrument used to limit emissions. The environmental objective or sum of total allowed emissions is expressed as an emissions cap. The cap is divided in tradable emission permits that are allocated \u2013 either by auctioning or handing out for free \u2013 to entities within the jurisdiction of the trading scheme. Entities need to surrender emission permits equal to the amount of their emissions (e.g. tons of CO2). An entity may sell excess permits. Trading schemes may occur at the intra-company, domestic or international level, and may apply to CO2, other GHGs, or other substances. Emissions trading is also one of the mechanisms specified under the Kyoto Protocol. Financial system: A financial system is a set of global, regional or firm-specific institutions and practices used to facilitate the exchange of funds. Financial systems can be organized using market principles, central planning, or a hybrid of both. Institutions within a financial system include everything from banks, to stock exchanges, to government treasuries. Food security: A situation that exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. Food systems: Food systems are the public policy decisions, the national and global systems (including production, farming, processing and global supply chains), and the individuals and groups (public and private), that influence the quantity and quality of food available for all. Global warming potential: An index representing the combined effect of the differing times GHGs remain in the atmosphere and their relative effectiveness in absorbing outgoing infrared radiation. Greenhouse gases (GHGs): The atmospheric gases responsible for causing global warming and climatic change. The major GHGs are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Less prevalent, but very powerful, GHGs include hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). Greenhouse gas removal: Withdrawal of a GHG and/or a precursor from the atmosphere by a sink. Industrial processes and products use (IPPU): The industrial processes and product use (IPPU) sector covers GHG emissions resulting from various industrial activities that produce emissions, that are not the direct result of energy consumed during the manufacturing process and the use of man-made GHGs in products. Integrated assessment models: Models that seek to combine knowledge from multiple disciplines in the form of equations and/or algorithms, in order to explore complex environmental problems. As such, they describe the full chain of climate change, from production of GHGs to atmospheric responses. This necessarily includes relevant links and feedbacks between socioeconomic and biophysical processes. Intended nationally determined contribution: Intended NDCs are submissions from countries describing the national actions that they intend to take to reach the Paris Agreement\u2019s long-term temperature goal of limiting warming to well below 2\u00b0C. Once a country has ratified the Paris Agreement, its intended NDC is automatically converted to its NDC, unless it chooses to further update it. Kyoto Protocol: An international agreement signed in 1997 and which came into force in 2005, standing on its own, and requiring separate ratification by governments, but linked to the UNFCCC. The Kyoto Protocol, among other things, sets binding targets for the reduction of GHG emissions by industrialized countries Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF): A GHG inventory sector that covers emissions and removals of GHGs resulting from direct human-induced land use, land- use change and forestry activities. Least-cost pathway: Least-cost pathway scenarios identify the least expensive combination of mitigation options to fulfil a specific climate target. A least-cost scenario is based on the premise that, if an overarching climate objective is set, society wants to achieve this at the lowest possible cost over time. It also assumes that global actions start at the base year of model simulations (usually close to the current year) and are implemented following a cost-optimal (cost-efficient) sharing of the mitigation burden between current and future generations, depending on the social discount rate.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "023e4bfa-f26e-4c6e-8411-d01f76695c5d": {"__data__": {"id_": "023e4bfa-f26e-4c6e-8411-d01f76695c5d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cd83024793cef03cb1a33ec38f4d6d87c403a5f50893236902ab6d22c6b11fd1"}, "2": {"node_id": "9407a6b7-a3fa-4c39-af86-e2ecfaa07e97", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c9f91692bc1bce4a52cf643951cf23cf5819df950915abcd6de36812882ca522"}}, "hash": "aa25dbdb7aaa54889d9f016b3d2a7400905c9a962aa25eb99c5de10ed901510a", "text": "Likely chance: A likelihood greater than 66 per cent chance.

Examples include using fossil fuels more efficiently for industrial processes or electricity generation, switching to solar energy or wind power, improving the insulation of buildings, and expanding forests and other \u2018sinks\u2019 to remove greater amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere. Nationally determined contribution (NDC): Submissions by countries that have ratified the Paris Agreement which presents their national efforts to reach the Paris Agreement\u2019s long-term temperature goal of limiting warming to well below 2\u00b0C. New or updated NDCs are to be submitted in 2020 and every five years thereafter. NDCs thus represent a country\u2019s current ambition or target for reducing emissions nationally. Offset: In climate policy, a unit of CO2e emissions that is reduced, avoided or sequestered to compensate for emissions occurring elsewhere. Purchasing power parity: A measurement that economists use to compare the spending power between two or more nations. Scenario: A description of how the future may unfold based on \u2018if-then\u2019 propositions. Scenarios typically include an initial socioeconomic situation and a description of the key driving forces and future changes in emissions, temperatures, or other climate change-related variables. S-curve: Adoption of new technologies often follows an S-curve trajectory. Under an S-curve, growth follows a non- linear pattern in which the curve initially increases slowly, before accelerating rapidly to a faster linear growth rate. As the variable approaches a new saturation point, the growth rate decelerates until a steady state is reached. Source: Any process, activity or mechanism that releases a GHG, an aerosol or a precursor of a GHG or aerosol into the atmosphere. XV Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window Foreword Foreword Every year, the negative impacts of climate change become more intense. Every year, they bring more misery and pain to hundreds of millions of people across the globe. Every year, they become more a problem of the here and now, as well as a warning of tougher consequences to come. We are in a climate emergency. And still, as UNEP\u2019s Emissions Gap Report 2022 shows, nations procrastinate. Since COP26 in Glasgow in 2021, new and updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) have barely impacted the temperatures we can expect to see at the end of this century. This year\u2019s report tells us that unconditional NDCs point to a 2.6\u00b0C increase in temperatures by 2100, far beyond the goals of the Paris Agreement. Existing policies point to a 2.8\u00b0C increase, highlighting a gap between national commitments and the efforts to enact those commitments. In the best- case scenario, full implementation of conditional NDCs, plus additional net zero commitments, point to a 1.8\u00b0C rise. However, this scenario is currently not credible. To get on track to limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C, we would need to cut 45 per cent off current greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. For 2\u00b0C, we would need to cut 30 per cent. A stepwise approach is no longer an option. We need system-wide transformation. This report tells us how to go about such a transformation. It looks in-depth at the changes needed in electricity supply, industry, transport, buildings and food systems. It looks at how to reform financial systems so that these urgent transformations can be adequately financed. Is it a tall order to transform our systems in just eight years? Yes. Can we reduce greenhouse gas emissions by so much in that timeframe? Perhaps not. But we must try. Every fraction of a degree matters: to vulnerable communities, to species and ecosystems, and to every one of us. Most importantly, we will still be setting up a carbon-neutral future: one that will allow us to bring down temperature overshoots and deliver other benefits, like clean air. The world is facing other crises. We must deal with them. But let us remember that they also offer opportunities to reform our global economy. We have missed the opportunity to invest in a low-carbon recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, we are in danger of missing the opportunity to boost clean and efficient energy as a response to the energy crisis. Instead of missing such opportunities, we must capitalize on them with confidence.

Since the twenty-sixth United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP 26), there has been very limited progress in reducing the immense emissions gap for 2030, the gap between the emissions reductions promised and the emissions reductions needed to achieve the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement, illustrated in the following: \u25b6 Countries\u2019 new and updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) submitted since COP 26 reduce projected global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2030 by only 0.5 gigatons of CO2 equivalent (GtCO2e), compared with emissions projections based on mitigation pledges at the time of COP 26. \u25b6 Countries are off track to achieve even the globally highly insufficient NDCs. Global GHG emissions in 2030 based on current policies are estimated at 58 GtCO2e. The implementation gap in 2030 between this number and NDCs is about 3 GtCO2e for the unconditional NDCs, and 6 GtCO2e for the conditional NDCs. \u25b6 The emissions gap in 2030 is 15 GtCO2e annually for a 2\u00b0C pathway and 23 GtCO2e for a 1.5\u00b0C pathway. This assumes full implementation of the unconditional NDCs, and is for a 66 per cent chance of staying below the stated temperature limit. If, in addition, the conditional NDCs are fully implemented, each of these gaps is reduced by about 3 GtCO2e. \u25b6 Policies currently in place with no additional action are projected to result in global warming of 2.8\u00b0C over the twenty-first century. Implementation of unconditional and conditional NDC scenarios reduce this to 2.6\u00b0C and 2.4\u00b0C respectively. \u25b6 To get on track for limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C, global annual GHG emissions must be reduced by 45 per cent compared with emissions projections under policies currently in place in just eight years, and they must continue to decline rapidly after 2030, to avoid exhausting the limited remaining atmospheric carbon budget. As these headline findings illustrate, incremental change is no longer an option: broad-based economy-wide transformations are required to avoid closing the window of opportunity to limit global warming to well below 2\u00b0C, preferably 1.5\u00b0C. Every fraction of a degree matters. At COP 26 last year, this dire situation was recognized, and countries were called upon to \u201crevisit and strengthen\u201d their 2030 targets by the end of 2022. Consequently, a key question for this edition of the Emissions Gap Report is, what progress has been made in ambition and action since COP 26, and how can the necessary transformations be initiated and accelerated? The report considers transformations required in the sectors of electricity supply, industry, transport and buildings. It furthermore investigates cross-cutting systemic transformations of food systems and the financial system, illustrating that there is immense potential to reduce emissions beyond current mitigation pledges. The climate crisis is part of the triple planetary crisis of climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss. This year, the world is witnessing compounding energy, food and cost of living crises, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, all of which are causing immense human suffering. Several methodological improvements and updates have been made this year to improve the estimates and ensure consistency across the chapters of this report. These changes, along with their implications for the interpretation of the report results, are described in detail in the report chapters and online appendices. However, it is important to note that these improvements imply that the estimates presented are not directly comparable to those of previous reports. 2. Global GHG emissions could set a new record in 2021 Estimates of land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) are currently only available up to 2020, limiting our analysis of total global GHG emissions for 2021. However, global GHG emissions for 2021, excluding LULUCF, are preliminarily estimated at 52.8 GtCO2e, a slight increase compared to 2019, suggesting that total global GHG emissions in 2021 will be similar to or even break the record 2019 levels (figure ES.1). This confirms earlier findings that the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic led to an unprecedented but short-lived reduction in global emissions. Total global GHG emissions dropped 4.7 per cent from 2019 to 2020. This decline was driven by a sharp decline in CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry of 5.6 per cent in 2020.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9a6795a1-8e97-4500-a6ed-911d6a6b4912": {"__data__": {"id_": "9a6795a1-8e97-4500-a6ed-911d6a6b4912", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eb4fd101533c0e8e46f5f7de08b4a4991182228b05b88083a02831cd3d3c6d24"}, "2": {"node_id": "ef462e9b-6e85-42e0-aca7-94e2813c0ddb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "652c21e81bbc7ce4a2f232bea3d55a12fe6077ed520de3a11c7f99bcf82ac11c"}}, "hash": "cc486604716e69eb02f9529195db6a2d83507d95f60f36cdc65d4742cace298e", "text": "However, CO2 emissions rebounded to 2019 levels in 2021, with global coal emissions exceeding 2019 levels.

Between 2010 and 2019, average annual growth was 1.1 per cent per year, compared to 2.6 per cent per year between 2000 and 2009. Thirty-five countries accounting for about 10 per cent of global emissions have peaked in CO2 and other GHG emissions, but their reductions have been outweighed by global emissions growth elsewhere. Estimates of LULUCF emissions and sinks are substantial, but also deeply uncertain. Based on national inventories, the LULUCF sector was a net sink in 17 of the G20 member States in 2020, including in China, the United States of America, India, the EU27 and the Russian Federation. GHG emissions excluding LULUCF in these countries are therefore higher, by as much as 33 per cent in the Russian Federation, 17 per cent in the United States of America, 9 per cent in India, and about 8 per cent in China and in the EU27. By contrast, the LULUCF sector is a net emitter in Indonesia and Brazil, accounting for 44 per cent and 22 per cent of their emissions respectively. 3. GHG emissions are highly uneven across regions, countries and households The top seven emitters (China, the EU27, India, Indonesia, Brazil, the Russian Federation and the United States of America) plus international transport accounted for 55 per cent of global GHG emissions in 2020 (figure ES.1). Collectively, G20 members are responsible for 75 per cent of global GHG emissions. Per capita emissions vary greatly across countries (figure ES.1). World average per capita GHG emissions (including LULUCF) were 6.3 tons of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) in 2020. The United States of America remains far above this level at 14 tCO2e, followed by 13 tCO2e in the Russian Federation, 9.7 tCO2e in China, about 7.5 tCO2e in Brazil and Indonesia, and 7.2 tCO2e in the European Union. India remains far below the world average at 2.4 tCO2e. On average, least developed countries emit 2.3 tCO2e per capita annually.

When emissions associated with both household consumption and public and private investments are allocated to households, and households are ranked by GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF), the bottom 50 per cent emit on average 1.6 tCO2e/capita and contribute 12 per cent of the global total, whereas the top 1 per cent emit on average 110 tCO2e/capita and contribute 17 per cent of the total. High-emitting households are present across all major economies, and large inequalities now exist both within and between countries. 4. Despite the call for countries to \u201crevisit and strengthen\u201d their 2030 targets, progress since COP 26 is highly inadequate As part of the Paris Agreement\u2019s five-year ambition-raising cycle, countries were requested to submit new or updated NDCs in time for COP 26. The Glasgow Climate Pact, adopted in 2021 at COP 26, further requested countries to revisit and strengthen their 2030 mitigation targets to align with the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. Between 1 January 2020 and 23 September 2022 (the cut-off date used for this report), 166 parties representing around 91 per cent of global GHG emissions had submitted new or updated NDCs, up from 152 parties as of COP 26. As the European Union and its 27 member States submit a single NDC, 139 new or updated NDCs have been submitted. Relative to initial NDCs, a larger share includes GHG emission targets, coverage of sectors and gases is generally greater, and more include unconditional elements.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e07f2be7-89af-47c1-8043-9775242049bc": {"__data__": {"id_": "e07f2be7-89af-47c1-8043-9775242049bc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "661f2348b95ec95b57b8737430d3e6a2f033745a88bef159927b5c351c181a16"}, "2": {"node_id": "e3fa5128-4654-421b-9f1f-b4ca5ea6aef3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a1fc81b2d9154d6dfb33247882a1a5936b80099826cef5ac16800209801519de"}}, "hash": "830b5defc7258e1b62cb655ccf4571487587deab3f08ceebeaf6ea3d1fb1071e", "text": "In total and if fully implemented, the new or updated unconditional NDCs are estimated to result in an annual additional reduction of 4.8 GtCO2e by 2030 relative to the initial NDCs.

G20 members are far behind in delivering on their mitigation commitments for 2030, causing an implementation gap Most of the G20 members that have submitted stronger NDC targets since 2020 have just started the implementation of policies and actions to meet their new targets. Those that are currently projected to meet their NDC targets are countries that have either not updated their original NDCs, or did not strengthen or only moderately strengthened their target levels in their updated NDCs. All other G20 members will need additional policies to achieve their NDCs. The central estimate of aggregate emissions projections for G20 members in 2030 under current policies decreased by 1.3 GtCO2e compared with the 2021 assessment, mainly due to the projected emission reductions from the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States of America (about 1 GtCO2e). Collectively, the G20 members are not on track to achieve their new or updated NDCs. Based on current policies scenario projections in independent studies, there is an implementation gap, defined as the difference between projected emissions under current policies and projected emissions under full implementation of the NDCs. This implementation gap is 1.8 GtCO2e annually by 2030 for the G20 members. For two G20 members, the Russian Federation and T\u00fcrkiye, the projected emissions under their NDCs have consistently been significantly above current policies projections, thereby lowering the implementation gap compared to what can reasonably be expected. If NDC projections are substituted by current policies scenario projections for these two members, the G20 members would collectively fall short of achieving their NDCs by 2.6 GtCO2e annually by 2030. Beyond G20 members, the global implementation gap for 2030 is estimated to be around 3 GtCO2e for the unconditional NDCs and 6 GtCO2e for the conditional NDCs. 6. \ufffd Globally,\ufffdthe\ufffdNDCs\ufffdare\ufffdhighly\ufffdinsufficient,\ufffdand\ufffd the emissions gap remains high The emissions gap for 2030 is defined as the difference between the estimated total global GHG emissions resulting from the full implementation of the NDCs, and the total global GHG emissions from least-cost scenarios that keep global warming to 2\u00b0C, 1.8\u00b0C or 1.5\u00b0C, with varying levels of likelihood. Current commitments by countries as expressed in their unconditional and conditional NDCs for 2030 are estimated to reduce global emissions by 5 and 10 per cent respectively, compared with current policies and assuming that they are fully implemented. To get on track for limiting global warming to below 2.0\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C, global GHG emissions must be reduced by 30 and 45 per cent respectively, compared with current policy projections. Full implementation of unconditional NDCs is estimated to result in a gap with the 1.5\u00b0C scenario of 23 GtCO2e (range: 19\u201325 GtCO2e) (table ES.1, table ES.2 and figure ES.3). This estimate is about 5 GtCO2e smaller than in the 2021 edition of the Emissions Gap Report. However, this difference is almost entirely due to methodological updates and updates to the 1.5\u00b0C scenarios. The emissions in 2030 are higher under the updated 1.5\u00b0C scenarios, because they start their reductions from the most up-to-date historical emissions, which have increased over the past 5 years. This does not come without consequences, as on average these scenarios have a lower chance of effectively keeping warming to 1.5\u00b0C. If the conditional NDCs are also fully implemented, the 1.5\u00b0C emissions gap is reduced to 20 GtCO2e (range: 16\u201322 GtCO2e). The emissions gap between unconditional NDCs and below 2\u00b0C pathways is about 15 GtCO2e (range: 11\u201317 GtCO2e), which is about 2 GtCO2e larger than that which was reported last year. The main reason for this increase is that this year\u2019s report corrects for discrepancies in historical emissions through harmonization.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a50e1948-67f8-4eef-a3f4-0a2a1b8b84bb": {"__data__": {"id_": "a50e1948-67f8-4eef-a3f4-0a2a1b8b84bb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca26c586c2d4e6351361aebe4ae26c70913372dd856501b231358bef92d2da4e"}, "2": {"node_id": "1edf1f16-c097-4267-9d1c-591d3be21286", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "db3473acb41889fe4664d60d842cc430aea37317d0ffeacf76cecaba9fbabdde"}}, "hash": "c60558b02a31e4caf2165e92442a86269b9baf0aebcf7da73d5bfeb772e65957", "text": "If the conditional NDCs are also fully implemented, the below 2\u00b0C emissions gap is reduced to 12 GtCO2e (range: 8\u201314 GtCO2e).

Without additional action, current policies lead to global warming of 2.8\u00b0C over this century. Implementation of unconditional and conditional NDC scenarios reduce this to 2.6\u00b0C and 2.4\u00b0C respectively A continuation of the level of climate change mitigation effort implied by current unconditional NDCs is estimated to limit warming over the twenty-first century to about 2.6\u00b0C (range: 1.9\u20133.1\u00b0C) with a 66 per cent chance, and warming is expected to increase further after 2100 as CO2 emissions are not yet projected to reach net-zero levels. Continuing the efforts of conditional NDCs lowers these projections by around 0.2\u00b0C to 2.4\u00b0C (range: 1.8\u20133.0\u00b0C) with a 66 per cent chance. As current policies are insufficient to meet even the unconditional of NDCs, a continuation of current policies would result in about 0.2\u00b0C higher estimates of 2.8\u00b0C (range: 1.9\u20133.3\u00b0C) with a 66 per cent chance. Global warming levels only get close to the Paris Agreement temperature goal if full implementation of the highly uncertain net-zero pledges is assumed. Achieving net-zero targets in addition to unconditional NDCs results in keeping projected global warming to 1.8\u00b0C (range: 1.8\u20132.1\u00b0C) with a 66 per cent chance. Assuming that conditional NDCs and pledges are achieved and followed by net-zero targets, global warming is similarly projected to be kept to 1.8\u00b0C (range: 1.7\u20131.9\u00b0C) with a 66 per cent chance. However, in most cases, neither current policies nor NDCs currently trace a credible path from 2030 towards the achievement of national net-zero targets. 8.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e17db921-8921-4a6d-8868-c72b1d9c698a": {"__data__": {"id_": "e17db921-8921-4a6d-8868-c72b1d9c698a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "20ce7d419c2afc19c6d58ff24f603e61fa50b38be92465937ec512fbef169a5b"}, "2": {"node_id": "a004a28b-cf65-4b9b-ae73-7430e2687a7b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "77678abceeee91295bc1c50fff97d602d4391059f1a92bef2c087ecf87814ebb"}}, "hash": "8826a9f066cdd8307407f8647b5f285f99dd3a37bdded6a049bc05de9772a5d9", "text": "8.

XXII Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window either in law (21), in a policy document such as an NDC or a long-term strategy (47), or in an announcement by a high- level government official (20). This is up from 74 parties at COP 26. An additional eight parties covering an additional 2 per cent of global GHG emissions have another (non- net-zero) GHG mitigation target as part of their long-term strategies. Focusing on the G20 members, 19 members have committed to achieving net-zero emissions, up from 17 at COP 26. These targets vary in a number of important respects, including their legal status; time frame; explicit consideration of fairness and equity; which sources, sectors and gases they cover; whether they will allow the use of international offsets to count towards their achievement; the level of detail they provide on the role of CO2 removal; and the nature of planning, review of and reporting on target implementation. Figure ES.4 visualizes the necessary direction for countries to move from their current emission levels to their NDC targets for 2030, and indicates the net-zero targets for each G20 member that has a net-zero target (noting that France, Germany and Italy are only assessed as part of the European Union). Those G20 members whose emissions have already peaked will need to further accelerate their emission declines to their net-zero target year, while members whose emissions will continue to increase through 2030 under the NDCs will require further policy shifts and investments \u2013 including adequate support to developing countries, where applicable \u2013 to achieve the emissions reductions implied by their national net-zero targets. This illustration does not consider the relative merits in terms of equity or fairness of the choices countries make regarding their NDCs or their nationally determined pathways to net-zero. However, it brings to the fore the discrepancies between short-term policy implementation, midterm targets and long-term targets. It also serves as an important reminder that current evidence does not provide confidence that the nationally determined net-zero targets will be achieved. 9. Wide-ranging, large-scale, rapid and systemic transformation is now essential to achieve the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement The task facing the world is immense: not just to set more ambitious targets, but also to deliver on all commitments made. This will require not just incremental sector-by- sector change, but wide-ranging, large-scale, rapid and systemic transformation. This will not be easy, given the many other pressures on policymakers at all levels. Climate action is imperative in all countries but must be achieved simultaneously with other United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The transformation towards zero GHG emissions in the sectors of electricity supply, industry, transportation and buildings is under way. However, increased and accelerated action is needed if these are to happen at the pace and scale required to limit global warming to well below 2\u00b0C, preferably 1.5\u00b0C. Of these four sectors, electricity supply is the most advanced, as the costs of renewable electricity have reduced dramatically. Still, major obstacles continue to exist, including ensuring that transformations are just and deliver energy access for people who are currently not served. Furthermore, the impacts on communities and nations, and existing fossil energy companies and supply chains, must be handled, and grid integration of large shares of renewable energy must be prepared. For building operations and road transport, the most efficient technologies currently available need to be applied, while for industry, and shipping and aviation, zero-emissions technologies need to be further developed and deployed. The following broad portfolio of key actions to initiate and advance the transformation must be undertaken, tailored to the specific context of each of the four sectors: \u25b6 avoiding lock-in of new fossil fuel intensive infrastructure \u25b6 enabling the transition by further advancing zero- carbon technologies, market structures and plans for a just transformation \u25b6 applying zero-emissions technologies and promoting behavioural change to sustain and deepen reductions to reach zero emissions All actors have roles to play in initiating and accelerating the transformation, including in the removal of barriers that stand in the way", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ba07737c-e2b1-4626-91fc-f0597ec28dae": {"__data__": {"id_": "ba07737c-e2b1-4626-91fc-f0597ec28dae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c17512608b1183cbd1e7e09bbb96b140433c454a0211f318e16255cf03b8a1c1"}}, "hash": "c17512608b1183cbd1e7e09bbb96b140433c454a0211f318e16255cf03b8a1c1", "text": "of progress (table ES.3).

The food system is currently responsible for about a third of total GHG emissions, or 18 GtCO2e/year (range: 14\u201322 GtCO2e). The largest contribution stems from agricultural production (7.1 GtCO2e, 39 per cent) including the production of inputs such as fertilizers, followed by changes in land use (5.7 GtCO2e, 32 per cent), and supply chain activities (5.2 GtCO2e, 29 per cent). The latter includes retail, transport, consumption, fuel production, waste management, industrial processes and packaging. Projections indicate that food system emissions could reach ca 30 GtCO2e/year by 2050. To get on an emissions pathway aligned with the Paris Agreement temperature goal, food systems will have to be rapidly transformed across multiple domains. Required transformations include shifting diets, protecting natural ecosystems, improving food production and decarbonizing the food value chain. Each transformation domain includes several mitigation measures. The potential to reduce GHG emissions is up to 24.7 GtCO2e/year in 2050 (figure ES.5). Transforming food systems is not only important for addressing climate change and environmental degradation, but also essential for ensuring healthy diets and food security for all. Actions by all major groups of actors is required to drive transformations forward and to overcome barriers.

Realignment\ufffdof\ufffdthe\ufffdfinancial system is a critical enabler of the transformations needed A realignment of the financial system is vitally important to enable the transformations needed are to be achieved. The financial system is a network of private and public institutions such as banks, institutional investors and public institutions that regulate the safety and soundness of the system, but also co-lend or finance directly. A global transformation from a heavily fossil fuel- and unsustainable land use-dependent economy to a low-carbon economy is expected to require investments of at least US$4\u20136 trillion a year, a relatively small (1.5\u20132 per cent) share of total financial assets managed, but significant (20\u201328 per cent) in terms of the additional annual resources to be allocated. The IPCC assesses that global mitigation investments need to increase by a factor of three to six, and even more for developing countries (figure ES.6). Financial systems change is required to enable such a global transformation. To date, most financial actors have shown limited action on climate change mitigation because of short-term interests and conflicting objectives, and because climate risks are not adequately recognized. Six approaches to bringing about a financial system that is capable of the shifting of finance flows needed for systemic transformation are identified: \u25b6 Increase the efficiency of financial markets. Key interventions include the provision of better information, including taxonomies and transparency, on climate risks. In developing country contexts, priorities will include capacity-building and strengthening institutions. \u25b6 Introduce carbon pricing. This can be done through policy instruments such as carbon taxes or cap- and-trade systems. Emissions-trading schemes and carbon taxes now cover 30 per cent of all global emissions, with a global average price of US$6 per ton of CO2.

This thirteenth edition of the Emissions Gap Report is a testimony to inaction on the global climate crisis. In just eight years, global GHG emissions must be reduced by 30 to 45 per cent compared to where they are headed under policies currently in place to get on track to limiting global warming to well below 2.0\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C respectively. Commitments by countries as expressed in their latest unconditional and conditional nationally determined contributions (NDCs) for 2030 will only reduce global emissions by 5 to 10 per cent, assuming that they are fully implemented. Earlier this year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published two reports as part of its Sixth Assessment cycle, on Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability (IPCC 2022a) and Mitigation of Climate Change (IPCC 2022b). The reports record the vast impacts of climate change that we are already experiencing, and how the climate risks of the future are of a much greater order of magnitude. Once again, these reports document that the scale and rate of climate change and associated risks depend strongly on near-term mitigation and adaptation actions, finding that projected adverse impacts and related losses and damages escalate with every increment of global warming. This year, as has repeatedly been the case in recent years, many countries have experienced an unprecedented number of climate events, with extreme weather leading to flooding, drought and wildfires, and causing food shortages, health problems, and major damage to ecosystems and human habitats, leading to internal displacement and migration around the world.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "41d12293-da8c-469d-b1b9-e657b3771667": {"__data__": {"id_": "41d12293-da8c-469d-b1b9-e657b3771667", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7cd85aefa5c7b84f737dcf3a126f42c0dcf012689b71a0c2f8d40e647649c709"}, "2": {"node_id": "d3ae2f8d-ef6a-4052-945c-a1f97e8e696f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f20777422c0f136968266ca7d1a9dbfe50afcd1c0aeb6d48d38a2488228a543e"}}, "hash": "3605f500704bf06cc2ef4c40dc698f80b1d7b22df722322a7b6f42a88bc7ed1c", "text": "In line with the Emissions Gap Report, the IPCC reports send a reverberating message that the window of opportunity to limit global warming to well below 2\u00b0C, preferably 1.5\u00b0C, thereby avoiding some unmanageable climate risks, is closing rapidly.

Specifically, the report finds that GHG emissions levels by 2030 associated with the implementation of NDCs, imply that mitigation after 2030 can no longer establish a pathway that limits global warming to 1.5\u00b0C during the twenty-first century without significant overshoot, and that returning to below 1.5\u00b0C in 2100 is infeasible for some scenarios (IPCC 2022b). Unprecedented scaling up of mitigation ambitions and implementation is a prerequisite to bridging the emissions gap, and is expected to be one of the focus areas of the twenty-seventh United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP 27). Following up on the decisions made at COP 26, it was decided to establish a work programme for urgently scaling up mitigation ambition and implementation, the details of which are expected to be agreed upon at COP 27 (UNFCCC 2022a; UNFCCC 2022b). Recognizing the significant emissions gap, countries were furthermore encouraged to revisit and strengthen their 2030 mitigation pledges in 2022, and it was decided to establish annual high-level ministerial roundtables on pre-2030 ambition also starting in 2022. Consequently, a key question for COP 27 and for this year\u2019s Emissions Gap Report is, what progress has been made since COP 26, and how can the transformation necessary to bridge the emissions gap be initiated and accelerated? The report looks at transformations required in electricity supply, industry, transport, buildings, food systems and the financial system. It is important to acknowledge that for transformations to be successful they need to be just and socially balanced. There is no universal model, and transformations will likely be very different between developed and developing countries. 2 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window In parallel with the climate crisis and other planetary crises, the world faces compounding energy, food and cost of living crises. These crises are exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, which is causing immense human suffering and undermines the recovery of the global economy following the COVID-19 pandemic. The crises are a wake-up call to the global community for more, rather than less, climate action. As previous editions of the Emissions Gap Report have documented, the unprecedentedly large fiscal rescue and recovery packages in response to the COVID-19 crisis were to a large extent missed as an opening to accelerate the green transition. While the current crises are fundamentally different, governments around the world face largely similar choices: (1) to use them as an opening to accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels and the expansion of renewable energy, while boosting energy conservation and energy efficiency, or (2) to allow them to divert attention from climate change action and continue investment in fossil fuels, causing lock-in and jeopardizing the Paris Agreement temperature goal. The global implications of these crises for climate action and GHG emissions are still unclear, and they are likely to differ in the short term and the long term, but they could be significant, depending on how governments respond to them. 1.2 Approach and structure of the report The Emissions Gap Report is an assessment report. It provides an evaluation of credible scientific and technical knowledge on emissions trends, progress, gaps and opportunities, based on a synthesis of the latest scientific literature, models, and data analysis and interpretation, and models, including that published in the context of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). As in previous years, this Emissions Gap Report has been prepared by an international team. This year, UNEP convened 77 leading scientists from 41 expert institutions across 23 countries. The assessment process has been overseen by a respected international steering committee and has been transparent and participatory, while also taking into account geographical diversity and gender concerns. All chapters have undergone external review, and the assessment methodology and preliminary findings were made available to the governments of the countries specifically mentioned in the report, to provide them with the opportunity to comment on the findings. This year, several methodological updates were made to improve the estimates and ensure consistency across the chapters of the report. Two working groups were established to address recurrent issues in the Emissions Gap Reports, related to (1) land use, land-use change and forestry data sources, notably reconciliation of differences between global model estimates and national reporting of forest CO2 sinks (also see chapter 2), and (2) harmonization of global emissions data based on historical emissions and global models (see chapters 3 and 4).

It is important to note that these improvements also imply that the estimates presented are not directly comparable to those of previous reports. Full details can be found in chapters 2 to 4 and related appendices. The report is organized into seven chapters, including this introduction. Chapter 2 assesses the trends in global GHG emissions, including the effects of COVID-19, and considers consumption-based emissions and their distribution between and within countries. Chapter 3 provides an updated global landscape of NDCs and long-term net- zero emissions pledges, and assesses the progress of G20 members towards achieving their NDCs and net-zero emissions pledges. Chapter 4 updates the assessment of the emissions gap by 2030 based on the latest NDCs, and considers the implications of the emissions gap on the feasibility of achieving the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. Chapter 5 provides the status of the transformation towards zero GHG emissions in the sectors of electricity supply, industry, transportation and buildings, and identifies actor-based actions that could accelerate the transformation. Chapter 6 provides an assessment of the food systems transformations needed, whether there are signs that they are happening, and how they could be accelerated. Finally, chapter 7 considers the transformations of the finance system needed to enable the achievement of the Paris Agreement. 3 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window Global emissions trends Lead authors: William F.

It analyses global emissions by gas, country, household and sector, providing the current and historical context for subsequent chapters on country pledges and mitigation pathways. There are both short- and long-term influences on GHG emissions. In the short term, abrupt geopolitical and economic events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine can lead to significant but temporary changes in annual emissions. In the long term, structural shifts in technologies, production and investment decisions, as well as economic and climate policies, play an important role. One aim of this chapter is to provide both short- and long- term perspectives on trends in global GHG emissions. Another focal area of the chapter is land use, land-use change and forestry emissions (LULUCF). The LULUCF sector is complex in terms of definitions, concepts and quantification, due to the scientific challenge of separating human from natural influences on GHG fluxes, and the fact that it is both a source and sink of CO2. This year, the Emissions Gap Report has adopted a new approach for LULUCF emissions, as described in box 2.1. 4 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window Box 2.1 Methodological update to ensure consistency between global and national LULUCF emission estimates Recent literature has highlighted significant differences in anthropogenic LULUCF estimates between the approach undertaken by countries in their reporting to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (\u2018national inventory approach\u2019) and the global modelling approach (\u2018bookkeeping approach\u2019) pioneered in the scientific community and used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Reports (Grassi et al. 2021; Grassi, Schwingshackl et al. 2022). Both approaches are applicable in their specific contexts, but are not directly comparable as they use different system boundaries.

To reflect and address this, the methodological approach to LULUCF emissions data is updated: when depicting country emissions trends, national inventory data is used. In this chapter this applies to historical emissions (based on Grassi, Conchedda et al. 2022 and gap-filled when necessary), and in chapter 3 it applies to country NDC emissions. When reporting global total GHG emissions, data from global models, i.e. the bookkeeping approach, is used. This chapter uses bookkeeping models that only cover LULUCF emissions (based on Friedlingstein et al. 2022), while chapter 4 uses integrated assessment models. This approach ensures that country estimates are consistent with those reported by countries themselves to the UNFCCC, and that global estimates are consistent with the carbon cycle, scenarios and climate science literature used in the IPCC Assessment Reports. In addition, a harmonization procedure has been implemented in chapter 4 to ensure comparability between globally aggregated NDC estimates and integrated assessment model emission pathways consistent with different warming levels. The harmonization procedure adjusts global NDC scenarios to the outputs from integrated assessment models for the historical period. For further details, please see appendix A, which is available online. All GHG emission figures in this report are expressed using global warming potential over 100 years (GWP100) from the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (Forster et al. 2021). In line with previous reports, non-LULUCF emissions in this chapter are based on a single consistent global source, the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR), which is available up to 2021 (Crippa et al. 2022).1 LULUCF emissions, based on both Grassi, Conchedda et al. (2022) and Friedlingstein et al. (2022), are currently only available up to 2020, limiting our analysis of total global GHG emissions to 2020. Nonetheless, an initial estimate of total global GHG emissions in 2021 excluding LULUCF is provided. 1 EDGAR includes all anthropogenic GHG emissions sources defined in the IPCC guidance and reflected in UNFCCC national inventories. Some additional sources with relevant warming impacts, such as chlorofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons and hydrogen gas are excluded (Minx et al. 2021; Dhakal et al. 2022). It should be noted that the emissions estimates presented differ from the Emissions Gap Report 2021 (United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] 2021) due to the revision of the LULUCF data and the switch to GWP100 values from the Sixth Assessment Report. If total GHG estimates excluding LULUCF are recalculated based on the GWP100 from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, they show strong agreement with previous reports. Further information on the data used, estimations of growth rates and uncertainties is provided in appendix A, available online. 5 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window 2.2 Global emissions trends 2.2.1 The rate of growth in GHG emissions has slowed in the past decade, but global GHG emissions could set a new record in 2021 While the rate of growth in GHG emissions (including LULUCF) in the past decade has slowed compared to the previous decade, average GHG emissions in the last decade were the highest on record (figure 2.1). Between 2010 and 2019, average annual growth was 1.1 per cent per year, compared to 2.6 per cent per year between 2000 and 2009. Reasons for this decadal slowdown include a global reduction in new coal capacity additions (particularly in China), the steady substitution of coal by gas in the power sectors of developed countries, the increasing pace of renewable energy deployments worldwide (Lamb, Wiedmann et al. 2021; Dhakal et al. 2022; Friedlingstein et al. 2022; Jackson et al. 2022;) and a reduction in LULUCF net emissions, although these are very uncertain (Friedlingstein et al. 2022). This raises the question of whether global GHG emissions are reaching a plateau, or whether slower levels of growth will continue in the coming years (see also section 2.2.3).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "de8fcbc4-7bad-407e-9249-e9dc5d20c24d": {"__data__": {"id_": "de8fcbc4-7bad-407e-9249-e9dc5d20c24d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9e71795a3ac97c0ef82e51e5ce81570ef1775fc69cae0d6d6a1b1c8dc2254e70"}, "2": {"node_id": "f7edcc39-ebc7-4fbc-bf26-679c7d50a9b8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9b3141dd581ac6c8e7e747b1078bae7706b6dae01a7edd3c30560ffd0f1f28b1"}}, "hash": "9262970b1948a8a896411a6b9e43d122ee3df7a3cda8d1628ceda6f5a67221e3", "text": "Total global GHG emissions averaged 54.4 gigatons of CO2 equivalent (GtCO2e) between 2010 and 2019, and reached a high in 2019 (figure 2.1, table 2.1).

Total global GHG emissions dropped 4.7 per cent from 2019 to 2020 \u2013 the largest single- year absolute drop in GHG emissions since 1970 when the data set starts (Dhakal et al. 2022). Nonetheless, daily emissions data suggests that CO2 emissions from fossil fuel and industry (hereafter referred to as fossil CO2 for brevity) had already rebounded by the end of 2020 (Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al. 2020; Liu et al. 2020; Davis et al. 2022; Jackson et al. 2022). Global atmospheric CO2 concentrations continued to grow from 2019 to 2020, reaching an annual mean of 413 parts per million. This was slightly slower than during 2018 to 2019, but faster than the decadal average rate, despite COVID-19 restrictions (World Meteorological Organization 2022). The long-term impacts of COVID-19 on global GHG emissions are not yet possible to discern (Kikstra et al. 2021; Shan et al. 2021). On the one hand, the global response to COVID-19 has disrupted supply chains and may have led to underlying shifts in energy supply and demand; on the other hand, economic stimulus packages appear to have favoured fossil fuels, missing an opportunity to support renewable energy and low-carbon investments (Hepburn et al. 2020; UNEP 2020; Bertram et al. 2021; Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al. 2021; UNEP 2021). Emissions trends in 2022 and beyond will be further influenced by the war in Ukraine and subsequent disruptions to global energy supplies, which are driving a renewed policy focus on energy security. Early assessments project an increase in fossil fuel investments in 2022, as many countries have announced plans to expand natural gas infrastructures to shore up domestic supplies (Climate Action Tracker 2022; International Energy Agency 2022).

These non-CO2 emissions sources are mainly linked to agricultural activities (methane and nitrous oxide), fossil fuel supply chains (methane), and cooling and industrial processes (F-gases). That they followed the longer-term trend of steady growth (for F-gas emissions, rapid growth) indicates that these sectors were less exposed to the energy demand reduction dynamics of the initial COVID-19 pandemic response. At a source level, emissions from oil saw the steepest drop in 2020, followed by coal and gas (Friedlingstein et al. 2022). Oil is mainly used in land transport and aviation and shipping, which were most severely affected by the pandemic (Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al. 2020; Liu et al. 2020). Emissions from oil have yet to rebound, and remained below 2019 levels in 2021 (Jackson et al. 2022). On the other hand, coal and gas rebounded strongly in 2021.

While the number of deforestation fires in the Amazon remained high in 2020, land-use related fire emissions in Indonesia decreased as the unusually dry conditions of 2019 ceased. LULUCF emissions from bookkeeping models are highly uncertain in both magnitude and trend, and vary substantially by global regions (Pongratz et al. 2021). Average emissions between 2011 and 2020 were 4.1 \u00b1 2.6 GtCO2. The data indicates a decline in LULUCF emissions over this past decade (of 4 per cent/year). However, the literature reports a very low confidence in this trend, due to underlying data limitations (Dhakal et al. 2022, Friedlingstein et al. 2022). Whereas removals mainly take place in regions with a pre- 7 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window twentieth-century legacy of deforestation (i.e. Europe and North America), emissions are concentrated in tropical regions with a high present-day burden of deforestation (the Amazon basin, Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa). Net emissions trends are primarily driven by deforestation, in places where the monitoring and quantification of land-use trends is challenging. Net LULUCF emissions from national inventories remained stable between 2011 and 2020 at a decadal average of around -2 GtCO2/year (appendix A, figure A.1), with temperate and boreal regions reporting net removals and tropical regions reporting close to net-zero emissions (Grassi, Conchedda et al. 2022). For 2011\u20132020, the difference in global net LULUCF CO2 fluxes between national inventories and bookkeeping models is about 6.1 GtCO2 (5.1 GtCO2 for the year 2020; figure 2.1). This large difference is explained by a variety of factors, the most important being how areas of managed land and anthropogenic forest sinks are defined (Grassi et al. 2021; also see appendix A). 2.2.4 Sector emissions trends Emissions can be divided among five global economic sectors: energy supply; industry; agriculture, forestry and other land-use change (AFOLU);2 transport; and direct energy use in buildings. Since 1990, most growth in emissions has been from the energy supply, industry and transport sectors (Lamb, Wiedmann et al. 2021; Dhakal et al. 2022). In 2020, the energy supply sector contributed 20 GtCO2e (37 per cent of the total), industry was 14 GtCO2e (26 per cent), AFOLU was 9.5 GtCO2e (18 per cent), transport was 7.6 GtCO2e (14 per cent) and buildings was 3.1 GtCO2e (5.7 per cent). Reallocating the emissions associated with electricity and heat production (e.g. in the energy supply sector) to final consuming sectors increases the contribution of the industry and buildings sectors to 34 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively (Dhakal et al. 2022). There are a number of particularly high-emitting subsectors that drive global emissions growth. These include electricity and heat production (14 GtCO2e in 2020, 25 per cent of the total), road transportation (5.6 GtCO2e, 10 per cent), and the 2 AFOLU includes LULUCF CO2 emissions, here accounted for using global bookkeeping model data, plus additional agricultural emissions from EDGAR, such as methane from livestock and rice cultivation and nitrous oxide from fertilizer application. metals industry (3.2 GtCO2e, 6 per cent). Methane emissions from enteric fermentation (i.e. livestock rearing), landfill sites, and fugitive methane emissions from oil, gas and coal supply chains, are also significant global sources with short- term warming impacts (Dhakal et al. 2022).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e45b0a4a-a7cc-4bcc-9b6b-73557dd3e163": {"__data__": {"id_": "e45b0a4a-a7cc-4bcc-9b6b-73557dd3e163", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3a02733134cd14fbe469321b9fdb57082e181276b1e7f061c5bb1ddb83c10c1d"}, "2": {"node_id": "ced14573-9d4a-4d5e-ab2e-d4e737d88265", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f1026acffed95e0f703fce406f6531c7f084f68aaf9c781ab407a9128f501e37"}}, "hash": "89de41924b720bc206e04aa214bb6abb5614cb90ee5eca576e758e280896bbc5", "text": "2022).

The United States of America remains far above this level at 14 tCO2e, followed by 13 tCO2e in the Russian Federation, 9.7 tCO2e in China, about 7.5 tCO2e in Brazil and Indonesia, and 7.2 tCO2e in the European Union. India remains far below the world average at 2.4 tCO2e. On average, least developed countries emit 2.3 tCO2e per capita annually. As with current per capita GHG emissions, contributions to historical cumulative CO2 emissions (excluding LULUCF) vary greatly between countries and global regions (G\u00fctschow et al. 2016; Matthews 2016). Whereas the United States of America and European Union contributed 25 per cent and 17 per cent respectively to total fossil CO2 emissions from 1850 to 2019, China contributed 13 per cent, the Russian Federation 7 per cent, India 3 per cent, and Indonesia and Brazil 1 per cent each. Least developed countries contributed only 0.5 per cent to historical CO2 fossil fuel and industry emissions between 1850 and 2019 (Dhakal et al. 2022). 2.3.2 Consumption-based emissions are highly unequal between and within countries When national fossil CO2 emissions are estimated on a consumption-basis (i.e.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "96b34e15-b9f6-4d9c-9ab0-65f759d8d551": {"__data__": {"id_": "96b34e15-b9f6-4d9c-9ab0-65f759d8d551", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3119317f44d502559041bcba3f11ea24ac4dc7c905ac8f2b13e84b2193204b27"}, "2": {"node_id": "d1b77450-aff9-4a72-9ba2-29072e5cf94f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "00c209bf547e69d9d78ac0f2f14982f87b4b9b1aa0fbc47e005d3ad31ca9d5c7"}}, "hash": "6901b193c5c915060ed52523cc24ebe9b5f71c0c93c826670a45b59c4cde5dee", "text": "where the supply-chain emissions are allocated to consumers) rather than on the territorial- basis considered so far, emissions tend to be higher in high- income countries such as the United States of America and European Union (by 6 per cent and 14 per cent respectively; Friedlingstein et al.

International transfers of emissions embodied in traded products peaked in 2006 and have since stabilized to be about one quarter of global CO2 emissions, or about 6.5 GtCO2e since 2014 according to the latest assessment (Wood et al. 2020; Hubacek et al. 2021; Dhakal et al. 2022).

Similar to fossil CO2 transfers, high-income countries (United States of America, European Union and Japan) tend to be net importers of agricultural products and hence have higher consumption-based AFOLU emissions. Major net exporters of such commodities and their embodied AFOLU emissions include Brazil, Indonesia, Argentina and Australia. According to Hong et al. (2022), in the past decade China has become the largest net importer of embodied AFOLU emissions, superseding Europe and the United States of America. Approximately 22 per cent of agricultural land worldwide is used for traded products, resulting in annual consumption-based AFOLU emissions of 4.5\u20135.8 GtCO2e as at 2017, excluding sinks (Hong et al. 2022). Consumption-based emissions also diverge starkly at a household level, in large part due to income and wealth disparities between and within countries (Capstick, Khosla and Wang 2020). When the emissions associated with both household consumption and public and private investments are allocated to households (see appendix A), and households are ranked by GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF), the bottom 50 per cent emit on average 1.6 tCO2e/ capita and contribute 12 per cent of the global total, whereas the top 1 per cent emit on average 110 tCO2e/capita and contribute 17 per cent of the total (Chancel 2022; Chancel et al. 2022). Super-emitters in the top 0.1 per cent (average 467 tCO2e/capita) and the top 0.01 per cent (2,531 tCO2e/ capita) have seen the fastest growth in personal carbon footprints since 1990. High-emitting households are present across all major economies, and large inequalities now exist both within and between countries (figure 2.3) (Chancel et al. 2022). 10 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window Figure 2.3 Household consumption-based emissions, excluding LULUCF, by emissions groups Source: Chancel et al. (2022) Note: Per capita emissions include emissions from domestic consumption, public and private investments, and imports and exports of carbon embedded in trade with the rest of the world. Households are ranked according to total emissions and divided accordingly into groups (e.g. the bottom 50 per cent refers to the 50 per cent of households with the lowest emissions in that country or region). 2.3.3 Some countries have peaked emissions, but their reductions have been outweighed by emissions growth elsewhere By 2019, 35 countries accounting for about 10 per cent of global emissions had peaked and reduced net GHG emissions, including LULUCF, for at least 10 years. These countries, which are mainly in Europe and also include the United States of America, that have started from a high base of per capita and historical cumulative emissions (Lamb, Grubb et al. 2021; Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al. 2019). Most of them have also achieved reductions on a consumption basis. Countries with sustained emissions reductions have tended to reduce energy system emissions via switching from coal to gas, low or negative growth in energy demand, and/or scaling up renewable energy deployments. So far, they have had limited success in reducing transport or agricultural emissions (Lamb, Grubb et al. 2021; Lamb, Wiedmann et al. 2021). However, total reductions in the annual emissions of peaking countries to date have been modest \u2013 3.2 GtCO2e from peak years to 2018, according to one estimate (Lamb, Grubb et al. 2021) \u2013 and have been outweighed by global emissions growth elsewhere. As at 2019, the majority of countries had increased emissions over the past decade (74 countries, 65 per cent of global emissions), or remained stable (39 countries, 25 per cent of global emissions).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0aaf9928-4182-4b59-af98-654acdf144bd": {"__data__": {"id_": "0aaf9928-4182-4b59-af98-654acdf144bd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "71cfe3ce1191b92e66952b77256872ae3a3e94243713447f05bc67c478fd0b90"}, "2": {"node_id": "376a22b2-e54c-4062-bb33-f59a9f52dbf3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "39cbb3b4d377b45152793e86e15afd08b8c7aed32034bca5443c052855cc8671"}}, "hash": "ecf1f767a70da24198f826f9784682bf6511bd7641ff97e55cb3ee5e527c2dd1", "text": "USA Russian Federation China World Europe Brazil Indonesia India 0 50 100 150 200 250 Household GHG emissions in 2019, excluding LULUCF (tCO2e/capita) Bottom 50% Middle 40% Next 9% Top 1% 11 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window Nationally determined contributions and long-term pledges: The global landscape and G20 member progress Lead authors: Takeshi Kuramochi (NewClimate Institute, Germany), Michel den Elzen (PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, Institute for Environmental Studies, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, the Netherlands), Taryn Fransen (World Resources Institute, United States of America) Contributing authors: Caitling Bergh (Energy Systems Research Group, University of Cape Town, South Africa), Anna Chapman (Climate Analytics, Australia), Nandini Das (Climate Analytics, Australia), Kim Coetzee (Climate Transparency, Germany), Neil Grant (Climate Analytics, Germany), Mariana Guti\u00e9rrez (HUMBOLDT-VIADRINA Governance Platform, Mexico), Gahee Han (Solutions for Our Climate, Republic of Korea), Frederic Hans (NewClimate Institute, Germany), Camilla Hyslop (Net Zero Tracker and University of Oxford, United Kingdom), Jiang Kejun (Energy Research Institute, China), Joojin Kim (Solutions for Our Climate, Republic of Korea), Ben King (Rhodium Group, United States of America), Aman Majid (Climate Analytics, Germany), Andrew Marquard (Energy Systems Research Group, University of Cape Town,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3e6135e-97e0-47da-9428-d30f3b01f575": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3e6135e-97e0-47da-9428-d30f3b01f575", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e6932c1489642688bb69257b8872aa5d19ced6429e5752350a2d49421fd6418a"}, "3": {"node_id": "805ef9a6-6dbd-4f44-adc2-f5af06017e88", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5b19b6f53f8ebc2a51047647c09a8de82a4dd7031acf8fabbd1f5804514fc60b"}}, "hash": "be56199b5d8337d376bd1496e88c6e2f1d066af9e94c6dfbcd45ac79921b0068", "text": "South Africa), Bryce McCall (Energy Systems Research Group, University of Cape Town, South Africa), Malte Meinshausen (University of Melbourne, Australia), Mia Moisio (NewClimate Institute, Germany), Silke Mooldijk (NewClimate Institute, Germany), Leonardo Nascimento (NewClimate Institute, Germany), Natalie Pelekh (NewClimate Institute, Germany), Anne Olhoff (CONCITO -

Section 3.2 adopts a global perspective, whereas subsequent sections focus on G20 members. Currently, G20 members account for about 75 per cent of global GHG emissions (see chapter 2), and their success in implementing and potentially exceeding their NDC targets will carry a major impact on 2030 emissions and the possibility for bridging the emissions gap. The cut-off date for the assessment is 23 September 2022. All GHG emission figures are expressed using the 100-year global warming potentials (GWPs) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6). The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) inventory reports for historical emissions are referred to when comparing them to individual G20 members\u2019 NDC targets. The methodology and preliminary findings of this chapter were made available to the governments of the G20 members specifically mentioned to provide them with the opportunity to comment on the findings. Findings related to the progress of G20 members towards their NDC and net-zero targets should be read with two important caveats in mind. The Emissions Gap Report does not assess the level of ambition of NDCs. However, the level of ambition is one of the factors likely to influence whether countries are on track to achieving their NDC targets. In 12 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window other words, a country currently on track to achieve its NDCs is not necessarily undertaking more mitigation action than a country not yet on track. Secondly, the Paris Agreement recognizes that each country faces unique national circumstances. Factors such as development stage and associated opportunities and barriers may affect both target ambition and target implementation. 3.2 Global developments in mitigation pledges for 2030 and beyond 3.2.1 NDCs The ambition-raising cycle of the Paris Agreement builds on the submission by parties of increasingly ambitious NDCs every five years.

Since the European Union and its 27 member states submit a single NDC, this amounts to 139 new or updated NDCs having been submitted. These NDCs reflect emerging trends related to the ambition, form, coverage and conditionality of GHG mitigation pledges. Effect on 2030 emissions: Of the 139 new or updated NDCs, just over half (74 NDCs from parties representing 77 per cent of global GHG emissions) would result in lower 2030 emissions relative to the initial NDCs (figure 3.1). This is up from 67 NDCs representing 69 per cent of global GHG emissions as at COP 26. Twenty-three NDCs, from parties representing 9 per cent of global GHG emissions, had communicated a new or updated NDC that would not reduce 2030 emissions relative to the previous NDCs. Forty- two NDCs from parties representing 5 per cent of global emissions could not be compared with the previous NDCs in terms of 2030 emissions, typically due to insufficient 1 Excluding updated first and second NDCs. information in the previous NDCs, as transparency has improved in the current NDCs. Pledge form: A total of 146 NDCs, from parties representing 91 per cent of global GHG emissions, now contain GHG targets. This is up from up from 128 initial NDCs (89 per cent of global emissions) and up from 143 NDCs as at COP 26 (90.5 per cent of global GHG emissions). These GHG targets comprise several different types, including base-year targets (commitments to reduce or control the increase in emissions by a specified amount relative to a base year, contained in 43 NDCs) and baseline scenario targets (commitments to reduce emissions by a specified amount relative to a projected emissions baseline scenario, contained in 83 NDCs), among other formulations (20 NDCs). Base-year targets typically result in emissions decreasing over time relative to historical levels, whereas baseline scenario targets are typically formulated to allow absolute emissions to continue to grow. A total of 43 NDCs, from parties representing 36 per cent of global GHG emissions, now contain a base-year target. This is up from 34 initial NDCs from parties representing 34 per cent of global GHG emissions. Of the 21 countries adopting a GHG target for the first time in their new or updated NDCs, 16 also adopted a baseline scenario target. Sector coverage: GHG targets can be formulated to cover a country\u2019s entire economy or only a subset of it. Targets with economy-wide coverage include the energy, industrial process and product use, waste and land sectors. There are 95 current NDCs, from parties representing 55 per cent of global GHG emissions, that cover all sectors. This is up significantly from the 54 initial NDCs, from parties representing 46 per cent of global GHG emissions, that did so. Gas coverage: Likewise, GHG targets can be formulated to cover all major GHGs \u2014 carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorochemicals (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) \u2014 or only a subset of them. GHG coverage of NDCs has remained relatively constant from the initial to the current NDCs, 24 of which, from parties representing 30 per cent of global emissions, cover all gases. Conditionality: Some parties have submitted NDCs that are entirely or partially conditional on factors such as international support (e.g., finance or technology transfer), while others have submitted NDCs that are not conditional.

The data come from three model groups that include updated NDCs with cut-off dates ranging from November 2021 to September 2022 (Keramidas et al. 2021; den Elzen et al. 2022; Meinshausen et al. 2022), and two open-source tools (Climate Action Tracker 2021; Climate Watch 2022).2 To enable the inclusion of the updated NDCs of G20 members that were submitted after the cut- off dates of the five data sources (that is, Australia, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Republic of Korea and the United Kingdom), NDC emission estimates were recalculated based on the historical emissions data used in the respective studies.3 Full implementation of all new or updated unconditional NDCs is projected to lead to a total reduction in global GHG emissions for 2030 of about 4.8 gigatons (Gt) of CO2e (range: 1.7\u20137.9 GtCO2e) annually, compared with initial pledges (figure 3.2; see also appendix B and table B.2). New and updated NDCs submitted since the Emissions Gap Report 2021 account for about 0.7 GtCO2e of this total, mainly due to additional reductions from the updated New or updated NDC not comparable to initial NDC New or updated NDC with equal or higher 2030 emissions relative to initial NDC New or updated NDC with lower 2030 emissions than initial NDC Updated NDC since COP 26 No new or updated NDC submitted 14 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window NDCs of Australia (10 per cent of the 0.7 GtCO2e), Brazil (35 per cent), Indonesia (10 per cent), Saudi Arabia (about 25 per cent),4 Republic of Korea (5 per cent) and non-G20 members (15 per cent), while submissions since COP 26 account for 0.5 GtCO2e of the total (mainly from Australia, Brazil, Indonesia and Republic of Korea). For some G20 members, the impact on global GHG emissions in 2030 is estimated at zero. This applies to members that have not 4 Brazil\u2019s 2022 NDC submission reduced emissions relative to their previous submission, which explains the contribution to the 0.7 GtCO2e reduction. However, the 2022 NDC submission still implies emissions that are higher than those of the initial NDC of Brazil. 5 According to the IPCC guidelines for national inventories for Brazil. submitted an updated NDC (T\u00fcrkiye), that have submitted NDCs with a similar target as in a previous update (United Kingdom) or where the updated target is estimated to result in higher emissions than emissions projected based on current policies for some studies (India and the Russian Federation). Brazil5 and Mexico show an increase in the emissions targets compared to the previous targets, due to a change in the reference emissions. Figure 3.2 Impact of new and updated unconditional NDCs on 2030 global emissions compared with initial NDCs Notes: The additional reduction resulting from other factors, including lower projections of international aviation and shipping emissions, is included in the figure.

This section provides an updated assessment of the progress of G20 members towards their latest NDC targets as at 23 September 2022 based on a synthesis of recently published studies of emissions projections.6 For each G20 member, GHG emissions projections were compiled and reviewed to assess the emission levels expected under existing policies i.e. the current policies scenario.7 Expected emission levels in 2030 under current policies were then compared to projected emissions under the NDC target to assess whether the G20 members are likely to meet their respective emissions reduction targets for 2030. The assessment is based on \u2018point in time\u2019 emissions projections in the NDC target year. European Union member states are not assessed individually. 3.4.1 Methods and limitations Current policies scenario projections are compared to the latest unconditional NDCs or to conditional NDCs for G20 members whose NDCs do not have unconditional elements. The assessment of conditionality of NDCs follows the World Resources Institute (Climate Watch 2022), which considers Indonesia and Mexico to have both unconditional and conditional NDCs, and India and South Africa to have only conditional NDCs (see appendix B, table B.2, available online). To enable a robust comparison of projections published by independent research institutions, the methodology of den Elzen et al. (2019) is followed. Official assessments published by national governments are compared with independent assessments. All data sources are presented in appendix B (table B.1), available online. The assessment is based on emissions including land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) (see appendix B for details on adjustments of emission projections excluding LULUCF). Historical emissions data for energy and industry sectors were taken from the latest inventory submissions to the UNFCCC, supplemented by the Potsdam Real-Time Integrated Model for probabilistic Assessment of emission Paths (PRIMAP) database for interval years and most recent years after the last inventory data year (G\u00fctschow, G\u00fcnther and Pfl\u00fcger 2021). For historical LULUCF emissions, harmonized data from Grassi, Conchedda et al. (2022) and Grassi, Federici et al. (2022) are used. For the emission data from the literature expressed in GWPs other than the 100-year GWPs from the 6 The updated NDCs of India and Indonesia submitted after the cut-off date were not considered in this section because no study reviewed in this section quantified and or examined the target levels as the report went to press. 7 Current policies scenario projections assume that no additional mitigation action is taken beyond current policies, even if it results in NDC targets not being achieved or being overachieved (United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] 2015; den Elzen et al. 2019). Current policy projections reflect all adopted and implemented policies, which for the purpose of this report are defined as legislative decisions, executive orders or their equivalent. This implies that officially announced plans or strategies alone would not qualify, while individual executive orders to implement such plans or strategies would qualify. 8 Exceptions were made in a few cases, where external reviewers suggested national studies published before 2020, that were assessed to provide relevant information. IPCC\u2019s AR6, conversion factors used in AR6 were applied (Lecocq et al. 2022). The selection of studies projecting 2030 emissions is based on four main considerations: 1) whether the studies take into account the most recent societal, economic and policy developments\u2014accordingly, only studies published in 2020 or later are included,8 2) that peer-reviewed studies are included to the extent possible, 3) inclusion of studies published by national experts and 4) that all GHGs and sectors are covered. Policy cut-off dates ranged from 2019 to mid-2022 across studies, meaning that recently adopted policies, including most of those presented later in section 3.4.3, are fully reflected in some of the scenario studies reviewed. Many studies took limited account of the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future emissions. Chapter 2 shows that long-term impacts of the pandemic on emissions remain uncertain, that global emissions are expected to rebound fully in 2021 and that impacts show large variation across G20 members and sectors. Therefore, studies that do not explicitly take the impact of the pandemic into account are also considered. Furthermore, none of the emissions projections consider the potential implications of the war in Ukraine.

Most G20 members that submitted stronger NDC targets in 2020 and 2021 have just begun their implementation efforts to meet their new targets. Those that are projected to meet their latest NDC target based on policies currently in place are G20 members that have not submitted a new or updated NDC, did not strengthen or only moderately strengthened their target levels in their updated NDCs (table 3.1). All other G20 members will need additional policies to achieve their NDCs. 16 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window Table 3.1 Assessment of progress towards achieving the current NDC targets, 2022 (unconditional, unless otherwise mentioned) for the G20 under current policies, based on independent studies mainly published in 2020 or later Projected progress towards the latest NDC target Meet the target with existing policies (Indicated by +, if overachieved by more than 15) Miss the target with existing policies Uncertain Status of new or updated NDC Submitted stronger target China (4/7), India (conditional: 4/7),i Saudi Arabia (2/2) Argentina (0/3), Australia (0/4)ii, Brazil (0/4, one within reach), Canada (0/4) EU27 (0/3),ii,iii Japan (0/3), Republic of Korea (0/3)iv, South Africa (conditional: 0/3), UK (0/1), United States of America (0/4) Indonesia (0/3, one within reach) No new target submitted T\u00fcrkiye (3/3) Submitted equivalent or weaker target Russian Federation+ (5/5)ii Mexico (1/3) Notes: See appendix B.1 for the list of studies reviewed.

The official publications for three G20 members (Canada, the European Union and United Kingdom) show that they do not project to meet their \u2018point in time\u2019 NDC target under their current policies scenario. Australia\u2019s most recent official report reported its progress towards their earlier NDC (Australia, Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources 2021). iii For the EU27, we refer to the European Union Reference scenario, which assumes full implementation of the National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs) for the period 2021\u20132030 by European Union member states and sees European Union emissions reduce by around 43 per cent below 1990 levels by 2030 (European Commission 2021a). Including net removals from LULUCF, this increases to -45 per cent. This baseline scenario indicates that additional effort would be required to meet the European Union\u2019s current 2030 energy efficiency target while its current 2030 renewable energy target would be met. Additional member state measures will update to fully implement their NECPs for the period 2021\u20132030 by June 2023 (draft) and June 2024 (final plans) with additional measures, taking into account recent policy and geopolitical developments (European Commission 2020). iv The Republic of Korea\u2019s Emissions Trading Scheme (K-ETS) is an instrument to fully achieve the country\u2019s NDC target and covers more than 70 per cent of its GHG emissions. The implementation phase 3 (2021\u20132025) has not been updated since the updated NDC was announced (International Carbon Action Partnership 2022). Collectively, the G20 members are projected to fall short of their new or updated NDCs by 1.8 GtCO2e (central estimate) annually by 2030. In other words, there is an implementation gap, defined as the difference between projected emissions in 2030 (assuming full implementation of NDC) and emissions based on current policies scenario projections.

Policy responses to the energy crisis and the war in Ukraine are not included. Some of the policies highlighted by national policy experts were adopted after the publication of the scenario studies reviewed in section 3.4.1 Notable exceptions include the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of the United States of America. 21 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window Table 3.3 Overview of recent policy measures adopted by the top seven GHG-emitting G20 members in 2021 and 2022 that are expected to affect the achievement of their NDC targets and long-term pledges Brazil \u2022 In its updated NDC, Brazil commits to reducing its GHG emissions by 37 per cent in 2025 and by 50 per cent in 2030 relative to 2005 levels. It has also committed to eliminating illegal deforestation by 2028 (Brazil 2022a). \u2022 In May 2022, Brazil adopted a federal decree establishing the procedures for setting up a national system for reducing GHG emissions as well as sectoral plans for climate change mitigation. The decree also establishes a single register of carbon and methane credits and classifies carbon credits as financial assets. The decree is expected to become a management mechanism and an operational instrument for the sectoral plans, which should establish gradual sectoral targets for emission reductions. These sectoral plans must be approved by the Interministerial Committee on Climate Change and Green Growth. Deadlines and specific rules are not yet specified under the decree (Brazil 2022b). China \u2022 The renewable energy development in China has continued its strong growth. By the end of 2021, the installed solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind capacity was more than 300 gigawatts (GW). Since 1996, the annual newly installed solar PV and wind capacity has accounted for about 55 per cent of new energy capacity (Statista 2022). \u2022 In April 2022, China announced that it would increase coal production by 300 million tons in 2022 through coal mining capacity increase, expanded and new production, and other measures.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c53b140d-7481-4085-9b36-630d49bf5336": {"__data__": {"id_": "c53b140d-7481-4085-9b36-630d49bf5336", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d6ff1c0019bc1f4b0f208592e45d423a84d928b75d120d2a9854b632f9bef532"}, "2": {"node_id": "172800c7-106d-4997-a4d1-04986c9b8927", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "509df3c28beb9adb19e365838dfd4278b1cffc42f7456f3d6dee07d9cbedfad2"}}, "hash": "9d9304bc25665becbbf66a17f29adf331d85935b88b21ba5603fc67949860a66", "text": "This comes despite China\u2019s pledge to strictly control coal-fired power generation projects, limit the increase in coal consumption over the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021\u20132025) and phase down coal consumption during the 15th Five-Year Plan period (2026\u20132030).

Specific objectives and implementing plans are published at the regional level and across all sectors covering energy, industry, urban-rural development, transportation, carbon sink, technology development, carbon market, climate and green finance, climate adaptation and social awareness (China, NDRC 2021a; China, NDRC 2021b). European Union \u2022 In December 2021, the European Commission proposed legislation to boost the renovation and decarbonization of buildings and reduce methane emissions in the energy sector by 80 per cent in 2030 (European Commission 2021b; European Commission 2021c). New requirements to promote sustainable products and construction were proposed in March 2022, which could lead to 132 million tons of oil equivalent (Mtoe) of primary energy savings (European Commission 2022a). \u2022 In May 2022, the European Commission presented its REPowerEU Plan in order to phase out Russian fossil fuels. Among others, the plan includes proposals to invest \u20ac210 billion mostly in clean energy and industry, speed up permitting procedures for renewable energy projects, and increase ambitions for renewable energy and energy efficiency. The plan would bring the EU\u2019s total renewable energy generation to 1236 GW by 2030 if adopted (European Commission 2022b; European Commission 2022c). \u2022 The EU\u2019s revision and update of legislation under the \u201cFit for 55\u201d package to implement its 2030 climate target is in its final phase. The European Commission, European Parliament and member states have already supported a ban on the sale of new fossil fuel cars and vans by 2035, an EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), and an expansion of emissions trading to new sectors (European Council 2022a; European Council 2022b; European Parliament 2022). 22 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window India \u2022 In August 2022, the Cabinet approved an update of India\u2019s NDC. The updated NDC has led to major polices being pushed forward, including 1) electric vehicles (EVs), 2) co-firing of biomass pellets in thermal power plants by 7 per cent, 3) ethanol blending in petrol by 20 per cent, 4) inclusion of agroforestry and private forestry, 5) solarization of agricultural pumps, 6) clean cooking (by shifting to liquefied petroleum gas [LPG]), and 7) rooftop solar PV. The Government of India is considering coal gasification, conversion of coal into chemical projects, ammonia and hydrogen as future fuels. Energy storage is supported through a production linked scheme to promote renewable energy (India, Press Information Bureau 2022). \u2022 In recognition of the role of lifestyles, the movement Lifestyle for Environment has been proposed to foster a citizen-centric approach to combat climate change (Bhaskar 2022; India, Press Information Bureau 2022). \u2022 The Lok Sabha passed the Energy Conservation (Amendment) Bill on 9 August 2022, aiming to facilitate the establishment and development of domestic carbon markets. The markets\u2019 objective is to incentivize actions for emission reduction expected to result in increased investments in clean energy and energy efficiency areas, especially in the private sector (PRS Legislative Research 2022). Indonesia \u2022 In February 2022, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry released Ministerial Decree No. 168/2022 on Forestry and Other Land Use (FOLU) Net Sink 2030 along with its operational plan. This regulation is expected to remove GHG emissions while implementing the energy transition and decarbonization. The FOLU Net Sink commitment was introduced in the last Long-Term Strategy to Low-Carbon and Climate Resilience 2050 published in 2021 (Forest Hints 2022). \u2022 The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources has announced a net-zero emission road map for the energy sector, which indicates that Indonesia will no longer build new fossil fuel power plants, with the exception of the 35 GW power capacity addition plan, and begin to retire subcritical coal power plants from 2030 onwards. In the period of 2031\u20132060, 45 GW of coal power plants will be retired and shut down. In addition, the Indonesian State-owned electricity company Perusahaan Listrik Negara seeks to cancel some coal plants under construction. However, despite the verbal statement and political decision, no regulation to phase out coal has been issued yet (International Energy Agency [IEA] 2022; Indonesia, Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources 2022; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] Clean Energy Finance and Investment Mobilisation Programme 2021). \u2022 The Electricity Supply Business Plan 2021\u20132030, published in October 2021, aims to achieve renewable energy capacity to account for 51.6 per cent of total power addition until 2030.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3465842b-0073-4ec1-8941-c4baf106e008": {"__data__": {"id_": "3465842b-0073-4ec1-8941-c4baf106e008", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1474438d93b272969f0f02993d387490e9525af410cb982eeed3ed5efebe9f46"}, "2": {"node_id": "ce05220a-358d-4e01-981b-9bb75120c481", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9d6b5b54bc8e8314a2a385c48c8a5303597432be1a68a2df2649d5f8fd223ebd"}}, "hash": "4037be7f576e275501422d8b1118be0dabfa7e1a656b37dd30efed57cbb3601a", "text": "Hydropower dominates the upcoming renewable plan by around 25.6 per cent, followed by solar (11.5 per cent), geothermal and other renewables (Indonesia, Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources 2021; OECD Clean Energy Finance and Investment Mobilisation Programme 2021).

The strategy outlines measures including energy-efficient or electric vehicles, low-carbon infrastructure and alternative fuels intended to reduce transport emissions by 1.2 per cent relative to total emissions in 2017 by 2030 (Russian Federation 2021a). \u2022 The Concept for the Development of Electric Vehicle Production was approved by the Russian Federation in August 2021, setting a target for EVs to make up at least 10 per cent of the Russian market by 2030. In addition to measures promoting EV production, the Government plans to stimulate demand by providing subsidies covering up to 25% of the price of domestically produced EVs (Russian Federation 2021b; Reuters 2021). \u2022 In August 2021, the Russian Government approved the concept for the Development of Hydrogen Energy. The plan presents strategic initiatives towards the development, use and export of low-carbon hydrogen energy (Russian Federation 2021a). 23 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window United States of America \u2022 In August 2022, the United States of America enacted the Inflation Reduction Act, projected to reduce GHG emissions by 1 Gt. The law makes major investments in clean energy technologies including utility-scale and distributed solar, wind and other renewable resources, existing zero-emitting nuclear plants, carbon capture facilities in the power and industrial sectors, light, medium and heavy-duty clean vehicles as well as heat pumps and other energy-efficient upgrades for homes and businesses. The Act also provides tax credits for emerging clean technologies like clean hydrogen production, direct air capture facilities and clean fuel production (United States of America, Congress 2022a; United States of America, Department of Energy 2022; Jenkins et al. 2022; Larsen et al. 2022; Mahajan et al. 2022). \u2022 The United States of America also enacted the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in November 2021, which makes US$27 billion in power grid and transmission investments, creates a new US$7.5 billion grant programme for EVs and alternative fuel infrastructure deployment, and provides US$3.5 billion and US$8 billion for direct air capture and clean hydrogen hubs, respectively, among other key investments (United States of America, Congress 2022b). \u2022 In 2021 and 2022, the Environmental Protection Agency and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration adopted standards for light-duty vehicles through model year 2026. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that the standards will avoid more than 3 billion tons of GHG emissions through 2050 (United States of America, Department of Transportation undated; United States of America, Environmental Protection Agency 2021; United States of America, Environmental Protection Agency 2022). 3.5 Details on G20 members\u2019 net-zero pledges A total of 19 G20 members have committed to achieving net-zero emissions, up from 17 as at COP 26. These targets vary in a number of important characteristics, including their legal status; timeline; explicit consideration of fairness and equity; which sources, sectors and gases they cover; whether they will allow the use of international offsets to count towards their achievement; the level of detail they provide on the role of carbon dioxide removal; and the nature of planning, review and reporting on target implementation (table 3.4). Figure 3.4 visualizes the direction needed for countries to get from their current emission levels to their NDC targets for 2030 and indicates their net-zero targets for each G20 member that has a net zero target (noting that France, Germany and Italy are only assessed as part of the European Union). Those G20 members whose emissions have already peaked will need to further accelerate their emission declines to their net-zero target year, while those members whose emissions will continue to increase through 2030 under the NDCs will require further policy shifts and investments (including adequate support to developing countries, where applicable) to achieve the emission reductions implied by their national net-zero targets. This illustration does not consider the relative merit in terms of the equity or fairness of the choices countries make regarding their nationally determined pathways to net zero. However, it highlights the discrepancy between current emissions, near-term NDC targets and long-term net-zero targets. This serves as a clear reminder to all G20 members, or indeed any country, that aspirational targets such as NDCs or net-zero targets need to be backed up with effective policies. It also serves as an important reminder that current evidence does not provide confidence that the nationally determined net-zero targets will be achieved. This has clear repercussions for the anticipated global temperature projections (see chapter 4). 24 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window Table 3.4 Details on net-zero targets of G20 members Sources: All indicators are based on a reconciliation of data from Climate Action Tracker (2022), Climate Watch (2022) and Net", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e977f0fd-28d8-45a9-8869-d1399aa8e6b3": {"__data__": {"id_": "e977f0fd-28d8-45a9-8869-d1399aa8e6b3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "36073cb521c77606cc3a105e239fc6cbaf8bf5c058b452c09d30032f4a7194a0"}, "3": {"node_id": "8dc2437c-7c0e-4864-a959-afe2624cab8a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cd3febdfbdaeed34dac940b2bcab7d55f2b0c0f154e5cd4ec33ead9725568474"}}, "hash": "670c2ed7024e4f2313e757486739dc52a720271a51f017b0dcab40a4cbb1f752", "text": "Zero Tracker (2022) with the following exceptions: \u201cCovers all sectors\u201d is based on Climate Watch (2022); \u201cReview process\u201d is based on Climate Action Tracker (2022); \u201cAnnual reporting\u201d is based on Net Zero Tracker (2022); \u201cRemovals transparency\u201d and \u201cReference to fairness\u201d are based on Climate Action Tracker (2022) and Net Zero Tracker (2022).

Or in other words, the gap between promised and needed emission reductions. The key questions assessed in this chapter are, what is the current best estimate of the emissions gap for 2030 considering the latest NDCs? What levels of global emissions are in line with the climate mitigation goals of the Paris Agreement? Where are we headed under current policies and various mitigation pledge scenarios in terms of global warming over the course of the century? The assembled scenarios reflect the latest findings from the reports released by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Working Groups I and III under the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) (Canadell et al. 2021; IPCC 2021; Byers et al. 2022; IPCC 2022b; Lecocq et al. 2022; Riahi et al. 2022), ensuring consistency with the most recent climate science and mitigation trajectory assumptions.

The updates mean that the estimates in this chapter cannot be directly compared with previous Emissions Gap Report estimates. However, differences in the estimates are explained in this chapter, and the report\u2019s central finding remains: current policies and NDCs are woefully insufficient to meet the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. The chapter first introduces the updated scenarios that underlie the quantification of the emissions gap (section 4.2). The emissions gap assessment for 2030 is presented in section 4.3, and the global temperature implications are discussed in section 4.4. 27 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window 4.2 Scenarios considered for the 2030 emissions gap assessment This section updates the three scenario categories considered for the 2030 emissions gap assessment. 2 The current policy scenario adjusts original modelling studies to account for different policy cut-off dates, which range from 2017 to 2020, and varying consideration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on socioeconomic drivers. 3 The below 1.5\u00b0C definition used in the 2022 Emissions Gap Report is consistent with the C1a category of the IPCC AR6 WGIII Summary for policymakers and selects scenarios based on both their temperature outcome and on whether they reach net-zero GHG emissions over the course of the century in line with the Paris Agreement article 4 (Schleussner et al. 2022). These categories comprise reference and current policies scenarios (section 4.2.1), new and updated NDC scenarios (4.2.2), and least-cost mitigation scenarios starting in 2020 consistent with specific temperature targets (4.2.3). All scenarios are summarized in table 4.1. Table 4.1 Summary of assessed scenarios Scenario Number of scenarios in set Global total emissions in 2030 (GtCO2e) Estimated temperature outcomes\u2020 Reference and current policies scenarios Reference or year 2010 policies 2010 This scenario only includes climate polices implemented up to 2010 and assumes no additional measures from 2010 onward. Current policies 2021 This scenario covers current policies and projects global GHG implications of climate mitigation policies adopted and implemented as of 2021. These scenarios account for the short-term and midterm socioeconomic impacts of COVID-192 (cut-off date: November 2021) and are adjusted for the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States of America. NDC scenarios Unconditional NDCs 2022 This scenario covers all the latest versions of the NDCs that have been indicated to be implemented without any explicit external support (cut-off date: 23 September 2022). Conditional NDCs 2022 In addition to the unconditional pledges, this scenario covers the latest versions of NDCs to be implemented conditional upon receiving international support (finance, technology transfer and/or capacity-building) (cut-off date: 23 September 2022). Mitigation scenarios consistent with keeping warming below specific temperature limits Below 2\u00b0C N/A Long-term least-cost pathway starting from 2020 and consistent with holding global warming below 2\u00b0C throughout the twenty-first century with at least 66% chance. Below 1.8\u00b0C N/A Long-term least-cost pathway starting from 2020 and consistent with holding global warming below 1.8\u00b0C throughout the twenty-first century with at least 66% chance. Below 1.5\u00b0C N/A Long-term least-cost pathway starting from 2020 and consistent with holding global warming below 1.5\u00b0C throughout the twenty-first century with limited or no overshoot.3 This implies global warming in 2100 being held below 1.5\u00b0C with at least 66% chance, while throughout the twenty-first century it is kept below 1.5\u00b0C with at least 33% chance. In addition, consistent with the Paris Agreement, these scenarios achieve net-zero GHG emissions in the second half of the century. 28 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window 4.2.1 Reference and current policies scenarios Two scenarios are considered: the reference or year 2010 policies scenario and the updated current policies scenario. The year 2010 policies scenario assumes that no additional climate mitigation policies are implemented after 2010. Global GHG emissions in this scenario are based on the scenarios assessed by the IPCC under AR6 WGIII category C8 (Byers et al. 2022; IPCC 2022a; Riahi et al. 2022). The estimated global emissions in 2030 under the year 2010 policies scenario is 66 GtCO2e (range: 64\u201368).

The scenario considers the impact of COVID-19 on GHG emissions projections, and the projections are adjusted to include the expected emission reductions from the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States of America (amounting to about 1 GtCO2e). The GHG emissions projections for the current policies scenarios were harmonized with 2015 emissions based on the IPCC AR6 historical emissions database (see box 4.1). The resulting median estimate of global GHG emissions in 2030 under current policies is 58 GtCO2e (range: 52\u201360). This is 3 GtCO2e higher than the estimate of the 2021 United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Emissions Gap Report (accounting for the impact of the United States of America). About half of the increase is due to the harmonization, about one quarter to the change in global warming potential (GWP), and the remaining increase is due to the methodological choice of only selecting model studies that explicitly account for the most recent current polices and NDC estimates (table 4.2). 4.2.2 NDC scenarios The NDC scenarios cover the most recent versions of the NDCs submitted, with a cut-off date of 23 September 2022. The estimates are based on the studies used in the IPCC AR6 WGIII assessment (see table 4.2 of Lecocq et al. 2022); however, to reflect NDCs submitted since the IPCC publication, updated estimates have been provided. The data come from four model groups with cut-off dates ranging from November 2021 to February 2022 across studies (Climate Action Tracker 2021; Keramidas et al. 2021; den Elzen et al. 2022; Meinshausen et al. 2022). To include the implications of new or updated NDCs submitted by certain G20 members after these cut-off dates (i.e. Australia, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Republic of Korea and the United Kingdom), NDC emission estimates were recalculated based on the historical emissions data used in respective studies (following the same approach as in chapter 3). The latest versions of the unconditional NDCs result in an annual emissions reduction of about 0.7 GtCO2e compared with last year\u2019s report (table 4.2, NDC updates column). As with the reference and current policies scenarios, the NDC scenarios were also harmonized with historical 2015 emissions (see box 4.1).

Box 4.1 Harmonization of emissions data Historical emission inventories and emissions projections from global integrated assessment models differ and are associated with uncertainties (see chapter 2, Dhakal et al. 2022). To ensure comparability, data sources in this year\u2019s report were harmonized through the following three steps: 1.

Emissions data from NDC estimates (based on a national inventory approach) and global integrated assessment modelling scenarios (consistent with a bookkeeping approach) were made conceptually more comparable in terms of the land use, land-use change and forestry emissions definition that they use, based on the harmonization presented in Grassi et al. (2021) (see chapter 2 and appendix A for further details). 3. The difference between historical emissions assumed in NDC studies and the historical emissions database of the IPCC AR6 was resolved by applying the modelled absolute change between the harmonization year and the 2030 projections of NDC studies to the historical emissions database of the IPCC AR6 for 2015. These methodological updates improve the comparability of values across chapters, but it is important to note that they limit the comparability of this year\u2019s estimate with those of previous editions of the Emissions Gap Report. 4.2.3 Mitigation scenarios keeping warming below specified temperature limits To assess the emissions and implementation gaps in 2030, current policies and NDC scenarios are compared with least-cost mitigation scenarios that are consistent with keeping warming below specific temperature limits. Least- cost mitigation scenarios are in line with the principle of the UNFCCC that \u201cpolicies and measures to deal with climate change should be cost-effective so as to ensure global benefits at the lowest possible cost\u201d (UNFCCC 1992). However, least-cost mitigation scenarios generally do not account for the economic co-benefits and avoided damages of mitigation (see box 4.2). Emission pathways from the literature are categorized according to their projected peak global warming outcomes relative to pre-industrial levels over the course of this century. Three scenarios are defined to reflect the three different levels of warming relevant for the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement: 2\u00b0C, 1.8\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C (see tables 4.1 and 4.3).

There are two main reasons for this (table 4.2). The most important is the update of the scenario literature evidence base collected in support of the IPCC AR6 (Byers et al. 2022; Riahi et al. 2022). The rate of emissions decline after 2020 in the below 1.5\u00b0C scenario4 is similar to that of the IPCC Special Report on global warming of 1.5\u00b0C and the IPCC AR6. However, the AR6 scenarios show higher GHG emissions in 2030 because the emission reductions generally start from higher levels in 2020, as reflected in the most recent historical emissions inventories (IPCC 2022a; IPCC 2022b). More scenarios in the IPCC AR6 scenario database also end up closer to the temperature limit in the below 1.5\u00b0C scenario category (see table 4.3), which again results in higher 2030 emission values.5 A second, more minor contributing factor, which affects all scenario categories, is the update to the most recent IPCC AR6 values of GWP100. 31 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window Box 4.2 Putting cost estimates from least-cost emissions scenarios in context Least-cost scenarios are constructed to achieve global emission reductions at the lowest cost possible. However, estimates of mitigation costs vary extensively and depend critically on the reference and mitigation scenario assumptions and data parameterization chosen (K\u00f6berle et al. 2021; Riahi et al. 2022). If a reference scenario in which global and local economies are at their efficiency frontier is assumed, climate policies will inevitably entail macroeconomic costs. However, the literature, including the latest IPCC assessment, illustrates that this is a stylized and unrealistic assumption (Riahi et al. 2022). An economy at its efficiency frontier implies no fossil fuel subsidies, no taxation that distorts the allocation of labour, no \u201cmisallocation or under-utilization of production factors such as involuntary unemployment\u201d, and no \u201cimperfect information or non-rational behaviours\u201d (Riahi et al. 2022). Each of these economic imperfections are common across real-world economies at all levels of development. However, the models that produce least-cost pathways rarely represent all these aspects and hence disregard them in their model estimates of mitigation costs. This results in mitigation cost estimates that are biased high (K\u00f6berle et al. 2021; Riahi et al. 2022). Studies that model a reference economy below the efficiency frontier find that a low-carbon transformation can result in economic stimulus and increase economic growth, conditional on green investments not replacing investment in other parts of the economy (Pollitt and Mercure 2018; Mercure et al. 2019; Riahi et al. 2022). Because of regional differences in governance, development and societal and technological context, mitigation cost estimates differ between countries. For example, under the idealized assumption that emission reductions are achieved through a globally uniform carbon price, countries with carbon-intensive economies or fossil fuel exporting countries would have relatively higher macroeconomic costs as their economies require a deeper transformation (Stern, Pezzey and Lambie 2012; Tavoni et al. 2015; B\u00f6hringer et al. 2021). For a detailed discussion see Riahi et al. (2022). In addition, mitigation cost estimates of least-cost pathways disregard the economic benefits that accrue through avoided damages and societal co-benefits of a low-carbon transition, such as improved public health because of improved air quality (K\u00f6berle et al. 2021; Riahi et al. 2022). Even when considering least-cost mitigation scenarios where costs are biased high, these benefits likely outstrip the modelled costs (see figure 4.1) (Riahi et al. 2022). For example, one study found that health co-benefits outweigh the policy cost of achieving fair national contributions to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C in China and India, with the modelled costs compensated by health co-benefits (Markandya et al. 2018). In conclusion, typically an ideal, perfectly working economy is assumed when mitigation costs are quantified, while the economic co-benefits and avoided damages are unaccounted for. As a result, modelled mitigation cost estimates typically only provide limited real-world insights about the net burden to economies or society.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f6e59843-38ba-4090-92b3-bc23c7647a0a": {"__data__": {"id_": "f6e59843-38ba-4090-92b3-bc23c7647a0a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9bedee8fdfde5d8fbd3f185deabb33e7f4e7e6c1e58cbefb331bf3f54404e37c"}, "2": {"node_id": "efa50935-01ee-403b-8e96-a0c0a41d00bf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4f1270e94357653dc448cbd25dfff834986af605806ffdcd5ebcba219b388c2f"}}, "hash": "662ebb430167e1cda5ac12966a705f0cb28aa56c3cc1e9cb6d27eb7699575d9a", "text": "In all cases, these modelled costs occur in a world of continued economic development and growth.

(2020); and an additional estimate of co-benefits from air-quality improvements from stringent mitigation following from Markandya et al. (2018). Estimated GDP reductions from economy-wide climate damages are based on the IPCC AR6 WGII Cross- Working Group Box on Economics (O\u2019Neill et al. 2022). The latter are quantified for when a specific level of global warming is reached for the first time, irrespective of when exactly this takes place. Note that under current policies, global warming by 2050 can range up to about 2.0\u20132.5\u00b0C. Global warming of 3.0\u00b0C would only be achieved later in the century. Notes: Dark lines in global baseline GDP growth projections and modelled mitigation costs are median estimates, with dark and light ranges representing 25\u201375 per cent and 5\u201395 per cent confidence intervals respectively. Mitigation co-benefit estimates cannot be aggregated across sources. 4.3 The emissions gap The emissions gap for 2030 is defined as the difference between estimated global GHG emissions resulting from full implementation of NDCs, and global total GHG emissions under least-cost scenarios that keep global warming to below 2\u00b0C, 1.8\u00b0C or 1.5\u00b0C with varying levels of chance (see table 4.4). This section updates the gap based on the scenarios described in section 4.2. Figure 4.2 shows the emissions gap for 2030, with table 4.4 indicating the details. While the latest NDCs narrow the gap slightly compared with previous NDCs, they are highly insufficient to bridge the gap. Altogether, they reduce expected emissions in 2030 under current policies by only 5 per cent. Meeting all conditions and implementing the conditional NDCs would take this reduction to 10 per cent, whereas 30 or 45 per cent is needed for 2.0\u00b0C or 1.5\u00b0C, respectively. Full implementation of unconditional NDCs is estimated to result in a gap to the 1.5\u00b0C scenario of 23 GtCO2e (range: 20\u201324). This is about 5 GtCO2e smaller than estimated in the 2021 report (UNEP 2021) \u2013 a difference that is almost entirely due to updates to the 1.5\u00b0C scenarios (see table 4.2). As outlined in section 4.2.3, these show higher emissions in 2030 because they start their reductions from higher 2020 emission levels, reflecting a global delay in ambitious climate action. This delay is not without consequences: on average the below 1.5\u00b0C scenarios now have a lower chance of effectively keeping warming to 1.5\u00b0C . If the conditional NDCs are also fully implemented, the emissions gap to the 1.5\u00b0C scenario is reduced by about 3 GtCO2e. 0 50 Baseline GDP growth from 2020 to 2050 Modelled GDP reductions (losses) in 2050 relative to median baseline GDP growth Limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot (IPCC AR6 WGIII category C1) Limit warming to 2.0\u00b0C (>67%) with no or limited overshoot (IPCC AR6 WGIII category C3) Modelled co-bene\ufb01ts (gains) in 2050 relative to median baseline GDP growth Estimated economy-wide climate damages relative to median baseline GDP growth 100 150 200 Change in global GDP (%) 25th\u201375th percentile 5th\u201395th percentile 25th\u201375th percentile 5th\u201395th percentile Modelled co-bene\ufb01ts (gains) Median Median Climate damage Avoided crop yield losses Avoided lost working days Public health bene\ufb01ts of\u2026 dietary change Global coal phase-out Air quality improvements 1.5\u00b0C 2.0\u00b0C 2.5\u00b0C 3.0\u00b0C Baseline growth 2020\u20132050 Modelled mitigation costs Mitigation co-bene\ufb01t estimates from: Estimated costs of climate change of least cost pathways assuming an idealized, perfectly ef\ufb01cient global economy and disregarding co-bene\ufb01ts and avoided impacts for various levels of global warming relative to pre-industrial levels 33 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window The emissions gap between unconditional NDCs and below 2\u00b0C pathways is about 15 GtCO2e (range: 12\u201316 GtCO2e), which is about 2 GtCO2e larger than last year.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c031e805-a15a-46af-8ec2-9d0bdccfd416": {"__data__": {"id_": "c031e805-a15a-46af-8ec2-9d0bdccfd416", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "18af8a78c454a0b464b908ca04ad3f53311b5a8cc200e76faf2068706869c9e5"}, "2": {"node_id": "051840fa-2aad-42d4-ab58-a2be0f07df13", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8f24d8133af6e3dbcb8c2f02522956e59ebad8d8357da6f5c28febe577a87977"}}, "hash": "ad5e8d3862197dcf19157844269f69daaf949a2ea14b1d6e36661ef5be6d84d3", "text": "The main reason for this increase in the assessed gap for 2\u00b0C is that this year\u2019s report corrects for discrepancies in historical emissions through harmonization (see table 4.2 and box 4.1).

In conclusion, the central message remains: NDCs are highly insufficient to put the world on a path to meeting the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. Furthermore, countries are not yet on track to achieve these globally insufficient NDCs. The implementation gap, which is the difference between emissions expected under the current policies scenario and those needed to achieve the NDCs, is estimated to be about 3 GtCO2e and 6 GtCO2e for the unconditional and conditional NDC scenarios respectively (table 4.4). These gap estimates are 1 GtCO2e and 3 GtCO2e larger than last year, mainly because NDCs have been updated while policies have not yet followed suit.

Numbers are rounded to full GtCO2e. GHG emissions have been aggregated with the IPCC AR6 values of GWP100. Box 4.3 The role of rapid methane emission reductions In conjunction with CO2 emission reductions, rapid reductions in emissions from methane and other short- lived climate pollutants are critical to lower peak warming, reduce the likelihood of overshoot and decrease the reliance on CO2 removal methods to limit warming later in this century (IPCC 2021; IPCC 2022). Global average methane concentrations in the atmosphere have increased by 162 per cent compared with pre-industrial levels (WMO 2021). This increase is largely driven by anthropogenic sources, mainly enteric fermentation of livestock and manure, rice cultivation, waste, and fossil fuel exploration (Jackson et al. 2020). Methane has a significantly higher global warming potential than CO2 (80 and 83 times higher over 20 years for biogenic and fossil methane, respectively), but a much shorter atmospheric lifetime (about 12 years) (Forster et al. 2021). Reducing methane emissions therefore affects warming rates in the near term, resulting in benefits for ecosystems and people, and enabling humans to adapt to climate change (UNEP 2021). Estimates of the remaining global carbon budget for 1.5\u00b0C assume that methane is strongly reduced by at least 30 per cent, 40 per cent and 50 per cent relative to 2020 levels in 2030, 2040 and 2050 respectively (IPCC 2018).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e676af3-4e67-416f-a457-48aec381ade4": {"__data__": {"id_": "2e676af3-4e67-416f-a457-48aec381ade4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "03c94729377ca7cf68549ff77cd4f077beae3fa747dbab15604c194be3b8039a"}, "2": {"node_id": "7a3b3549-e4cd-473d-9f38-2c97d12d68da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "940f8b1ae49046d3af4dd95c61e944f39b8a6bef8aa2a0c09210519bcd027ee1"}}, "hash": "81cb9e875790848d86edfeabed3c8872941ac4ac5068b19257d9702363a1d843", "text": "Every ca 100 Mt shortfall in methane reductions compared with these benchmarks diminishes the already very small cumulative remaining carbon budget by around 450 GtCO2 (UNEP 2021).

To realize this opportunity, a Global Methane Pledge was announced at United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP) 26, with the aim to reduce global anthropogenic methane emissions by at least 30 per cent by 2030 from 2020 levels. So far, 122 countries have joined the pledge, covering half of global methane emissions and nearly two thirds of the global economy. Large methane emitters such as Australia, China, India, Iran, and the Russian Federation have yet to join the pledge, and efforts to track its implementation are still in the process of being established. 35 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window Looking beyond 2030, figure 4.3 projects global GHG emissions out to 2050 under different scenarios and indicates the associated global warming implications over this century (see section 4.3). The figure illustrates the substantial increase in the emissions gap for 2050 if climate efforts implied by current policies and NDC scenarios are continued without further strengthening. Implementation of net-zero targets by around mid-century would significantly reduce these gaps, but even then, gaps with the 1.5\u00b0C scenarios would remain. Figure 4.3 Projections of GHG emissions under different scenarios to 2050 and indications of emissions gap and global warming implications over this century (medians only) 4.4 Temperature implications of the emissions gap Neither current policies nor NDCs put emissions on track to limit global warming to the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. The extent of the shortfall in ambition and implementation can also be expressed in terms of the estimated resulting global warming. The same method is applied as in last year\u2019s report (see box 4.1 in UNEP 2021) to project the emissions implications of current policies and NDCs from 2030 out to 2100. The global warming implications of these emissions are subsequently assessed with a climate model that captures the latest climate science assessment and uncertainties of the IPCC AR6 (Smith et al. 2018; Forster et al. 2021). This approach allows accounting for the uncertainties in current policies and NDCs, the degree to which climate action continues beyond 2030, and the uncertainties of how the climate responds to these emissions. As table 4.5 and figure 4.3 show, a continuation of the level of climate change mitigation efforts implied by current unconditional NDCs is estimated to limit warming over the twenty-first century to about 2.6\u00b0C (range: 1.9\u20133.1\u00b0C) with a 66 per cent chance, and warming is expected to increase further after 2100 as CO2 emissions are not yet projected to reach net-zero levels. Continuing the efforts of conditional NDCs lowers these projections by around 0.2\u00b0C to 2.4\u00b0C (range: 1.8\u20133.0\u00b0C) for a 66 per cent chance. Because current policies are insufficient to meet even the unconditional NDCs, a continuation of current policies would result in about 0.2\u00b0C higher estimates of 2.8\u00b0C (range: 1.9\u20133.3\u00b0C) for a 66 per cent chance.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b8d1e81-5e52-4c2d-8155-59d68707297e": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b8d1e81-5e52-4c2d-8155-59d68707297e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2dd3bcc1ff0c2a8c826bdcbb71b6d5160b449096a45c4f2292f3384cc28ac2b4"}, "2": {"node_id": "1c92e6eb-ef84-4852-a91d-6e5765b7683d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8a7f72ee8ce82200b63c9f269d133e853c50a9d2ece82857df180b3563c7324a"}}, "hash": "bd45e345ff8e7e559f9dd18da69ae86c7eaf6ff1820a5fb4ffd12891634bfa0f", "text": "2\u00b0C pathway 1.5\u00b0C pathway Current policies scenario: 2.8\u00b0C (66% chance) Estimated global warming over the twenty-first century Conditional NDC scenario: 2.4\u00b0C (66% chance) Unconditional NDC scenario: 2.6\u00b0C (66% chance) Unconditional NDC scenario with net-zero targets: 1.8\u00b0C (66% chance) GtCO2e Conditional NDC scenario with net-zero targets: 1.8\u00b0C (66% chance) 2010 policies scenario Area of figure 4.2 Indicative emissions gap to 2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C pathways for the conditional NDC scenario Indicative emissions gap to 2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C pathways for the unconditional NDC scenario 20 10 0 30 40 50 60 70 2015 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 2045 2050 36 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window Table 4.5 Estimated global warming implications over the course of the twenty-first century under different scenarios and likelihoods Scenario Estimated global warming over the twenty-first century with various chances (median and range) 66% 50% 90% Current policies 2.8\u00b0C (range: 1.9\u20133.3\u00b0C) 2.6\u00b0C (range: 1.7\u20133.0\u00b0C) 3.3\u00b0C (range: 2.3\u20133.9\u00b0C) Unconditional NDCs 2.6\u00b0C (range: 1.9\u20133.1\u00b0C) 2.4\u00b0C (range: 1.7\u20132.9\u00b0C) 3.1\u00b0C (range: 2.3\u20133.7\u00b0C) Conditional NDCs 2.4\u00b0C (range: 1.8\u20133.0\u00b0C) 2.2\u00b0C (range: 1.7\u20132.7\u00b0C) 2.8 (range: 2.2\u20133.5\u00b0C) Unconditional NDCs and long- term net-zero targets 1.8\u00b0C (range: 1.8\u20132.1\u00b0C) 1.7\u00b0C (range: 1.7\u20131.9\u00b0C) 2.1 (range: 2.0\u20132.5\u00b0C) Conditional NDCs and long- term net-zero targets 1.8\u00b0C (range: 1.7\u20131.9\u00b0C) 1.7\u00b0C (range: 1.6\u20131.8\u00b0C) 2.0\u00b0C (range: 2.0\u20132.3\u00b0C) 6 This estimate assumes countries\u2019 emissions remain constant once their net-zero target is achieved.

Achieving net-zero targets in addition to unconditional NDCs results in projected global warming being held to 1.8\u00b0C (range: 1.8\u2013 2.1\u00b0C) with a 66 per cent chance. Assuming that conditional NDCs and pledges are achieved and followed by net-zero targets, global warming is similarly projected to be kept to 1.8\u00b0C (range: 1.7\u20131.9\u00b0C) with a 66 per cent chance. However, in most cases neither current policies nor NDCs currently trace a credible path from 2030 towards the achievement of national net-zero targets (see chapter 3). These temperature projections are slightly lower than those reported in the 2021 Emissions Gap Report, because the latest NDCs, if fully implemented, lower 2030 emissions estimates by about 0.7 GtCO2e (see table 4.3) and because the inclusion of more countries in the net-zero analysis further lowers emissions projections over the course of the century. The effect of the methodological updates for the gap estimations is much lower, as similar methodological steps were already used in the temperature projections in earlier reports. As illustrated above, global warming levels only get close to the Paris Agreement temperature goal when full implementation of the highly uncertain net-zero targets is assumed in addition to the NDC scenarios. In addition, there is still significant uncertainty about how much warming we will experience over the course of this century. Figure 4.4 shows the range of global warming outcomes under three scenarios (current policies, unconditional NDCs and unconditional NDCs combined with net-zero targets announced by countries). The figure illustrates that the risk of levels of warming clearly beyond 2\u00b0C remains, even under the optimistic assumption of current climate promises expressed in NDCs and net-zero targets. Current policy projections globally lead to about a 20 per cent chance of global warming exceeding 3\u00b0C. If measures are put in place that ensure current NDC and net-zero targets will be achieved, the risk of exceeding 3\u00b0C is strongly reduced. Taking more ambitious climate actions by 2030 is urgently needed and is of utmost importance for getting the world on track to meeting the Paris Agreement. 37 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window Figure 4.4 Range of global warming projections for three key scenarios Range of global warming outcomes projected if current policies (left), unconditional NDCs (middle), and unconditional NDCs combined with net-zero targets announced by countries (right) are achieved. ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? higher than 4\u00b0C 3.0\u20134.0\u00b0C 2.5\u20133.0\u00b0C 2.0\u20132.5\u00b0C 1.5\u20132.0\u00b0C below 1.5\u00b0C 1% 7% 37% 16% 43% 28% 36% 19% 12% 20% 61% 17% 1% 1% Current policies Unconditional NDCs with net-zero targets Unconditional NDCs 38 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window Transformations needed to achieve the Paris Agreement in electricity supply, industry, buildings and transportation Lead authors: Niklas H\u00f6hne (NewClimate Institute, Germany), Kelly Levin (Bezos Earth Fund, United States of America), Joyashree Roy (Asian Institute of Technology, Thailand; Jadavpur University, India) Contributing authors: Stephen Naimoli (World Resources Institute, United States of America), Louise Jeffery (NewClimate Institute, Germany), Judit Hecke (NewClimate Institute, Germany), Joshua Miller (International Council on Clean Transportation, United States of America) 5 5.1 Introduction In light of the magnitude of the emissions gap, wide- ranging, large-scale, rapid and systemic transformation is now necessary to achieve the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. To inform action, the emissions gap can be translated into sectoral transformations that bend the emissions trajectory by 2030 and lead to zero emissions in the longer term. The challenge is that multiple major transformations must be initiated in this decade, simultaneously across all systems. Transformations of the way we power our homes and businesses; transport people, goods and services; grow and consume food; build our cities; and manage our lands, are among the required shifts, which need to take place while simultaneously improving the livelihoods of the poorest including women and minorities, and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.

Sets of actions that are most critical to advance, as well as sets of actions that should be avoided given the barriers they create to accelerating change, are offered, while highlighting what various actors can do to accelerate action. The chapter presents a global agenda. While the list of priority actions is relevant for most countries, the chapter does not offer recommendations at the national or regional level. Each nation varies in its resources, capacity and emissions composition, and accordingly, mitigation priorities and opportunities will vary. 5.2 Initiating, accelerating and accomplishing the transformation towards zero emissions A significant challenge is that the required transformations have to happen in all sectors and all countries in parallel. The sequencing of actions can vary slightly by country, but as the remaining carbon budget is so limited that the transition needs to be initiated at an accelerated pace immediately, everywhere. Sectoral transformation based on technological change can follow an S-curve path, with limited change initially, followed by sudden exponential growth and then by saturation (figure 5.1, also see the glossary). With the clear goal of transformation towards zero emissions, there are three broad areas of actions that need to be undertaken in all emitting sectors: 39 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window \u25cf Avoid lock-in: Decisions made today can define emissions trajectories for decades to come. For example, a building lasts 80 years on average; a coal- fired power plant 45 years; a cement plant 40 years (Erickson, Lazarus and Tempest 2015). Pipelines and gas connections create decade-long dependencies. Interventions can also lock in behaviour and policies that reinforce incumbent systems (Seto et al. 2016). Actions today that lock in a high-energy and high- carbon future for decades must be avoided, including avoiding new fossil fuel infrastructure for electricity and industry, car-centred city or regional planning, and inefficient new buildings. These actions do not always result in immediate emission reductions, but are fundamental for the long-term transition. \u25cf Initiate zero-carbon technological advancements: Zero-carbon technologies, market structures and planning for a just transformation typically need to be advanced in the beginning of a transition and are fundamental for the long-term transition. For many transformations, it will also be necessary to phase out incumbent fossil fuel-intensive industries at the same time as zero-carbon alternatives are scaled up. Focusing only on the latter is risky, as zero-carbon alternatives may not entirely replace new demand or existing infrastructure. \u25cf Sustain deep reductions: For sectors and technologies that are advanced on the transformation curve, deep reductions need to be sustained, for example through further expansion of renewables, electrification of industry, electric vehicles and increasing the retrofit rate of buildings. Figure 5.1 Selected important transformation interventions (green) and things to avoid (red) grouped by \u201cavoiding lock-in\u201d and different stages of the transformation S-curve Notes: See sections 5.5\u20135.8 for more details. The ability to achieve the transformations necessary depends on how a series of interrelated barriers and drivers of progress are approached. These include the following (Boehm et al. 2021, based on Olsson et al. 2004; Geels and Schot 2007; Chapin et al. 2010; Folke et al. 2010; Westley et al. 2011; Levin et al. 2012; O\u2019Brien and Sygna 2013; Moore et al. 2014; Few et al. 2017; Patterson et al. 2017; Sterl et al. 2017; H\u00f6lscher et al. 2018; Reyers et al. 2018; Victor, Geels and Sharpe 2019; Initiative for Climate Action Transparency 2020; Levin et al. 2020; Otto et al.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ef99b8ea-cd2a-45ff-8fa8-cc98e6b5825b": {"__data__": {"id_": "ef99b8ea-cd2a-45ff-8fa8-cc98e6b5825b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "17f4df52a225e335d75c7ca05d5f5526d36f3792e42917a0ea3ae701c740933e"}, "2": {"node_id": "69c5c1a2-0503-424f-b8df-d500f1b7c347", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bddc4be3e8dd2759fe7ec3c018f0901d01e7ec6bf2bb21cf0f872edd1fedbce2"}}, "hash": "8406b9fa67525a20d033c72baa0c3bf046fb5823db57755395b7aa35a976e12e", "text": "2020; Otto et al. 2020; Sharpe and Lenton 2021): \u25cf Institutions: Institutions guide decision-making, and their design can stymie or accelerate progress. \u25cf Policies and incentives: Strong regulations such as mandates and standards, and incentives such as tax breaks, can either steer towards low-carbon alternatives or perpetuate an uneven playing field for new entrants.

At the same time, entrenched interests present significant barriers to advancing systems change. Involving diverse sets of champions can help shape durable outcomes. \u25cf Innovation: Advances in technology, practice and approaches can help leapfrog current ones and hasten rates of decarbonization (Boehm et al. 2021). The enabling environment for innovation, e.g. spending on research and development and intellectual property rights, can be designed in a way that either advances an innovation agenda or stymies progress. \u25cf Exogenous shocks/change: Conflicts, recessions, elections, etc., create openings for advancing change, or close doors to making progress. Preparing for these openings can help ensure that transformational change is catalysed rather than stalled. 5.3 Electricity supply Achieving the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement requires rapid global transformation of the power system, which is the single largest source of energy-related CO2 emissions globally, covering 42 per cent of total energy- related emissions (International Energy Agency [IEA] 2021c). At least four shifts need to occur to decarbonize power: (1) steeply accelerating the share of zero-carbon power, (2) phasing out unabated coal and gas generation, (3) adapting grid/storage and demand management, and (4) ensuring reliable energy access for all (Boehm et al. 2022). (1) Steeply accelerate the share of zero-carbon power in electricity generation: The share of zero-carbon power in electricity generation should be between 65 and 92 per cent by 2030, and between 98 and 100 per cent by 2050 (Monteith and Menon 2020; IEA 2021e; International Renewable Energy Agency [IRENA] 2021; Boehm et al. 2022). (2) Phase out unabated coal and gas generation: The share of generation from unabated coal needs to fall to zero or near zero in 2030, requiring the pace of change to accelerate by about six times in the next eight years (IEA 2021e; IRENA 2021; Boehm et al. 2022). To be aligned with 1.5\u00b0C, the share of generation from unabated natural gas needs to fall to 17 per cent in 2030 before being phased out by 2040\u20132050, requiring a turnaround from its current upward trend (IEA 2021b; IRENA 2021; Boehm et al. 2022). (3) Adapt grid/storage and demand management: A decarbonized power system relying primarily on renewables will require different grid systems than exist today. Flexibility will be key in decentralized supply, storage and demand, given the characteristics of wind and solar. (4) Ensure reliable energy access for all: Currently, 10 per cent of the world\u2019s population has no access to electricity and over 40 per cent has unreliable access (Ayaburi et al. 2020; World Bank 2022). Ensuring universal energy access must be part of the shift to a global clean energy system.

AVOID NEW FOSSIL FUEL INFRASTRUCTURE: Building new fossil fuel infrastructure needs to be avoided, as it locks in fossil fuel dependency and greenhouse gas emissions for decades, in particular for coal and gas (Falk, Gaffney et al. 2020; Clarke et al. 2022). AVOID FOSSIL FUEL SUBSIDIES: Fossil fuel sub- sidies are still widely applied and stand in the way of the transformation. It is important to eliminate these subsidies in a socially acceptable manner and not to introduce new ones (Falk, Gaffney et al. 2020; Clarke et al. 2022). 42 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window 2 ELECTRICITY SECTOR TRANSFORMATION \u2013 RECOMMENDATIONS BY ACTOR GROUP + Remove fossil fuel subsidies in a socially acceptable manner: While all G20 members have pledged to remove fossil fuel subsidies, all G20 members still apply some fossil fuel subsidies. Due to the energy crisis, many have decreased taxes on fossil fuels, which is a form of new fossil fuel subsidies (Falk, Gaffney et al. 2020; CAT 2022b; Clarke et al. 2022). + Remove barriers to the expansion of renewables: Allow production for own use, accelerate planning and provision of sites, remove bureaucratic hurdles, regulate grid access and connection, and educate workers (Falk, Gaffney et al. 2020). + Stop expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure: This is necessary to avoid lock-in of continued high emissions or expanding stranded assets (IEA 2021e). Many coal power plants are still planned globally (Global Energy Monitor et al. 2022), and the current energy crisis has led to a gold rush for new fossil gas infrastructure (CAT 2022b). + Plan for a just fossil fuel phase-out: All governments need to plan for fossil fuel phase-out well ahead and in a socially just manner (Falk, Gaffney et al. 2020). Governments should quantify any international support they need. + Adapt market rules of electricity system for high shares of renewables: Adapt the electricity market to cope with the fundamentally different situation of large shares of electricity only being available under certain weather conditions (Falk, Gaffney et al. 2020). + Cooperate on and support a just fossil fuel phase-out: National governments need to cooperate on just fossil fuel phase-out plans (IEA 2021e). Donor governments and multilateral development banks can target support for jobs, skills and investments (IEA et al. 2022). South Africa is an example, where a set of donors provide US$8.5 billion for a just transition away from coal (Mason, Shalal and Rumney 2021). Donor governments should also facilitate expert exchanges, capacity- building and support for policy reforms, and leverage both public and private \ufb01 nance (IEA et al. 2022). + Support international initiatives on emissions-free electricity and power system \ufb02 exibility and interconnection solutions: Governments should initiate, sign and implement international initiatives on coal phase-out, the end of fossil fuel production and the end of \ufb01 nancing fossil fuel infrastructure, and on scaling renewable electricity, including energy storage, smart grids and interconnection efforts (IEA et al. 2022). + Agree to higher energy performance standards: In consultation with industry, governments can cooperate on higher minimum energy performance standards for high energy-consuming appliances, coupled with support for implementation of such standards. This can cut costs and growth in demand (IEA et al. 2022). + Set 100 per cent renewable targets: Subnational governments can create demand for renewable electricity by setting 100 per cent renewable targets (Falk, Gaffney et al. 2020). + Plan for a just fossil fuel phase-out: Subnational governments need to plan for fossil fuel phase-out well ahead and in a socially just manner (Falk, Gaffney et al. 2020).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ab7af338-95fe-4d49-be16-980b17ce4405": {"__data__": {"id_": "ab7af338-95fe-4d49-be16-980b17ce4405", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "02240d6e6044ba2673e1b21b47f5f2295b288b1b56ceb62bbaf9c7a52068952b"}, "2": {"node_id": "58fc6991-eef1-48f3-8295-c1a55d0ffc6a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d5f0e753981a081636047663f877bfcbea3125685459dcf3bba2956e1e2a7283"}}, "hash": "b6ff9c1ca6c6ac833b491c15efcd6e5ab0f9e520d34e6e568c52236fe19ca650", "text": "2020). + Support a 100 per cent renewable electricity future: Businesses should purchase 100 per cent renewable power with high quality power purchase agreements or with own production (not through renewable energy credits), electrify their energy end-use, and provide demand \ufb02 exibility, on-site storage, training and skills (Falk, Gaffney et al. 2020; Day et al. 2022). + Engage with or divest from fossil fuel electricity utilities: Investors need to take responsibility for their shares and engage with fossil fuel electricity utilities to incentivize change, or divest from these assets. + Do not invest in or insure new fossil fuel infrastructure: Investors, banks and insurers should refrain from investing in, supporting or insuring new fossil fuel infra- structure (Falk, Gaffney et al. 2020). + Purchase 100 per cent renewable electricity: Citizens with the economic power to do so should create demand for renewable energy", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "995a5583-fade-4efd-98ee-77358ba947b9": {"__data__": {"id_": "995a5583-fade-4efd-98ee-77358ba947b9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "891a6ca8250fe8ac4916629520e470031c2b63a6cb1159a6cd4d7c57ce80966f"}, "3": {"node_id": "bbe48f3e-c873-4c67-a44f-837811eb2971", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3b18eebbb9e07e0d09fed18f257d913e28ea856c8c2662f5fb343c2f1db3c12d"}}, "hash": "a577dce915930969a09f3ab1a601fc6e16310110db61303787e4230e6bdb7853", "text": "by purchasing 100 per cent renewable power from high quality providers (Falk, Gaffney et al. 2020). NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION SUBNATIONAL GOVERNMENTS BUSINESSES INVESTORS, PRIVATE AND DEVELOPMENT BANKS CITIZENS Table 5.2 Immediate actions to accelerate the transformation of the electricity sector by actor groups 43 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window 5.4 Industry The industry sector is the largest contributor to global emissions when direct and indirect emissions are included, and the second-largest contributor when only direct emissions are considered (IPCC 2022). To date, efforts to decrease emissions have mainly focused on improved energy efficiency and application of best available technologies. As many industrial processes have already reached maximum theoretically attainable energy efficiency, the key transformations needed to bring the industry sector to a Paris-compatible pathway include (1) electrifying industry and transform production processes, using (2) new fuels, and (3) specific solutions for hard-to-abate sectors; (4) accelerating material efficiency and scaling up energy efficiency everywhere, and (5) promote circular material flow. (1) Electrify industry: To get on track for the Paris Agreement, the share of electricity in industry\u2019s final energy demand must increase to 35 per cent in 2030 and 50\u201355 per cent in 2050 (CAT 2020). The share of electricity reached 28.5 per cent in 2019, but decreased slightly to 28.4 per cent in 2020 (IEA 2021b). (2) Reduce demand for and decrease carbon intensity of global cement and steel production: Demand reduction, substitution and carbon management are crucial for decarbonizing the industrial sector. The carbon intensity of global cement production needs to be reduced by 40 per cent from 2015 levels by 2030, and at least 85\u201391 per cent by 2050 (CAT 2020). The carbon intensity of global steel production needs to be reduced by 25\u201330 per cent from 2015 levels by 2030, and 93\u2013100 per cent by 2050 (CAT 2020). (3) Grow and integrate green hydrogen production capacity: There is vast potential for green hydrogen to help decarbonize several sectors, especially the hard-to-abate energy-intensive industry sectors that cannot use electricity. Green hydrogen production capacity needs to grow to 0.23\u2013 3.5 Mt (25 GW cumulative electrolyser capacity) by 2026 (in order to achieve costs below US$2/kg) and then massively scale up to 500\u2013800 Mt (2,630\u201320,000 GW cumulative electrolyser capacity) by 2050 (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 2021), up from almost 0 tons today (IEA 2021d). (4) Accelerate and scale up material and energy efficiency: Demand for materials has grown 2.5\u20133.5 times over the past 25 years (Bashmakov et al. 2022). Material processing and rising demand are the main drivers of industrial emissions. Basic materials production leads to increases in both direct and indirect emissions. Supply side interventions include changing the material intensity of the product used. (5) Promote circular material flow: Recycling of waste materials helps to reduce emissions, but the growing complexity of product design and functionality increases the demand for materials. There are still huge gaps and regional variations in recycling. The rates of recycling across various metals varies from 20 to 85 per cent, and the recycling rate of end-of-life waste from industrial material is very low at ca 10 per cent (IPCC 2022; Teske and Pregger 2022).

AVOID FOCUS ON NARROWLY DEFINED POLICIES: Policies that support linear production processes which generate more waste need to be avoided and to be replaced by sequential, cross- sectoral policies which have a wide impact on societal and environmental domains (Rissman et al. 2020; IPCC 2022) 45 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window Table 5.4 Immediate actions to accelerate the transformation of the industry sector by actor groups 4 INDUSTRY SECTOR TRANSFORMATION \u2013 RECOMMENDATIONS BY ACTOR GROUP + Support zero-carbon industrial processes: Implement strategic, well-designed policy and incentives to accelerate innovation, technology deployment of clean energy and low-carbon input materials, e.g. development of new, CO2-free processes or carbon capture (Rissman et al. 2020). + Promote circular material \ufb02 ow: Incentivize the use of recycled materials, reduce demand through material ef\ufb01 ciency (e.g. foster shift to paper which uses less pulp), substitute low-carbon for high-carbon materials, and introduce circular economy measures such as improving product longevity, reusability and recyclability (Millward-Hopkins et al. 2018; Rissman et al. 2020). + Promote electri\ufb01 cation: Introduce policies to incentivize electri\ufb01 cation of the industrial processes that currently use fossil fuels (Rissman et al. 2020). + Support alternative carbon pricing mechanisms: Implement carbon pricing policies to incentivize industry leadership in low-carbon action, improve productivity and drive innovation (Rissman et al. 2020; World Bank 2021). + Support research and innovation: Remove barriers to and invest in research, development, deployment and innovation, and support energy ef\ufb01 ciency and/or emissions standards (Falk, Gaffney et al. 2020; Rissman et al. 2020; Bashmakov et al. 2022). + Promote low-carbon products: Ensure labelling and government procurement of low-carbon products, information dissemination, promoting repair work, data collection and implementation of disclosure requirements, and incentives for recycling (Rissman et al. 2020; Bashmakov et al. 2022). + Plan a just transformation: Prepare national-level plans for social protection to stay gender sensitive, meet development needs of low- and middle-income countries, and enhance social acceptance of new production systems with the aim to ensure a just transformation for displaced workers and affected communities (Rissman et al. 2020). + Cooperate on zero-carbon basic materials: International cooperation and coordination may be particularly important in enabling change in emissions-intensive and highly traded basic materials industries (IPCC 2022). This can include procurement commitments, strategic dialogues, shared learning on pilot projects, and standard adoption (IEA et al. 2022). Additionally, funding will need to be signi\ufb01 cantly increased to support the industrial transition (IEA et al. 2022). + Share best practice: There needs to be support for low- and middle- income countries while making the International Organization for Standardization more progressive, helping in the development of standards and regulations, sharing technology, and accounting to reduce waste in the global supply chain.

In addition, car and plane use by frequent travellers should be abated. These shifts should be promoted simultaneously, and many actions can address more than one shift. (1) Shift to low-emitting modes of transport: A significant shift to lower emitting modes, including public transport, walking and cycling, is required alongside the electrification of transport modes to align with a well-below 2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C pathway (Institute for Transportation and Development Policy [ITDP] and University of California Davis 2021). Currently, private light-duty vehicles make up 53.2 per cent of all trips (as at 2015, International Transport Forum 2021). The number of trips made by private light-duty vehicles needs to decrease by 4\u201314 per cent below business-as-usual levels by 2030. The number of kilometres of public transit per 1,000 inhabitants must be doubled by 2030, while the number of kilometres of high-quality bicycle lanes per 1,000 inhabitants should be increased fivefold (Transformative Urban Mobility Initiative 2021; Boehm et al. 2022). (2) Accelerate the move to zero-carbon cars and trucks: Light-duty electric vehicle sales reached 8.3 per cent of total sales in 2021 (Irle 2021). This must increase to between 35 per cent and 95 per cent by 2030, and reach 100 per cent by 2035, requiring an increase in the rate of change by 1.8 to 6 times in the next eight years (Bloomberg New Energy Finance [BloombergNEF] 2018; ICCT 2021; IEA 2021e; IRENA 2021; McKerracher et al. 2022; Boehm et al. 2022; Cheung and O\u2019Donovan 2022). Heavier vehicles, including buses and medium- and heavy-duty vehicles (MHDVs), should also be decarbonized. Buses have proven to be a success story for vehicle electrification, reaching a high of 43 per cent of bus sales in 2017, driven largely by demand in China (BloombergNEF 2021). However, sales have slowed since then, falling to 39 per cent in 2020, whereas the share needs to increase to 60\u2013100 per cent in 2030 and 100 per cent in 2050 (ICCT 2021; IEA 2021e; IRENA 2021; Boehm et al. 2022; Sen and Miller 2022). Zero-carbon options for MHDVs have only just begun to hit the market, reaching 0.2 per cent of sales in 2020 (BloombergNEF 2021). Electric and fuel cell MHDVs are required to reach between 5 and 45 per cent of sales in 2030, and 100 per cent between 2040 and 2050 (IEA 2021e; IRENA 2021; Boehm et al. 2022; Sen and Miller 2022; Xie, Dallmann and Muncrief 2022). (3) Transformation to zero-carbon aviation and shipping: Sustainable aviation fuels are required to meet 13\u201318 per cent of aviation fuel needs in 2030 and 78\u2013100 per cent in 2050, requiring a significant increase in uptake (IEA 2021e; University Maritime Advisory Services 2021; Boehm et al. 2022; Graver et al. 2022). Maritime shipping faces similar problems, with a dearth of options for decarbonization outside zero-emissions fuels. Vessels have not yet begun to use zero-emissions shipping fuels, but zero-emissions fuels will need to meet 5\u201317 per cent of maritime shipping needs in 2030 and 84\u201393 per cent by 2050 (IEA 2021e; Boehm et al. 2022). INDUSTRY SECTOR TRANSFORMATION \u2013 RECOMMENDATIONS BY ACTOR GROUP + Engage with or divest from emissions-intensive industry: Investors can actively engage with the companies they own shares of to move them towards zero emissions. If this is not successful, they should divest (Creutzig, Roy et al. 2022). + Invest in low-carbon energy and process technologies: Investors and banks should enable investment in low-carbon energy and process technologies and novel chemistries. Investments to signi\ufb01 cantly reduce costs of new technologies and innovations will be essential for uptake by developing countries (Rissman et al. 2020). + Drive awareness of climate risk: Despite various regulatory and voluntary initiatives, climate-related \ufb01 nancial risks remain grossly underestimated.

SHIFT: Make investments in, establish pricing for and shift towards low-carbon modes of transport (trains, public transport, cycling). IMPROVE: Complete transformation to zero- emissions vehicle technologies for cars, vans, buses and trucks, and for ships and planes in combination with zero- emissions fuels. AVOID UNSUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS: Avoid supporting technologies that are incompatible with deep decarbonization, such as natural gas in road transport and biofuels that lead to deforestation and/or compete with food production (Searchinger et al. 2019). AVOID DELAY: It is important not to delay transport electri\ufb01 cation until the electricity grids are cleaner (Sen et al. 2021). AVOID FALSE DICHOTOMIES: A 1.5\u00b0C pathway requires both electri\ufb01 cation of transportation and investment in more compact cities (public transit, walking, biking). 7 TRANSPORT SECTOR TRANSFORMATION \u2013 RECOMMENDATIONS BY ACTOR GROUP + Set mandates to switch to zero-emissions road vehicles by speci\ufb01 c dates: Governments, regions and cities can set regulations to shift towards 100 per cent zero-emissions vehicle sales for new buses by 2030, cars and vans by 2035, and trucks by 2040 (Hall et al. 2021; Sen and Miller 2022). These can be complemented with demand-side action to accelerate uptake. Setting CO2 standards for manufacturers will also help accelerate the transition. + Regulate and incentivize zero-carbon fuels for aviation: Develop regulations and support \ufb01 scal policies to transition to 100 per cent low-carbon fuels for aviation and marine sectors by 2050, including advanced biofuels, green hydrogen, renewable electricity, and e-fuels generated with additional renewable electricity (Graver et al. 2022; Pavlenko and O\u2019Malley 2022). + Adjust taxation/pricing schemes: Align pricing, taxes and fees on vehicle sales (Wappelhorst 2022), ownership, fuels and transportation activity to support environmental objectives (technology changes, mode shift, avoided travel) (Jaramillo et al. 2022). + Invest in zero-emissions transport infrastructure: Align transportation infrastructure funding to invest in high quality zero- emissions public transport, rail, walking/bicycling facilities, ships, aeroplanes and vehicle-charging infrastructure (Minjares et al. 2021; Jaramillo et al. 2022; Ragon et al. 2022).

INVESTORS, PRIVATE AND DEVELOPMENT BANKS CITIZENS 49 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window 5.6 Buildings Direct emissions through building operations are relatively small compared to other sectors and are estimated at 5 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, but this number increases to 17 per cent when accounting for indirect emissions from electricity and heat consumption (IPCC 2022). While direct emissions have remained relatively stable at 3 gigatons of CO2 per year, indirect emissions have almost doubled since 1990 (IEA 2020). To decrease emissions in the building sector, four major shifts are necessary: (1) excess floor area must be minimized, (2) energy intensity must be reduced, (3) the emissions intensity of energy use must decline, and (4) embodied emissions from construction must be reduced (Boehm et al. 2022). (1) Reduce excess floor area: Energy use and emissions from space and water heating and cooling are directly linked to the total amount of floor area that undergoes active thermal control. Furthermore, the greater the extent of new floor area that is constructed, the more materials are required, and the higher are the embodied emissions. The amount of floor area used per person vastly differs across countries, but also within countries. Minimizing the amount of floor area which is well above the area necessary to meet basic needs, can have a large effect on emissions in the sector. (2) Reduce energy intensity of buildings: The energy that is used for heating, cooling and appliances per square metre of floor area, needs to decrease globally by 10\u201330 per cent in commercial buildings and 20\u201330 per cent in residential buildings, relative to 2015 levels, by 2030 (CAT 2020). Global average energy intensity in buildings reduced by 19 per cent between 2000 and 2015, but the reduction has slowed in recent years, with only an additional 2 per cent between 2015 and 2019 (Boehm et al. 2022). (3) Reduce emissions intensity of energy use in buildings: Emissions intensity, or the amount of CO2 emitted per floor area, is related to energy intensity, but adds the decarbonization factor, meaning that a switch from fossil fuels to electric power (sourced from renewable energy) is needed. In buildings, this entails installing and replacing cooking and heating devices with cleaner technologies, such as heat pumps instead of oil or gas heating, or district heating in dense urban areas (CAT 2020). Emissions intensity in buildings needs be reduced by 45\u201365 per cent for residential buildings and 65\u201375 per cent for commercial buildings compared to 2015 levels by 2030, and 95\u2013100 per cent by 2050 (CAT 2020). Although emissions intensity has decreased steadily, the pace needs to be accelerated to meet these targets (Boehm et al. 2022). (4) Reduce emissions from construction: The production of materials such as steel, cement and concrete to construct buildings is a highly energy- and emissions- intensive process. While measures to reduce the emissions intensity of these materials should be pursued (see section on industry above), further reductions can be achieved by more efficient use of these materials. This can include reconstructing existing buildings (rather than demolition and new construction), minimizing the volume of materials required and substituting alternative construction materials (Energy Transitions Commission 2019). Integrated planning and design can be used to minimize energy demand throughout the building construction phase, including transport and on-site energy use. Furnishing the interior of buildings can also be energy intensive, with circular economy principles providing opportunities for lifecycle emission reductions.

SCALE UP ZERO-EMISSIONS HEATING AND COOLING TECHNOLOGY: Highly ef\ufb01 cient air conditioners and heat pumps without hydro\ufb02 uoro- carbons can be powered by renewables, either on-site or supplied off-site through electricity. ALL NEW BUILDINGS SHOULD BE ZERO CARBON IN OPERATION: New buildings should be designed and constructed so that they are zero carbon in operation, with a minimal energy demand that is met through zero- carbon sources (IEA 2021e). MINIMIZE EMBODIED EMISSIONS: Emissions from construction materials should be minimized by reducing the emissions intensity of steel and cement production and substituting lower carbon materials, including recycled materials, where possible. INCREASE RETROFITTING RATE: 2.5\u20133.5 per cent of buildings need to be retro\ufb01 tted every year, but recent rates are below 1 per cent per year (IEA 2021a). AVOID INEFFICIENT BUILDINGS: Due to the long lifetime of buildings, the lock-in effect of inef\ufb01 cient new buildings is signi\ufb01 cant and currently potentially incentivized by low ambition or no building codes (Cabeza et al. 2022). AVOID NEW FOSSIL GAS CONNECTIONS: New gas connections should be avoided to not create a lock-in, which would last decades. Improved insulation and electric heating and cooling can reduce fossil gas demand. PHASE OUT FOSSIL FUEL SUBSIDIES: Several countries subsidize fossil fuel use in buildings, directly or indirectly. 51 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window Table 5.8 Recommendations from immediate actions to accelerate the transformation of the buildings sector by actor groups 10 BUILDINGS SECTOR TRANSFORMATION \u2013 RECOMMENDATIONS BY ACTOR GROUP + Regulate towards zero-carbon building stock: Require all new buildings to be zero carbon in operation and introduce minimum energy performance standards for existing buildings to increase retro\ufb01 t rates, both accompanied by a comprehensive enforcement strategy (CAT 2022a). Buildings codes can be used to accelerate the transition to using low- carbon building materials for construction, and in limiting emissions during the end-of-life phase of a building. Setting requirements to calculate and monitor these embodied emissions is an important \ufb01 rst step (Jordan et al. 2020). + Incentivize zero-carbon building stock: Modify cost structures in favour of zero-carbon options through taxes and subsidies, provide incentives for \u2018best in class\u2019 technologies and practices, improve access to \ufb01 nance, and address the landlord-tenant dilemma (CAT 2022a). + Facilitate zero-carbon building stock: Ensure an appropriately skilled workforce and increase institutional capacity for enforcement and awareness-raising (CAT 2022a). + Provide access and favourable conditions to \ufb01 nance: Support, de-risk or guarantee the upfront investments required to achieve a zero-carbon building stock (GlobalABC and UNEP 2022). + Support skills and knowledge growth: Expand the massively needed skills training and knowledge exchange (GlobalABC and UNEP 2022). + Implement zero-emissions building stock plans: Subnational governments in particular cities should plan and implement how to arrive at an 100 per cent zero-emissions building stock (Burrows et al. 2021). Particularly important is that the design of any new construction is fossil fuel free, and the presence of a vision to rapidly reduce embodied emissions. + Integrate low emissions requirements in urban planning: This includes zoning and parks (Jordan et al. 2020). + Add requirements on top of national requirements: Stronger requirements at subnational level can accelerate the transformation (Falk, Gaffney et al. 2020). Several examples exist where, for example, cities add renewable obligations or low/no interest loans for low-income households that are not required at the national level (CAT 2022a). + Construction and building material companies review business models: Make and implement zero-emissions plans with zero-carbon building materials if the business model relies on carbon intensive raw materials and high energy buildings (Falk, Gaffney et al. 2020). + Achieve zero-carbon owned or rented building stock: Building owners should make their building stock zero carbon without overburdening tenants.

INVESTORS, PRIVATE AND DEVELOPMENT BANKS CITIZENS 52 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window Transforming food systems Lead authors: Aline Mosnier (Sustainable Development Solutions Network, France), Marco Springmann (University of Oxford, United Kingdom), Shenggen Fan (China Agricultural University, China) Contributing authors: Bruce Campbell (Clim-EAT and University of Copenhagen, Denmark), Helen Harwatt (Chatham House, United Kingdom), Julia Rocha Romero (UNEP-CCC, Denmark), Wei Zhang (CGIAR and International Food Policy Research Institute [IFPRI], United States of America) 6 6.1 Introduction Food systems are major contributors to climate change and other environmental problems, such as land-use change and biodiversity loss, depletion of freshwater resources, and pollution of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems through nitrogen and phosphorus run-off from fertilizer and manure application (Cordell and White 2014; Crippa et al. 2021; Diaz and Rosenberg 2008; Foley et al. 2005; Newbold et al. 2015; Robertson and Vitousek 2009; Shiklomanov and Rodda 2004; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC] 2019; Wada et al. 2010; Willett et al. 2019). If current trends continue, the environmental pressures on food systems are likely to intensify (Jalava et al. 2014; Tilman and Clark 2014; Davis et al. 2016; Springmann et al. 2016; Springmann, Clark et al. 2018). Key targets of several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are projected to be at risk (Springmann, Clark et al. 2018; Springmann et al. 2020), and the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from food systems could, on their own, preclude achieving the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to below 2\u00b0C, aiming for 1.5\u00b0C (Clark et al. 2020). Transforming food systems is therefore imperative for avoiding dangerous levels of climate change and other environmental problems. Moreover, transforming food systems is not only important for addressing climate change and environmental degradation, but also essential for ensuring healthy diets and food security for all. Currently, imbalanced diets that are low in fruits, vegetables, nuts and whole grains and high in red and processed meat are a leading health burden in most regions and are responsible for more than one in five premature deaths globally (GBD 2017 Diet Collaborators 2019; Springmann, Mozaffarian et al. 2021). In addition, about 2 billion people are overweight and obese, and 2 billion have nutritional deficiencies, while about 800 million are still suffering from hunger due to poverty and poorly developed food systems (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [FAO] et al. 2020). As the dietary transition towards more processed and high-value products continues in many regions of the world, these dietary health risks are expected to worsen (Springmann et al. 2016; Springmann, Wiebe et al. 2018). At the same time, many of the world\u2019s poor cannot afford to pay for healthy and sustainable diets (FAO et al. 2020; Springmann, Clark et al. 2021), and the ongoing crises caused by COVID-19, the war in Ukraine, and widespread extreme climate events are further exacerbating this situation by disrupting food systems and increasing the costs of foods (Gu\u00e9nette, Kose and Sugawara 2022; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] 2020; Ogundeji and Okolie 2022) (see box 6.1). Adopting a food systems lens can help in identifying the synergies and trade-offs across the various interconnected environmental, health and economic impacts. Compared to the traditional categorization of agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU), food systems include pre- and post-production processes, which are related to the transportation, industrial activities, storage and consumption of food (IPCC 2019; Rosenzweig et al. 2020). The inclusion of several sectors makes the computation of food system emissions more difficult and increases the risk of double counting when summed with and compared to individual sectors (figure 6.1).

It will also discuss how further actions can be accelerated to ensure that food systems contribute their share to fulfilling the goals of the Paris Agreement. Box 6.1 Equity and justice as vital components to accelerate transformations of food systems Although any climate stabilization pathway requires a substantial reduction in emissions from food systems, such mitigation efforts must not come at the expense of the health and livelihoods of low-income populations. At a per-person level, the richest 10 per cent of the world\u2019s population produces the highest emissions, while the poorest produce the least emissions and suffer the highest consequences of climate change due to their socioeconomic status and reduced adaptive capacities. In 2021, approximately 828 million people were affected by hunger globally, and this figure is estimated to continue increasing with the instability caused by COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine. The current rise in inflation and energy prices adds further pressure to the world\u2019s food supply chain. These adverse impacts concern everyone, but they are especially felt by the poorest and the most vulnerable in society, the majority of whom are women. Better distribution of food and more efficient use of resource is essential to fight food insecurity and malnutrition within the decade (FAO et al. 2022). Reducing the use of much of the world's grain production to feed animals and producing more food for direct human consumption can significantly contribute to this objective (IPCC 2022a). In most high and middle-income countries, healthier and more sustainable diets can be cheaper than current diets, but in many low-income countries, they are higher in cost than the prevalent starch-based diets (FAO et al. 2020; Springmann, Clark et al. 2021). Making healthy and sustainable diets affordable for all is possible, but will require dedicated food system interventions in low-income settings (Springmann, Clark et al. 2021). Poverty alleviation remains a prime goal of low-income countries, and agricultural development will remain a key part of their development strategies, with climate actions more focused on adaptation than mitigation. Climate-resilient development in Africa\u2019s rural areas, if it is to tackle entrenched chronic poverty, will need to be transformational, with elements of farm consolidation, irrigation development, improved fertilizer usage, increased market access and enhanced social safety nets, among other elements (Orr et al. 2013; Beegle, Coudouel and Monsalve 2018; Lefore et al. 2019; Giller 2022). Some of the expected changes can produce mitigation co-benefits, but in other cases food system emissions are likely to rise (Springmann, Wiebe et al. 2018). An important objective is therefore to ensure that rural transformation is placed on a low emissions trajectory. 54 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window Figure 6.1 Classification of food systems emissions and the difference to standard emissions categories of the IPCC Notes: The IPCC categories included in food systems are shown within the faded grey square. This figure shows the main differences and overlaps with the more traditional IPCC category of AFOLU (Crippa et al. 2021; IPCC 2019). For all official IPCC categories, only parts are included in food systems. Although some agricultural production is dedicated to non-food uses, non-food crops only represent 2 per cent of the emissions, so most of agricultural production is included in food systems. From the category land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF), we only include emissions from land use and land-use change within food systems. Thus, emissions and/or sequestration in remaining forest land are excluded from food systems. We followed FAO\u2019s definition for the categories energy, industrial processes and product use (IPPU), and waste (Tubiello et al. 2021). 6.2 Transformation needs and potential The food system is currently responsible for about a third of total GHG emissions or 18 (range: 14\u201322) gigatons of CO2 equivalent (GtCO2e) per year (IPCC 2019; Crippa et al. 2021). The largest contribution stems from agricultural production (7.1 GtCO2e, 39 per cent) including the production of inputs such as fertilizers, followed by changes in land use (5.7 GtCO2e, 32 per cent), and supply chain activities (5.2 GtCO2e, 29 per cent). The latter includes retail, transport, consumption, fuel production, waste management, industrial processes and packaging.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "40f22868-0387-4a5d-b382-062bbb6b01ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "40f22868-0387-4a5d-b382-062bbb6b01ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "48c8cf772ed2f02f3cb0337df7c32353cd9b5dd5967c8d10f1f1bc46b9c24d5e"}, "2": {"node_id": "7337a362-66c8-4edd-8549-77ace1be20c3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ea0a3c1349667df884d68d91feeed73327d6cfa1bac3a9a0d3358d35fa755217"}}, "hash": "f9700e5df13f00fb07f763ee9d38bab31845c45d0a377e2b84543669e1f0afbf", "text": "Developing countries currently contribute about three quarters (73 per cent) of emissions from food systems, but given their large populations, per capita emission footprints are up to four times lower than those in industrialized countries (Crippa et al. 2021).

Both the current and the projected levels of food system emissions are at odds with the scale of rapid emissions reductions needed across all sectors to achieve the Paris Agreement goals (Clark et al. 2020; IPCC 2022b). Even if fossil fuel emissions were quickly reduced, food system emissions could prevent achieving the well below 2\u00b0C, preferably 1.5\u00b0C goal by the end of the century (Clark et al. 2020). For having a 66 per cent chance of limiting global warming to below 2\u00b0C, estimates from integrated assessment models have suggested a limit of agricultural emissions (i.e. methane and nitrous oxide) of about 5 GtCO2e in 2050, in addition to decarbonizing the energy system and limiting emissions from land-use changes (Costa et al. 2022; Willett et al. 2019). A range of transformation domains with several mitigation measures have been identified where food systems can contribute to bridge the emissions gap (Springmann, Clark, et al. 2018; Roe et al. 2019; Clark et al. 2020; IPCC 2022b). They include: 1) demand-side changes, including dietary changes towards sustainable and nutritionally balanced diets, and reductions in food loss and waste, Forestry Changes in woody biomass stocks LULUC Land use and land-use change and CO2 removals from soils related to agricultural land Enteric fermentation, manure management, burning of crop residues, agricultural soils, indirect N2O in agriculture Production of non-food crops Agriculture Waste Solid food waste, food incineration, industrial and domestic wastewater Industrial processes and product use (IPPU) Refrigeration from retail Energy On-farm energy use, transportation, fertilizer manufacturing, packaging, retail Other GHGs related to energy use (including bioenergy and BECCS) Other GHGs related to the production of minerals, metal, high-value chemicals Other GHGs related to wastewater, landfill, waste incineration Food supply chain Food systems emissions AFOLU 55 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window 2) protection of natural ecosystems, including reductions in deforestation for agriculture and degradation of agricultural land, 3) improvements in food production at the farm level, including changes in the composition of animal feeds, better rice management, better manure management, and improvements in crop nutrient management, and 4) decarbonizing the food supply chain, including in retail, transport, fuel use, industrial processes, waste management and packaging. Figure 6.2 provides an overview of the mitigation potentials of the different measures. We focus on the technical mitigation potentials in the figure, but note that economic potentials (i.e. those achievable below a cost of carbon of US$100/tCO2e) are much lower and often just half of the technically achievable potential (IPCC 2022b). To avoid double counting in these estimates, the chapter isolates the demand-side impacts from land use and technical improvements at the farm level. However, any one domain will generally be affected by changes in any other domain. For example, dietary changes towards more plant-based diets will reduce the demand for cropland that then eases measures to reduce deforestation. In addition, each estimate is subject to considerable uncertainty. This is especially evident for technologies or management practices that have not yet been proven to work at scale, including bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (Low and Sch\u00e4fer 2020) and a range of soil-related activities often classified as regenerative agriculture (Willett et al. 2019; Giller 2022). What is clear however is that there is no simple solution, and a combination of measures will be needed to transform food systems in line with targets and pathways for reducing emissions. When combining mitigation measures, care will have to be taken to avoid trade-offs with other issues of concern, including food security and health, and instead generate synergies. Especially when it comes to food and diets, important synergies exist across the public health concerns for the provision of healthy diets and the elimination of malnutrition and the climate change concern for reducing emissions (Springmann, Wiebe et al. 2018; Willett et al. 2019).

It also shows some encouraging examples across the world. Global food system emissions have increased during the last two decades (figure 6.3). Emissions from agriculture have only slightly increased, while emissions from the food supply chain have dramatically increased (FAO 2021a; Ritchie 2019). The following examines key subcategories within each transformation domain to get a more detailed understanding of their relative importance and discuss concrete mitigation options. The selected subcategories are meat consumption for demand-side changes, deforestation for the protection of natural ecosystems, nitrous oxide emissions from agricultural soils for improvements in food production at farm level, and energy use in food systems for decarbonizing the food supply chain. Figure 6.3 shows the evolution of emissions by subcategories. These subcategories together account for more than half of total emissions from food systems. Figure 6.3 Average global annual emissions from food systems between 2000\u20132009 and 2010\u20132019 Source: The GHG emissions from food systems supply chain, agriculture, and land use and land-use change (LULUC) excluding forest cover change are taken from FAOSTAT Emissions shares and Emissions Totals (Tubiello et al. 2021). Emissions from tree cover loss are taken from Global Forest Watch (Curtis et al. 2018). This selection leads to higher total emissions from food systems than Crippa et al. (2021), Tubiello et al. (2022), and Costa et al. (2022). 6.3.1 Sustainable and nutritionally balanced diets The production of meat was responsible for approximately 54 per cent of GHG emissions from agriculture between 2018 and 2020 (OECD and FAO 2021). Life cycle analyses indicate that meat production\u2014from inputs in its production to retail\u2014has a median value of CO2e per 100g of protein that is significantly higher than alternative plant-based sources of protein (Poore and Nemecek 2018). For example, beef has a median GHG intensity that is more than 5\u201310 times higher than pork and poultry, and 50\u2013100 times higher than plant-based protein sources such as beans and lentils. In addition to the climate benefits, eating less red meat, only moderate amounts of poultry, seafood and lean fish as well as increasing the intake of plant-based foods is associated with a lower risk of major chronic diseases (Springmann, Wiebe et al. 2018; FAO and WHO 2019; Willett et al. 2019).

This is also reflected in a review of the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) that shows the inaction towards reducing meat consumption both in high- income and higher-middle-income countries (box 6.2). Meat production is projected to increase more than 60 per cent between 2010 and 2050, primarily being driven by population and economic growth, especially in low- and middle-income countries. However, if everybody on the planet consumed within levels recommended for health and the environment (14 g/d or less of red meat, 29 g/d or less of poultry, and 28 g/d or less of fish), meat production would not need to increase beyond current levels (Springmann, Clark et al. 2018). Table 6.1 Examples of positive shifts in meat consumption Area Positive shifts Slovenia, Uruguay and Ecuador* Average per capita meat consumption between 2010 and 2019 has decreased despite economic growth (Ritchie 2019). More research is needed to highlight the determinants of this change. Europe and North America* Vegetarian diets are increasing in popularity. Non-meat consumers represent between 5 and 10 per cent of the total population (Kansas State University 2022; Lusk and Norwood 2016). Global Total consumption of meat substitutes has increased by more than three times, and total consumption of milk substitutes has almost doubled between 2013 and 2020 (Friedlingstein et al. 2022). * In these areas, meat consumption currently far exceeds recommended levels. Box 6.2 Coverage of food system in revised NDCs Currently, all NDCs include food systems. However, demand-side measures and actions to reduce emissions from food processing, storage and transportation of the food systems are frequently overlooked (Food and Land Use Coalition [FOLU] and Food, Environment, Land and Development Action Tracker 2021; Global Alliance for the Future of Food 2022; Hamilton et al. 2021). None of the revised NDCs submitted ahead of the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP 26) mention the need to reduce the consumption of animal protein. Food loss and waste are only covered in a few NDCs including the ones for the United Kingdom, the European Union, France and South Africa (Global Alliance for the Future of Food, 2022). On the production side, the agriculture and land use sectors feature prominently in the NDCs of developing countries with 86 per cent prioritizing mitigation in these sectors (Crumpler et al. 2021), but sustainable livestock production could be better covered, especially by large meat producing countries (Global Alliance for the Future of Food, 2022). Agroecology and regenerative approaches are common, but a clear operational definition of regenerative agriculture is needed. Except for Colombia, food systems actors tended to be overlooked in domestic consultation processes which has likely led to gaps in food systems coverage in the NDCs. With new data available in FAOSTAT Emissions shares and the Emissions Database for Global Atmosphere Research\u2019s global food emission (EDGAR-FOOD) databases (Crippa et al. 2022) released in 2021, quantifying and discerning food systems-related emissions and acquiring data on emission patterns has improved. This should facilitate the coverage of food systems in future NDCs (Crippa et al. 2021). 58 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window 6.3.1 Protection of remaining natural ecosystems For this transformation domain, the selected subcategory is deforestation, the main source of emissions from LULUC (figure 6.3).Deforestation also reduces the future removals of atmospheric carbon in natural forests, further exacerbating climate change (Maxwell et al. 2019). At the global level, food systems can be directly related to almost half of tree cover loss through commodity-driven deforestation and shifting agriculture, and the contribution could be higher if linked to wildfires (Curtis et al. 2018; Pendrill et al. 2022). Halting deforestation therefore is key for both environment protection and climate change mitigation. The SDGs include a target of halting deforestation by 2020 (target 15.1), and the objective has been restated in several declarations e.g. during COP 26 with the Glasgow Leaders\u2019 Declaration on Forests and Land Use. Despite all these commitments, deforestation related to food systems has continued to increase from 8 million hectares (Mha) per year in 2001\u20132010 to 11.5 Mha/year in 2011\u20132020 according to statistics from the Global Forest Watch (GFW) on tree cover loss driven by commodities and shifting agriculture (GFW 2022).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "18cf713e-1e25-459c-a7f6-f0aad11a9de6": {"__data__": {"id_": "18cf713e-1e25-459c-a7f6-f0aad11a9de6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "36188293ea5f89cdd7cb5a5968359826cd774c859d76b7b0a6d1c956afe29921"}, "2": {"node_id": "15fb27da-af96-4fe7-aeb6-f62f2d2415d8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "44f379ad50e1765e8f15880debe201373c7af7fe3a07a160e5350bd2f12e928d"}}, "hash": "eec43b366491db5c35ce1d05e62febe57eeef1e585a7c44831565c09b13767f5", "text": "It is estimated that 29\u201339 per cent of emissions were driven by international trade (Pendrill et al. 2019).

Without new forest conservation policies, 289 million hectares of tropical forest could be cleared by 2050 (Busch and Engelmann 2017) and have dramatic impacts on climate change, traditional livelihoods, human health, biodiversity loss and ecosystem services. With less than eight years to close the emissions gap there is a need for effective, unified and public systems of monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) of deforestation to make governments and companies accountable for their deforestation commitments (Nabuurs et al. 2022). Local communities and traditionally marginalized groups such as indigenous communities inhabiting and or living close to forested areas are deeply vulnerable to the impacts of deforestation and therefore should be closely involved (FAO 2022). Their contributions and knowledge are invaluable and can help to address important sources of risk. Table 6.2 Examples of positive shifts in addressing deforestation Area Positive shifts Brazil There was an impressive slowdown in deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon between 2005 and 2011. The combination of real-time monitoring (Real Time Deforestation Detection System), public release of annual deforestation data (Basin Restoration Program), strong law enforcement, expansion of protected territory and adoption of a conditional rural credit policy has been key to curbing deforestation during that period (Assun\u00e7\u00e3o, Gandour and Rocha 2015). Unfortunately, political changes mean that deforestation has increased again since then, even if it remains below its peak in 2005 (zu Ermgassen et al. 2020). Indonesia Deforestation in Indonesia has been reduced for the fourth year in a row (GFW 2022; Gaveau et al. 2022). The moratorium on new licences for primary forests and peatlands introduced in 2011 has played an important role to reduce conversion of natural forests and peatland drainage to install timber or oil palm plantations. More than 80 per cent of the oil palm refining capacities and the pulp and paper industry in Indonesia have also committed to \u2018No Deforestation, No Peat and No Exploitation\u2019. European Union In September 2022, the European Parliament voted to enable a law that conditions farmers to document that products being sold to the European Union are neither involved with human rights abuse nor deforestation. Being responsible for approximately 16 per cent of deforestation in the tropics (Pacheco et al. 2021), the European Union can address its consumption of products associated with ecosystem degradation to have real impacts. 59 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window 6.3.2 Reduction of emissions from agricultural production Enteric fermentation of ruminant livestock is the major source of emissions from agricultural production. beyond changes in diets, the reduction of methane emissions from ruminants can be achieved through changes in feed level and feed composition, which can also increase animal productivity (Frank et al. 2018; Arndt et al. 2022). Growing rice is another important source of emissions from agriculture, especially for low- and middle-income countries. Paddy farming relies on flooded cultivation fields that emit large quantities of methane into the atmosphere via anaerobic decomposition (Gupta et al. 2021). Changes in water management can significantly reduce methane emissions from rice (Islam 2021). Another prominent GHG is nitrous oxide, which is mainly emitted from agricultural activities. This includes emissions from the application of synthetic fertilizers on agricultural land and from livestock manure that is either used as organic fertilizers for crops or left on pastures. In 2019, nitrous oxide emissions from soils represented 25 per cent of total agricultural emissions (FAO 2021a), making it the second largest source of emissions from agriculture after methane emissions. Production of synthetic fertilizers is also a large source of emissions from the supply chain. reducing on- farm synthetic fertilizer would therefore lead to a reduction in this source of emissions too. Tackling excessive on-farm nitrogen use carries important co-benefits for air pollution through reduced ammonia emissions that would otherwise contribute to particular matter concentrations, and for water quality, as excessive nitrogen use leads to the excessive growth of aquatic plants and algae that can reduce the diversity of animals and plants and compromise the possible uses of the affected water (de Vries 2021; Ma\u00fare et al. 2021). Global nitrogen emissions from synthetic fertilizers and livestock manure have continued to grow after 2010, and the average annual emissions in 2010\u20132019 were 14 per cent higher than in 2000\u20132009 (FAO 2022). While average annual emissions have been nearly stable in high-income countries and only increased by 7 per cent in upper-middle- income countries, they have strongly increased in lower- middle-income and low-income countries (by 25 and 69 per cent, respectively). Reducing nitrogen use without impacting yield is not straightforward due to the fact that different crops have different needs independent of factors", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ff39d6b9-eeee-46c5-8cb8-555ae02f9f87": {"__data__": {"id_": "ff39d6b9-eeee-46c5-8cb8-555ae02f9f87", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "08826ac5f23cfcaacc3f36d64f68e631bb60cea8da17e6e1c85a2dead39fdf2f"}}, "hash": "08826ac5f23cfcaacc3f36d64f68e631bb60cea8da17e6e1c85a2dead39fdf2f", "text": "such as topography and slope (which can vary during the growing cycle), crop type and weather conditions (Sharma and Bali 2018). From equity and food security perspectives, unequal access to fertilizers is an important area of concern. For example, judicious use of fertilizers and organic nutrients are essential to increasing crop productivity in large areas of inherently poor and highly weathered soils in Africa (Zingore and Njoroge 2022). For context, to achieve self- sufficiency in maize in nine countries in sub-Saharan Africa, maize yields would have to increase from about 20 per cent of water-limited yield potential currently to approximately 50\u201375 per cent of the potential, with nitrogen input rising disproportionately more (by 9\u201315 times) (Rurinda et al. 2020). Table 6.3 Examples of positive shifts in emissions from agricultural production Area Positive shifts China Nitrogen emissions from synthetic fertilizers and livestock manure have reduced over the last three years because of a long focus on reducing fertilizer use. Since 2005, a policy on zero increase in chemical fertilizer use has been introduced (Wang et al. 2022) and a programme has been running to test soils and use fertilizers based on exact needs, with US$1.2 billion of government investment. The scheme has been applied on 100 Mha of land, which has increased the efficiency of fertilizer use by 5 per cent while increasing grain harvests by 6\u201310 per cent. In 2017, the Government of China started a five-pronged push to develop green agriculture. This included replacing chemical fertilizers with organic compost made from fruits, vegetables and tea (Kun and Genxing 2021). Europe Nitrous oxide emissions declined from 1990 levels (IPCC 2022b) and the nitrogen surplus applied to agricultural land was reduced by 18 per cent between 2000 and 2009, (Cook 2018), mainly thanks to public regulation. The European Union Nitrates Directive (91/676/EEC) was established in 1991 to balance fertilization requirements and prohibited nitrogen application during some periods (European Environment Agency 2020). This has been strengthened by other directives on improving the quality of water and setting emission reduction commitments by country, and policy instruments within the Common Agricultural Policy. Denmark From the 1980s, a wide range of policy instruments were introduced that led to a cut in nitrogen use by almost two between 1990 and 2011 without reduction of agricultural production (Petersen et al. 2021). A key factor of success was the definition of several action plans with clear targets that have been progressively adjusted according to the monitored progress. Introduction of farm-level nitrogen quotas has also proved to be costly but effective. 60 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window India Legumes such as beans, peas and lentils increase the release of ammonium nitrogen into the soil. The greater availability of nitrogen in the soil can reduce the needs for nitrogen fertilizers for other crops when legumes are used in rotations or as cover crops or intercrops. India has observed a consistent increase in the production of legumes in the last five years. In 2020, some states decided to include pulses in the Public Distribution Package that previously only included wheat and rice to further encourage production. North America Precision farming techniques have increasingly been adopted. These include a management approach that focuses on (near real-time) observation, measurement and responses to variability in crops, fields and animals. However, it has not yet translated into lower nitrogen emissions. It is not so clear if even the most promising technologies for reduced nutrient use (Sharma and Bali 2018) can significantly reduce nitrogen input use and increase economic benefits (Sp\u00e4ti, Huber and Finger 2021). Viet Nam The national strategy for achieving emission reductions in rice includes controlled water management, reduction of straw burning and conversion of inefficient rice land for other uses. Low-emission practices have already been successfully implemented in An Giang, a major rice-producing province in the Mekong Delta, contributing to a reduction of over 2 megatons (Mt) of CO2e/year and improving smallholder famers\u2019 net income per hectare by 7\u201325 per cent through the use of alternate wetting and drying (Tran et al. 2019). In the Mekong, alternate wetting and drying could be practised on an additional 900,000 hectares, resulting in emission reductions of 10.97 MtCO2e. Global The area under organic farming is increasing in all continents with close to 75 million ha globally in 2020 (1.6 per cent of global farmland) compared to 11 Mha in 1999 (Willer et al. 2021). The contribution of organic farming to the overall reduction in GHG emissions is debated because of indirect land- use effects due to lower yields and the increased manure-related emissions compared to synthetic fertilizers (Smith et al. 2019). 6.3.3", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "02e60ff4-a0d1-43c0-859e-da94ec9661dd": {"__data__": {"id_": "02e60ff4-a0d1-43c0-859e-da94ec9661dd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "49bcc92f4735c7894da68adcb59c6e030145a6e24f5515fc96d16c5535a09388"}, "3": {"node_id": "179d3071-c43f-44b1-83de-477506b98048", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bec535467c3f4ac5516192be484d7e09423464e0037503426a8014809a4a23d4"}}, "hash": "5eeefd7793f2c89a23301d76ac2235ded85505c454ec23f858b2a5dc4241fb3b", "text": "Decarbonizing the food supply chain Energy use along the whole food supply chain is the source of emissions in the food systems that has grown the fastest during the last two decades. This covers emissions from on-farm fuel use for machinery and irrigation, food transportation, energy use for cooking, cooling and freezing in the food processing industry and for packaging, energy use within retail and supermarkets, and household food- related energy consumption. Household food-related energy consumption includes energy use related to travel to purchase foods, food storage in freezers/refrigerators, meal preparation and clean-up (Pelletier et al. 2011). Households represent 30 per cent of total food systems\u2019 energy emissions, while the retail and supermarket sector come second with 20 per cent of food systems\u2019 energy emissions (Tubiello et al. 2021), a number only expected to increase as supermarkets continue expanding in developing countries (Reardon, Timmer and Minten 2012). Despite a high average distance travelled for many food products (Pelletier et al. 2011), transport represents only between 5 and 11 per cent of total emissions from energy in the global food system (Poore and Nemecek, 2018; Tubiello et al. 2022). The rapid growth in fluorinated gases (F-gases) emissions from cooling equipment used in the food chain, particularly in emerging economies, is worrying as F-gases greatly contribute to climate change due to their significantly higher warming potential than CO2. The food and beverage industry is a critical area of activity characterized by: a large geographical spread unlike many other industries, large multinational corporations alongside numerous small and medium enterprises, a broad heterogeneity of products that cut across very different processes, and stringent requirements related to rapid post- production shelf life and health considerations (Sovacool et al. 2021). This leads to specific mitigation options and potentials compared with other industries. The main options include improved management and technologies to increase energy use efficiency and better waste recovery and use of by-products (Sovacool et al. 2021). More generally, the food sector has great potential for adopting renewable sources of electricity or heat, especially biomass waste or biogas from anaerobic digestion. It is projected that renewable energy could cover 60 per cent of existing heat demands of the sector (International Renewable Energy Agency [IRENA] 2015). Simple things like putting doors on refrigerators in supermarkets could also help cut energy use, but this is often perceived as a sales barrier (Jesse, Perotti and Roos 2022). 61 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window Table 6.4 Examples of positive shifts in decarbonizing supply chains Area Positive shifts Kenya A major dairy processor has partnered with an off-grid solar technology provider to provide solar-powered irrigation to support fodder crops and water access for cattle, thus boosting milk production (IRENA and FAO 2021; Lukhanyu 2021). Europe A leading European dairy producer is working closely with almost 8,000 farms in seven countries to promote circular farming practices. As a result, the carbon footprint of milk production for the company is less than half the global average per kilogram (Jesse, Perotti and Roos 2022). 6.4 How can transformation be accelerated? Although a food systems transformation is essential for limiting global warming and would have a number of other environmental, health, food security and equity benefits, little progress has been made in the last two decades (UNEP and UNDP 2021). In this final section, the role of different actors in accelerating transformations is discussed. Main actors include national governments, cities and local governments, the private sector, civil society and the scientific community. 6.4.1 National governments At the national level, structures for food system governance that integrate relevant sectors and food system components are essential to drive transformative action (Springmann et al. 2020; Steiner et al. 2020). One of the first challenges to scaling transformations is the fragmentized state of data, information, knowledge and awareness across sectors, population groups and public and private agencies (OECD and FAO 2022). Multicomponent approaches that combine e.g. information campaigns with economic incentives and fiscal measures are more likely to lead to meaningful changes than the narrow focus on the provision of information that many governments have traditionally followed (Mozaffarian et al. 2012; Mozaffarian 2016). Reforming national dietary guidelines can be a good start and help guide citizens make healthier and more sustainable food choices (e.g. Seychelles, Ministry of Health 2020), but this needs to be disseminated both through educational programmes and government-sponsored campaigns (Springmann et al.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "179d3071-c43f-44b1-83de-477506b98048": {"__data__": {"id_": "179d3071-c43f-44b1-83de-477506b98048", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "49bcc92f4735c7894da68adcb59c6e030145a6e24f5515fc96d16c5535a09388"}, "2": {"node_id": "02e60ff4-a0d1-43c0-859e-da94ec9661dd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5eeefd7793f2c89a23301d76ac2235ded85505c454ec23f858b2a5dc4241fb3b"}}, "hash": "bec535467c3f4ac5516192be484d7e09423464e0037503426a8014809a4a23d4", "text": "2020), and combined with other measures such as mandatory labelling and the provision of additional information e.g. carbon footprint data.

Fiscal policies, including taxation and the provision of directed subsidies, is another measure that can contribute to food system transformation. A global analysis with country- level data has shown that taxing foods in accordance with their GHG emissions could improve diets and reduce emissions by about 1 GtCO2e for a modest carbon price of about US$50/tCO2e (Springmann et al. 2017). When examining subsidies, currently approximately 87 per cent of support to agricultural producers is either distorting prices or supporting approaches that are harmful to nature and health (UNEP and UNDP 2021). Reforms are necessary to direct subsidies to the production of healthy and more sustainable foods to increase their availability, reduce their prices and increase their consumption, which carries knock- on effects in the form of reduced GHG emissions (FOLU 2019; Springmann and Freund 2022). Lastly, targeted investments and regulation can also play a role. Reducing on-farm emissions will require increased investment in public infrastructure such as storage or waste management. Moreover to support farmers, the food industry and retailers can invest in renewable energy and equipment via subsidized loans (UNEP and UNDP 2021). 6.4.2 Cities and local governments Cities will be home to two thirds of the world\u2019s population by 2050 and already approximately 70 per cent of all food produced worldwide is consumed inside cities (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs 2019). City management can therefore play a key role in food systems transformation. Since 2015, city-to-city cooperation and best practices exchanges have been fostered by the Milan Urban Food Policy Pact, which includes 225 cities worldwide. In many cities, this has translated into revised public procurement policies (e.g. for public schools, canteens, hospitals, care centres and so on) to align them with healthy diet recommendations (FAO et al. 2020), to increase the share of organic products and/or from local suppliers and to reduce waste through directives, resolutions or orders, for example. Moreover, integrating food production, access and distribution across urban planning must be considered as cities expand (FAO et al. 2020). Policies related to food systems inside cities also positively impact the creation of jobs related to producing, distributing, delivering, redistributing and recycling food. 62 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window Lastly, cities and local governments can serve as testing grounds for policies that could be scaled nationally and for innovative solutions, including those from start-ups. 6.4.3 Private sector Business opportunities in implementing the SDGs related to food have been estimated to be around US$4.5 trillion out of the total food sector turnover of US$10 trillion per year by 2030, representing a huge opportunity for current businesses and for entrepreneurship in the sector (FOLU 2019). Given the investment opportunities in the food system, companies and their investors could pursue new opportunities, disruptive innovations and technology transfer in line with social and environmental goals. New protein sources are a disruptive technology. In 2021, plant-based meat substitutes generated US$5 billion in sales, and forecasts suggest up to US$85 billion in 2030 (Thornton, Gurney-Smith and Wollenberg, forthcoming). Processing plant-based protein sources such as legumes into meat substitutes generate five times higher emissions than unprocessed plant-based sources, but remains 5\u20138 times lower than those from beef (Clune, Crossin and Verghese 2017; Rubio, Xiang and Kaplan 2020; Smetana et al. 2015). In contrast, lab-grown meat (sometimes referred to as cellular meat) currently has footprints that can be as high as those of beef (Smetana et al. 2015; World Economic Forum 2019). Another important area to drive food system transformation, from a private sector perspective, includes sector- and company-wide targets to reduce emissions and eventually reach carbon neutrality (Burns et al. 2022). The Science- Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and other entities offer companies with target-setting methodologies based on the best scientific evidence and guidelines to track GHG emissions within the companies\u2019 operations. This initiative already comprises over 1,200 companies worldwide. A key aspect is enhanced transparency through systematic reporting and verification of company operations. An example that openly accessible information can help drive action is the Big Climate Database developed in Denmark using life cycle assessments, which has already been used by several supermarket chains and the food service industry.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "253ec29f-847f-4712-a13c-68233c240a8d": {"__data__": {"id_": "253ec29f-847f-4712-a13c-68233c240a8d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5bf506ff8e88809672c427feede8e1437ae4edc71a8c7a19266f75bcfad8f4f8"}, "2": {"node_id": "a6465e42-4d4b-488f-bec4-ae8f9f7bf9ce", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "809b85b0815f44466094cc60141b2889c27f26691e1e0dbf6c7484c06a6be60c"}}, "hash": "01302adbd544b4363aa93a2d031241b70e379300120403d12fe4f78a52fa45e0", "text": "Public disclosure of data used to measure progress and independent audits and initiatives, such as those of the World Benchmarking Alliance which ranks companies on their performance, will be important in assessing progress and increasing accountability. 6.4.4 Civil society (citizens and non-governmental organizations) Citizens", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "78463829-a00a-4bbe-8da0-6846e2cb4e18": {"__data__": {"id_": "78463829-a00a-4bbe-8da0-6846e2cb4e18", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0e228524e88579f14683eb5a18d7e3d7701686b6a574a520887c5453d8f2d5d1"}}, "hash": "0e228524e88579f14683eb5a18d7e3d7701686b6a574a520887c5453d8f2d5d1", "text": "can drive food systems transformation through their consumption choices, their electoral choices and their mobilization in favour or against certain policy reforms related to food systems e.g. through boycott, public demonstration, disruption of traffic, etc. Social media has also played an important role in raising awareness on the need to shift diets and how to shift diets to reduce our carbon footprint. But this may only reach a certain audience e.g. with a higher education level (Eker et al. 2021). An important voice for civil society initiatives are non- governmental organizations (NGOs). They often work closely with citizens and can represent a multitude of voices at local, national and international levels of governance. For example, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) works with over 1,000 NGOs worldwide to support 'close to citizen' activities and efforts. 63 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window Table 6.5 Potential solutions and barriers to food systems transformation by actor group 6.4.4 International cooperation International cooperation is essential amid a strong interconnectedness of countries\u2019 food systems, large inequalities such as the impacts of climate change on food production and the complexity of climate change. While developments in food trade over the past decades have increased food availability and diversity, it has also increased the vulnerability of some countries\u2019 food systems to climate and political shocks (Wang and Dai 2021) and accelerated the destruction of natural ecosystems such as tropical forests (zu Ermgassen et al. 2020). With strong interconnectedness, even well-intentioned national policies to reduce GHG emissions from food systems can be offset by spillovers to the rest of the world and/or could raise food prices but could also spur positive change in other countries. The negative impacts of climate change on agricultural production are also especially strong in developing countries. International cooperation to ensure that no one will be left behind is crucial. Channelling emergency food aid when there are crises, avoiding trade disruptions even when there is a war, or reducing food overconsumption can all contribute to reducing inequalities within global food systems. Many technologies exist that are capable of increasing crop and livestock productivity, enhancing nutrition of food crops and reducing GHG emissions (Pathak and Aggarwal 2012; 1 Table 6.5 Potential solutions and barriers to food systems transformation by actor group MAJOR TRANSFORMATION GAPS POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS BARRIERS National governments \u2013 Absence of national strategy and clear measurable targets \u2013 Lack of data and capacity \u2013 Lack of key performance indicators to monitor progress \u2013 Weak evaluation of externalities and incorporation into national accounting \u203a Science-based national food systems transformation strategy and corresponding national coordination and accountability mechanism \u203a Open government data \u203a Integrate low carbon into national food and dietary guidelines \u203a Strengthen national land monitoring system for carbon reduction !

International networks such as the Milan Urban Food Policy Pact for cities, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development for private companies, and the Food, Agriculture, Biodiversity, Land and Energy Consortium for scientists can help in sharing positive experience and peer learning across countries, fostering innovation. In the same vein, a global data and knowledge platform would be desirable to guide food systems transformation using science based recommendations (Singh et al. 2021). During COP 26 in Glasgow, various international key food systems-related activities were announced (box 6.3). These and similar initiatives carry the potential to unite actors internationally, (e.g. countries, international organizations, think tanks, development banks and more) to mobilize resources and capacity and pursue common goals.

The Declaration has 141 signatory governments that together represent around 91 per cent of forested areas. The Forest, Agriculture and Commodity Trade Roadmap aims to halt forest loss associated with agricultural commodity production and trade, joined by 28 countries and 12 companies so far that hold a considerable market share in forest commodities (that is, in soy, palm oil, cocoa and cattle). The High Ambition Coalition for Nature and People includes nearly 100 countries that push for the ratification of ambitious post-2020 biodiversity targets at the upcoming Convention on Biological Diversity, such as placing 30 per cent of the territory under protection by 2030. The Global Methane Pledge, currently signed by 122 countries, aims to reduce methane emissions by 30 per cent below 2020 levels. 65 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window Transforming the finance system to enable the achievement of the Paris Agreement Lead authors: Pieter Pauw (Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands), Dipak Dasgupta (The Energy and Resources Institute - TERI, India), Heleen de Coninck (Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands) Contributing authors: Lilia Couto (University College London Institute for Sustainable Resources and Chatham House, United Kingdom), Michael K\u00f6nig (the Frankfurt School \u2013 UNEP Centre for Climate and Sustainable Energy Finance, Germany), George Marbuah (Stockholm Environment Institute, Sweden), Luis Zamarioli (the Frankfurt School \u2013 UNEP Centre for Climate and Sustainable Energy Finance, Germany) 7 7.1 Introduction: The need for a transformation of the financial system A realignment of the financial system is a critical enabler of the sectoral transitions required to address the current climate crises. Article 2.1(c) of the Paris Agreement calls for this and establishes a new objective for all countries to make finance flows consistent with low-carbon and climate- resilient development pathways (United Nations Framework on Climate Change Convention [UNFCCC] 2015). In contrast to the mobilization of climate finance for developing countries under the UNFCCC (article 9), another key goal, the climate consistency of finance flows represents a new purpose that relies on support and action to transform the global financial system (Zamarioli et al. 2021). This chapter therefore focuses on a transformation of the financial system that engages all relevant actors, including governments, central banks, commercial banks and institutional investors. The success of the transformation can ultimately be measured based on two indicators: a rapid increase in investments in low-carbon assets worldwide and a rapid decrease in investments in greenhouse gas (GHG)-intensive assets. Although this has significance for all sectors, examples in this chapter focus on the energy sector, where literature on finance and transformation is emerging (Steffen and Schmidt 2021). 1 Methodological issues and data limitations persist. Limited data availability prevents a full accounting of domestic government expenditures on climate finance and of private sector investments in energy efficiency, transport and land use (Buchner et al. 2021). Investments in low-carbon assets need to rapidly increase. Tracked climate-related investments in mitigation rose significantly to about US$571 billion per year in 2019\u20132020 (Buchner et al. 2021).1 However, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that global mitigation investments need to increase by the factor of 3 to 6. In developing countries, this gap is even larger (see figure 7.1) (Kreibiehl et al. 2022).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4cd4f044-88e7-463c-872e-a72a7344458b": {"__data__": {"id_": "4cd4f044-88e7-463c-872e-a72a7344458b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "102d734cfad26cda4983d7745656b0860750c3ce4278061487df9bbdf5fb3a80"}, "2": {"node_id": "d9fd4cd6-0735-49cb-9d81-878909f4eda3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d00d9b23f5df161c049fa7f805ed863348e68f585e828b853d531295192610c5"}}, "hash": "7016e47a56f8c992d0d957c307d222a71fa324377f527eb6623f0a2837175f37", "text": "2022).

Developing economies account for 83 per cent of global population, one half of global GDP (in purchasing power parity terms), and 36 per cent of global GDP (at market- based exchange rates) (World Bank 2020). Given their development needs and low per capita consumption of energy, virtually the entire future increase in global primary energy demand is expected to occur in these economies (International Energy Agency 2021). An 'efficient' global financial market would mobilize flows from capital abundant high-income economies for investment in faster-growing and capital-scarce developing economies in theory (see section 7.3), but this mobilization is missing in practice (Agenor 2001; Gourinchas and Jeanne 2006; Obstfeld 2021). There are at least three \u2018frictions\u2019 that prevent capital markets from investing more in developing countries. First, the perceived high risks of investing (Koepke 2018), sometimes attributed to weaker policy settings and compounded by credit rating agency risk assessment and their observed bias or tendency to assign higher credit ratings to firms and enterprises located in financial centres (Ioannou, W\u00f3jcik and Pa\u017eitka 2021). Exchange rate risks can be an additional deterrent in contexts where local capital markets are not well developed and the risks cannot be hedged because of limited risk markets. In marked contrast, investments in fossil fuel sectors in many developing countries are considered less risky because such investments, as globally traded primary energy sources, have greater asset backing and liquidity. For example, the single biggest private investment in sub-Saharan Africa in 2020 was in fossil fuel (liquefied natural gas [LNG]) export investment (Pekic 2022). Second, persistent \u2018home-bias\u2019 of investors in high-income markets to invest within their own borders, contravening efficient capital markets functioning (Hau and Rey 2008) (Ardalan 2019). Finally, observed procyclical volatility of capital flows (larger inflows in \u2018good times\u2019 and faster outflows in \u2018bad times\u2019) can exacerbate the problem and lead to periodic economic crises, debt defaults and exchange rate volatility (Dadush, Dasgupta and Ratha 2000). These three frictions can potentially worsen with increasing climate vulnerability and unsustainable debt burdens (Volz et al. 2020) or lead to a \u201cclimate investment trap\u201d, especially for least developed countries, as in sub- Saharan Africa (Ameli et al. 2021).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c06409e-51ca-4db0-bb23-59157b1e9ea8": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c06409e-51ca-4db0-bb23-59157b1e9ea8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b5408093bac5298cd81757f69a6adfc0e3f62cef66af0f5399bce9ac2084599c"}, "2": {"node_id": "0c553e37-00d4-4af9-9bd3-e4355191bf22", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "97757a2e19b2f14891c43c2525233f7d5ca779b292e6e74420f92ab673fa5477"}}, "hash": "4daf5bfe2c37406758cf2aef87a029a8ce73e2384116fd1fbeb10cfbafb895da", "text": "2021). Multilateral development banks (MDBs) and regional development banks can play a larger and countercyclical role, but their overall role in global capital markets is relatively small and decreasing (see section 2). Strategic international positioning and growing financial resources have led to alternative South-South financing in recent years (Chen, Dollar and Tang 2016). Some developing countries have also benefited from new market instruments, such as green bonds (see section 2), but this has not provided a solution to the financing difficulties. Investments in fossil fuel assets need to decline rapidly, because they work against the clean energy transition now and lock in GHG emissions for decades to come, leading to stranded assets in the future (Campiglio et al. 2018; Mercure et al. 2018; Kreibiehl et al. 2022).

Across all portfolios in the energy sector, renewable power generated higher returns than fossil fuel investments (Fomicov et al. 2020). Additionally, current returns in fossil fuel investments are only possible because of the continued absence of clear government policies to counteract rising climate risk (Griffin et al. 2015) and because of continued public fossil fuel subsidies. Explicit fossil fuel-related subsidies (US$340 billion annually)2 are estimated to be much greater than for renewable energy (US$170 billion) (IPCC 2022). It is also in the long-term interest of the financial system to reduce investments in fossil fuel assets, because a considerable share of fossil fuel assets is likely to become stranded (Campiglio et al. 2018; Mercure et al. 2018; Kreibiehl et al. 2022). Based on ongoing low-carbon technology trends, global estimates of potential stranded fossil fuel assets amount to at least US$1 trillion. When more stringent policies to limit global warming to well below 2\u00b0C are adopted, these can increase to US$4 trillion (Mercure et al. 2018). Together with societal and litigation risks, these technological and policy risks cause a \u201ctransition risk\u201d that 68 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window should be managed to avoid financial instability (Campiglio et al. 2018). The bursting of a carbon bubble cannot be ruled out (Griffin et al. 2015). 7.2 Aligning financial system actors with climate change The core function of the large and complex global financial system is \u201cto facilitate the allocation and deployment of resources, spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment\u201d (Merton 1990). The financial system is a network of private and public institutions such as banks, institutional investors and public institutions that regulate the safety and soundness of the system but also co-lend or finance directly. Financial systems are regulated as they influence the economic system, and their capabilities facilitate the growth and productivity of real assets (see figure 7.2 for more insight into key roles and relations of actors in the financial system). The size of assets held by a myriad of financial actors in global capital markets is very large: recent estimates indicate US$128 trillion in global bond markets (International Capital Market Association 2020), US$83 trillion in banking credit (Bank for International Settlements 2021), and US$124 trillion in equity markets (Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association 2021), totalling some US$225 trillion in credit to the non-financial sector (Bank for International Settlements 2021) and growing by about 7 per cent (US$15 trillion) annually. Given rapidly changing economic opportunities, risks and returns, decisions by actors in capital markets to change their allocation of assets even modestly, or not, have an enormous bearing on economic transitions (see box 7.2).

Between 2012 and 2021, a period that saw a surge in debt and equity markets, there was no significant increase in the relative scale of climate finance, despite large technology gains as seen in renewable energy. In contrast, other sectors, many highly speculative, saw extremely rapid growth, attracting bigger investment and financing support. The share of \u2018zombie\u2019 firms, for example, defined as firms unable to even cover debt servicing costs from current profits, rose from 4 per cent in late 1980s to 15 per cent by 2017. Such misallocation in financial markets can be attributed to low nominal interest rates and quantitative easing policies as well as a rise in central bank balance sheet assets, which hit creditworthy firms (Acharya et al. 2019). A consensus on cutting wealth taxes emerged in public finances (Lierse 2022) while fossil fuel financing remained unabated (Kirsch et al. 2022). Whether such broader macroeconomic policy and finance directions carried significant negative effects on the slow, observed progress of climate finance is a complex question (van \u2019t Klooster and Fontan 2020), but the relative magnitudes confirm that climate finance has not been significant in the financial system nor in the overall macrofinancial setting globally. A global transformation from a heavily fossil fuel energy- dependent economy to a low-carbon economy is expected to require investments of at least US$4\u20136 trillion a year, a relatively small (1.5\u20132 per cent) share of total financial assets managed, but significant (20\u201328 per cent) in terms of the additional annual resources to be allocated. While the size of the global financial system is clearly sufficient to close funding gaps, there is a qualitative mismatch between available and required types of capital (Polzin and Sanders 2020; IPCC 2022). Table 7.1 Actors in the financial system relevant to climate change Actor Role in financial system Governments Set out policies and regulations, especially to manage public goods externalities, such as climate. In addition, governments influence investments through fiscal policy levers (including green procurement), public finance (including grants, loans and sovereign guarantees) and information instruments (Whitley et al. 2018). Furthermore, governments own and operate financial institutions such as development finance institutions (DFIs), \u2018green\u2019 banks, climate funds, export credit and aid agencies (see below). Central banks and financial regulators Primary mandate to ensure price stability and financial stability in the economy. Institutional settings vary between countries, but many central banks also have a mandate to support government policies. Dikau and Volz (2021) found that 114 central banks consider curbing climate change as part of their existing mandate. Besides, climate change poses risks to financial stability and has implications for prudential regulation. 70 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window DFIs (bilateral and multilateral) Provide financial and technical support to developing countries public and private sectors, thereby filling gaps where governments and other financial actors cannot deploy needed investments in critical sectors of the economy. Backed by their shareholders, DFIs have recognized the need to play an essential role through initiatives (e.g. green bond programmes by the International Finance Corporation, African Development Bank and European Investment Bank; mainstreaming climate in financial institutions\u2019 initiatives) in addressing global development challenges such as climate change. International climate funds Channel international public finance to mitigation and adaptation projects in developing countries. The funds vary in size, geographic coverage, aims and governance. Export credit agencies (ECAs) Official or quasi-official government agencies that provide government-backed support for the international operations of corporations from their home country. Such support can either take the form of credits (financial support) or credit insurance and guarantees (pure cover) or both, depending on the ECA's mandate. This way, ECAs can crowd in billions of dollars of private investment. Insurance industry Provides insurance as a risk management instrument to hedge against the risk of contingent or uncertain (financial) loss. Insurance payouts for catastrophes have increased significantly over the last 10 years, and this trend is expected to continue (Kreibiehl et al. 2022).

Equity markets Compared to other financial instruments (e.g. debt instruments, guarantees and grants), equity investments require enhanced assessment and governance (OECD 2021) because of increased investors\u2019 ownership of a company or asset class. Credit rating agencies Credit rating agencies (CRAs) are crucial actors for access to finance on international and domestic capital markets. CRAs rate the creditworthiness of debt and equity securities based on quantitative and qualitative analyses (Mathiesen 2018). Notes: See also figure 7.2. The actors within the financial system can play key roles in shaping its transformation (see H\u00f6lscher, Wittmayer and Loorbach 2018). Some of the actors in the financial system have an explicit mandate or aim to enable action on climate change (table 7.1). However, it is not the primary objective of any of them, except for the climate funds, to address climate change. Furthermore, successful integration of climate risks into financial decision-making requires a time-horizon of multiple decades, but most actors in the climate finance system typically have time-horizons of 1\u20135 years (Chenet 2019). Aligning the actors of the financial system with the goals of the Paris Agreement is therefore challenging. Public sector actors Public sector authorities are most strongly linked to climate change, in particular governments, central banks and regulators, DFIs and climate funds. Governments, as signatories to the Paris Agreement, have a responsibility to implement its article 2.1(c), but they are also important to give climate policy signals to address macroeconomic uncertainty and to help guide investment decisions (Kreibiehl et al. 2022). Central banks and financial regulators recognize that climate change can impact the macroeconomic aggregates that they are required to stabilize, such as inflation and employment (Robins, Dikau and Volz 2021). Furthermore, climate impacts and the transition to net zero will affect financial markets (key for the monetary transmission), financial institutions (often supervised by central banks) and the broader financial system, for which central banks have 71 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window a macroprudential mandate (Chenet, Ryan-Collins and van Lerven 2021; Svartzman et al. 2021). Central banks must choose how to react to climate change: by trying to maintain the status quo by focusing purely on climate risk assessment, which is more easily framed within their primary mandate of financial stability, or proactively by addressing climate change and transition risks by including climate risk criteria, e.g. in their asset purchase programmes, adjusting collateral frameworks and capital requirements (see Bolton et al. 2020). The former will pose a barrier to the transformation of the financial system because risk disclosure alone does not ensure the expected shift in financial decision-making (Ameli et al. 2021). Bilateral and multilateral DFIs have recognized their role in addressing climate change. For example, some European DFIs have committed to ending lending to fossil fuel projects by 2030 as well as immediately ceasing the financing of new oil and coal projects (e.g. European Investment Bank, Investment Fund for Developing Countries [IFU], and Swedfund, which has invested in renewables only since 2014). Using instruments such as loans, guarantees and equity acquisitions, many DFIs leverage their financial resources to mobilize and scale up finance to address climate change in developing countries (Lemma 2015; Attridge, te Velde and Andreasen 2019). However, despite their potential significance in climate finance, the eight largest international DFIs only mobilized US$50 billion in mitigation finance in 2020 (African Development Bank et al. 2020). This may reflect their preference for direct project finance operations (Hourcade, Dasgupta and Ghersi 2020) over de-risking and crowding in private capital (African Development Bank et al. 2015) as well as limits on their capital exposure (single-country exposure limits). Climate funds have a stronger focus on climate change than DFIs but they are relatively small: together, they held US$34.8 billion in deposits from donors and committed US$28.4 billion in approved projects by January 2022 (Climate Funds Update 2022). Some funds function exclusively through grants, as in the case of the Adaptation Fund, while others, such as the Green Climate Fund (GCF), use a variety of financial instruments to engage public and private actors to implement and co-finance projects.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e57fe40-3e5e-488b-a658-415174603153": {"__data__": {"id_": "2e57fe40-3e5e-488b-a658-415174603153", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a473ae8a444761ce1d439297ddeddaaf8c8ecc0174671314a77b76638755d995"}, "2": {"node_id": "37fa3164-36a7-48a9-9c9a-3d90fc972066", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9e32fbcab3130e5b8d29973f405a7642f62bd299eeb4f2d7f507f179f44286ac"}}, "hash": "91851758bc4c0d5d16bebb348f3d744242eb028ef642b166360c53ba36934d6e", "text": "Since 2020, the GCF also intends to support mainstreaming of climate considerations in developing countries\u2019 national financial systems, by developing climate investment capacities of national institutions or by formulating supportive policy/ regulatory frameworks (GCF 2020).

Basel III introduces stricter standards for banks on both the liquidity of their assets and the robustness of their capital. least US$120.3 billion in support for fossil fuel projects (excluding the Export-Import Bank of the United States) (Tucker and DeAngelis 2020). ECAs thus currently tend to work against the implementation of article 2.1(c) and the low-carbon transformation (see Shishlov, Censkowsky and Darouich 2021). If the public sector-backed financial system actors would work in an aligned way towards shifting financial flows away from high-GHG investments to low-GHG ones, they could multiply each other\u2019s impact and increase the viability of low-GHG projects. Private sector actors Private actors in the financial system include commercial banks, insurance companies, institutional investors and private equity (equity markets). Commercial banks are simultaneously an important source of debt financing for low-carbon investments (Polzin, Sanders and T\u00e4ube 2017) and a source of fossil fuel financing. As an illustration, the world\u2019s 60 largest banks alone provided US$4.6 trillion in fossil fuel financing in the six years since the adoption of the Paris Agreement, with no sign of decline (see Kirsch et al. 2022). Macroprudential regulation, such as Basel III,3 promotes short-termism and hence negatively affects the already problematic access to finance of low-emission sectors (Campiglio 2016). For the insurance industry, climate change is a threat because losses limit the affordability (through increased premiums) and availability of coverage (when insurers withdraw from particular perils and geographical areas) (Collier, Elliott and Lehtonen 2021). Financial instruments are being developed by private insurers and other financial services entities to price in climate risks, but a majority of the companies does not integrate climate change into their risk management practices (e.g. Thistletwaite and Wood 2018). Furthermore, internal conflicts may arise when an insurer\u2019s underwriters advise against issuing insurance in areas with increasing climate risk, while doing so would decrease the value of the insurer\u2019s real estate investments in that same area (Riedl 2022). Institutional investors (including insurers) accounted for just 0.2 per cent of total climate-related finance flows in 2016 (Ameli et al. 2020). The very broad current permissive classifications of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments obscures rather than promotes scaled- up climate finances (Berg, K\u00f6lbel and Rigobon 2019). More significant action has also been limited by the priorities of institutional investors on short-term returns, lack of climate expertise and their lingering scepticism about climate risk exposure. 72 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window In equity markets, private equity expansion (e.g. corporate financing or early-stage investors into a portfolio of start-ups) is essential for riskier tranches of low-carbon investments (Hourcade et al. 2021), but private equity energy investments continue to be dominated by GHG-intensive activities. The higher cost of equity capital for GHG-intensive production activities provides still a relatively weak market disincentive mechanism (Trinks et al. 2022). While still predominantly a barrier to addressing climate change, private actors in the financial system demonstrate a willingness to act on climate change. For example, the United Nations-convened Net-Zero Banking Alliance brings together a global group of 117 banks, currently representing about 39 per cent of global banking assets (UNEP Finance Initiative 2022). Insurance companies and institutional investors are increasingly aware of the risk climate change is posing as well as increasing ESG pressures from shareholders and stakeholders. However, effects have been limited so far. This is where CRAs may contribute. Climate and ESG risks are increasingly integrated into CRAs\u2019 rating methodologies (Mathiesen 2018; Angelova et al. 2021) and climate risks have started to negatively affect credit ratings (Cevik and Jalles 2020). Especially in developing countries, higher-risk premiums have already raised costs of public (sovereign) capital (Beirne, Renzhi and Volz 2021; Kling et al. 2021). However, climate risks tend to materialize with high uncertainties and on longer time-horizons (Network for Greening the Financial System [NGFS] 2020; Coelho and Restoy 2022), while ratings issued by CRAs are relatively short-term-oriented.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "27508d31-4019-4529-bef6-e48ad6702e5f": {"__data__": {"id_": "27508d31-4019-4529-bef6-e48ad6702e5f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "07fc7e8494b54c919aef0dbbfc49d01ddd7cb7fd8fe9b12635e60db36f8b5e04"}, "2": {"node_id": "11d34ec5-8dee-4456-9d8e-6ddd0454ea7f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7e60c1e385b53247ec2f87956f51fed322a90b605059c2c6fd579c1e8e247844"}}, "hash": "1e5267cbdecca49587d6660f1e823a3ee7333052ca4b9960aaafa85c54f74be3", "text": "The limited response by CRAs to the growing scientific and economic evidence of climate- related risks may cause markets and investors to struggle to correctly identify, price and manage their investments (Agarwala et al. 2021).

A gendered approach should ensure that women will gain equally in the emerging opportunities from a green economy, while also improving effectiveness to decarbonize through, for example, girls\u2019 education. Women are inordinately affected by climate change, creating strong links between gender and adaptation. Yet evidence has shown the relevance of gender and gender-smart investments also for most mitigation-related areas, from renewable energy to agriculture and forestry, infrastructure and waste. The practice is developing to boost women\u2019s financial inclusion in climate finance/ investment, with the example of climate funds (Kreibiehl et al. 2022). Overall, however, practice and literature remain deficient, particularly in advancing the business case to mainstreaming gender in the broader context of shifting finance flows. 7.3 Transforming the financial system: Six approaches to public policy Inspired by the innovation system literature (Bergek et al. 2008; Geels 2002), the financial system can be viewed as a complex constellation of actors, interactions and institutions with a specific internal dynamic, as well as a relation to the real economy of projects, assets and policy instruments. When a system is influenced by external pressures or by social, technological or institutional innovations within the system, it can change rapidly. This has been extensively documented for technological innovation systems (Blanco et al. 2022) and recently scholars started applying the concept to finance (Hafner et al. 2020; Naidoo 2020; Steffen and Schmidt 2021). Processes to shape transitions are necessarily about interactions between technology, policy/ power/politics, economics/business/markets, and culture/ discourse/public opinion (Geels 2011). There are multiple approaches to reach inflection points that lead to a financial system capable of supporting actions to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C: \u25b6 Increase the efficiency of financial markets. In well-developed financial markets, markets function efficiently, but in their \u2018weak\u2019 form, markets are inefficient, especially in the context of uncertainty. However, agents can correct this with time and better information (Krueger et al. 2020). Financial innovations through \u2018engineering\u2019 of new financial 73 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window products to address special needs are a mark of such relatively efficient markets. The main policy prescription is better information, including taxonomies for sustainable economic activities and transparency through disclosure of climate risks (Carney 2015; Dietz et al. 2016; Zenghelis and Stern 2016; Campiglio et al. 2018). In developing country contexts (Bond, Tybout and Utar 2015; Hamid et al. 2017), priorities will include capacity-building and strengthening institutions (Banga 2019). Relying solely on the efficient markets and information disclosure can hide imperfections that are inherent to financial markets\u2019 structure and practices (Ameli, Kothari and Grubb 2021; Bolton and Kacpercyzk 2021) and depend on the uncertain (behavioural) responses of boards, stockholders and markets to such disclosures. Examples of increasing the efficiency of financial markets can be found in both developed and developing countries. For example: \u25cf through voluntary disclosures (e.g. recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Risk Disclosures) and mandatory rules (e.g. European Union Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive) on enterprises\u2019 observed emissions and projected risks from climate change \u25cf the definition of low-carbon consistent or transition activities via taxonomies and classification systems (e.g. Chinese Green Bond Catalogue and Green Industry Guiding Catalogue; Bangladeshi Green Taxonomy; European Union Taxonomy for sustainable activities) \u25cf the protection of consumers of ESG-related services against \u2018greenwashing\u2019 (e.g. by the United States of America Securities and Exchange Commission or the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority) \u25b6 Introduce carbon pricing. In the presence of strong externalities and missing or incomplete futures markets, this approach suggests that the most important response is to price carbon explicitly and high enough for it to provide signals for investors to alter decisions (Aghion et al. 2016). This can be done through carbon taxes or through cap-and-trade systems (Haites 2018).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a6ee3883-c7c4-4c90-83c2-2a221a152c9c": {"__data__": {"id_": "a6ee3883-c7c4-4c90-83c2-2a221a152c9c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "80c4b263b80592d3006b0b5050f3af6767762349f1801b09051b782e12023f34"}, "2": {"node_id": "0af658b4-a413-4035-9b2b-9dc5201697e6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4be8e6f269df4c123b6bf1cb6344206327e4479a8cd536e2c3b554c82bc7073b"}}, "hash": "06ff26c78000359e410c13fb6bde102b5eda70c98d24fbe4bd21561f97c0534d", "text": "Carbon taxes have practical appeal because they provide more certainty over future emissions prices, helping encourage low- carbon investments and lower energy use.

Similarly, the High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices (2017) concluded that an explicit carbon price level should be at least US$50\u2013100/tons of CO2 (tCO2) by 2030 to limit global warming to between 1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C warming above pre-industrial levels, provided a supportive policy environment is in place. The report proposed that this goal can also be achieved with lower near-term carbon prices, but that this would require stronger action through other policies and instruments and/or higher carbon prices later (Stern and Stiglitz 2017). Currently, there are proposals for higher near-term international carbon price floors (Chateau, Jaumotte and Schwerhoff 2022), differentiated between high-, medium- and low-income countries (US$75, US$50 and US$25, respectively). In jurisdictions without explicit carbon pricing, shadow pricing is a tool for firms, development banks and governments to internalize a carbon price in investments and take more informed decisions. Rising (minimum) carbon price floors can strengthen such future investment decision-making (Stern and Stiglitz 2017). \u25b6 Nudge financial behaviour. Climate finance markets are subject to deep information asymmetry, risk- aversion and herd behaviour (contagion and bandwagon), all of which result in inefficient choices, status quo and deter actions. In addition, the financial system is characterized by the existence of strong and complex networks, nodes and inter-linkages among financial institutions (Battiston et al. 2016), (H\u00fcser 2015). While this might create hard-to- change behaviour and inertia, they can be addressed through credible public signals directed at such financial networks and nodes. Routines are strongly determined by networks and are relatively easily adaptable: imitation of other actors\u2019 new routines can result in herding effects towards transformation (Steffen and Schmidt 2021). On the demand side, solutions to reduce consumption of GHG-intensive uses can be significant, reducing 40\u201370 per cent of the gap in low-carbon transition (Creutzig et al. 2016; Creutzig et al. 2022; IPCC 74 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window 2022) and can enhance household welfare. Current demand-side policy strategies, however, still rely heavily on individual self-responsibility. Governments need to steer more actively, through taxes, subsidies, regulations, standards, labelling and public infrastructure, especially in sectors such as mobility, food, housing and urban transitions (Moberg et al. 2019). In the case of electric vehicles, for example, in addition to subsidies and tax rebates, charging density, fuel prices and road priority incentives are increasingly important across countries (Ingeborgrud and Ryghaug 2019; Wang et al. 2019). Green finance institutions additionally play a critical role (Polzin and Sanders 2020; Song, Xie and Shen 2021) in nudging investor and financial behaviour (Zhang, Li and Ji 2020; Koutsandreas et al. 2022). Institutions and local governments pledging to divest from carbon-intense assets, for example coal and oil companies, can help. Building on climate awareness and its associated moral claims, shareholders and activists create uncertainty among institutional investors about the future stability of the fossil fuel industry and its reliability as a continuing source of profitable investment (Ayling and Gunningham 2017). The effectiveness of divestment has been criticized, for example because entities that are divesting do not account for a large share of investors, the effects might only be temporary (Ansar, Caldecott and Tilbury 2013), or because investment funds are not mandated to operate based on ethics but on rules that protect them from the forces of politics (Mercure 2019). However, the stigmatization and reputational damages impact the fossil fuel companies (Ayling and Gunningham 2017). Based on a divestment campaign by 350.org, about 1500 institutions in 71 countries representing US$40 trillion in assets are divesting (Lipman 2021). Divestment also takes place outside of this movement. For example, Europe\u2019s biggest pension fund, ABP of the Netherlands, pledged to divest US$17.4 billion worth of fossil fuel assets by 2023 (Marsh 2021) and stated that it reduced the CO2 footprint of its portfolio by 40 per cent in 2022 compared with 2015 (ABP 2022). \u25b6 Create markets.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "84206209-def9-4d2f-9267-988e5b934299": {"__data__": {"id_": "84206209-def9-4d2f-9267-988e5b934299", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "794db0e2baa01af82ecd04b7b81fb1fde96d5e72c8ac01aee0a6fd9bed01c220"}, "2": {"node_id": "bad57694-a6a9-400f-9dc6-848c36feaf72", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "21c5720863689f94676d093b6d5fddbaa00028a9395ca6e6bc75adcda887eff6"}}, "hash": "7068cc0f13f82bf229e2a5582093ce25ae0f5647ecbd939aec474585f9fb6949", "text": "\u25b6 Create markets.

In the case of low-carbon product markets, an example is the rapid uptake of LEDs in India\u2019s lighting market from negligible to a dominant share in five years (annual sales grew 130 times between 2014 and 2018) (Kamat et al. 2020), attributable to a programme aimed at lowering prices through at-scale public agency procurement. Industrialized countries can support the creation of markets in developing countries. Development banks, including green banks, can play a more active role to stimulate financial markets as newer product markets are being accelerated. These banks are at the nexus of the public and private sectors and the developed and developing worlds, and with their ability to provide concessional public financing, alongside technical and policy expertise, and working with domestic financial institutions, they can lower risks in new low-carbon asset markets (e.g. accelerated solar rooftop power in India). MDBs can support market creation through shifting financial flows, stimulating innovation and helping to set standards (e.g. for fossil fuel exclusion policies, GHG accounting and climate risk disclosure). Consistency of public policy is, however, essential: signals must go in one direction. Alignment of public policies towards creating new markets in low- carbon energy transition also requires exiting from subsidies and other support to fossil fuel sectors, such as guarantees from ECAs. Steering in other directions prolongs the status quo, and is expensive and ineffective. It also prevents norms and practices from changing, because signals towards the actors in the financial system are unclear. \u25b6 Mobilize central banks. Central banks are increasingly addressing the climate crisis, and have different tools at their disposal (see section 7.2). In December 2017, eight central banks and supervisors established the NGFS, which has now grown to 116 members and 18 observers. Mandates of central banks in developing countries are often broader than those of central banks in developed countries; More concrete action towards this approach can therefore be observed. For example, the Reserve Bank of India requires that commercial banks allocate a certain proportion of lending to a list of \u2018priority sectors\u2019, including renewable energy, and Bangladesh Bank has introduced a minimum credit quota of 5 per cent that financial institutions must allocate to green sectors (Campiglio et al. 2018). 75 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window Furthermore, prudential regulations are increasingly starting to include climate change. Prudential regulation aims at ensuring that banks and other financial institutions (the micro level) and the whole of the financial system (the macro level) are robust against market risks. Apart from stress testing, central banks could also consider green quantitative easing and making transition plans, or transition pathways, mandatory for commercial banks, for example through science-based net-zero targets with interim emissions reduction targets every five years, sectoral decarbonization trajectories for the entire portfolio, and minimizing the use of offsets (Pinko and Pastor 2022). The European Central Bank, for example, announced the incorporation of climate criteria in their asset purchase programmes in 2022. The prioritization of which bonds to purchase, or to keep in their portfolio, is crucial. By choosing to release high-emitting assets first, central banks send a strong signal to the market for firms and financial institutions. The same is true for changing capital requirements and collateral frameworks. Another important recent development is that the IMF has set up a special Resilience and Sustainability Trust Fund (special drawing rights [SDR] 33 billion, equivalent to US$45 billion) as part of the recent SDR issuance of US$650 billion in August 2021. Aim is to help low-income and vulnerable middle- income countries access long-term funding (up to 20 years) for climate change and other structural challenges, at low interest rates, using a part of new SDR reserves (IMF 2022). \u25b6 Set up climate clubs and cross-border finance initiatives. This approach draws from game theory literature, and suggests a strong advantage of smaller \u2018clubs\u2019 of cooperating countries (Nordhaus 2015), to move faster on commitments to shifting financial flows (since global climate agreements have greater difficulties in coordinated actions). Because of the smaller size and leverage of participating countries, such clubs could alter policy norms and change the course of finance through credible financial commitment devices, such as sovereign guarantees on cross-border financial flows. For example, at COP 26 in Glasgow, a group of 34 countries signed an agreement to end new direct public support for the international unabated fossil fuel energy sector by the end of 2022, except in limited and clearly defined circumstances that are consistent with a 1.5\u00b0C warming limit and the goals of the Paris Agreement (United Nations Climate Change Conference", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3876414e-3365-4071-96fc-e5d7dd597753": {"__data__": {"id_": "3876414e-3365-4071-96fc-e5d7dd597753", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "98e5c020fc2a94033cd9e922d8cda08530dd06a5c715f65e26661e18f01a22fd"}, "3": {"node_id": "ba894cbb-a8d1-4ab7-9149-2520429b10ca", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cbaa606dd3b1ad56974937162683dd0f5b4a0f13feddaaaf6a7aca5ae5c653f5"}}, "hash": "704f0f4c04ba8c94970a616e892cba5260dd50ff82b666120a6bc894698a356d", "text": "of the Parties 2021). This agreement directly targets ECAs. For the transition of the financial system, it is crucial that this agreement is fully implemented and that additional countries join the agreement, as Japan did in the context of the G7 meeting in 2022. The International Just Energy Transition Partnership initiative was also announced at COP 26, and could be enlarged and operationalized. Climate clubs are more effective and could do more; they currently primarily act as information-sharing and voluntary arrangements among small groups of influential cooperating countries (such as at the G20) (Unger and Thielges 2021). Another example is fossil fuel subsidy reform, an emerging norm (Skovgaard and van Asselt 2019) that is advocated by climate clubs. For example, after earlier commitments by the G20 and the Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation to reform fossil fuel subsidies, this was also mentioned in the UNFCCC Glasgow Climate Pact. A demonstration effect caused by deepening these initiatives domestically would have an important impact. Evidence on the effectiveness of the six approaches above suggests that there is no single \u2018silver bullet\u2019 that will transform the financial system, and that multiple instruments, institutions and actors under different approaches need to be mobilized (see table 7.2). For example, while institutional investors are making markets more efficient by applying exclusionary screens (or not), they have done so solely on the basis of scope 1 emissions intensity, and only for the industries with the highest CO2 emissions (oil and gas, utilities, and motor industries) (Bolton and Kacperczyk 2021). It will take time and more reliable data to overcome such shortcomings. Similarly, when governments postpone ambitious climate policy, the transition risks are downplayed, which makes the short-term effects for financial stability less problematic, thus limiting action by central banks with the mandates they have (even if long-term risks are aggravated). Instead, nested and coordinated approaches are likely to work better in transforming climate finance (Schmidt and Sewerin 2019; Bhandary, Gallagher and Zhang 2020): the ensure that action is implemented in the same direction, tailored to contexts and pursued across major groups of countries, with equity and a just transition within and between countries. The institutional challenges to achieving such coordinated and cooperative actions, however, ultimately depend on public support and pressures to avert the significant risks of inaction. Adopting multiple approaches in the same direction ultimately helps address a variety of different binding constraints to accelerate the pace of change. Low- carbon transitions are undertaken by a wide range of actors with differing interests, resources, capabilities and beliefs about their preferred solutions (Geels, Berkhout and van Vuuren 2016; Edomah et al. 2020). The other reason is that a multiplicity of approaches may signal a stronger \u2018whole of 76 Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window society\u2019 commitment. For example, combinations of carbon taxes, use of pooled green bond markets and supportive state fiscal policies have worked in some contexts (Hoff 2017; Nassiry 2018; Andersen 2020; Hans et al. 2022). These, in turn, help drive faster movement up the typical S-curves observed in the uptake of large system/technological/finance transitions where such transitions are typically non-linear (Dasgupta 2015; Grubb, Drummond and Hughes 2020).

Anthropogenic methane: Methane emissions derived from human activities. Anthropogenic emission sources include coal mining, agricultural practices, wastewater treatment, certain industrial processes and oil and gas systems, among others. Baseline/reference: The state against which change is measured. In the context of climate change transformation pathways, the term \u2018baseline scenarios\u2019 refers to scenarios that are based on the assumption that no mitigation policies or measures will be implemented beyond those that are already in force and/or are legislated or planned to be adopted. Baseline scenarios are not intended to be predictions of the future, but rather counterfactual constructions that can serve to highlight the level of emissions that would occur without further policy effort. Typically, baseline scenarios are compared to mitigation scenarios that are constructed to meet different goals for greenhouse gas emissions, atmospheric concentrations or temperature change. The term \u2018baseline scenario\u2019 is used interchangeably with \u2018reference scenario\u2019 and \u2018no policy scenario\u2019 In much of the literature, the term is also synonymous with the term \u2018business as usual (BAU) scenario\u2019, although the term \u2018BAU\u2019 has fallen out of favour because the idea of \u2018business as usual\u2019 in century- long socioeconomic projections is hard to fathom. Carbon border adjustment mechanisms: Mechanisms that act to equalize the price of carbon between domestic products and imports to eliminate financial incentives in order to relocate production outside of regions with strong climate controls. Carbon dioxide emission budget (or carbon budget): For a given temperature rise limit, for example a 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C long-term limit, the corresponding carbon budget reflects the total amount of carbon emissions that can be emitted for temperatures to stay below that limit. Stated differently, a carbon budget is the area under a carbon dioxide (CO2) emission trajectory that satisfies assumptions about limits on cumulative emissions estimated to avoid a certain level of global mean surface temperature rise. Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e): A way to place emissions of various radiative forcing agents on a common footing by accounting for their effect on climate. It describes, for a given mixture and amount of greenhouse gases, the amount of CO2 that would have the same global warming ability, when measured over a specified time period. For the purpose of this report, greenhouse gas emissions (unless otherwise specified) are the sum of the basket of greenhouse gases listed in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol, expressed as CO2e assuming a 100-year global warming potential. Carbon markets: A term for a carbon trading system through which countries may buy or sell units of greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to meet their national limits on emissions, either under the Kyoto Protocol or other agreements, such as that among member states of the European Union. The term comes from the fact that CO2 is the predominant greenhouse gas, and other gases are measured in units called carbon dioxide equivalent. Carbon neutrality: This is achieved when an actor\u2019s net contribution to global CO2 emissions is zero. Any CO2 emissions attributable to an actor\u2019s activities are fully compensated by CO2 reductions or removals exclusively claimed by the actor, irrespective of the time period or the relative magnitude of emissions and removals involved. Carbon offset: See Offset. Carbon price: The price for avoided or released CO2 or CO2e emissions. This may refer to the rate of a carbon tax or the price of emission permits. In many models that are used to assess the economic costs of mitigation, carbon prices are used as a proxy to represent the level of effort in mitigation policies. Clean development mechanism (CDM): A mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol, the purpose of which, in accordance with article 12 of the Protocol, is to assist non-Annex I parties in achieving sustainable development and in contributing to the ultimate objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and to assist Annex I parties in achieving compliance with their quantified emissions XII Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On limitation and reduction commitments under article 3 of the Protocol.

Conference of the Parties (COP): The supreme body of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. It currently meets once a year to review the Convention\u2019s progress. Double counting: Double counting involves two countries taking credit for the same emissions reductions, thereby giving the impression that the world has reduced emissions more than it actually has. For example, emissions reduction credits from one country might be sold to another country, but the reductions may still be counted towards the achievement of the NDC of the country where the credits originated. Emission pathway: The trajectory of annual greenhouse gas emissions over time. Emissions trading: One of the three Kyoto mechanisms, by which an Annex I party may transfer Kyoto Protocol units to, or acquire units from, another Annex I party. An Annex I party must meet specific eligibility requirements to participate in emissions trading. EU Emissions Trading System (ETS): The EU ETS is a trading system for carbon emissions and the first international emissions trading system in the world. The EU ETS covers the following sectors and gases: electricity and heat generation, energy-intensive industry sectors (including oil refineries, steel works and production of iron, aluminium, metals, cement, lime, glass, ceramics, pulp, paper, cardboard, acids and bulk organic chemicals, commercial aviation within the European Economic Area), nitrous oxide from production of nitric, adipic and glyoxylic acids and glyoxal, and perfluorocarbons from production of aluminium. Global warming potential: An index representing the combined effect of the differing times greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere and their relative effectiveness in absorbing outgoing infrared radiation. Greenhouse gases: The atmospheric gases responsible for causing global warming and climatic change. The major greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Less prevalent, but very powerful, GHGs are hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). Greenhouse gas removal: Withdrawal of a greenhouse gas and/or a precursor from the atmosphere by a sink. Integrated assessment models: Models that seek to combine knowledge from multiple disciplines in the form of equations and/or algorithms in order to explore complex environmental problems. As such, they describe the full chain of climate change, from production of greenhouse gases to atmospheric responses. This necessarily includes relevant links and feedbacks between socioeconomic and biophysical processes. Intended nationally determined contribution (INDC): INDCs are submissions from countries describing the national actions that they intend to take to reach the Paris Agreement\u2019s long-term temperature goal of limiting warming to well below 2\u00b0C. Once a country has ratified the Paris Agreement, its INDC is automatically converted to its NDC, unless it chooses to further update it. Katowice Climate Package: The Katowice Climate Package, also known as \u2018the Katowice outcome \u2019, is a complex package containing operational guidance on information provision, communication and rules for the functioning of the climate transparency framework, the global stocktaking of overall progress and the evaluation of progress, and the provision of prior information on financial assistance. The package sets out the essential procedures and mechanisms that operationalized the Paris Agreement. The guidelines of the package aim to build greater trust and strengthen international cooperation. Kyoto Protocol: An international agreement, standing on its own, and requiring separate ratification by governments, but linked to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Kyoto Protocol, among other things, sets binding targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by industrialized countries. Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF): A greenhouse gas inventory sector that covers emissions and removals of greenhouse gases resulting from direct human- induced land use, land-use change and forestry activities. Leakage: A phenomenon whereby the reduction in emissions (relative to a baseline) in a jurisdiction/sector associated with the implementation of mitigation policy is offset to some degree by an increase outside the jurisdiction/sector through induced changes in consumption, production, prices, land use and/or trade across the jurisdictions/sectors. Leakage can occur at a number of levels: project, state, province, nation or world region.

XV Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On Foreword Foreword Climate change is no longer a future problem. It is a 'now' problem. As we saw this year, devastating impacts are spreading across the globe and growing ever stronger. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change told us a few months ago that we have a 50 per cent chance of exceeding a 1.5\u00b0C temperature threshold within the next few decades. Climate action so far has been characterized by weak promises, not yet delivered. As the Emissions Gap Report 2021 shows, the updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement fall into the same trap. These pledges only take 7.5 per cent off predicted 2030 emissions, compared to the previous round of commitments. This is far from adequate. Reductions of 30 per cent are needed to stay on the least-cost pathway for 2\u00b0C and 55 per cent for 1.5\u00b0C. If nations only implement unconditional NDCs as they stand, we are likely to hit global warming of about 2.7\u00b0C by the end of the century. Current net-zero pledges could cut another 0.5\u00b0C off global warming \u2013 but these pledges are still ambiguous, delayed in many cases and not folded into NDCs. At the same time, this year\u2019s Emissions Gap Report shows that the opportunity to use pandemic recovery spending to reduce emissions has been largely missed. To get on track to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C, the world needs to take an additional 28 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) off annual emissions by 2030, over and above what is promised in updated unconditional NDCs. For the 2\u00b0C Paris Agreement target, the additional need is lower: a drop in annual emissions of 13 GtCO2e by 2030. To be clear: we have eight years to make the plans, put in place the policies, implement them and ultimately deliver the cuts. The clock is ticking loudly. Nations must put in place the policies to meet their new commitments and start implementing them immediately. Then they must zero in on net zero, ensuring these long- term commitments are linked to the NDCs, and that action is brought forward. It is time to get the policies in place to back the raised ambitions and, again, start implementing them. This cannot happen in five years. Or in three years.

In 11 years, from 2010 to 2021, we have put in place policies that will lower annual emissions by 11 GtCO2e in 2030 compared to what would have happened without these policies. But we need to make the difference, not a difference. We cannot keep doing the same things and expect a better result. The world has to wake up to the imminent peril we face as a species. We need to go firm. We need to go fast. And we need to start doing it now. Inger Andersen Executive Director United Nations Environment Programme XVI Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On Executive summary Introduction This twelfth edition of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Emissions Gap Report comes during a year of constant reminders that climate change is not in the distant future. Extreme weather events around the world \u2013 including flooding, droughts, wildfires, hurricanes and heatwaves \u2013 have continuously hit the news headlines. Thousands of people have been killed or displaced and economic losses are measured in the trillions. Bearing witness to the increasingly clear signs of climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published the first report in its Sixth Assessment cycle addressing the \u201cPhysical Science Basis\u201d in August 2021. Dubbed a \u201ccode red for humanity\u201d by the United Nations Secretary-General, the IPCC report documents in far greater detail and with higher certainty than previous assessments how climate change and extreme events can be attributed to the build-up of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the atmosphere. There is a fifty-fifty chance that global warming will exceed 1.5\u00b0C in the next two decades, and unless there are immediate, rapid and large- scale reductions in GHG emissions, limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C or even 2\u00b0C by the end of the century will be beyond reach. Building on the new evidence from the IPCC, the twenty- sixth United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) is charged with the growing urgency of accelerating global ambition and action on both mitigation and adaptation. This year, the spotlight is on the new and updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) that countries were requested to submit in advance of COP26. As the September 2021 version of the NDC Synthesis Report published by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) illustrates, the new and updated NDCs are insufficient to achieve the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. This Emissions Gap Report confirms the findings of the UNFCCC report. It expands the assessment to consider announced mitigation pledges for 2030 in addition to the new and updated NDCs. The report shows that new or updated NDCs and announced pledges for 2030 have only limited impact on global emissions and the emissions gap in 2030, reducing projected 2030 emissions by only 7.5 per cent, compared with previous unconditional NDCs, whereas 30 per cent is needed to limit warming to 2\u00b0C and 55 per cent is needed for 1.5\u00b0C. If continued throughout this century, they would result in warming of 2.7\u00b0C. The achievement of the net-zero pledges that an increasing number of countries are committing to would improve the situation, limiting warming to about 2.2\u00b0C by the end of the century. However, the 2030 commitments do not yet set G20 members (accounting for close to 80 per cent of GHG emissions) on a clear path towards net zero. Moreover, G20 members as a group do not have policies in place to achieve even the NDCs, much less net zero. Turning to some of the opportunities for bridging the emissions gap and getting on track to net zero, the report assesses the extent to which COVID-19 fiscal recovery measures are used to accelerate a green transition. It examines the scope for reducing emissions from methane, the second-most- important GHG in terms of current anthropogenic climate forcing, to bridge the gap and get on track to net zero. Finally, the report looks into a key negotiation issue for COP26: reaching agreement on how to move forward with article 6 of the Paris Agreement dealing with cooperative approaches and market mechanisms. A large number of countries have included the use of market mechanisms in their NDC implementation plans and are waiting for the modalities to be agreed. At the same time, the use of markets and offsets in meeting net-zero emission goals is often unclear.

XVII Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On 1. Following an unprecedented drop of 5.4 per cent in 2020, global carbon dioxide emissions are bouncing back to pre-COVID levels, and concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere continue to rise. \u25b6 The COVID-19 pandemic led to an unprecedented 5.4 per cent drop in global fossil carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in 2020 (figure ES.1). Data are not yet available for all GHG emissions in 2020, but the drop in total global GHG emissions is anticipated to be smaller than the drop in fossil CO2 emissions. \u25b6 A strong rebound in emissions is expected in 2021. Preliminary estimates suggest fossil energy Figure ES.1. Global greenhouse gas emissions from all sources, 1970\u20132020 CO2 emissions could grow by 4.8 per cent in 2021 (excluding cement), and global emissions in 2021 are expected to be only slightly lower than the record level of 2019. \u25b6 Despite the large decline in CO2 emissions in 2020, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere grew by around 2.3 parts per million, in line with recent trends. It is unlikely that the reductions in emissions in 2020 will be detectible in the atmospheric growth rate, as the natural variability of around one part per million is far greater than the effect of a 5.4 per cent reduction in CO2 emissions in a single year. Solving the climate problem requires rapid and sustained reductions in emissions. 2. New mitigation pledges for 2030 show some progress, but their aggregate effect on global emissions is insufficient. \u25b6 As at 30 September 2021, 120 countries (121 parties, including the European Union and its 27 member states) representing just over half of global GHG emissions, have communicated new or updated NDCs. This year's assessment considers the new or updated NDCs communicated to the UNFCCC as well as announcements of new mitigation pledges for 2030 by China, Japan and the Republic of Korea not submitted as NDCs by 30 September. \u25b6 Just under half (49 per cent) of the new or updated NDCs submitted (from countries accounting for 32 per cent of global emissions) result in lower 2030 emissions than the previous NDC. Around 18 per cent of the NDCs (from countries accounting for 13 per cent of global emissions) will not reduce 2030 emissions relative to the previous NDC. The remaining 33 per cent of NDCs (from countries accounting for 7 per cent of global emissions) contain insufficient detail to assess their impact on emissions relative to the previous NDC (figure ES.2). Typically, this is due to a lack of information in the previous NDC, rather than the current one; the current NDCs are more transparent. 2020 2015 2010 2005 2000 1995 1990 1985 1980 1975 1970 0 60 50 40 30 20 10 CH4 LULUCF CO2 Fossil CO2 N2O F-gases 2020 data only available for fossil and LULUCF CO2 Global greenhouse gas emissions (GtCO2e) XVIII Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On Figure ES.2. Effect of new or updated nationally determined contributions on 2030 greenhouse gas emissions relative to previous nationally determined contributions \u25b6 Of the countries that have submitted new or updated NDCs, more (89 per cent) have GHG targets than before (75 per cent). However, these targets are only marginally more comprehensive in terms of sector and gas coverage.

This estimate includes reductions of around 0.3 GtCO2e resulting from other factors, including lower projections of international aviation and shipping emissions, and adjustments of countries that are projected to overachieve their NDC targets.

The impact of conditional targets is of similar magnitude. \u25b6 Taking a closer look at the G20 members, the combined impact of submitted NDCs and announced GHG reduction targets for 2030 is an annual reduction of about 3 GtCO2e compared with the previous NDCs. Six G20 members have formally submitted updated NDCs with enhanced GHG mitigation pledges: Argentina, Canada, the EU27 (counting the EU27 and its three individual G20 member states France, Germany and Italy as one), South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States of America \u2013 all of which entail reduced emissions in 2030 of about 2.1 GtCO2e compared with previous NDCs. Two G20 members (Brazil and Mexico) have submitted targets that lead to an increase in emissions of 0.3 GtCO2e, bringing the net reduction in global GHG emissions of new or updated NDCs submitted by G20 members to 1.8 GtCO2e annually by 2030. In addition, China, Japan and the Republic of Korea have announced enhanced pledges that result in annual reductions of about 1.2 GtCO2e, but have not yet formally communicated them to the UNFCCC. \u25b6 The largest reductions come from the United States of America, the EU27, the United Kingdom, Argentina and Canada (submitted) and China and Japan (announced). Two G20 members (Australia and Indonesia) have submitted NDC targets, which are assessed not to lead to additional reduction relative to the previous NDCs. One G20 member (the Russian Federation) has submitted an NDC that improves upon its previous NDC, but still does not go beyond its current policies and another three G20 members (India, Saudi Arabia and Turkey) have not yet submitted a new or updated NDC.

As a group, G20 members are not on track to achieve either their original or new 2030 pledges. Ten G20 members are on track to achieve their previous NDCs, while seven are off track. \u25b6 When considering the impact of new pledges, it should be noted that collectively the G20 members are not yet on track to achieve their previous NDCs. If current policy projections are used for those countries where policy projections are lower than what NDCs would deliver, the G20 members as a Figure ES.3.

Among them, three members (India, the Russian Federation and Turkey) are projected to reduce their emissions to levels at least 15 per cent lower than their previous unconditional NDC emissions target levels under current policies, indicating that these countries have significant room for raising their NDC ambition. As at 30 September 2021, India and Turkey have not yet submitted a new or updated NDC, while the Russian Federation has submitted a new NDC that reduces emissions, but still results in higher emissions than implied by current policies.

This is to be expected and it would indicate a lack of enhanced ambition if the new 2030 pledges were projected to be achieved with currently implemented policies. It is worth noting that Canada and the United States of America have submitted strengthened NDC targets, while independent studies suggest that they are not on track to meet their previous NDC targets with currently implemented policies. These two countries therefore need to make significant additional efforts to meet their new NDC targets. 4. A promising development is the announcement of long-term net-zero emissions pledges by 52 parties, covering more than half of global emissions. However, these pledges show large ambiguities. \u25b6 Net-zero emissions is a state where the sum of all anthropogenic emissions and removals is zero. Net-zero emissions targets are being defined in a variety of ways \u2013 the most important aspect from a global geophysical perspective being whether they cover all GHGs or CO2 only. Global net-zero CO2 emissions stabilize global warming, whereas net- zero GHG emissions result in a peak then a decline in global warming. To align with a 1.5\u00b0C limit, global CO2 emissions must reach net zero around 2050, with global GHG emissions reaching net zero 15\u201320 years later. A delay of 15\u201320 years in either net-zero CO2 or net-zero GHGs implies limiting warming to 2\u00b0C rather than 1.5\u00b0C. \u25b6 Globally, 51 countries and one party (the EU27 in addition to the net-zero pledges made by its individual member states) have pledged a net-zero emissions target that is stated in national legislation, in a policy document or in a public announcement by the government or a high-level government official. These pledges cover more than half of current global domestic GHG emissions, over half of gross domestic product (GDP) and one third of the global population. Thirteen targets covering 12 per cent of global emissions are enshrined in law. \u25b6 By number, the majority of these targets (40) are for 2050, coincident with the mid-century timescale for global CO2 emissions indicated by the IPCC as necessary for limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C. Eight targets are aimed at earlier years (2030\u20132045) and four at later years. In terms of emissions, however, the targets are split almost entirely and equally between 2050 (due to the European Union and United States of America pledges) and 2060 (due to China\u2019s pledge). \u25b6 Existing targets show variations in scope and large ambiguities with respect to the inclusion of sectors and GHGs. The majority are furthermore unclear or undecided on the inclusion of emissions from international aviation and shipping and the use of international offsets. 5. Few of the G20 members' NDC targets put emissions on a clear path towards net-zero pledges. There is an urgent need to back these pledges up with near-term targets and actions that give confidence that net-zero emissions can ultimately be achieved and the remaining carbon budget kept. \u25b6 Twelve G20 members covering just over half of global domestic GHG emissions have currently pledged a net-zero target, of which six are in law, two are in policy documents and four are government announcements. All are for the year 2050, with the exception of China\u2019s 2060 target and Germany\u2019s target for 2045. The remaining eight G20 members have so far not set net-zero targets, but three of them have communicated long-term low GHG emission development strategies to the UNFCCC (Indonesia, Mexico and South Africa). \u25b6 G20 pledges also show ambiguity. Most targets are unclear or undecided on the inclusion of offsets and of international aviation and shipping emissions. Lack of clarity is also notable on coverage of sectors and gases, but pledges that are clear show XXI Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On a tendency for comprehensive coverage. However, most show a lack of transparency regarding the approach taken to fairness, the plans for achievement (including on use of removals), and progress reporting and review. Only Canada, the European Union, France, Germany and the Republic of Korea have published their plans at the time of completing this report, and only these countries plus the United Kingdom have accountable processes for reviewing their targets. \u25b6 The pathway to net zero counts: the path followed from today until net-zero CO 2 emissions are reached determines the total amount of emitted CO2 and thereby the total carbon budget used (see bullet below).

Therefore, limiting global warming to a specified level requires that the total amount of CO2 emissions ever emitted be kept within a finite carbon budget. New IPCC estimates put the remaining carbon budget to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C relative to pre-industrial levels, with 66 per cent chance, at 400 GtCO2. For 2\u00b0C, the estimate is 1,150 GtCO2. Current annual global CO2 emissions are above 40 GtCO2/year, meaning that urgent and deep emissions reductions over the next decade are required to stay within the remaining budgets. \u25b6 As an indication of the consistency between nearer-term actions and net-zero targets, figure ES.5 plots the emissions paths for a subgroup of G20 members implied by their current NDCs and Figure ES.4.

XXIII Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On their net-zero target. Of the nine G20 members for which an emissions path can be estimated based on their net-zero target and their NDC, none have NDC targets that put them on an accelerated path towards their net-zero emissions targets. Five of these nine members, accounting for about one fifth of global domestic GHG emissions, have NDC targets that put the country\u2019s domestic emissions onto a linear path towards achieving their net-zero targets. In the other four cases, the NDCs lead to emissions in 2030 that are about 25 per cent to 95 per cent higher than a linear path towards their net-zero targets would imply. Recognizing that countries face very different circumstances, these countries urgently need strengthened and more ambitious near-term climate plans for their net- zero targets to remain achievable. \u25b6 There is an urgent need for (i) more G20 members \u2013 and indeed all countries \u2013 to pledge net- zero emissions, (ii) all countries to increase the robustness of their net-zero pledges, and (iii) all net- zero targets to be backed up by near-term actions that give confidence that the net-zero targets can ultimately be achieved. 6. The emissions gap remains large: compared to previous unconditional NDCs, the new pledges for 2030 reduce projected 2030 emissions by only 7.5 per cent, whereas 30 per cent is needed for 2\u00b0C and 55 per cent is needed for 1.5\u00b0C.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d163c23a-86d2-4346-a0a1-374c069ed205": {"__data__": {"id_": "d163c23a-86d2-4346-a0a1-374c069ed205", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2301848357c666c78c921064b0ee40d9fbb3215e5f4dad04e22d7eb0f5eee359"}, "2": {"node_id": "9c032f92-9c27-4db3-b5a7-8d0106fa8f7b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2ffae57a1ae6d4858a6eac10c8437a79daed1c7dd6b5c1b783bbbae5d97586e6"}}, "hash": "d6edfb7103af68a867b08acb98ae073e5c0ec3008d78ebe6fa21f82d4ddb019c", "text": "\u25b6 As in previous reports, the emissions gap for 2030 is defined as the difference between total global GHG emissions from least-cost scenarios that keep global warming to 2\u00b0C, 1.8\u00b0C or 1.5\u00b0C with varying levels of likelihood and the estimated total global GHG emissions resulting from the full implementation of the NDCs. \u25b6 This year, the NDC scenario has been expanded to include all the most recent NDCs (new or updated NDCs if submitted, and previous NDCs otherwise) as well as all officially announced climate change mitigation", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2b508f27-dd64-42af-b56a-05b0e4c5c93a": {"__data__": {"id_": "2b508f27-dd64-42af-b56a-05b0e4c5c93a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c67eb1c2e86a470ab3e120075fa67ab5deba334fb812ffd42c975964ac94da55"}, "3": {"node_id": "cf0486f5-3a93-41ac-804d-5a9d736ad887", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0939e4871d8bc9263309a93cb70ea83cca8c98071caa72d9ff1b371513c1678b"}}, "hash": "c7958f38e7c6db172a4925f9dc7381cc90031d52a8aac613045dd936c4b0fff6", "text": "pledges for 2030 with a cut-off date of 30 August 2021. The three least-cost scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement have been updated and their temperature outcomes re- assessed based on the Contribution of Working Group I to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. As a result, global emissions in 2030 consistent with keeping global warming below 2.0\u00b0C with a 66 per cent chance are now estimated at 39 GtCO2e, which is about 2 GtCO2e lower than in earlier reports. Similarly, the estimate for 1.8\u00b0C is about 2 GtCO2e lower than the 1.8\u00b0C estimate of previous reports. There are no changes to the 1.5\u00b0C estimate (table ES.1). This implies that while the aggregate effect on global emissions in 2030 of new or updated NDCs and announced pledges is estimated at 4 GtCO2e (see point two of this summary), the gap with respect to 2\u00b0C is only reduced by 2 GtCO2e compared with last year. \u25b6 The updated current policies scenario is estimated to reduce global GHG emissions in 2030 to about 55 GtCO2e (range: 52\u201358 GtCO2e) in 2030, which is 4 GtCO2e lower than the median estimate of the 2020 Emissions Gap Report and 9 GtCO2e lower than the 2010-policies scenario (table ES.1). Around half of the decrease between the 2020 and 2021 Reports reflects climate policy progress in the countries, while the other half is because of the general slowdown of economies due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \u25b6 Collectively, countries are falling short of meeting their new or updated NDCs and announced pledges with current policies. This implementation gap in 2030 is 3 GtCO2e for unconditional NDCs and 5 GtCO2e for conditional NDCs. \u25b6 Compared to last year, the emissions gap is only slightly narrowed by the new or updated NDCs and announced mitigation pledges. By 2030, annual emissions need to be 13 GtCO2e (range: 10\u201316 GtCO2e) lower than current unconditional NDCs imply for the 2\u00b0C goal, and 28 GtCO2e (range: 25\u201330 GtCO2e) lower for the 1.5\u00b0C goal. Both estimates are for a 66 per cent chance of staying below the stated temperature limit. If conditional NDCs are also considered, these gaps are reduced by around 2 GtCO2e and 3 GtCO2e respectively (figure ES.6, table ES.1). XXIV Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On 7. Global warming at the end of the century is estimated at 2.7\u00b0C if all unconditional 2030 pledges are fully implemented and 2.6\u00b0C if all conditional pledges are also implemented.

If conditional pledges are also fully implemented, these estimates are lowered to 2.6\u00b0C (range: 2.1\u20133.1\u00b0C). By contrast, a continuation of current policies, which are insufficient to meet the 2030 pledges, is estimated to limit warming to 2.8\u00b0C (range 2.3\u20133.3\u00b0C). \u25b6 The full implementation of the net-zero pledges, in addition to new or updated unconditional NDCs and announced pledges, further lower these temperature estimates markedly to 2.2\u00b0C (range 2.0\u20132.5\u00b0C) with 66 per cent chance. Even under this scenario, there is still more than 15 per cent chance that global warming will exceed 2.5\u00b0C by the end of the century, and just short of 5 per cent chance that it will exceed 3\u00b0C. Finally, these estimated improvements from net-zero targets should be caveated by the fact that only a few current NDCs set countries\u2019 emissions on a linear path towards reaching longer-term net- zero targets. 8. The opportunity to use COVID-19 fiscal rescue and recovery spending to stimulate the economy while fostering a low-carbon transformation has been missed in most countries so far. Poor and vulnerable countries are being left behind. \u25b6 The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated an enormous increase in public expenditure, in the form of: (i) short-term rescue spending, to keep businesses and people alive; (ii) longer- term recovery investment, to reinvigorate the economy; and (iii) reinforcement spending, to embed new economic trajectories into long-term development plans. Low-carbon rescue spending has incentivized decarbonization through green conditionalities attached to short-term business support. Low-carbon recovery investment has set out to accelerate the low-carbon transition directly by supporting green projects and indirectly by incorporating green incentives into traditional investment. Green reinforcement initiatives deliver long-term support to the projects and sectors targeted by green recovery investment. \u25b6 Approximately US$16.7 trillion was spent to May 2021 on COVID-19-related rescue and recovery packages (excluding unallocated European Union funds).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "50a84227-ae2c-4e34-86ec-d3ab1639e9ed": {"__data__": {"id_": "50a84227-ae2c-4e34-86ec-d3ab1639e9ed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b0ae1ffdf1fd2284e52722f940f9d7428b6cc4dd791d2865cbeeae4d641d91f"}, "2": {"node_id": "de8b8446-b091-42ab-9e47-c6ed0e47ea06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b9c996a6a85d5504204879fc88b74b2a587bd2fddccf9318e79cc306fbe26100"}}, "hash": "ff9399474926b6895cf2ce034b26d7c78cfe831f1d548647b48d3f799083457a", "text": "However, most resources have been for immediate rescue spending, mostly on unemployment and worker support programmes, pandemic management, and health-care 0 50 100 150 200 US$250 bn Clean energy (4.1%) Natural infrastructure (3.8%) Clean transport (3.3%) Traditional energy (1.6%) Armed forces (0.8%) Traditional transport (9.2%) Clean R&D (1.6%) Energy efficiency (2.2%) Europe Africa Asia Latin America & the Caribbean Northern America Oceania Low- carbon measures High- carbon measures Figure 5.4 XXVII Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On services.

The United Kingdom, Spain and Sweden also rank highly, according to Vivid Economics\u2019 Greenness of Stimulus Index. \u25b6 Vulnerable nations are being left behind. COVID-19 spending has been far lower in low- income economies (~US$60 per person) than advanced economies (~US$11,800 per person) (figure ES.8). Less diversified economies, rising debt as a percentage of GDP, and corresponding limited fiscal space have constrained the ability of emerging economies and low-income countries to mobilize resources. \u25b6 Without a substantial increase in foreign aid, the difference in spending between advanced economies and emerging markets and developing economies will exacerbate gaps in development and restrict progress against climate change. Additionally, without significantly increased climate finance, emerging markets and developing economies are likely to become the world\u2019s top GHG emitters, all while disproportionately suffering the burden of climate change, which has historically been caused primarily by high-income nations. 9. Reduction of methane emissions from the fossil fuel, waste and agriculture sectors can contribute significantly to closing the emissions gap and reduce warming in the short term. \u25b6 Methane is the second-most-important GHG in terms of current anthropogenic climate forcing, and global anthropogenic methane emissions continue to increase. \u25b6 With a lifetime of about 12 years, and a global warming potential (GWP) of approximately 82 over a 20-year period and 29 over a 100-year period, reducing methane emissions represents Figure ES.8.

Abatement potential via technical measures is also large in the waste sector and to a lesser extent in agriculture, where it will be difficult to greatly mitigate emissions without changing diets at the global or regional levels. \u25b6 Available net-negative or low-cost technical mitigation measures alone could reduce anthropogenic methane emissions by approximately 20 per cent by 2030, whereas all targeted measures could reduce emissions by about one third. Additional measures, such as switching from natural gas to renewables, dietary changes and food waste reduction could add 15 per cent to the 2030 mitigation potential. This is consistent with methane reductions in most 2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C pathways, which are approximately 34 per cent and 44 per cent, respectively, at the global level in 2030 compared to 2015. \u25b6 Current NDCs cover only about one third of the methane reduction required to be consistent with a 2\u00b0C temperature goal, and only about 23 per cent of what is needed for the 1.5\u00b0C goal. There are, however, excellent opportunities to include additional methane reduction measures in NDCs, as several countries are already demonstrating, for example through actions such as upstream leak detection and repair in oil and gas systems, elimination of gas flaring, energy recovery from landfill gas, and reducing food waste and loss. \u25b6 Action is often hampered by the fact that reported methane emissions are highly uncertain given the large number and complexity of emission sources and the uncertainty over emission factors. Recent developments in measurement capabilities enable total emissions rates to be monitored, including at the facility scale for larger emission sources. Although these measurements will provide a much better basis for decisive actions, they need to be used systematically and to become a key element in preparing national policies. 10.

Particularly, participants with hard-to- abate emissions would be enabled to meet their mitigation goals at lower costs. \u25b6 From a market-integrity perspective, the optimal situation would be for NDCs to come with comprehensive GHG coverage, clearly quantifiable mitigation goals, and robust accounting, but NDCs are currently very heterogeneous. This creates challenges for developing a robust international market. The agreed rules need to ensure environmental integrity and encourage enhanced ambition. A global market system would best facilitate progress towards meeting the Paris goals, if countries are not allowed to capture the benefits of lower cost without raising ambition, or if countries that are selling off cheap mitigation options subsequently ensure delivery on the costlier ones. \u25b6 The use of market mechanisms could have important implications for both mitigation and sustainable development pathways. In addition to potentially lowering the cost of additional ambition everywhere, markets could lead to a shift in capital investment towards selling regions, and in this way affect metrics such as local air quality, employment and sustainability, and shift costs. Nevertheless, there is a risk that this could lead to reduced incentives for technological innovation in buying regions. \u25b6 Global modelling studies estimate that if all NDCs were transformed into tradable emissions abatement and all countries had economy-wide targets, around 4\u20135 GtCO2e could be traded per year by 2030. If the savings from more cost- XXIX Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On effective global implementation of NDCs were redeployed towards increased ambition, the emissions reductions planned in current NDCs could be roughly doubled over the next decade at no added cost to parties, compared to parties acting alone to implement their commitments. \u25b6 These studies indicate the significant theoretical potential of carbon markets. For this potential to be realized, these theoretical findings need to be translated into real-world policy changes. The challenge for COP26 negotiations is to decide on the necessary guidance for article 6 that can launch a global market that is able to gradually expand and improve as pledges evolve and experiences are gained. \u25b6 The number of countries that in their new or updated NDCs have indicated the planned or possible use of voluntary cooperative approaches has almost doubled compared to the previous NDCs, indicating significantly increased interest. \u25b6 For markets to play a role in the process towards net-zero emissions, NDCs should cover all sectors and gases and have economy-wide quantitative goals. With narrowing cost differences over time, the volume of trading would likely diminish, while the transactional value would increase. The market would increasingly focus on CO2 removal from the atmosphere. 1 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On Introduction Authors: Anne Olhoff (UNEP DTU Partnership), John Christensen (CONCITO [Denmark\u2019s climate think tank]) 1 1.1 Context of the Emissions Gap Report 2021 This twelfth edition of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Emissions Gap Report comes during a year of constant reminders that climate change is not in the distant future. Extreme weather events around the world \u2013 including flooding, droughts, wildfires, hurricanes and heatwaves \u2013 have continuously hit the news headlines. Thousands of people have been killed or displaced and economic losses are measured in the trillions. Bearing witness to the increasingly clear signs of climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published the first report in its Sixth Assessment cycle addressing the \u201cPhysical Science Basis\u201d in August 2021. Dubbed a \u201ccode red for humanity\u201d by the United Nations Secretary-General, the IPCC report documents in far greater detail and with higher certainty than previous assessments how climate change and extreme events can be attributed to the build-up of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the atmosphere. There is a fifty-fifty chance that global warming will exceed 1.5\u00b0C in the next two decades, and unless there are immediate, rapid and large- scale reductions in GHG emissions, limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C or even 2\u00b0C by the end of the century will be beyond reach. Building on the new evidence from the IPCC, the twenty- sixth United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) is charged with the growing urgency of accelerating global ambition and action on both mitigation and adaptation. This coincides with an important milestone in the five-year ambition-raising cycle of the Paris Agreement, whereby countries were requested to submit new or updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) that represent a progression compared with previous NDCs before COP26. There is therefore a special focus both in the international discussions and in this year's Emissions Gap Report on the ambition level in the new and updated", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "70a37e94-5886-4464-9aed-da45a8feae65": {"__data__": {"id_": "70a37e94-5886-4464-9aed-da45a8feae65", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "07588495bc3287ef4e56ad3315ede567a75b1368f44ab25b9662b987dc1e636a"}}, "hash": "07588495bc3287ef4e56ad3315ede567a75b1368f44ab25b9662b987dc1e636a", "text": "NDCs. As the September 2021 version of the NDC Synthesis Report published by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) illustrates, the new and updated NDCs are insufficient to achieve the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 2021). This Emissions Gap Report confirms the findings of the UNFCCC report. It expands the analysis to consider new or updated NDCs and mitigation pledges that have been announced for 2030 and assesses the impacts of these on global emissions, the emissions gap and projected global warming at the end of the century. Furthermore, it provides an in-depth assessment of the net- zero pledges that an increasing number of countries are committing to, including whether 2030 plans set countries on a clear path towards their longer-term net-zero pledges. 1.2 Focus, approach and structure of the report Each year, the Emissions Gap Report provides an updated assessment of the gap between i) estimated future global GHG emissions if countries implement their climate mitigation pledges and ii) the global emission levels from least-cost pathways that are aligned with achieving the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to well below 2\u00b0C and pursuing 1.5\u00b0C. This difference between where we will likely be and where we need to be is now well known as the \u2018emissions gap\u2019. This year, the new or updated NDCs as well as officially announced mitigation pledges for 2030, with a cut-off date of 30 September 2021, are included in the assessment. One of the United Kingdom\u2019s key goals for its COP26 presidency is to secure global net zero by mid-century and keep 1.5\u00b0C within reach (United Nations and United Kingdom undated). To date, 49 countries (50 parties, including the European Union) have firmly pledged net-zero emission goals by around mid-century, and a large number of non- state actors have joined the High-Level Climate Champions in the Race To Zero campaign that aims to elevate ambition and mobilize credible climate action among cities, regions, businesses and investors. Given the increasing importance of and attention to net-zero emission pledges, the report includes a special chapter on net zero which assesses the trends in and robustness of these goals, including whether 2030 commitments set countries on a clear path towards their longer-term net-zero pledges. 2 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On The report also includes three chapters on opportunities to bridge the emissions gap that are pertinent to the current global situation and the COP negotiations. First, an updated assessment is provided on the extent to which COVID-19 fiscal recovery measures are used to accelerate a green transition. Second, the scope for reducing emissions from methane, the second largest GHG, to bridge the gap and get on track towards net zero is examined. Finally, the report looks into a key negotiation issue for COP26: reaching agreement on how to move forward with article 6 of the Paris Agreement dealing with cooperative approaches and market mechanisms. A large number of countries have included the use of market mechanisms in their NDC implementation plans and are waiting for the modalities to be agreed. As in previous years, this 2021 Emissions Gap Report has been prepared by an international team consisting of 78 leading scientists from 44 expert institutions across 24 countries, assessing all available information, including that published in the context of the IPCC reports, as well as in other recent scientific studies. The transparent and participatory assessment process has been overseen by an experienced steering committee. All chapters have undergone external review and the assessment methodology and preliminary findings were made available to the governments of the countries specifically mentioned in the report in order to provide them with the opportunity to comment on the findings. The report is organized into seven chapters, including this introduction. Chapter 2 assesses the trends in global GHG emissions and how they are affected by COVID-19, and provides a global and G20-member-specific overview of new, updated and announced NDCs. Chapter 3 provides an assessment of net-zero emission pledges. Chapter 4 updates the assessment of the likely emissions gap in 2030, based on new or updated NDCs as well as officially announced mitigation pledges for 2030. The chapter then looks at the implications of the emissions gap on the feasibility of achieving the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. Chapter 5 assesses the extent to which COVID-19 fiscal rescue and recovery measures to date can support low-carbon or high-carbon development. It also looks at the disparities between high-income and developing countries.

GHG emissions reached a record high of 51.5 gigatons of CO2 equivalent (GtCO2e) in 2019 without LUC emissions and 58.1 GtCO2e when including LUC4 (figure 2.1). These 2019 estimates of global GHG emissions have been downward adjusted compared with the Emissions Gap Report 2020, as more complete data have become available. 3 This change was made to be more in line with the decisions of the twenty-fourth United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP24) held in Katowice, where parties agreed to use GWPs from the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report for reporting reasons. However, a full switch to using Fifth Assessment Report GWPs in this report is not yet possible as the literature is still not up to date on this decision. 4 The GHG emissions data in this report are based on the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR; Crippa et al. 2021), PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (Olivier and Peters 2021) and LUC from the Global Carbon Project (Friedlingstein et al. 2020). EDGAR data are available until 2020 for CO2, but only until 2018 for non-CO2 emissions. Non-CO2 emissions were extrapolated to 2019 based on the Emissions Gap Report 2020. GWPs were used from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report. All estimates for 2019 and 2020 should be considered preliminary. Different GHGs play different roles in the changes in total GHG emissions (figure 2.1). Fossil CO2 emissions dominate total GHG emissions including LUC (66 per cent since 2010), as well as the growth in GHG emissions. Fossil CO2 emissions reached a record 37.9 GtCO2 in 2019, but dropped to 36.0 GtCO2 in 2020. CO2 emissions from LUC have constituted 10 per cent of cumulative GHG emissions since 2010, and can change significantly from year to year due to climate conditions (Friedlingstein et al. 2020; Canadell et al. 2021). Estimates in this chapter only consider the direct effects of LUC and represent the average of three bookkeeping models (Friedlingstein et al. 2020). Furthermore, the estimates assume that 2020 emissions are similar to the 2010\u20132019 average, based on preliminary estimates of fire data. No preliminary estimates are available for the growth of non-CO2 emissions in 2020. 5 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On Figure 2.1.

The change in fossil CO2 emissions varied across countries. Despite the pandemic, Chinese fossil CO2 emissions grew 1.3 per cent in 2020, though most other major emitters saw a decline in emissions, including the United States of America (10 per cent), the EU27 (10 per cent), India (6.2 per cent), with international transportation (shipping and aviation) dropping by 20 per cent.

(2020) 5 All figures presented in section 2.3 reflect new or updated NDCs submitted until 30 September 2021. Despite the large decline in CO2 emissions in 2020, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere grew by around 2.3 parts per million, in line with recent trends. It is unlikely that the reductions in emissions in 2020 will be detectible in the atmospheric growth rate for three reasons. First, although emission levels declined, they were still high and around the same levels as those seen in the early 2010s, meaning the amount of CO2 remaining in the atmosphere is expected to be only marginally less than if emissions grew. Second, CO2 is a cumulative pollutant with a long lifetime, so sustained emission reductions are needed to see a change in the atmospheric signal. Finally, the natural variability of around one part per million is far greater than the effect of a 5.4 per cent reduction in emissions. Similar factors mean that methane and nitrous oxide concentrations also continued to grow in line with trends, with the increase in these concentrations in 2020 the highest ever recorded. The lack of change in atmospheric concentrations despite a record drop in emissions highlights that solving the climate problem requires rapid and sustained reductions in emissions. 2.3 Trends and implications of the new or updated NDCs and other announced mitigation pledges for 2030 2.3.1 Global summary of trends in the new or updated NDCs The decision text that accompanied the Paris Agreement (1/CP.21) requested that parties whose intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) contained a time frame up to 2025 communicate a new NDC, and that parties whose INDC contained a time frame up to 2030 communicate or update that contribution by 2020. As at 30 September 2021,5 121 parties (including the European Union and its 27 member states, which submit a single NDC), representing around 52 per cent of 2018 global domestic GHG emissions (Climate Watch 2021), had submitted 94 new or updated NDCs. The NDCs communicated thus far reflect emerging trends related to the ambition, form, coverage and 7 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On conditionality of GHG mitigation pledges, as well as the expected use of market mechanisms in their achievement. Effect on 2030 emissions: Of the 94 new or updated NDCs, just under half (46 NDCs from countries representing 32 per cent of global GHG emissions) would result in lower 2030 emissions relative to the previous NDCs (figure 2.3).

Thirty-four per cent (32 NDCs from countries representing 7 per cent of global emissions) could not be compared with the previous NDCs in terms of 2030 emissions, typically due to insufficient information in the previous NDCs, as transparency has improved in the current NDCs.

Base-year targets typically (though not always) result in emissions decreasing over time relative to historical levels, whereas baseline scenario targets are typically (though not always) formulated to allow absolute emissions to continue to grow. The form of GHG targets in new or updated NDCs evolved relative to the previous round, with a slightly larger share of NDCs now setting base-year targets (from 19 per cent to 28 per cent of NDCs).

Sector and gas coverage: GHG targets can be formulated to cover a country\u2019s entire economy or only a subset of it. Targets with full coverage include the energy, industrial process and product use, waste and land sectors, as well as CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorochemicals (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride and nitrogen trifluoride. The GHG targets in the current round of NDCs are only marginally more comprehensive in terms of sector and gas coverage than in the previous round. Of the new or updated NDCs, 19 per cent had full sector and gas coverage, up from 14 per cent in those countries\u2019 first NDCs. While 8 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On seven countries improved their NDCs from partial coverage to full or nearly full coverage, three countries downgraded their NDCs from nearly full coverage to partial coverage. Conditionality: Some parties have submitted NDCs that are entirely or partially conditional on factors such as international support (e.g. finance or technology transfer), while others have submitted NDCs that are not conditional. This round of NDCs includes more unconditional elements than the last round, with 26 per cent completely unconditional, up from 24 per cent in countries\u2019 first contributions. This was largely due to countries making any mixed conditional and unconditional elements completely unconditional in their new or updated NDCs. Likewise, the share of completely conditional NDCs fell from 31 per cent to 18 per cent. Finally, parties are increasingly recognizing gender integration as a means to enhance the ambition and effectiveness of their climate action in their new or updated NDCs (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change [UNFCCC] 2021). 2.3.2 Impacts on GHG emissions by 2030 at the global and G20 levels, considering new or updated NDCs and announced mitigation pledges This section quantifies the impacts of the new or updated NDCs and announced mitigation pledges on global 2030 emissions, relative to the previous NDCs. The analysis is based on the difference in projected GHG emissions by 2030 under the full implementation of the new or updated NDC submissions and announced pledges compared with the previous NDCs. The data are from five model groups and two open-source tools.7,8 Aggregate impact on global GHG emissions in 2030 The analysis shows that the aggregate impact of the new or updated unconditional NDCs is estimated to lead to a reduction in 2030 global GHG emissions of about 2.9 GtCO2e, compared with the previous NDCs (figure 2.4). This estimate includes reductions of around 0.3 GtCO2e resulting from other factors, including lower projections of international aviation and shipping emissions, and adjustments of countries that are projected to overachieve their NDC targets. If the announced pledges of China, Japan and the Republic of Korea are included, this reduction increases to 4.1 GtCO2e. For the conditional targets, these reductions are 2.8 GtCO2e and 4.0 GtCO2e, respectively. 7 Climate Action Tracker (2021a; 2021b); Joint Research Centre with the Prospective Outlook on Long-term Energy Systems (POLES) model (Joint Research Centre 2021); PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency with the Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment (IMAGE) model (den Elzen et al. 2021, in preparation; Nascimento et al. 2021). The two open-source tools that provide NDC emissions projections for many countries are: Climate Resource (Meinshausen et al. 2021) and the World Resources Institute\u2019s Climate Watch (2021). All GHG emissions projections of the Climate Action Tracker and Climate Resource exclude LULUCF. 8 The following data sources have been used to assess announced pledges that have not yet been formally submitted: Climate Action Tracker, PBL and the Joint Research Centre. Climate Action Tracker accounts for the impact of the announcements of China and Japan, Joint Research Centre for China and Japan, and PBL for the impact of China, Japan and the Republic of Korea. 9 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On Figure 2.4.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "91807430-a721-43f8-ba93-5a1f213b38bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "91807430-a721-43f8-ba93-5a1f213b38bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7276f9506bb92aca6ad889fcc0158f6f355eae32eff9ab62d97d0c42f3d8e25e"}, "2": {"node_id": "7659fc6f-9461-4f2e-94d6-f6cfef30613e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8e0b6eb68ba21242bac30ae175d151108aaf7cfb4cd0a037363b0a11bb5a4056"}}, "hash": "664807ccd94fae42e1f4905528fe62d277507435fded38398caf89fd27c7d81f", "text": "9 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On Figure 2.4.

Two G20 members (Brazil and Mexico) have submitted targets that lead to an increase in emissions of 0.3 GtCO2e, bringing the net reduction in global GHG emissions of new or updated NDCs submitted by G20 members to 1.8 GtCO2e annually by 2030. In addition, China, Japan and the Republic of Korea have announced enhanced pledges that result in annual reductions of about 1.2 GtCO2e, but have not yet formally communicated them to the UNFCCC. The largest reductions come from the United States of America, the EU27, the United Kingdom, Argentina and Canada (submitted), and China and Japan (announced). Two G20 members (Australia and Indonesia) have submitted NDC targets, which are assessed not to lead to an additional reduction relative to the previous NDCs. One G20 member (the Russian Federation) has submitted an NDC that improves upon its previous NDC, but still does not go beyond its current policies and another three G20 members (India, Saudi Arabia and Turkey) have not yet submitted a new or updated NDC (table 2.1). Non-G20 members In comparison, the aggregate impact of the new or updated NDC submissions for the non-G20 members is an annual reduction of about 0.8 GtCO2e by 2030. Other factors Finally, additional reductions of around 0.3 GtCO2e come from the decreased international aviation and shipping emissions projections, and from countries that are projected to overachieve their NDC targets. As explained previously, for some countries, NDC emission levels are expected to be above the estimated current policies scenario, with the projections of the current policies scenario assumed for the global emissions estimate. Due to the impact on COVID-19 on GHG emissions projections under the current policies scenario, the emissions projections of many countries have lowered. This means that a larger number of countries are expected to overachieve their NDC targets, in particular India, the Russian Federation and Turkey, which lowers global GHG emissions. In addition, the methodology of the underlying models may have also been updated, which could lead to changes in global emissions estimates between scenarios. 10 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On Table 2.1.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2fe795cb-8307-4616-8a65-d544bef913d1": {"__data__": {"id_": "2fe795cb-8307-4616-8a65-d544bef913d1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "94b8a2fe7ef40701a74611d98f71e002c9dab9145cec800f5cc491bce3100e97"}, "2": {"node_id": "639e63b9-c1c7-4114-887e-780eddb0e809", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5054fa3af78f25b776e3b3c0f7b5ad5d32526fd2a5b2d3c0863a1af0a218d4b1"}}, "hash": "13c17e08ecba350a52c1b77515dfae2af8adc69ebdee4d18f10093ec7b624c5e", "text": "10 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On Table 2.1.

This assessment follows the methodology of den Elzen et al. (2019) to enable a robust comparison of projections published by independent research institutions. European Union member states are assessed as the EU27 (and not individually), with the United Kingdom now assessed separately. Official assessments published by national governments were compared with independent assessments. All data sources are presented in appendix A (available online). Policy cut-off dates ranged from 2017 to 2021 across studies. The progress assessment was based on emissions figures including land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF; see appendix A on how the emissions projections excluding LULUCF were adjusted). Recently published emissions projections for the current policies scenario and NDC scenario were collected from independent studies and considered. As at October 2021, only a few of the institutions regularly publishing national-level CO2 and GHG emissions projections for the current policies scenario had released updates that considered the potential impact of COVID-19. Annually published global studies, such as Climate Action Tracker (2021b), Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (Joint Research Centre 2021) and PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (Nascimento et al. 2021; PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency 2021), as well as national studies, such as the Rhodium Group study for the United States of America (Pitt et al. 2021), all include the impact of COVID-19 and recent policies. For these studies, the progress assessment 12 Current policy scenario projections assume that no additional mitigation action is taken beyond current policies, even if it results in NDC targets not being achieved or being overachieved (United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] 2015; den Elzen et al. 2019). Current policies scenario projections reflect all adopted and implemented policies, which for the purpose of this report are defined as legislative decisions, executive orders or their equivalent. This implies that officially announced plans or strategies alone would not qualify, while individual executive orders to implement such plans or strategies would qualify. 13 COMMIT \u2013 Climate policy assessment and mitigation modeling to integrate national and global transition pathways. used NDC target emission estimates from their previous updates (used in the Emissions Gap Report 2020). Other recent studies included several new national model scenarios from Fragkos et al. (2021) and the COMMIT13 scenario database (International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis [IIASA] 2021; van Soest et al. 2021) for Australia, China (two national studies), the EU27 and the United States of America. These studies updated some 2020 national model scenario projections from the European Horizon 2020 Linking Climate and Development Policies \u2013 Leveraging International Networks and Knowledge Sharing (CD-LINKS) project (Roelfsema et al. 2020). However, it should be noted that these scenarios did not include the impact of COVID-19. After examining the projections from the studies collected, a number of pre-2020 studies were excluded whose 2020 emission estimates were more than 10 per cent higher than the highest estimates of the three studies published in 2021 that considered the impact of COVID-19 and recent policies (Climate Action Tracker 2021b; Joint Research Centre 2021; Nascimento et al. 2021). Up-to-date official emissions projections published since November 2020 were collected from various sources, including countries\u2019 recently published national communications and biennial update reports, and other national government reports (see appendix A). Such information included annually updated projections made by the Australian and Canadian governments (Australia, Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources 2020; Canada, Environment and Climate Change Canada 2021). The most important limitation for the 2021 assessment is the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the current policies scenario projections. As at September 2021, several recent projections had either been published or prepared prior to the pandemic, and therefore did not account for its potentially significant impact on emission trends in 2020 and 2021, and in the period until 2030. Other important limitations are similar to those of previous Emissions Gap Reports (see appendix A). 2.4.2 G20 progress towards previous NDC targets and indications of progress towards new, updated or announced targets for 2030 Collectively, the G20 members are projected to fall short of their new or updated unconditional NDCs and other announced mitigation pledges for 2030.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "885ed451-d0b2-4d18-863b-b86789b77661": {"__data__": {"id_": "885ed451-d0b2-4d18-863b-b86789b77661", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f853cfaccd2c23c6a8883d59b9979ed5278cbff6e8e10da29308157b2d93ac8b"}, "2": {"node_id": "9beef325-62da-478b-a693-df536cd1b6df", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4abced7cd0393cb62f02c0078cc1b4481c4361bd9bd2dcf8fbdeff6715c8676d"}}, "hash": "4d9517acd22c703402151656296620a403b457011047029e97b38b78ac118761", "text": "Similarly, G20 members are projected to collectively fall short of their previous unconditional NDCs (as at November 2020) by 1.1 GtCO2e per year, if the unconditional NDCs of the three G20 members that are projected to significantly overachieve 13 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On their targets (India, the Russian Federation and Turkey; see table 2.2) are substituted with current policies scenario projections.

Three G20 members (India, the Russian Federation and Turkey) are projected to be at least 15 per cent lower than their previous unconditional emission target levels and therefore have significant room to increase the ambition of their NDCs (figure 2.5). Central estimates of emissions projections for 2030 under current policies were lower than those of the Emissions Gap Report 2020 for all previously mentioned G20 members, with the exception of Argentina, whose estimate remained largely unchanged. For example, for the EU27 and South Africa, current projections are roughly 10 per cent and 20 per cent lower than the projections of last year\u2019s assessment, respectively, due to enhanced policies and the impact of COVID-19. 14 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On Table 2.2.

Current policies scenario projections were also examined from official publications. The number of official publications that projected countries would achieve their point-in-time NDC target were: Australia: 0 of 1, Canada: 0 of 1, EU27: 0 of 1, Russian Federation: 0 of 1 and the United Kingdom: 0 of 1. 2. The EU Reference Scenario was used for the EU27, which assumes full implementation of the national energy and climate plans by European Union member states and sees European Union emissions reduce by around 43 per cent below 1990 levels by 2030 (European Commission 2021). Including net removals from LULUCF increases the reduction to 45 per cent. This baseline scenario indicates that additional effort would be required to meet the European Union\u2019s current 2030 energy-efficiency target, though its current 2030 renewable energy target would be met. Additional measures for member states are being prepared to fully implement national energy and climate plans submitted in 2020 (European Commission 2020). 3. The Republic of Korea\u2019s Emissions Trading Scheme (K-ETS) is an instrument used to fully achieve the country\u2019s NDC target and covers about 70 per cent of its GHG emissions.

The long-term impacts of COVID-19 on GHG emissions were also highly uncertain, especially given the fact that China\u2019s fossil CO2 emissions rebounded strongly in the second half of 2020 and in 2021 (section 2.2). This stronger-than-expected rebound was not considered in China\u2019s latest emissions projections that estimated the impact of COVID-19 (Climate Action Tracker (2021b), Joint Research Centre (2021) and PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (2021)). Six G20 members\u2019 GHG emissions were projected to fall short and therefore require further action of varying degree to meet their previous (or original) unconditional NDC targets. These G20 members are Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, the Republic of Korea and the United States of America. 15 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On \u25b6 For Australia, official projections showed that it will fall short of achieving its point-in-time target of 26\u2013 28 per cent by 2030 with implemented measures. Australia is also projected to miss its emissions budget targets for 2021\u20132030 without relying on past overachievement (Australia, Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources 2020). However, the official projections also indicated that Australia would achieve its point-in-time NDC target if its Technology Investment Roadmap is fully implemented (\u2018High technology\u2019 scenario) (Australia, Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources 2020). \u25b6 For Canada, official projections indicated that if its strengthened climate plan, A Healthy Environment and a Healthy Economy, introduced in December 2020, is fully implemented, its GHG emissions would be reduced by 31 per cent below 2005 levels, thus overachieving its previous NDC target of 30 per cent below 2005 levels (Canada, Environment and Climate Change Canada 2021). \u25b6 For Mexico, all three independent studies reviewed in this assessment showed a (minor) increase in 2030 emissions projections compared with previous assessments included in the Emissions Gap Report 2020, finding that the country would narrowly miss its original NDC target. \u25b6 The United States of America has returned to the Paris Agreement and reversed many policies of the Trump Administration that would have led to increased emissions. The central estimate for the country\u2019s 2030 emissions in this year\u2019s assessment decreased by about 0.5 GtCO2e/year (about 10 per cent). The main reasons for this result include the exclusion of two projections developed with a 2017 cut-off date for policies (Chai et al. 2017; Roelfsema et al. 2020), which were replaced with one updated national model projection of the COMMIT scenario database, and the inclusion of projections that quantified the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emissions in 2020 and beyond, and to a lesser extent on the quantified impact of the reversal of the previous Administration\u2019s policies. 15 There are several other factors for the lower emissions projections, including revisions in GHG inventory data and changes in emissions scenario methodologies, along with other underlying assumptions. It is worth noting that Canada and the United States of America have strengthened their NDC targets, though independent studies suggest that they are not on track to meet their earlier NDC targets with implemented policies. Although positive trends have been observed as described previously, these two countries need to make significant additional efforts to meet their new NDC targets. Independent studies either do not agree or are inconclusive on whether Indonesia is on track to meet its unconditional NDCs. This is mainly due to the uncertainty of LULUCF emissions projections as a result of peat fires. The central estimate for 2030 emissions in this year\u2019s assessment are higher than that of the 2020 assessment, partially due to the major revision of LULUCF emissions data and projections. The aggregate emissions for G20 members in 2030 under current policies are projected to be about 2 GtCO2e lower than that of the 2020 assessment. Consideration of 2020 emission reductions and the long-term impact of COVID-19 on the global economy has contributed significantly to the lower emissions projections. Another key factor behind these estimated lower emissions is the impact of policies adopted by G20 members in recent years, which will affect their progress towards achieving their NDC targets.15 A list of key policy measures that may have significant direct impacts on future GHG emissions adopted in 2020 and 2021 are presented in appendix A.

In 2030, the average per capita emissions of G20 members under latest NDCs and other announced 2030 pledges are projected to be slightly lower (7 tCO2e) than under the current policies scenario (7.4 tCO2e) and the previous NDCs (7.2 tCO2e). However, compared with 2010 levels, average emissions are not expected to be lower and as the figure illustrates they are still far off the median estimates consistent with 2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C scenarios by 2050, which are 1.9 tCO2e (tenth Figure 2.5b. 17 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On and ninetieth percentile range: 1.2\u20132.3 tCO2e) and 0.6 tCO2e (0.3\u20131.1 tCO2e), respectively.16 Per capita emissions vary significantly across G20 members, with India\u2019s emissions about half the G20 average for example, and Saudi Arabia\u2019s three times greater.

Emissions reductions are essential to keep the challenge of halting global warming as manageable as possible. Removals are used to balance out emissions from activities for which we have not reduced emissions to zero \u2013 hence the concept of \u2018net zero\u2019 \u2013 as well as to deliver net-negative global emissions that can gradually reverse the warming already caused. One promising development is the announcement of long- term net-zero emissions pledges by an increasing number of countries that currently account for more than half of global emissions. However, these pledges have large ambiguities and few of the latest nationally determined contributions (NDCs) put countries on a clear path towards their net-zero pledges. There is an urgent need to back net-zero pledges up with near-term targets and actions that give confidence that net-zero emissions can ultimately be achieved. This chapter looks at how net-zero emissions targets have emerged from the scientific understanding of the climate system and the goals of the Paris Agreement (section 3.2). It sets out the considerations when translating net zero from a global scientific concept to national policy targets (section 3.3), and assesses current targets in terms of their ambition, scope, transparency and consistency with near-term plans and actions (sections 3.4 and 3.5). 3.2 The science of net-zero emissions targets Net-zero emissions is a state where the sum of all anthropogenic emissions and removals is zero. Net-zero emissions targets are being defined in a variety of ways \u2013 the most important aspect from a global geophysical perspective being whether they cover all GHGs or carbon dioxide (CO2) only (Rogelj et al. 2015). Net-zero GHG emissions are achieved when total aggregate GHG emissions over a given period are equal to an equivalent amount of aggregate GHG removal (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC] 2021b). Net-zero CO2 emissions are defined similarly but for CO2 only. Other terms such as \u2018carbon neutrality\u2019 and \u2018climate neutrality\u2019 are often used interchangeably for net-zero CO2 and net-zero GHG emissions, respectively. However, as their meaning can differ depending on context and language, further specification is needed to avoid ambiguity (see glossary for various definitions of net-zero terms). 3.2.1 Net-zero CO2 emissions stabilize global warming, whereas net-zero GHG emissions result in a peak and decline in global warming As a concept, net-zero emissions were introduced well over a decade ago as a way of thinking about minimizing society\u2019s impact on the climate and the environment (United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] 2008; Worth 2005). The concept gained traction after several scientific studies in the 2000s established a near-linear relationship between global warming and the total amount of net anthropogenic CO2 emissions ever emitted. Reaching net-zero CO 2 emissions results in CO 2 concentrations gradually declining over time towards a long-term equilibrium as part of the excess CO2 in the atmosphere is redistributed by the uptake in the biosphere on land and in the ocean. As a result, CO2-induced temperature stabilizes (Allen et al. 2009; Collins et al. 2013; Joos et al.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6d593d9b-670a-4824-85e4-d4d087959f22": {"__data__": {"id_": "6d593d9b-670a-4824-85e4-d4d087959f22", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1b8fec569b8bba322b1e94ea80f24c0fc15b8c997dae3da82b96b41414f72f35"}, "2": {"node_id": "2f78a685-5bad-497a-9c37-1f68f637113b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "13179bfcdc928e9e4c7f549b463730b916f3a9a631748c7753ef279af30eb356"}}, "hash": "810ecb244b961bd3ef193959f157165731c022ce832925dff7d0fd9e2403c343", "text": "2009; Collins et al. 2013; Joos et al. 2013; Knutti and Rogelj 2015; Lee et al. 2021; MacDougall et al. 2020; Matthews et al. 2009; Matthews and Caldeira 2008; Meinshausen et al. 2009; Solomon et al. 2010; Zickfeld et al. 2009). 19 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On These insights were consolidated in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) where they were used to establish the geophysical requirements for halting global warming and to estimate carbon budgets consistent", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "93c10966-377c-41da-b01d-2db785162e6f": {"__data__": {"id_": "93c10966-377c-41da-b01d-2db785162e6f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8398b3ceefd86844dc3a8ce947fcf6c5bf1ea9d005e9089cac5ac5e0b8ef7350"}, "3": {"node_id": "c69f607c-7f7c-461d-998c-a40a3b550523", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fdb7a60894b3723601380f428daa0d72ebc61d24589c6281c8195675d050628c"}}, "hash": "a84870fc4bf9cb4815af09697a8219a51812b59050f20d2e6f45870b496f86e5", "text": "with preventing warming from exceeding specified levels (Collins et al. 2013; IPCC 2014, 2013; Stocker et al. 2013) (see box 3.1). The most recent IPCC assessment report (the Sixth Assessment Report, AR6) confirms that warming is expected to stabilize once global CO2 emissions reach net-zero levels (IPCC 2021a; Lee et al. 2021). For non-CO2 emissions, the global temperature impact of achieving net-zero emissions depends on how long the GHG persists in the atmosphere (Pierrehumbert 2014; Solomon et al. 2010). Methane, currently the second-largest contributor to warming, has a much shorter lifetime than CO2. Therefore, if methane emissions reduce to zero, concentrations fall faster, and their contribution to global temperature will decline. Achieving net-zero GHG emissions expressed with the default GWP-100 metric through a combination of low 1 Parties to the Paris Agreement are mandated to report aggregated greenhouse gas emissions by using the GWP-100 metric, while additional information that uses other aggregations can also be provided. Note that in addition, emissions of the various GHGs also have to be reported individually. residual non-CO2 emissions and CO2 removal results in a peak then a decline in global warming (figure 3.1) (Forster et al. 2021; Fuglestvedt et al. 2018; IPCC 2021b; Rogelj et al. 2021). The magnitude of this decline depends on the minimum level to which non-CO2 GHGs can be reduced, but could potentially be around 0.02\u20130.05\u00b0C/decade (Fuglestvedt et al. 2018). At present, none of the available mitigation scenarios fully eliminate all CO2 or other GHG emissions (Clarke et al. 2014; Gernaat et al. 2015; Rogelj et al. 2018; Smith et al. 2014). To reach net-zero emissions, residual emissions are thus balanced by removals from the atmosphere: hence the inclusion of \u2018net\u2019 in net-zero targets. The most scalable forms of GHG removal are CO2 removal measures (Fuss et al. 2018; Nemet et al. 2018). This means that net-zero CO2 emissions are achieved before net-zero GHG emissions. Reaching net-zero GHG emissions targets therefore involves at least two, and in most cases three, interlinked strategies: deep reductions in CO2 emissions, the upscaling of CO2 removal, and deep reductions in other GHG emissions (figure 3.1). Box 3.1. Carbon budgets Global warming is close to linearly proportional to the total net amount of CO2 that has ever been emitted into the atmosphere as a result of human activities. Therefore, limiting global warming to a specified level requires that the total amount of CO2 emissions ever emitted be kept within a finite carbon budget. Recently, AR6 published new estimates of the remaining carbon budget for limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C relative to pre-industrial levels (Canadell et al. 2021; IPCC 2021b). According to these, human activities resulted in about 2,390 GtCO2 between 1850 and 2019, contributing around three quarters of the 1.07\u00b0C of human-induced warming from 1850-1900 to 2010-2019. To limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C with a 66 per cent or 50 per cent chance, the remaining carbon budget is estimated at 400 and 500 GtCO2, respectively. For 2\u00b0C, these estimates are 1,150 and 1,350 GtCO2, respectively. Current annual global CO2 emissions are above 40 GtCO2/year, meaning that urgent and deep emissions reductions over the next decade are required to stay within the remaining budgets. AR6 clarifies that methodological improvements cause the estimates in the latest report to be markedly larger than in AR5 (Stocker et al. 2013), but very similar to those reported in the IPCC Special Report on global warming of 1.5\u00b0C (Rogelj et al. 2018) (see box 5.2 in Canadell et al. (2021) for more information). Carbon budgets are not the only determinant of global warming. The warming that accompanies non-CO2 emissions also plays a role. AR6 carbon budgets assume that non-CO2 emissions are reduced following the median reductions from deep mitigation scenarios (Canadell et al. 2021; Rogelj et al. 2018).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c69f607c-7f7c-461d-998c-a40a3b550523": {"__data__": {"id_": "c69f607c-7f7c-461d-998c-a40a3b550523", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8398b3ceefd86844dc3a8ce947fcf6c5bf1ea9d005e9089cac5ac5e0b8ef7350"}, "2": {"node_id": "93c10966-377c-41da-b01d-2db785162e6f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a84870fc4bf9cb4815af09697a8219a51812b59050f20d2e6f45870b496f86e5"}}, "hash": "fdb7a60894b3723601380f428daa0d72ebc61d24589c6281c8195675d050628c", "text": "2021; Rogelj et al. 2018).

Chapter 6 assesses the role of methane in meeting these emissions reductions and bridging the emissions gap. Total GHG emissions are aggregated in units of CO2 equivalence. Although several different metrics for defining this equivalence exist (Myhre et al. 2013), under the Paris Agreement GHG emissions must be aggregated using the global warming potential over a 100-year time- horizon (GWP-100) metric1 (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change [UNFCCC] 2018). 20 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On Figure 3.1.

The Paris Agreement marked the incorporation of the net-zero concept into international policy, aiming to \u201cachieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century, on the basis of equity, and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty\u201d (UNFCCC 2015). Subsequently, the IPCC Special Report on global warming of 1.5\u00b0C highlighted that to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels with no or limited overshoot, global CO2 emissions should reach net zero around mid- century (IPCC 2018).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "96f88c10-d669-44b2-a522-ef993d4566c1": {"__data__": {"id_": "96f88c10-d669-44b2-a522-ef993d4566c1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3011d9f0b4b3672e3536aa64f33f49818bce022339e7fae178daba20ea607150"}, "2": {"node_id": "aa71d0eb-283d-437d-8a71-5fb1a1d7fece", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5ea57525e2123381ac48919ebca2f1e23efb1de5021a9e77542ee43440dce89d"}}, "hash": "6cba1d42e46f3d11dd0f581f86dc2ce83e1f9ddc63fb3e0e9800dd9c441227bf", "text": "The latter spurred a wave of net-zero target declarations.

In the pathway categories as used in chapter 4 of this report, pathways with emissions reductions before 2020 are excluded. The temperature outcomes of these pathways have also been reassessed based on the physical climate assessment of the IPCC AR6 \u2013 see cross-chapter box 7.1 in Forster et al. (2021). 3.2.3 The pathway to net-zero counts Carbon budgets come with climate implications for net- zero targets: the path followed from today until net-zero CO2 emissions are reached determines the total amount of emitted CO2 and thereby the total carbon budget. Whether we follow a linear, an accelerated, or a delayed path impacts the climate outcome (figure 3.2). Following a delayed path compared to an accelerated path to net-zero GHG emissions by 2065 could lead to about 0.1\u00b0C more warming. At worst, a delay could result in a complete failure to achieve the net-zero target, resulting in higher warming. Near-term emissions reductions that sketch a linear or accelerated path towards a longer-term net-zero target therefore provide higher confidence that the net-zero target can ultimately be achieved. 22 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On Figure 3.2.

Cumulative emissions are further reduced compared to a linear path. Linear: the NDC sets emissions approximately on a linear path towards achieving the net-zero target. Delayed: the NDC reduces emissions more slowly than implied by a linear path towards the net-zero target. Cumulative emissions and resulting global warming are higher compared to a linear path. Global net-zero emissions targets in isolation set only a weak limit on the maximum level of global warming (Rogelj et al. 2015), as the maximum level of warming is largely defined by the cumulative amount of CO2 emissions emitted until net zero (IPCC 2018). 3.3 Net-zero at the national level Setting net-zero emissions targets at the national level involves several steps in addition to the aforementioned global considerations. These steps represent both technical choices and normative decisions related to equity and fairness. Although this chapter focuses on countries, there are similar steps to translate global net-zero targets to sectors, companies, investment portfolios and other entities (see box 3.2). First, at a technical level, the scope of emissions covered by a net-zero target needs defining (Levin et al. 2020; Rogelj et al. 2021). This includes defining the GHGs and activity sectors that are covered. For countries, the UNFCCC's requirement that parties report emissions and removals of a basket of GHGs on a territorial basis informs the scope of national targets. Countries could however exclude some gases or activities, include others such as international aviation and shipping, or take a different approach such as consumption-based accounting (Davis and Caldeira 2010; Munksgaard and Pedersen 2001; Wyckoff and Roop 1994).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b55044f0-81e6-47c5-a2b0-803fbb415580": {"__data__": {"id_": "b55044f0-81e6-47c5-a2b0-803fbb415580", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "75864f2f667a60b31b68f9d7124f7dcceb8517c08312b7a89346b18a783a0c80"}, "2": {"node_id": "cbc0afd9-2308-4a91-a80c-e25c49259ca9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "082274abb1ed47fe6795df91c278b1fc2e12627c0f5162b2b9b4bf64cb67abcd"}}, "hash": "7d1675fba7730e19c5cddaaa658f8d0b4596ebd4a0fbc53b06cac57e6b1e79c6", "text": "A further choice in scope is the inclusion and use of carbon offsets, which are credits generated by projects carrying out emissions reduction or removal outside a country\u2019s (or other entity's) boundary.

This will require clearly defined rules and robust accounting mechanisms to track progress, deliver real emissions reductions and drive ambition. Chapter 7 further discusses challenges and opportunities in using markets in achieving Paris Agreement targets in both the near-term and net-zero context. Second, normative choices are required when translating global net-zero targets to the country level, involving questions of equity and fairness. A deadline for global net- zero emissions does not require all countries to achieve net zero at the same time (Robiou du Pont et al. 2016; Rogelj et al. 2021). Factors such as responsibility, capacity and level of development imply that some nations should achieve (and go beyond) net-zero emissions more quickly than others (Dubash et al. 2021; Rogelj et al. 2021). Furthermore, the costs of and potential for achieving emissions reductions and removals are geographically unevenly distributed. Reaching global net-zero emissions is therefore likely to involve a combination of positive and negative emissions contributions across countries and sectors, keeping in mind that the global potential for negative CO2 emissions is limited because of technical, social and sustainability reasons (IPCC 2019, 2018). This variation between countries is illustrated by the different times at which regions (Rogelj 2018) or major emitting countries (van Soest et al. 2021) reach net-zero CO2 or GHG emissions as part of a global least-cost transition, irrespective of additional equity or fairness considerations. 2 See https://unfccc.int/process/the-paris-agreement/long-term-strategies. Aside from questions of equity and scope, debates have emerged over whether net-zero targets promote or hinder actions consistent with the Paris Agreement. Net-zero is seen as more actor-centred and effective than a temperature limit (Geden 2016). It also represents greater ambition than the current long-term pledges of most countries.2 Nevertheless, the concept of net-zero has faced criticism on the grounds that it may slow mitigation, either through over-reliance on carbon removal (McLaren et al. 2019) or on carbon credits (Stabinsky, Bhatnagar and Shaw 2021), or because an emphasis on long-term targets can distract from a lack of near-term actions. Other critics highlight that a narrow focus on net-zero targets can lose sight of differences in national climate politics, or the credibility of pledges, as well as equity (Dubash et al. 2021; Rogelj et al. 2021). Net-zero targets are not to be viewed in isolation as the sole policy mechanism for effecting change; they should be accompanied by near-term actions as well as detailed and transparent plans for delivery (Rogelj et al. 2021; Smith 2021). The Paris Agreement encourages these through the submission of NDCs and long-term strategies to the UNFCCC. In response to these issues and criticisms, several recent studies have focused on identifying a set of criteria against which the robustness of net-zero pledges can be assessed (Black et al. 2021; Climate Action Tracker 2021; Levin et al. 2020; Rogelj et al. 2021). They share several common features, summarized in table 3.2. 24 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On Table 3.2.

By the broadest definition, as many as 136 countries covering more than half of global GHG emissions either have some form of commitment to such a target or are considering it (Climate Action Tracker 2021; Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit [ECIU] 2021; UNEP 2020; World Resources Institute 2020). This includes countries whose governments are merely discussing net-zero targets, and signatories to the Climate Ambition Alliance which cites working towards net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050 among its aims (Climate Ambition Alliance 2019). 25 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On Here we define a net-zero target as a statement in national legislation, in a policy document (i.e. an NDC or long-term strategy communicated to the UNFCCC, or a similar document published by a national government), or a public announcement by the government or a high- level government official (e.g. Head of State). We include references to net-zero emissions, net-zero carbon, carbon neutral(ity), GHG neutral(ity), climate neutral(ity) and a decarbonized economy or society. Our analysis reflects developments up to 13 September 2021. Using this classification, 52 parties (51 countries plus the European Union) have pledged a net-zero target. These cover around 57 per cent of current global domestic GHG emissions, 60 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and 34 per cent of the global population (Climate Watch 2021; World Resources Institute 2021). Thirteen targets are enshrined in law, covering 12 per cent of global emissions (table 3.3). Table 3.3. Overview of current national net-zero pledges across all United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) parties, by year and by legal status Parties Emissions GDP Population In law 13 12% 10% 3% In policy document 24 15% 24% 7% Government announcement 15 30% 26% 24% Sources: Total coverage of current net-zero pledges by percentage of global domestic emissions in 2018 (World Resources Institute 2021), GDP (World Bank 2019, in purchasing power parity (PPP) constant international $ terms) and population (UN World Population Prospects 2019) By number, the majority of these targets (40) are for 2050, coincident with the mid-century timescale for global CO2 emissions indicated by the IPCC as necessary for limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C. Eight targets are aimed at earlier years (2030\u20132045) and four at later years. In terms of emissions, however, the targets are split almost entirely and equally between 2050 (due to the pledges by the European Union and United States of America) and 2060 (due to China\u2019s pledge). It is important to note that approaches to counting carbon sources and sinks can differ between global studies and national reporting. Some care is therefore needed when assigning net-zero status to countries, or interpreting claims by countries that \u2018carbon neutrality\u2019 has been achieved. In particular, national GHG inventories label all carbon uptake on managed land (including naturally occurring uptake) as anthropogenic, resulting in greater removal numbers than in the scientific modelling studies that form the basis for the global emissions pathways assessed in chapter 4 of this report (Grassi et al. 2021, 2018). However, one available study indicates that differences between the two approaches at the global level lead to a negligible difference in terms of timing of net-zero emissions (Grassi et al. 2021). Further in- depth studies are required to confirm this. Existing net-zero targets show variations in scope, as well as large ambiguities (World Resources Institute 2020). Thirty- six are clear in including all sectors of domestic activity, while the remaining 16 are unclear or undecided. Regarding inclusion of GHGs, 17 targets are unclear or undecided, however those that are clear all include at least some non- CO2 gases as well as CO2.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d0c7b4ac-4c70-449e-9f03-790e7d0081d3": {"__data__": {"id_": "d0c7b4ac-4c70-449e-9f03-790e7d0081d3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ed9d38323bf1f0670027aa322cc1fdff9c88f981a0d143034b8664f914edbdd1"}, "2": {"node_id": "5b29d16e-f3d1-4bef-a320-958b3ea15945", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d38b0e4fcce03b97802fb6a1de8f2a291a9abdbdbc0f42ebfbfa90be2b0e667c"}}, "hash": "575de1ab9a389c75f999931be014520d1e95d55f9cd106431d2cabf2aac8dacc", "text": "The majority (41) are unclear or undecided on inclusion of emissions from international aviation and shipping.

Chapter 4 \u2013 which provides an overview of global warming implications of current policies, NDCs and net-zero targets \u2013 estimates that if fully achieved, net-zero targets could reduce global warming projections by about 0.5\u00b0C relative to projections that only take into account unconditional NDCs. 3.5 A closer look at net-zero targets in the G20 Twelve of the G20 members, covering 54 per cent of global domestic GHG emissions, currently have pledged a net-zero target, of which six are in law, two are in policy documents and four are government announcements. All are for the year 2050, with the exception of China\u2019s 2060 target and Germany\u2019s target for 2045. 26 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On Figure 3.3 provides an assessment of these targets against most of the criteria provided in table 3.3. Where information relevant to the criteria is available from countries, figure 3.3 highlights its existence rather than assessing its sufficiency. For instance, a plan may be published and it may refer to the fairness of its contribution to global efforts, however additional assessment is required to establish whether the plan is detailed enough and the fairness appropriate. Similar to the global assessment of national net-zero targets, a notable feature of current net-zero targets of G20 members is their ambiguity. Regarding scope, most targets are unclear or undecided on inclusion of offsets and of international aviation and shipping emissions. Lack of clarity is also notable on coverage of sectors and gases, but those that are clear show a tendency for comprehensive coverage. Most show a lack of transparency regarding the approach taken to fairness, the plans for achievement (including on use of removals), and on reporting and reviewing progress. Only Canada, the European Union, France, Germany and the Republic of Korea have published their plans so far, and only these countries plus the United Kingdom have accountable processes for reviewing their targets. As an indication of the consistency between nearer-term actions and net-zero targets, figure 3.3 also plots the emissions paths for G20 members implied by their most recent NDCs or announced mitigation pledge for 2030 and their net-zero target. As highlighted in section 3.2 and figure 3.2, near-term targets need to be aligned on a clear path towards achieving net-zero targets and limiting cumulative emissions. Indeed, the Emissions Gap Report 2020 (UNEP 2020) argued that the litmus test of net-zero pledges is the extent to which they are reflected in near-term policy action and in significantly more ambitious NDCs for the period to 2030. Near-term emissions reductions that follow a linear or accelerated path towards a net-zero target provide higher confidence that the net-zero target can be achieved. To summarize, eight G20 members have so far not set net- zero targets, whereas 12 (covering 54 per cent of global domestic GHG emissions) have. Of the nine G20 members for which we can estimate an emissions path based on their net-zero target and their NDC, none have NDC targets that put them on an accelerated path towards their net-zero emissions targets. Five of these nine members (covering 21 per cent of global domestic GHG emissions) have NDC targets that put the country\u2019s domestic emissions onto a linear path towards achieving their net-zero targets. For four G20 members (covering 28 per cent of global domestic GHG emissions), the NDCs lead to emissions in 2030 that are about 25 per cent to 95 per cent higher than a linear path towards their net-zero targets would imply. These countries urgently need strengthened and more ambitious near-term climate plans for their net-zero targets to remain achievable. There is an urgent need for (i) more G20 members \u2013 and indeed all countries \u2013 to pledge net-zero emissions, (ii) all countries to increase the robustness of their net-zero pledges, and (iii) all net-zero targets to be backed up by near- term actions that give confidence that the net-zero targets can ultimately be achieved. 27 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On Figure 3.3.

Non-state action on net zero Businesses, cities, regions, investors, civil society groups, and other non-state and subnational actors (NSAs) play an increasingly important role in raising ambition and accelerating implementation. The Paris Agreement institutionalized the engagement of NSAs in achieving long-term climate goals and created an ongoing process to catalyse climate commitments made by NSAs, including net-zero targets (Chan, Ellinger and Widerberg 2018; Hale 2016; Hsu et al. 2018). Efforts by NSAs towards global net-zero emissions are strengthening and broadening, which helps mobilize stakeholders to achieve net zero (Data-Driven EnviroLab and NewClimate Institute 2020; Hsu et al. 2020). The United Nations Race To Zero campaign rallies NSAs globally to take rigorous actions to reduce emissions by 50 per cent by 2030 and achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 at the latest, vetting members via an independent expert group. More than 3,000 businesses, 730 cities, 170 investors, 30 regions and 600 universities have joined Race To Zero, together covering around 25 per cent of global CO2 emissions and 50 per cent of GDP (Black et al. 2021; NewClimate Institute and Data-Driven EnviroLab 2020; Smit and Kuramochi 2020; UNFCCC 2021). Actions taken by NSAs can also contribute to achieving net-zero targets set by governments, while at the same time creating more favourable conditions for governments to increase their ambition going forward. A recent study of major non-state actor initiatives found they had the potential to reduce 2030 emissions by 5\u201315 GtCO2e (Black et al. 2021; Hale et al. 2021; Hsu et al. 2019; NewClimate Institute and Data-Driven EnviroLab 2020; NewClimate Institute et al. 2021). At the national level, NSAs are supporting implementation and enhancement of climate goals. For instance, America Is All In, a coalition of over 1,800 institutions representing 65 per cent of the United States of America\u2019s population and 70 per cent of its GDP, is an initiative to enhance non- state actions to cut the United States of America\u2019s GHG emissions by 50 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 and put the country on a trajectory consistent with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C (Hultman et al. 2021). Meanwhile, the European Commission launched the European Climate Pact to mobilize NSAs and communities to participate in climate actions. The Japan Climate Initiative, made up of businesses and municipalities, has played a key role in supporting the government\u2019s new NDC. However, the increase in NSA net-zero pledges needs to be treated with caution, because as they have proliferated, they have varied in robustness. The scope and coverage of net-zero targets; the existence of implementation plans, transparency and reporting to track progress; the alignment between near-term actions and long-term net- zero targets; and the robustness of carbon offsets are critical to credible net-zero targets (Black et al. 2021; Hale et al. 2021; Hsu et al. 2019; NewClimate Institute and Data- Driven EnviroLab 2020; NewClimate Institute et al. 2021). NSAs have started to take actions to address these issues. For example, the Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets, a private-sector-led initiative, aims to develop a threshold standard to ensure high integrity offset credits and create robust and transparent markets.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5402ad70-7fc0-459f-a9a0-3ea2bffe9775": {"__data__": {"id_": "5402ad70-7fc0-459f-a9a0-3ea2bffe9775", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fc5f41b21bf62bc0efc990feffc1f8e37b508711e05733795b935090f204f328"}, "2": {"node_id": "a51c88b4-90ef-476c-af1a-d4d7389d1191", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4fd69a0eb63ceb4b148af136162891d19e569720b98dbdd338ee14dd10b9c46f"}}, "hash": "89fd30920dc7683552e94bb0380380bc57e9c5b4bf819674b9110c035b666f34", "text": "29 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On The emissions gap Lead authors: Michel den Elzen (PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, the Netherlands), Joana Portugal-Pereira (Graduate School of Engineering (COPPE), Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), Joeri Rogelj (Grantham Institute, Imperial College London, UK; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis [IIASA], Austria) Contributing authors: Ioannis Dafnomilis (PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, the Netherlands), Johannes G\u00fctschow (Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Germany), Kimon Keramidas (Joint Research Centre [JRC], Spain), Robin Lamboll (Imperial College London, UK), Jared Lewis (University of Melbourne, Australia), Malte Meinshausen (University of Melbourne, Australia), Zebedee Nicholls (University of Melbourne, Australia) 4 4.1 Introduction", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "212fc491-5fef-45cf-aac8-6b6fa57f2481": {"__data__": {"id_": "212fc491-5fef-45cf-aac8-6b6fa57f2481", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f51bfe55dce0e37d31ad99f87548657c8a8ed16f25aa5ec3819c0edd429591ea"}, "3": {"node_id": "6a41aba7-d8d3-480d-b549-d9f169c7a9f7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5741040f6c698ce27ebe4cdbfd0301a69b30b4db375c69b4900f3e1eddc552f6"}}, "hash": "f8ba84b7013449b1084cdaeaca40983e1f4398d63d2d850701fda7c87763cd4d", "text": "The emissions gap is estimated as the difference between projected global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions assuming full implementation of the mitigation pledges that countries have made for 2030, and emissions under least-cost pathways consistent with the Paris Agreement\u2019s long-term goal of limiting global average temperature increase to \u201cwell-below 2\u00b0C\u201d and pursing efforts to limit it to 1.5\u00b0C, compared with pre-industrial levels. This year, the update of the emissions gap is particularly interesting as it is the first time countries have submitted new or updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) as part of the Paris Agreement\u2019s five-year ambition-raising cycle. Thus, the update of the emissions gap provides an indication of the extent to which the NDC process under the Paris Agreement is working and the progress made. To estimate the emissions gap, updated scenarios that underlie its quantification are assessed (section 4.2). This year, the mitigation pledge scenarios include the latest available NDCs as well as announced mitigation pledges for 2030 with a cut-off date of 30 August 2021. Further, scenarios consider the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic and possible economic recovery paths. The emissions gap assessment for 2030 is presented in section 4.3, while the implications of failing to bridge the emissions gap for global temperature rise are discussed in section 4.4. In this context, the key questions assessed in this chapter are: What is our current best estimate of the emissions gap for 2030 taking into account the new or updated NDCs, announced pledges and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated recovery measures? What are the global warming implications over the course of the century? 4.2 Scenarios considered for the 2030 gap assessment This section updates the eight scenarios considered for the 2030 emissions gap assessment. These scenarios comprise reference scenarios (4.2.1), NDC scenarios (4.2.2), and least- cost mitigation scenarios starting in 2020 consistent with specific temperature targets (4.2.3). Table 4.1 lists and describes all scenarios included in the assessment 30 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On Table 4.1. Summary of assessed scenarios Scenario Cut-off year Description Reference Year 2010 policies 2010 This scenario includes only climate polices implemented up to 2010 (no additional measures from 2010 onward). Current policies 2020/21 Current policies updated to reflect climate mitigation policies adopted and implemented as of 2020/21. Scenario also adjusted to reflect short- and midterm socioeconomic impacts from COVID-19.1 NDCs and announced mitigation pledges Unconditional NDCs and announced mitigation pledges 2021 This scenario reflects new or updated NDCs as well as officially announced mitigation pledges for 2030 that have been indicated to be implemented without any explicit external support. (Cut-off date: 30 August 2021) Conditional NDC and announced mitigation pledges 2021 In addition to the unconditional pledges, this scenario considers new or updated NDCs as well as officially announced mitigation pledges for 2030 to be implemented conditional upon receiving international support (finance, technology transfer and/or capacity-building). (Cut-off date: 30 August 2021) Mitigation scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement Below 2\u00b0C Starting from 2020 Long-term least-cost pathway consistent with holding global warming below 2\u00b0C throughout the twenty-first century with at least 66 per cent chance. Below 1.8\u00b0C Starting from 2020 Long-term least-cost pathway consistent with holding global warming below 1.8\u00b0C throughout the twenty-first century with at least 66 per cent chance. Below 1.5\u00b0C Starting from 2020 Long-term least-cost pathway consistent with holding global warming below 1.5\u00b0C throughout the twenty-first century with limited or no overshooting. Global warming in 2100 is projected to be below 1.5\u00b0C with at least 66 per cent chance, while throughout the twenty- first century it is kept below 1.5\u00b0C with at least 33 per cent chance. 1 The updated current policy scenario adjusts original modelling studies to account for different policy cut-off dates, which range from 2017 to 2020, and varying consideration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on socioeconomic drivers. 31 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On 4.2.1 Reference scenarios and updates Two reference scenarios are considered: the \u2018year 2010 policies\u2019 scenario and the \u2018updated current policies\u2019 scenario.

It also considers the impact of COVID-19. The data for this scenario are based on updates by four modelling studies3 that include the impacts of COVID-19 and have a cut-off date of November 2020 and four international modelling groups.4 The international modelling groups have 31 December 2016 as their cut-off date for current policies (Roelfsema et al. 2020) and do not include COVID-19 effects. They are included to ensure consistency of the data set and methodology across the Emissions Gap Reports. Their results were adjusted to reflect updates of policies until November 2020 by comparing them to the results of the four modelling studies that provide estimates for both cut- off dates (den Elzen, H\u00f6hne and Jiang 2017). Following this approach, the median estimate of the impact of recent policies is a reduction in global GHG emissions of 1.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) (range: 3.0\u20130.4). To capture the impact of COVID-19, the four international modelling groups' estimates were adjusted based on three of the four modelling studies (Climate Action Tracker, International Energy Agency [IEA] and PBL) that provide global GHG emissions projections based on consistent current policies scenarios, including as well as excluding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following this approach, the impact of COVID-19 is an estimated reduction in global GHG emissions of about 2.5 GtCO2e (range: 3.2\u20131.4) by 2030. Considering both of these impacts, the median estimate of global GHG emissions in 2 From the CD-LINKS Scenario Database, version 1.0. 3 Climate Action Tracker (2021); Joint Research Centre's POLES model (Joint Research Centre, forthcoming); PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency's IMAGE model (Dafnomilis et al. 2021; den Elzen et al. in review; Nascimento et al. 2021) (see also: www.pbl.nl/ndc); and the stated policies scenario of the International Energy Agency [IEA]\u2019s World Energy Outlook 2020 (IEA 2020). The more-optimistic stated policies scenario of the IEA World Energy Outlook 2020 that was used as a current policies scenario is not yet included. Furthermore, the energy-related CO2 emissions of IEA were supplemented with the median estimates of the non-CO2 GHG emissions and CO2 land-use-related emissions of the current policies scenarios from the COMMIT database. 4 International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) with the MESSAGE\u2013GLOBIOM model (Fricko et al. 2017); National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES) with the AIM model (Fujimori et al. 2017); Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) with the REMIND\u2013MAgPIE model (Luderer et al. 2015) and COPPE, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (COPPE/UFRJ) with the COFFEE model (Rochedo et al. 2018). 2030 for the updated current policies scenario becomes 55 GtCO2e (range of 52\u201358 GtCO2e; see table 4.2) in 2030, which is 4 GtCO2e lower than the median estimate of the 2020 UNEP Emissions Gap Report. It remains critically important to understand the potential structural changes of the COVID-19 pandemic and the post-COVID rescue and recovery packages on emission levels out to 2030 (see chapter 5). This is particularly important given the use of 2030 as a target year in many countries\u2019 NDC submissions and as a benchmark to gauge global climate action. Research is ongoing in this area, but not yet published in the peer-reviewed literature. While understanding of energy-related GHG emissions trends during the COVID-19 pandemic is improving (Forster et al. 2020; Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al. 2021, 2020; Liu et al. 2020), there is more uncertainty around trends in agriculture, forestry and other land-use (AFOLU)-based GHG emissions. However, these emissions seem to continue to increase. In 2020, agricultural activities had limited losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic and some commodities even increased their production (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [FAO] 2021a, 2021b; World Bank 2021).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "211aec8e-a07f-4632-948a-e596784c7ca3": {"__data__": {"id_": "211aec8e-a07f-4632-948a-e596784c7ca3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9a1fa8860355ffd48c75438eed5ac16243e1f07e96336440bd15d50caa7380d3"}, "2": {"node_id": "6803d1e3-5241-47e1-a94d-d1c72fb08bb4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fdce0695952ec0f416be6769aac3be89f7fe1a8a592e4f6e9aef6c0a4ffb89e6"}}, "hash": "e96bda92dac5c3aa2e0808893f44fb4340e01617866a6f1a7a464238eedffcea", "text": "Further global deforestation rates increased significantly, resulting in a loss of tree cover by 25.2 Mha, 12 per cent more than in 2019 (Hansen et al. 2013; World Resources Institute [WRI] 2021).

The rising trend of prices for most food and metal commodities (FAO 2021a, 2021b; World Bank 2021), along with governmental stimulus into agribusiness activities, extractive industries, and development of road infrastructure in protected land regions drove deforestation and forest degradation, mainly in the tropics (Brancalion et al. 2020; Ferrante and Fearnside 2020).

Another issue related to land-use emissions is that about half of the global scenarios analyses and national GHG inventories use different definitions for anthropogenic removals in the land-use sector, resulting in different amounts of net land-use carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions being reported, with a historic difference of up to 4 GtCO 2e/year between national GHG inventories and global emission pathway studies (Grassi et al. 2018). The solutions that have been published to account and correct for this discrepancy are integrated in these studies by applying a constant adjustment term over the 2010\u2013 2030 period.5 4.2.2 NDC and announced pledge scenarios and updates The NDC and announced pledge scenarios include all the most recent NDCs (new or updated NDCs and previous NDCs for countries where no updates are available) as well as announced climate change mitigation pledges for 2030 that could be linked to updated NDCs and that focus on indicators or targets also included in their NDCs. The estimated impact of revised reduction targets in the new or updated unconditional NDC submissions and announcements lowers the emissions projection of the unconditional NDC scenario by about 4 GtCO2e (about 15 per cent) compared with the previous NDCs. For the conditional NDC scenario including announced pledges, a similar impact is found. This results in a median estimate of global GHG emissions of 52 GtCO2e and 50 GtCO2e, if the unconditional and conditional NDCs are fully implemented. This is about 4 GtCO2e lower than last year\u2019s projections (based on previous NDCs, see figure 4.1). The NDC and announced pledge scenario estimate is based on four model studies (Climate Action Tracker, PBL, JRC and Climate Resource) (Meinshausen et al. 2021),6 all of which include the NDC updates (as at end of August 2021), while only the first three studies consider the impact of the announcements.7,8 In addition, it is based on projections of four model groups (IIASA, the National Institute for Environmental Studies [NIES], the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research [PIK] and Resources for the Future and Euro Mediterranean Center on Climate Change [RFF\u2013CMCC]) that have been adjusted to reflect the impact of the new or updated NDCs and announced pledges. 5 This approach is consistent with the detailed adjustments calculated by Grassi et al. (2021), which are virtually constant until 2030 for emissions scenarios in line with updated current policies or NDCs scenarios. Previous reports already applied a similar adjustment method, when comparing model studies (such as the integrated assessment model studies) or in the emissions gap calculations. Although the literature now provides a more elaborate evidence base in support of this adjustment, this approach does not result in shifts in estimates of the global emissions gap. 6 Climate Action Tracker: https://climateactiontracker.org/global/cat-emissions-gaps/; PBL: www.pbl.nl/ndc; JRC: https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/geco. 7 The Climate Action Tracker accounts for the impact of the announcement of Japan and China, JRC for China and Japan, and PBL includes the impact of China, Japan and the Republic of Korea, and also includes the impact of the latest NDC of South Africa. 8 As these studies do not fully account for all announced pledges, the estimate is slightly lower than the estimate in chapter 2, but it has been rounded to avoid apparent inconsistencies. 4.2.3 Mitigation scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement and updates Emission projections of the latest NDCs and announced pledges scenarios, and updated current policies scenarios are compared to least-cost mitigation scenarios that meet specific temperature targets relative to pre-industrial levels. Here, we categorize emissions pathways from the literature based on their projected peak warming outcomes over the course of this century (Huppmann et al. 2018b, 2018a; Rogelj et al. 2018.

This year, the scenarios have been updated by re-assessing their temperature outcomes based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Report 6 Working Group I assessment. The temperature outcome of the scenarios is assessed with the reduced-complexity carbon-cycle and climate model MAGICC (Meinshausen et al. 2011) in a set up that captures the uncertainties in radiative forcing as well as climate and carbon-cycle response (Nicholls et al. 2021) as assessed in cross-chapter box 7.1 of the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b7810ee2-165a-4eaa-ba89-5e0c50d1f6cc": {"__data__": {"id_": "b7810ee2-165a-4eaa-ba89-5e0c50d1f6cc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b4d255ce301a9cae297bb3f4fb7a7c363deda33873da1b8e522c950d4deefc6a"}, "3": {"node_id": "4bd17ae9-c569-4b70-a04a-a1e2f3b59d85", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7df17f966417b842d58094fb6fa5752234d566dbdf9dc72b9938eeacb2486282"}}, "hash": "7cb6c9fc16d20988597dcd95ed3976a7faa410a0fa93ddde9955232df07c1b36", "text": "(Forster et al. 2021). As a result of the updates, global emissions in 2030 consistent with keeping global warming below 2.0\u00b0C with a 66 per cent chance are estimated at 39 GtCO2e, which is about 2 GtCO2e lower than in earlier reports. Similarly, the estimate for 1.8\u00b0C is about 2 GtCO2e lower than the 1.8\u00b0C estimate of previous reports. There are no changes to the 1.5\u00b0C estimate (table 4.2). As pathways often assume net- negative CO2 emissions in the second half of the century, the estimated global warming in the year 2100 is typically lower than the maximum warming over the course of the twenty-first century. 4.3 The emissions gap The emissions gap for 2030 is defined as the difference between global total GHG emissions from least-cost scenarios that keep global warming to 2\u00b0C, 1.8\u00b0C or 1.5\u00b0C with varying levels of likelihood and the estimated global GHG emissions resulting from a full implementation of NDCs and announced reduction pledges. This section updates the gap based on the scenarios described in section 4.2. 33 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On Table 4.2 provides a full overview of 2030 emission levels for the eight scenarios considered, as well as the resulting emissions gap between the scenario and the 2\u00b0C, 1.8\u00b0C or 1.5\u00b0C pathways.
