Y = 1 U or N = 0 69 Appendix 3: Range Appendix 3: Range To obtain data on focal species\u2019 distribution ranges, the UK\u2019s Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, collated broad-scale distribution data for c. 70% of species listed in Appendix 1. This was carried out using data sourced from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (https://www. gbif.org/) and Kew\u2019s own specimen collections. For the most widespread species, these formed the basis of the maps below. For the more narrowly distributed species, a synthesis of roughly \u2018province level\u2019 data was compiled from regional flora treatments (e.g. The Tree Flora of Sabah and Sarawak (Soepadmo et al. 2004)). The extent of a species\u2019 range can also be used as a metric of sensitivity (species with small ranges are more likely to be vulnerable to a specific set of climate change effects e.g. warming temperatures plus increasing rain, while species with large ranges may experience mixed climate changes), but was kept separate as it is not a biological trait. Figure A3.1 An example of a species scored 1 for range: the species has a small range and the population is vulnerable to climate change. Geographic area considered = white filled land surface, while red = presence of Macaranga pearsonii at the province level in Borneo.

We expect these updates will be mostly clarifications and additions of detail rather than substantial changes, with the exception of a few sections clearly identified in the text below. We value input from users \u2013 suggestions on how to improve the KBA Guidelines may be submitted to chair.sac@keybiodiversityareas.org at any time.

Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 2 How to use the KBA Guidelines The KBA Guidelines should be used in close conjunction with the KBA Standard, which is available in English, French and Spanish. The introduction to the KBA Guidelines provides background information essential for applying the KBA criteria, thresholds and delineation procedures. We recommend that users read the introductory chapter in full before initiating any KBA identification process. Five chapters provide guidelines on applying species-based criteria (and their associated assessment parameters), ecosystem-based criteria and criteria based on ecological integrity and quantitative analysis of irreplaceability (in preparation). These chapters start with an overview section including a flowchart that summarises the steps. Detailed guidance for each step is provided in a frequently-asked-questions format. Further chapters cover delineation procedures, stakeholder consultation and involvement, data availability, quality and uncertainty and reassessment. Note that this version of the KBA Guidelines does not include guidance on the following: (a) the use of distinct genetic diversity as an assessment parameter (Criteria A1, B1, B2); (b) the use of globally most important 5% of occupied habitat (Criterion B3c); (c) the use of irreplaceability through quantitative analysis (Criterion E). Guidance on these is in development and will appear in later versions of the KBA Guidelines. Definitions of terms used in the KBA Standard are provided in Appendix I. A one- page summary of the KBA criteria and thresholds is provided in Appendix II. Detailed supplementary guidance on documentation and the process of submitting a KBA proposal to the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas (WDKBA) is provided in the Guidance on the process of Proposing, Reviewing, Nominating and Confirming Key Biodiversity Areas and the Documentation and Mapping Standards. The KBA Guidelines are designed for use in electronic or printed form. Terms defined in Appendix I are highlighted in blue; related documents or web resources available online are highlighted in purple (see Appendix V for links). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 3 1. Introduction 1.1 Key Biodiversity Areas Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) are sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity. The criteria used to identify KBAs incorporate elements of biodiversity across genetic, species and ecosystem levels, and are applicable to terrestrial, freshwater, marine and subterranean systems. KBAs have delineated boundaries and are actually or potentially manageable as a unit. However, the process of KBA identification and delineation does not include steps to advance management activity and does not imply that any specific conservation action, such as protected area designation, is required. 1.2 A Global Standard for the Identification of Key Biodiversity Areas The KBA Standard (IUCN, 2016) defines a set of criteria and associated quantitative thresholds for identifying KBAs in an objective, repeatable and transparent way. The general approach for identifying KBAs was informed by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (IUCN, 2012a, hereafter the IUCN Red List) and by the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (IUCN, 2017, hereafter the IUCN RLE), which use quantitative criteria and thresholds to identify threatened species and ecosystem types respectively.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0a644c05-7a84-469e-8e56-d45211b157fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "0a644c05-7a84-469e-8e56-d45211b157fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c6ed5869de99e6701fa73fe41a510f0eb724139442f8cf36cb11717758640bcf"}, "2": {"node_id": "ec18aa3c-bd50-4104-9859-13f42ca6d737", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a4ff437f0c045c1f42e1627fd8ca1c58756082bb2dde9ad5c24efa8b9a819337"}}, "hash": "130a1344f87e8ea330e0f2b03b2d74b56c86ce271d960e338e2cf52c1d68df0f", "text": "Development of the KBA criteria, thresholds and delineation procedures was informed by decades of experience identifying important sites for biodiversity, including Alliance for Zero Extinction (AZE) sites (Ricketts et al., 2005), Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs, Donald et al., 2018), Important Fungus Areas (Evans et al., 2001), Important Plant Areas (IPAs, Plantlife International, 2004; Darbyshire et al., 2017), previous iterations of Key Biodiversity Areas (Eken et al., 2004; Langhammer et al., 2007), Prime Butterfly Areas (van Swaay & Warren, 2006), Ramsar sites (Ramsar, 2008), Special Protection Areas (Stroud et al., 1990) and Ecologically and Biologically Significant Areas (EBSAs, Dunn et al., 2014).

The KBA criteria include both Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 4 species-based criteria similar to those used in the above-mentioned schemes (e.g., AZE sites, IBAs), and ecosystem-based criteria designed to identify sites that are important for biodiversity at the ecosystem level. Genetic diversity is addressed through its inclusion in assessment parameters used to identify sites under several of the species- based criteria. The eleven criteria are grouped into five high-level criteria (A-E). A site must contribute significantly to the global persistence of at least one of the following to qualify as a KBA: A. Threatened biodiversity (Criteria A1-2) B. Geographically restricted biodiversity (Criteria B1-4) C. Ecological integrity (Criterion C) D. Biological processes (Criteria D1-3) or, it must have: E. Very high irreplaceability, as determined through quantitative analysis (Criterion E). The threatened biodiversity criterion (A) identifies sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of threatened species (A1) or threatened ecosystem types (A2). The geographically restricted biodiversity criterion (B) identifies sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of individual geographically restricted species (B1), co-occurring geographically restricted species (B2), geographically restricted assemblages (B3), or geographically restricted ecosystem types (B4). The ecological integrity criterion (C) identifies sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of wholly intact ecological communities with supporting large-scale ecological processes. The biological processes criterion (D) identifies sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of demographic aggregations (D1), ecological refugia (D2), or recruitment sources (D3). The irreplaceability through quantitative analysis criterion (E) identifies sites that have very high irreplaceability for the global persistence of biodiversity as determined through a complementarity-based quantitative analysis of irreplaceability. Many of the criteria include subcriteria (e.g., a, b, \u2026) that describe explicitly how the site contributes to the global persistence of biodiversity (Appendix II). A site that Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 5 qualifies as a KBA under Criterion A1 (threatened species) subcriterion b, for example, supports \u2265 1% of the global population size and \u2265 10 reproductive units of a species listed as Vulnerable (VU) on the IUCN Red List (Fig. 1.3). Recognition that a site meets KBA thresholds may be based on one or more assessment parameters. A site may be recognised as meeting the thresholds for subcriterion A1b, for example, based on the assessment parameters (ii) area of occupancy and (iii) extent of suitable habitat (Fig. 1.3). This site would then be listed as a KBA under Criterion A1b(ii, iii). Figure 1.3 Criteria, subcriteria, thresholds and assessment parameters A site needs to meet the thresholds for only one criterion or subcriterion to qualify as a KBA, but all sites should be assessed against as many KBA criteria and for as many taxonomic groups and ecosystem types as possible, given available data. Assessing sites against multiple criteria and for multiple biodiversity elements will strengthen the robustness of KBA identification to changes in the status of particular trigger species, assemblages, or ecosystem types. For example, if a KBA is identified for both a globally threatened species of mammal (under Criterion A1) and an aggregation of Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 6 fish (under Criterion D1), the site would remain a KBA even if the mammal is down- listed so that it is not globally threatened. Assessing sites against multiple criteria and for multiple biodiversity elements may be an iterative process. 1.4 Thresholds for identifying Key Biodiversity Areas The KBA criteria have quantitative thresholds to ensure that KBA identification is objective, repeatable and transparent.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "548def7a-3ffc-4c9c-831e-414fd469234b": {"__data__": {"id_": "548def7a-3ffc-4c9c-831e-414fd469234b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6198ba4f0f5ad5934a244083536e799caa3d18e975fa9d850075da4023432798"}, "2": {"node_id": "a3b9d606-b50c-4d21-b74e-9a5a2b6b5f80", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "248892ebcb27918250338dcbb8dd890431265e22507a002129acc78cf89acab2"}}, "hash": "8cac02560090454b9c082c666ac071dffce0c19843150f192b4667a127f40753", "text": "The thresholds in the KBA Standard are designed to identify sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity under each of the KBA criteria.

The KBA thresholds have been developed to apply to all macroscopic species (i.e. excluding micro-organisms) and ecosystem types in terrestrial, freshwater, marine and subterranean systems.

For example, a site would qualify as a KBA under Criterion A1b if it holds \u22651% of the global population of a Vulnerable species (Fig. 1.3), or under Criterion B4 if it holds 20% or more of the global extent of an ecosystem type (Appendix II). The use of percentage thresholds avoids the challenge of identifying fixed numeric thresholds (such as a pre-defined number of mature individuals or ecosystem extent) that would be appropriate across all taxonomic groups or ecosystem types. The KBA Standard is designed to be flexible to enable assessment of species for which there is limited information on population sizes. There is therefore a range of assessment parameters that can be used to estimate the proportion of the global population size at a site if estimates of the number of mature individuals are not available. These assessment parameters include area of occupancy (AOO), extent of suitable habitat (ESH), range, number of localities and distinct genetic diversity. Differences in species characteristics are accounted for in parameter definitions that incorporate life-history traits. Population size, for example, is measured in terms of mature individuals, where the definition of mature individuals can be adapted for different life forms, such as clonal colonial organisms. The thresholds are thus based Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 7 on specific parameter definitions presented in the KBA Standard and the KBA Guidelines; many of these definitions are the same as for the IUCN Red List. 1.5 Confirmed presence of biodiversity elements in Key Biodiversity Areas KBA identification requires the confirmed presence at the site of one or more biodiversity elements (e.g., species, species assemblage, or ecosystem type) that trigger one or more of the KBA criteria. Many species-based criteria have two thresholds, one relating to the percentage of the global population held by the site, the other relating to the number of reproductive units present at the site. This second threshold is designed to ensure that the species is documented at the site in sufficient numbers that the population is capable of maintaining itself beyond the current generation. In the case of Criterion C, a site evaluation should be conducted to verify that ecological communities at each proposed site are intact. 1.6 Climate and environmental change Sites that do not currently meet the criteria and thresholds cannot be identified as KBAs based on predictions that they will do so in the future as a result of climate change. Models that predict the future locations of biodiversity elements under specific climate-change scenarios may be important in national and regional conservation planning exercises but cannot be used to identify KBAs that do not currently meet the criteria and thresholds. Likewise, the predicted loss of biodiversity elements at sites that currently meet the KBA criteria and thresholds due to climate or other environmental change does not preclude its identification as a KBA. 1.7 Delineating Key Biodiversity Areas Delineation is the process of defining the geographic boundaries of a KBA and is a required step in the KBA identification process. The aim is to derive site boundaries that are ecologically relevant and provide a basis for potential management activities. Delineation is an iterative process that typically involves assembling spatial datasets (Section 7.1), deriving initial KBA boundaries based on ecological data (Section 7.2), refining the ecological boundaries to yield practical KBA boundaries (Section 7.3) and documenting delineation precision (see the Documentation and Mapping Standards). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 8 1.8 Stakeholder consultation and involvement KBAs should not overlap. If a new site proposed as a KBA intersect with an existing KBA (including AZE sites, IBAs and KBAs identified under previous initiatives), then consensus-building with proposers of the existing KBA is required before the boundaries of any existing KBA are modified (see Section 8.2). The process of KBA identification and delineation does not include steps to advance management activity. It is recognized that involvement of those who hold rights to terrestrial, freshwater, marine or subterranean resources is strongly recommended before any action that might affect their rights to those resources (see Section 8.3). In particular, the Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) of indigenous peoples or other natural resource dependent communities is required when contemplating actions or decisions that could affect rights to lands, territories or resources (IUCN Standard on Indigenous Peoples).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6253592f-90d9-4eb0-8a63-626b7348890b": {"__data__": {"id_": "6253592f-90d9-4eb0-8a63-626b7348890b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2ca33e7bd38ccc0217c6fb5acb478a459f936338f07e602df9d583ecd1e49760"}, "2": {"node_id": "53da469b-7a2b-4326-805c-d3cf890b43d2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0c35553bc6e39509fcae43f07cffa06a9e231ce2f9087440246e5bf1062828a7"}}, "hash": "5f7302447057c6ad3a43936f2c3d04c6928321426f4bd11a183eb1d22a013c2b", "text": "1.9 Data availability, quality and uncertainty KBA identification should be based on a compilation of the most comprehensive and up-to-date available data and the best available methods for quantitative analysis.

KBA proposers must assess whether the data supporting a site\u2019s qualification as a KBA are reasonable and defensible. KBA proposals will be reviewed during the submission process (see Guidance on the process of Proposing, Reviewing, Nominating and Confirming Key Biodiversity Areas). 1.10 Reassessment of sites as Key Biodiversity Areas Confirmed KBAs should be reassessed against the KBA criteria and thresholds at least once every 8-12 years, with more frequent monitoring of biodiversity elements that triggered KBA qualification recommended where possible. Both genuine status changes and new information about the biodiversity element(s) triggering KBA criteria and thresholds may affect the status of a site as a KBA. Previously confirmed KBAs that no longer meet any criteria will no longer be considered global KBAs, unless there is reasonable expectation that the site will requalify in the near future (see Section 10 for further guidelines on reassessment of sites as KBAs). However, such Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 9 sites may still meet thresholds for regional significance, once these thresholds have been developed. 1.11 Definitions Important terms used in the KBA criteria, thresholds, assessment parameters and delineation procedures have specific definitions, as set out in the KBA Standard and reproduced and expanded in Appendix I to the KBA Guidelines. The KBA Standard uses several assessment parameters that are also used in IUCN Red List or IUCN RLE assessments (e.g., \u201cmature individuals\u201d, \u201cAOO\u201d). The KBA Guidelines therefore make frequent reference to the Guidelines for using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN SPSC, 2017) and the Guidelines for the application of IUCN RLE Categories and Criteria (IUCN, 2017), which provide more detailed discussion of these parameters. 1.12 Documentation Sites will only be accepted as KBAs if they are adequately documented, and following review by independent reviewers. All required documentation should be compiled prior to review. Documentation provides information to reviewers on the justification for identifying a site as a KBA and to decision-makers on why each KBA is important. Documentation also enables analysis of KBA data across species, ecosystem types and countries. (See the Documentation and Mapping Standards for further guidance.) Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 10 2. Identifying Key Biodiversity Areas using species-based criteria (A1, B1-3, D1-3) Criterion E is also based on species but is covered separately in Section 6 because the identification process differs substantially from that used for Criteria A1, B1-3 and D1- 3. 2.1 Overview NCGs and/or KBA proposers are encouraged to conduct a comprehensive scoping analysis (Steps 1-4 in Fig. 2.1) to identify all potential KBA trigger biodiversity elements and potential KBAs in the region of interest for which there are adequate data. For species-based criteria (A1, B1-3, D1-3), this may be implemented by taxonomic group. NCGs or KBA proposers may choose to start by compiling data for a few taxonomic groups in existing KBAs, other sites of importance for biodiversity, and protected or conserved areas. However, for each country, the aim should be to conduct inventories and compile locality data for as many taxa as possible to improve data availability for lesser-known biodiversity elements (e.g., some invertebrates, fungi). Assessing sites against multiple criteria and biodiversity elements will strengthen the robustness of KBAs to changes in the status of particular trigger species. In practice, the process of KBA identification is likely to vary greatly between countries. Some KBA proposers may wish to focus on identifying KBAs for a particular species or taxonomic group; whereas others may be primarily interested in a particular site and prefer to start by conducting an inventory of biodiversity elements that may meet KBA criteria and thresholds at the site.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d183201d-78a7-492f-904d-d221238e9c12": {"__data__": {"id_": "d183201d-78a7-492f-904d-d221238e9c12", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0a1446056d9789100dbaa8da62abcf80710a4ac9c7fdea652a377c4d781a1e70"}, "2": {"node_id": "68dc78a3-ce28-49ac-ba7c-7329c9ee108c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "83f483bef4111a9d7832277a9311c458ce1d17168b1ed668113fa88be639e02d"}}, "hash": "13d874d4cf8ec46bd6bf21f597b0418dcbce377f1f9a5182ba71900171990d9e", "text": "However, all sites must meet the criteria and thresholds in the KBA Standard, consistent with the KBA Guidelines, to be accepted as KBAs.

The taxonomy used for KBA identification needs to be consistent with the taxonomy used in IUCN Red List assessments. For species that have been assessed on the IUCN Red List, KBA proposers should follow the taxonomy used in the IUCN Red List, even if it differs from the taxonomy used for the national Red List. If new information on taxonomy is available, the IUCN Red List account must be updated first, before a KBA can be confirmed based on the new information. What taxonomy should be used for species that have not been assessed on the IUCN Red List? For species that have not been assessed on the IUCN Red List but fall under the remit of an IUCN Red List Authority, KBA identification should follow the taxonomy used by the IUCN Red List Authority. In many cases, this taxonomic information is available online. KBA proposers should check with the relevant IUCN Red List Authority where there is uncertainty (for example, regarding the status of any recently published species). For taxonomic groups that do not have a designated IUCN Red List Authority, KBA proposers should liaise with their RFP or the KBA Secretariat, if an RFP has not been appointed), who will ask the IUCN Red List Unit whether there is an approved checklist (e.g., Catalogue of Life, World Register of Marine Species) or relevant expert group (e.g., an IUCN Species Survival Commission subcommittee) who can advise on taxonomy. The final decision on which taxonomy to follow rests with the IUCN Red List Unit. Can KBAs be identified for undescribed species? Undescribed species cannot trigger KBAs unless the species has been assessed on the IUCN Red List (see IUCN Red List Guidelines; IUCN SPSC, 2017, Section 2.1.1 for conditions under which undescribed species may be listed). In the case of species that are in the process of being formally described through a scientific article that has not yet been published, the site will not be confirmed for that species until the article has been published and the species has been accepted be the IUCN Red List Authority or relevant expert group. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 13 Can KBAs be identified for subspecies or varieties? The thresholds associated with the species-based criteria (i.e. A1, B1-3, D1-3 and E) are designed to be applied at the species level. Subspecies, evolutionarily significant units, or varieties cannot trigger global KBAs. However, a site may qualify under Criterion A1, B1 or B2 because it holds a threshold proportion of distinct genetic diversity for a species. Guidelines for regional application of the KBA criteria and thresholds, when developed, may include provision for sites that are important for the persistence of subspecies or varieties. Can KBAs be identified for extinct species? No. But see Section 2.3.1 for species that are listed on the IUCN Red List as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct), or as Extinct in the Wild (EW) that are in the process of reintroduction. 2.2.2 Species only known from their type locality Can species known only from their type locality trigger a KBA? Critically Endangered (CR) or Endangered (EN) species known only from their type locality can trigger Criterion A1e if the species is assessed as unlikely to occur beyond the site. This information should be available in the IUCN Red List account. Generally, species known only from their type locality should not be automatically assumed to trigger KBA Criteria B1, B2, or B3, without further assessment of whether the species might occur beyond the site. For species that have been assessed for the IUCN Red List, this information should be available in the IUCN Red List account.

For example, a CR migratory species may trigger subcriterion A1e if a single site holds effectively the entire global population size of breeding adults during the breeding season, even if no mature individuals are found at the site during the non-breeding season. The same species could also trigger a separate KBA under subcriterion A1a if the site regularly holds \u22650.5% of the population size and \u22655 reproductive units in the non-breeding season. (See Section 3.3 for guidance on reproductive units for migratory species.) 2.2.4 Managed and introduced populations Can KBAs be identified for managed populations? Only populations that are considered \u201cwild\u201d, following the guidance provided in the IUCN Red List Guidelines (IUCN SPSC, 2017, Section 2.1.4), can trigger a KBA. There is a continuum of management intensities from captive populations (e.g., in zoos, aquaria and greenhouses) to populations not benefiting from any conservation measure. Many populations are dependent on anthropogenic ecosystems (e.g., reservoirs or grazed ecosystems) and/or conservation measures (e.g., protected areas) \u2013 these populations are generally considered wild. Captive animal populations and cultivated plant populations are not considered wild. In general, classification as wild should be based on the intensity of management and the expected viability of the population without intensive management. For example, an unmanaged population of a plant species in a botanical garden may be considered wild, whereas a population dependent on heated greenhouses would not. For further guidance, please refer to the IUCN Red List Guidelines (IUCN SPSC, 2017, Section 2.1.4). Can KBAs be identified for introduced populations? A site that supports an introduced population outside its natural range and that is considered wild may be identified as a KBA only if all the following conditions are met: (a) The known or likely intent of the introduction was to reduce the extinction risk of the introduced species; Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 15 (b) The site is geographically close to the natural range of the taxon (see IUCN SPSC, 2017, Section 2.1.3 for definition of \u201cgeographically close\u201d); (c) The introduced population has produced viable offspring at the site; and (d) At least five years have passed since introduction. Please see the IUCN Red List Guidelines (IUCN SPSC, 2017, Section 2.1.3) for further details. 2.3 Applying Criterion A1 to identify KBAs for threatened species 2.3.1 Identify the globally threatened species in the taxonomic group(s) of interest that may trigger Criterion A1 in the region of interest. The list of globally threatened species that may trigger Criterion A1 in each country will be provided automatically through the WDKBA when it is fully functional. Until then, this information can be found on the IUCN Red List by searching for species assessed as Critically Endangered (CR), Endangered (EN), or Vulnerable (VU) that occur in each country. How are globally threatened species identified for the purposes of applying KBA Criterion A1? The IUCN Red List is the global standard for species threat assessments despite its taxonomic and geographic gaps (Stuart et al., 2010) and using it as the authority for threatened species increases the rigour and transparency of the KBA identification process. Species that can trigger KBA Criterion A1 are: \u2022 species assessed as globally threatened (i.e. CR, EN or VU) on the IUCN Red List; and \u2022 species that (a) have not been assessed globally and (b) are endemic to the region/country in question and (c) have been assessed as regionally/nationally threatened using the Guidelines for Application of IUCN Red List Criteria at Regional and National Levels (IUCN, 2012b)1 or equivalent systems2.

Species assessed over 8-12 years ago should be reassessed prior to being used to identify KBAs. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 16 of species assessed at national levels can be found at www.nationalredlist.org. KBA proposers should consult with their RFP (if appointed) or the KBA Secretariat before using equivalent systems. If a species\u2019 IUCN Red List threat category has been proposed but not yet accepted or is in revision, the site will not be confirmed as a KBA for the species under the new threat category until after the new IUCN Red List account is published. The KBA Standard does not specify any particular version of the IUCN Red List Criteria (IUCN, 2016, p. 16), but the most recent assessment must be used for each species. Species assessed as globally CR, EN or VU under previous versions of the IUCN Red List Criteria that have not been updated may trigger KBA Criterion A1, but it is strongly recommended that such species are reassessed prior to KBA identification to confirm that they fall into the same categories under the current criteria. Can species assessed as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) trigger a KBA? For species listed as CR (PE), only the site at which the species is most likely to occur (if it still exists) can trigger KBA Criterion A1, under subcriterion A1e. For many species listed as CR(PE), this corresponds to the location of the last recorded population. There is no reproductive-unit threshold for Criterion A1e. Can species assessed as Extinct in the Wild (EW) trigger a KBA? Sites that hold populations of species listed on the IUCN Red List as EW that are in the process of reintroduction within their natural range may trigger KBA Criterion A1a, c, or e, as appropriate. Reintroduction efforts should either be underway at the time of the KBA assessment or planned to take place within the next two years. (If reintroduction is not yet underway, the site will be flagged as \u201crestoration dependent\u201d in the WDKBA and the site\u2019s status will be revisited in two years.) 2.3.2 Ascertain the relevant population-size threshold for each potential trigger species given its threat category. For each species that can trigger Criterion A1, the relevant threshold depends on its category on the IUCN Red List (e.g., CR, EN, VU). A site qualifies as a KBA under Criterion A1 because it regularly holds one or more of the following: a) \u22650.5% of the global population size AND \u22655 reproductive units of a CR or EN species; b) \u22651% of the global population size AND \u226510 reproductive units of a VU species; Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 17 c) \u22650.1% of the global population size AND \u22655 reproductive units of a species assessed as CR or EN due only to population size reduction in the past or present (as indicated by the IUCN Red List assessment); d) \u22650.2% of the global population size AND \u226510 reproductive units of a species assessed as VU due only to population size reduction in the past or present (as indicated by the IUCN Red List assessment); e) Effectively the entire global population size of a CR or EN species. KBA subcriteria A1a and A1b are intended for general applicability across all globally threatened species. KBA subcriteria A1c and A1d are intended for limited application to species that have experienced, or are currently experiencing, rapid decline in population size. KBA subcriteria A1c and A1d apply only to species listed as CR, EN, or VU under IUCN Red List Criterion A only; and only to species listed under IUCN Red List subcriteria A1, A2, and/or A4, and not under A3.

Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 18 2.3.4 Overlay boundaries of existing sites on spatial data for each potential trigger species. Using a GIS, boundaries of existing sites (e.g., existing KBAs, other sites of importance for biodiversity, protected or conserved areas) can be overlaid on areas that are important for globally threatened species to generate a list of existing sites that might qualify as KBAs under Criterion A1. (See the WDKBA, Plantlife IPA Database, Ramsar Sites Information Service, and the Protected Planet Database for GIS data on existing sites.) 2.3.5 If there are no suitable delineated sites in areas of potential importance, derive initial KBA boundaries using ecological data. In some cases, the scoping analysis may reveal areas of potential importance where there are no existing KBAs, other recognised sites of importance for biodiversity, or protected or conserved areas. In this case, initial boundaries for potential KBAs may be based on ecological considerations (see Section 7.2). These boundaries may need to be refined later to yield practical KBA boundaries (see Section 7.3). 2.3.6 Identify assessment parameters for which reliable global and local level data are available, and estimate these parameters at the global and site level. For each potential trigger species, review the available data at global and local levels and decide which assessment parameters to use, then estimate global and site-level values for those parameters. For Criterion A1, the proportion of the global population size at a site can be observed or inferred through any of the following: (i) number of mature individuals, (ii) area of occupancy, (iii) extent of suitable habitat, (iv) range, (v) number of localities, (vi) distinct genetic diversity. See Section 3.1 for guidelines on selecting among assessment parameters. 2.3.7 Assess whether each potential trigger species meets the relevant population- size threshold at each existing/potential site. For each globally threatened species, the proportion of the global population that regularly occurs at a site will be calculated in the WDKBA based on the estimated global and site-level values entered or selected for each assessment parameter by the proposer, and then compared to the relevant population-size threshold for the species given its threat category. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 19 2.3.8 Confirm the presence of each potential trigger species that meets the relevant population-size threshold at each proposed site. The final step in assessing a site against KBA Criterion A1 is to confirm the presence of each potential trigger species at the site by reviewing recent data or conducting new field surveys if necessary. For subcriteria A1a-d, the species must be regularly present in numbers that meet or exceed the relevant reproductive-unit threshold. There is no reproductive-unit requirement for subcriterion A1e. Nevertheless, it is still necessary to confirm that the species regularly occurs at the site (see Section 9.2.3). 2.3.9 Refine ecological boundaries, if necessary, to yield practical KBA boundaries. KBA delineation is not complete until ecological boundaries have been evaluated and refined, if necessary, to yield a manageable site or sites (see Section 7.3 for further guidelines). 2.3.10 Compile required and recommended documentation under Criterion A1.

Can migratory species trigger Criterion B1? The KBA Standard states that \u201cthe regular occurrence of all life stages of a species at a site distinguishes Criterion B1 from Criterion D1\u201d (IUCN, 2016, p. 18). Here, the KBA Guidelines clarify that Criterion B1 may apply to resident or migratory species as long as at least 10% of the global population size and at least 10 reproductive units of the species regularly occur at the site. The criterion should be applied separately to each spatially segregated life-cycle process. For example, a migratory species may be geographically restricted in its breeding range, but not in its non-breeding range, or vice versa. In contrast, Criterion D1 is intended to apply solely to highly mobile species (e.g., migratory or nomadic species) that aggregate at particular sites at high densities that make them especially vulnerable to over-exploitation or other threats. 2.4.2 Ascertain the relevant population-size threshold for each potential trigger species.

The final step in assessing a site against KBA Criterion B1 is to confirm the presence of each potential trigger species at the site in numbers that meet or exceed the relevant reproductive-unit threshold by reviewing recent data or conducting new field surveys if necessary. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 22 2.4.9 Refine ecological boundaries, if necessary, to yield practical KBA boundaries. KBA delineation is not complete until ecological boundaries have been evaluated and refined, if necessary, to yield a manageable site or sites (see Section 7.3 for further guidelines). 2.4.10 Compile required and recommended documentation under Criterion B1. See the Documentation and Mapping Standards for guidance on required and recommended documentation for Criterion B1. 2.5 Applying Criterion B2 to identify KBAs for co-occurring geographically restricted species 2.5.1 Identify the species in the taxonomic group(s) of interest that could trigger Criterion B2 in the region of interest. The first step in applying Criterion B2 is to identify the appropriate taxonomic rank for applying this criterion for each taxonomic group. Please see recommended taxonomic ranks for applying Criteria B2 and B3. For taxonomic groups without a recommended taxonomic rank, KBA proposers are encouraged to review the guidelines below and consult with the RFP (if appointed) or the KBA Secretariat, who will consult with IUCN Red List Authorities and other relevant experts, as appropriate, before proceeding with site assessments. For each taxonomic group, the same taxonomic rank should be used to apply Criteria B2 and B3 globally. The second step in applying Criterion B2 is to compile a list of restricted-range species for each taxonomic group. For taxonomic groups that have been comprehensively assessed on the IUCN Red List at the recommended taxonomic rank (e.g., mammals, birds and amphibians) or previously assessed against Criterion B2, a list of restricted- range species will be provided through the WDKBA. For other taxonomic groups, KBA proposers are encouraged to review the guidelines below and consult with the RFP (if appointed) or the KBA Secretariat before proceeding with site assessments. Site analysis should be conducted separately for each taxonomic group (i.e. geographically restricted species from different taxonomic groups cannot be combined to meet the Criterion B2). How is the appropriate taxonomic rank for applying Criterion B2 determined? Criterion B2 may be based on any taxonomic rank above species (IUCN, 2016, p. 19). KBA proposers are encouraged to use the most inclusive rank for which range size data are available for all species. In the case of birds, for example, it would be inappropriate to determine the number of restricted-range species in a genus of birds, Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 23 given that range sizes are known for all birds; rather, the number of restricted-range birds should be determined from the entire Class. For highly speciose taxa (such as the Order Lepidoptera, which includes approximately 180,000 species), it may be more appropriate to work at a lower taxonomic rank than Class, such as Family. It is worth noting that working at a lower taxonomic rank will make it less likely that 2 or more potential trigger species co-occur at the same site, as required by the threshold. How are restricted-range species identified for the purposes of applying KBA Criterion B2? For the purpose of identifying KBAs under Criterion B2, the KBA Standard defines restricted-range species as species having a global range size less than or equal to the 25th percentile of range-size distribution in a taxonomic group for which all species have been mapped globally (i.e. the quarter of species in the taxonomic group with the smallest ranges), up to a maximum of 50,000 km2. If the 25th percentile of range- size distribution for a taxonomic group falls below 10,000 km2, restricted range should be defined as having a global range size less than or equal to 10,000 km2 (i.e.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "03fc7c06-1912-4deb-a0c0-7938be35846c": {"__data__": {"id_": "03fc7c06-1912-4deb-a0c0-7938be35846c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "213bde9b21eed3a1a52a86fec23b371a13b2898249183f3140b9473f42c9a46a"}, "2": {"node_id": "c214704d-0e8a-4e9c-a004-e896825d768c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0bf8d889d7b1926e2e68e1cd5f6b5c0b1c930a66adf14af167d3e8e4c7514cc0"}}, "hash": "52d3dd9d2162805faa9c4eecb668f3dbbe03e5f77bf0e79e70671db3606be32b", "text": "all species with global range size less than or equal to 10,000 km2 are considered restricted-range).

Can KBA Criterion B2 be applied to migratory species? The KBA Standard does not comment on the applicability of Criterion B2 to migratory species. The criterion should be applied separately to each spatially segregated life- cycle process. For example, a migratory species that is restricted-range in its breeding range, but not in its non-breeding range, could only trigger KBAs under Criterion B2 in its breeding range; whereas a migratory species that is restricted-range in its breeding and its non-breeding range, could trigger KBAs in its breeding range and its non-breeding range. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 24 2.5.2 Ascertain the relevant species threshold for each taxonomic group and population-size threshold for each potential trigger species. A site qualifies as a KBA under Criterion B2 because it regularly holds \u22651% of the global population size of each of a number of restricted-range species in a taxonomic group, determined as either \u22652 species OR 0.02% of the global number of species in the taxonomic group, whichever is larger. For example, if the total number of species in the taxonomic group is 20,000, the threshold number is 4. For each taxonomic group that has been comprehensively assessed for the IUCN Red List at the recommended taxonomic rank (e.g., amphibians, birds, mammals) or previously assessed for Criterion B2, the global number of species in the taxonomic group will be provided through the WDKBA, together with the threshold number of restricted-range species that must co-occur at a site to trigger a KBA under Criterion B2. For taxonomic groups that have not been comprehensively assessed for the IUCN Red List or previously assessed for Criterion B2, KBA proposers should estimate the global number of species in the taxonomic group. Note that an exact number may not be required. If that number is less than 15,000, then the species threshold is 2 restricted- range species. Conversely, if that number is greater or equal to 15,000, then the species threshold is 0.02% of the global number of species in the taxonomic group (for example, a taxonomic group containing 15,000-19,999 species would require 3 restricted-range species in the taxonomic group to co-occur at the site). 2.5.3 For each taxonomic group, overlay distribution data for restricted-range species to identify areas where they co-occur in the region of interest. Locality data may be found through a literature search, online, museum/herbarium records, and direct contact with biodiversity knowledge-holders. Some of these data may need to be digitised for use in a GIS. ESH maps already developed for birds, mammals and amphibians, and AOO for some species, will be provided through the WDKBA, when it is fully functional. Range maps for many globally threatened species can be downloaded from the IUCN Red List.5 Distribution data may be overlaid in a GIS to identify areas where restricted-range species (identified following guidelines in Section 2.5.1) in the same taxonomic group co-occur. 5 Individual range maps can be downloaded from IUCN Red List species accounts; whole groups may be downloaded from http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical-documents/spatial-data; and custom-built sets using a free Red List user account.

Using a GIS, boundaries of existing sites (e.g., existing KBAs, other sites of importance for biodiversity, protected or conserved areas) can be overlaid on areas that are important for co-occurring geographically restricted species to generate a list of existing sites that might qualify as KBAs under Criterion B2.

These may be based on an intersection of terrestrial biomes and biogeographic realms defined by Dinerstein et al.

For subcriterion B3b, the species must be regularly present in numbers that meet or exceed the relevant reproductive-unit threshold. While there is no explicit reproductive-unit threshold for subcriteria B3a and B3c, numbers and densities of mature individuals should be sufficient to support reproduction at sites used for breeding.

The KBA Standard states that \u201cCriterion D1 is not meant to identify sites that hold all key stages of a species\u2019 life-cycle; those sites may be triggered by criteria A1, B1, B2 or B3.\u201d Thus, Criterion D1 is not generally intended to apply to resident species or the resident components of partially migratory species, although it may be triggered by Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 34 resident species that aggregate in specific areas within their range for specific life-cycle processes (e.g., at lekking areas or in spawning areas). Can KBA Criterion D1 be applied to aggregations of juveniles or other life stages? KBA Criterion D1 applies to sites that support threshold numbers of mature individuals as the threshold is defined in terms of mature individuals. 2.7.2 Ascertain the relevant population-size threshold for each potential trigger species given its threat category. A site qualifies as a KBA under Criterion D1 because it predictably holds one or more of the following: a) An aggregation representing \u22651% of the global population size of a species, over a season, and during one or more key stages of its life cycle; b) A number of mature individuals that ranks the site among the largest 10 aggregations known for the species. The term \u201clife-history stage\u201d is intended to be synonymous with life-cycle process (e.g., breeding, feeding, or migration) and does not refer to developmental stage (e.g., pup, juvenile, adult). For subcriterion D1b, proposers should estimate the aggregation size at sites that host the largest aggregations of the species globally, with the number of sites sufficient to demonstrate clearly that any proposed KBAs rank among the largest 10 aggregations. 2.7.3 For each potential trigger species, compile readily available data on the distribution in the region of interest. Relevant data on species\u2019 aggregations will most likely be found through a literature search or expert knowledge, or possibly online databases. Some of these data may need to be digitised for use in a GIS. 2.7.4 Overlay boundaries of existing sites on spatial data for each potential trigger species. Using a GIS, boundaries of existing sites (e.g., existing KBAs, other sites of importance for biodiversity, protected or conserved areas) can be overlaid on areas that are important for demographic aggregations in a GIS to generate a list of existing sites that might qualify as KBAs under Criterion D1. (See the WDKBA, Plantlife IPA Database, Ramsar Sites Information Service, and the Protected Planet Database for GIS data on existing sites.) Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 35 What does \u201cover a season\u201d mean in the threshold for D1a? \u201cOver a season, and during one or more key stages of its life cycle\u201d refers to a specific period of the year when some or all members of a population predictably aggregate to perform some specific life-cycle processes, such as breeding, moulting, or over- wintering. A migratory stopover or bottleneck site that supports \u22651% of the global population size over the course of the migratory season would qualify under subcriterion D1a even if the estimated number of individuals present does not exceed 1% of the global population size at any point in time. Discriminating migratory or bottleneck sites may be challenging for species that do not fly. Individuals are expected to accumulate in such sites because the movement process slows, so stopover and bottleneck sites may be distinguished by higher than average densities along a migratory corridor. In such cases, it is important to provide supporting evidence to show that the cumulative total of individuals during a season meets the threshold (e.g., through individual mark-recapture data). Can subcriterion D1b be applied separately to aggregations for specific functions? The D1b threshold (i.e., the largest 10 aggregations known for the species) applies across all life-cycle processes rather than separately for specific functions (e.g., breeding or feeding).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e879561c-d3c7-4ca7-a9a7-4bb8c6f2f5b0": {"__data__": {"id_": "e879561c-d3c7-4ca7-a9a7-4bb8c6f2f5b0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "21b4478871a4a9e58d360884aabe186adcd9cfff0cb1e85d0a98a42b03cf1081"}, "2": {"node_id": "843b1da7-30c3-4838-a394-768e63794272", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b9a85a1cebf48bd85b08240fc13e3a9492729f1535fb9fab0b30887d2557a887"}}, "hash": "266589f38fe0ee3a3dabc8679878e33927f9dbdaaba090c0c85d13b3cbb1771d", "text": "Thus, if a species forms aggregations at one time of year for breeding and aggregations at another time of year for feeding, only the ten largest aggregations across both seasons would qualify. 2.7.5 If there are no suitable delineated sites in areas of potential importance, derive initial KBA boundaries using ecological data.

These boundaries may need to be refined later to yield practical KBA boundaries (see Section 7.3). 2.7.6 Identify assessment parameters for which reliable global and local level data are available, and estimate these parameters at the global and site level. For Criterion D1, the proportion of the global population size at a site can be observed or inferred through the following: (i) number of mature individuals. For many species, the global number of mature individuals will be provided through the WDKBA. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 36 For Criterion D1, a site predictably holds a species if the species is known to have occurred at the site in at least two thirds of the relevant seasons for which adequate data are available; the total number of seasons being not less than three. For example, a site would qualify if a species occurs there at threshold numbers in 7 out of 10 years. This is consistent with the definition of \u201cregularly\u201d in the application of Ramsar Criteria 5 and 6 (Ramsar, 2008). For some species, numbers of individuals in large aggregations are extremely hard to estimate, but the densities of individuals in aggregations of the same type may be relatively consistent (e.g., seabirds nest pecking-distance apart). In this case, the size (i.e. area or volume) of the aggregation may be used to infer whether a site ranks among the largest 10 aggregations known for the species under Criterion D1b. 2.7.7 Assess whether each potential trigger species meets the relevant population- size threshold at each existing/potential site. For each potential trigger species under subcriterion D1a, the proportion of the global population that occurs in seasonal aggregations at a site will be calculated in the WDKBA based on the estimated global and site-level values entered or selected for each assessment parameter by the proposer, and then compared to the population- size threshold for subcriterion D1a. 2.7.8 Confirm the seasonal presence of each potential trigger species that meets the relevant population-size threshold at each proposed site. The final step in assessing a site against KBA Criterion D1 is to confirm the seasonal presence of each potential trigger species at each proposed site by reviewing recent data or conducting new field surveys if necessary. What is necessary to confirm seasonal presence at a site for Criterion D1 given that there are no reproductive-unit thresholds? While there is no explicit reproductive-unit threshold for Criterion D1, KBA proposers are encouraged to confirm the presence of potential trigger species at the site in terms of reproductive units, where appropriate (using the 10 reproductive-unit threshold for Criterion B1, for example). This is most relevant for spawning aggregations that are severely depleted but trigger Criterion D1b. 2.7.9 Refine ecological boundaries, if necessary, to yield practical KBA boundaries.

For Criterion D3, the proportion of the global population size at a site can be observed or inferred through the following: (i) number of mature individuals. A significant proportion of the global population of a species may be produced at sites identified under Criterion D3 even though there may be only a few mature individuals at the site at any given time. Hence, the threshold is based on the global population size of mature individuals produced by the site, rather than the number of immature individuals within the site. Proposers should estimate the global population size and the number of mature individuals that are produced by each proposed site. For Criterion D3, a site predictably produces propagules, larvae, or juveniles that maintain \u226510% of the global population size of a species if it produces them in at least two thirds of the recruitment cycles for which adequate data are available; the total number of recruitment cycles being not less than three. How can the number of mature individuals produced by a site be estimated? Estimating the proportion of the global population size of mature individuals that is produced by a site will often be challenging. For most species, it is not feasible to tag or track propagules, larvae, or juveniles from recruitment to maturity. Exceptions may include anadromous fish species with high site-fidelity (e.g., salmon), or species that produce large juveniles (e.g., sharks and rays). For some species (e.g., corals), genetic markers have been used to identify recruitment sources. Recruitment models that include the transport or dispersal of propagules, larvae, or juveniles from recruitment sources to final settlement sites have also been developed for some species (e.g, fungi, plants, corals, benthic invertebrates), but are often complex and difficult to validate. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 41 Identification of recruitment sources may therefore be based on the simplifying assumption that survival from proposed recruitment source habitat to maturity is uniform, unless reliable data or models are available to quantify an alternative distribution. Hence, in most cases, it will be sufficient to estimate the relative density of propagules, larvae, juveniles and use this information to identify recruitment sources that produce \u226510% of propagules, larvae, or juveniles, under the assumption that these recruitment sources also produce \u226510% of mature individuals. This can be achieved through direct sampling throughout the range or, more likely, a combination of sampling and spatial density modelling (see Appendix III.4). 2.9.7 Assess whether each potential trigger species meets the relevant population- size threshold at each existing/potential site. For each potential trigger species under Criterion D3, the proportion of the global population size that is produced by each proposed site will be calculated in the WDKBA, based on the estimated global and site-level values entered or selected for the assessment parameter by the proposer, and then compared to the population-size threshold for Criterion D3.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "45a8524d-6092-4454-90f2-d2c8825db05f": {"__data__": {"id_": "45a8524d-6092-4454-90f2-d2c8825db05f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b41543438781d4d26a42d3ee47c2b1b7169c3d2ea69529373104b2b7a7d773e7"}, "2": {"node_id": "7210f3ed-d37e-4678-ae71-c6ca8c7021a3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "14ee926d0b9f1c7e8ec53e9234aee99ecaa98f963986ac18b22504d29f959deb"}}, "hash": "85cc6dd85e8802764d3ea08c6e74b7a5c029b52d461dd0c2b261ffb84cdb19f0", "text": "2.9.8 Confirm that each proposed site produces recruits in numbers consistent with the population-size threshold.

See the Documentation and Mapping Standards for guidance on required and recommended documentation for Criterion D3. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 42 3. Thresholds and assessment parameters for species-based criteria (A1, B1-3, D1-3 and E) Only populations considered \u201cwild\u201d should be included in estimates of assessment parameters (see Section 2.2.4). 3.1 Selecting assessment parameters Which assessment parameters provide the best indication of the proportion of the global population size at a site? Under KBA Criteria A1, B1-2 and B3a, the proportion of the global population size at a site can be observed or inferred through any of the following: (i) number of mature individuals, (ii) area of occupancy, (iii) extent of suitable habitat, (iv) range, (v) number of localities, (vi) distinct genetic diversity (except for Criterion B3a). For each species, the best information available should be used to determine the proportion of the global population size held by the site. The same assessment parameter must be used at both the global and site levels, so the quality of data at both global and site levels needs to be considered. This may often be a matter of compromise; it is better to use an assessment parameter for which reliable estimates are available at global and site levels than one for which the site estimate is very reliable and the global estimate is unreliable, or vice versa. An assessment parameter may be unreliable if the only available data are old, the sampling strategy was not representative, or analytical methods were inappropriate. If equally reliable data are available for both number of mature individuals and one or more of the area-based assessment parameters (i.e. ii-iv), number of mature individuals should generally be used as it provides a direct rather than indirect representation of the population\u2019s distribution. However, in some species, the number of mature individuals may fluctuate substantially among years, and area-based parameters may provide a more stable assessment parameter. If reliable data are not available for number of mature individuals, then area-based assessment parameters may be used. For example, a 1% threshold can typically be Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 43 inferred where the site contains at least 1% of a species\u2019 AOO, ESH, or range. However, these assessment parameters should be used cautiously, given that species are generally unevenly distributed across their range, suitable habitat, or AOO. An overview of area-based parameters is provided in Section 3.4. If reliable data are not available for number of mature individuals, each species should ideally be assessed using as many of the area-based assessment parameters as possible in order to develop multiple lines of evidence, although it is recognised that there will often be insufficient data to allow this. Locality information is typically most useful for species with fragmented populations, but should only be used to infer the proportion of the global population size at a site if sampling has been sufficient to represent the range and AOO of the species. Proposers are encouraged to provide information on all assessment parameters for which reliable data are available at both global and site levels, as this may increase the resilience and credibility of site identification and will facilitate comparison across sites. What happens if different assessment parameters point to different conclusions? Where different assessment parameters point to different conclusions, proposers should use the best available information and justify that choice (see Section 9.2 for further guidance). For example, consider a species for which there is reliable information at global and site levels on both ESH and AOO, with AOO providing the more accurate and precise indicator of the population\u2019s distribution. If a site does not exceed relevant thresholds based on ESH but does based on AOO, then the site will qualify as a KBA because AOO provides better information on the population\u2019s distribution. Conversely, if a site exceeds relevant thresholds based on ESH but not based on AOO, then the site will not qualify as a KBA, for the same reason.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dfdec843-c036-4145-a2c5-b156b6c150fb": {"__data__": {"id_": "dfdec843-c036-4145-a2c5-b156b6c150fb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c4dd5e6b7aa4b1f5cd36ddb117ef3980224e6c73966e90020d649bfb84ba9154"}, "2": {"node_id": "ae3a08a8-a094-403e-90cd-5f34505abf00", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "efcf2c2b4ff82e72d7b626cffff9cc20cb11c3ce666e02d2e781a74d32991d30"}}, "hash": "740a071228905956a8b397b75b3df954b689bdcda3226dd8d784ad22d3f3e467", "text": "Alternatively, consider a species with reliable information at global and site levels on ESH, but out-of-date and questionable data on AOO.

Site assessments that are not based on the best available data may be vulnerable to challenge through an Appeal. Can different estimation methods be used at the global and site level? For each species, the same assessment parameter must be used at the global and site levels, and estimation methods should be the same or as consistent as possible to Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 44 ensure that population size estimates at the global and site levels are directly comparable and enable calculation of the proportion of the global population size held at the site (see Section 9.3.2 for further guidance). For multi-species criteria (i.e. B2, B3), does the same parameter need to be used for all species at a proposed site? When determining whether a species is restricted-range for Criterion B2 or estimating the median range size for assessing which subcriterion to apply under Criterion B3, range (not ESH) must be used for all species. The median range size can be estimated from a representative sample of species, so data on range are not required for the entire taxonomic group. However, when determining either the proportion of the global population size at the site, or whether a species is ecoregion- or bioregion-restricted, the proposer should use the assessment parameter that provides the best available data for each individual species. What if assessment parameters derived from the IUCN Red List account need updating? When assessment parameters derived from the IUCN Red List, such as global population size, range, or AOO, are out-of-date, new estimates may be used in the KBA proposal but must be flagged for expert review when the KBA proposal is submitted to the WDKBA. The KBA Secretariat will forward new information to the relevant Red List Authority for review on a periodic basis. 3.2 Number of mature individuals (Criteria A1, B1-3, D1-3, E) For Criteria A1, B1-3, D1-3 the proportion of the global population size can be observed or inferred through any of the following: (i) number of mature individuals. Number of mature individuals is also used in Criterion E. Why focus on mature individuals? The global population size and population size at a site are both measured in terms of mature individuals because this can be measured more consistently across species than the total number of individuals, given the wide variation in life history strategies and life forms. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 45 How are mature individuals defined? The definition of mature individuals in the KBA Standard (IUCN, 2016) is consistent with the definition used in IUCN Red List assessments: \u201cThe number of individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction as defined in IUCN (2012a).\u201d For species that have been assessed for the IUCN Red List, proposers should use the definition of mature individuals in the IUCN Red List assessment. For species from taxonomic groups that have not yet been assessed for the IUCN Red List (or for which the above information is unavailable), proposers should follow the detailed guidance on defining mature individuals in the IUCN Red List Guidelines (IUCN SPSC, 2017). The guidance below is extracted from the IUCN Red List Guidelines (IUCN SPSC, 2017, Section 4.3.1) and repeated here for convenience. When determining the number of mature individuals, the following points should be borne in mind: \u2022 \"Reproduction\" means production of offspring (not just mating or displaying other reproductive behaviour). \u2022 Mature individuals that will never produce new recruits should not be counted (e.g., densities are too low for fertilisation). \u2022 In the case of populations with biased adult or breeding sex ratios, it is appropriate to use lower estimates for the number of mature individuals, which take this into account. \u2022 Reproducing units within a clone should be counted as individuals, except where such units are unable to survive alone (e.g., corals). \u2022 In the case of taxa that naturally lose all or a subset of mature breeding individuals at some point in their life cycle, the estimate should be made at the appropriate time, when mature individuals are available for breeding. \u2022 Reintroduced individuals must have produced viable offspring before they are counted as mature individuals.

Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 46 What if juveniles cannot be easily distinguished from mature individuals? When the mature/ immature ratio is similar at global and site levels, then the proportion of all individuals at a site should provide a reasonable approximation of the proportion of mature individuals at a site. For example, if the mature/ immature ratio is 50/50 at both global and site levels, a site that holds 10% of global population size of all individuals would be expected to hold 10% of the global population size of mature individuals. In contrast, if the species distribution is characterised by spatial segregation of life stages (e.g., juveniles vs mature individuals) or the mature/ immature ratio is known to differ at global and site levels, then proposers should account for this information. What if the sex ratio is imbalanced? If the sex ratio is imbalanced but similar at global and site levels, then proposers may use mature individuals of either or both sexes as the basis for estimating the proportion of the global population size at a site. However, if the sex ratio is known to differ at global and site levels, then proposers should focus on the limiting sex and use a ratio-based approach when estimating population size at both global and site levels. For species in which females bear and raise young, the limiting sex will generally be females, unless males are severely under-represented. For example, for a species with a global population of 1,200 mature individuals, with an imbalanced sex ratio in which females are the limiting sex and represent approximately 1/3 of the total population (i.e. 400 mature females total), then a site that holds 100 mature individuals (i.e. < 10% of mature individuals) but 50 mature females (i.e. 12.5% of all mature females) might be proposed as a KBA based on the 10% threshold in Criterion B1. Where can proposers find information on the number of mature individuals at the global or site level? For species that have been assessed for the IUCN Red List, estimates of global population size included in the IUCN Red List account will be provided through the WDKBA. However, this information is not available for all species assessed for the IUCN Red List. For species that have not yet been assessed for the IUCN Red List, or for which this information is unavailable, other sources of information on the number of mature Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 47 individuals at the global level include IUCN Red List Authorities, NatureServe, national authorities, and scientific literature. How can proposers estimate the number of mature individuals at the global or site level? It is beyond the scope of the KBA Guidelines to provide detailed guidelines on how to estimate the number of mature individuals at the global or site level, given the wide range of valid methods available. Methods should be applied consistently at the global and site levels, and should be scientifically valid and appropriate for the taxon (i.e. should be acceptable for publication in the peer-reviewed literature). In a very few cases, it may be possible to make a direct count of all mature individuals at a site. More often, estimates of population size will be based on sampling, such as counts of the number of individuals in representative samples of the habitat (e.g., point counts, transects quadrats); estimates of the number of individuals in representative samples of the habitat using distance sampling (Buckland et al., 2001), individual mark-recapture (Amstrup et al., 2010), or other methods that account for imperfect detection; or methods based on indirect indicators of abundance, such as scat or footprint surveys (e.g., Jachmann, 2012). Methods that do not involve a count of the entire population size (at the global or site level) should take account of habitat suitability, where possible, rather than assume that densities are uniform across the site or AOO, ESH, or range. If population estimates have not been published at the global or site level, then a full account of the methods needs to be provided in the documentation.

KBAs should be identified on the basis of the current presence of biodiversity elements, according to the KBA Standard (IUCN, 2016). If the number of mature Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 48 individuals at the global or site level is known to be increasing or decreasing over time, then past data on global or site-level population size should be projected forward to the current time. This is especially important if these data were collected more than 8-12 years before the assessment (see Section 9.2). 3.3 Reproductive units (Criteria A1, B1, B3, E) Why are reproductive units included in the thresholds for some species-based criteria? Reproductive units are included in the thresholds for some species-based criteria to ensure that the species is documented at the site in sufficient numbers that the population is capable of maintaining itself beyond the current generation. The reproductive-unit threshold is especially important where population size is inferred through area-based assessment parameters because it provides confirmation that the species is actually present at the site. How are reproductive units defined? The KBA Standard defines reproductive units as: \u201cThe minimum number and combination of mature individuals necessary to trigger a successful reproductive event at a site (Eisenberg 1977). Examples of five reproductive units include five pairs, five reproducing females in one harem, and five reproductive individuals of a plant species.\u201d For each species, the definition of reproductive units should be consistent with the definition of mature individuals. See IUCN Red List Guidelines (IUCN SPSC, 2017, Section 4.3.1) for detailed discussion of several special cases including clonal colonial organisms and sex-changing organisms. Additional examples of 5 reproductive units include: \u2022 birds: 5 pairs, or 5 females and at least 1 male in lekking species, \u2022 non-social insects: 5 females and at least 1 male, \u2022 social insects: 5 colonies with single reproducing queen each, \u2022 parthenogenetic insects: 5 reproductive females, \u2022 fungi: 5 mature individuals, \u2022 plants: 5 mature individuals for hermaphroditic or self-fertilising species, \u2022 clonal species: 5 distinct clones. As with mature individuals, reproductive units should be capable of reproduction. Individuals that will never produce new recruits (for example, because densities are too low for fertilisation) should not be counted. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 49 What if males and females cannot be readily distinguished? For species in which males and females cannot be readily distinguished, the reproductive-unit threshold should be translated into the equivalent number of mature individuals (e.g., if 10 reproductive units = 10 pairs, this is equivalent to 20 mature individuals). However, if there is evidence of a severely imbalanced sex ratio, proposers should increase efforts to assess whether the minimum number of reproductive units does indeed occur at the site. What about sites at which breeding does not occur? \u201cBreeding\u201d here refers to mating and other processes that require reproductive units, such as incubation and chick-rearing in many bird species. For sites at which breeding does not occur, the reproductive-unit threshold should be translated into the equivalent number of mature individuals (e.g., if 10 reproductive units = 10 pairs, this is equivalent to 20 mature individuals; for sexually segregated species, this may be 20 mature females or 20 mature males). Densities do not need to be sufficient to enable reproduction in this context. How is the reproductive-unit threshold applied to species listed as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct)? See Section 2.3.8. What about species-based criteria that do not have reproductive units included in the threshold? Some species-based criteria (i.e. A1e, B2, B3a, B3c, D) do not include a reproductive- unit threshold. For non-threatened species, it is likely that a site that meets the population-size threshold would hold at least 10 reproductive units. Nevertheless, proposers should confirm the regular or predictable presence of each trigger species at sites proposed under these criteria (see Section 9.2.3). In sites where breeding occurs, numbers and densities should be sufficient to support successful reproduction and proposers are encouraged to confirm presence in terms of reproductive units if possible (e.g., at least 10 reproductive units).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "de6cf501-7eab-42b3-bab9-5b55bceaab64": {"__data__": {"id_": "de6cf501-7eab-42b3-bab9-5b55bceaab64", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9ef23c93b2c8eaf392ba24f4731465a1ce4fb00a26d0109cc226d655948e4a72"}, "2": {"node_id": "f69ee39b-ac03-4f47-8b8b-974b4949d66e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dae2d1f73473e67d56a6214e7cb114c56ef3bcdfa837b7e0f969d6b2013253b4"}}, "hash": "cbe6f5ce17ac6f4709bf77071080141ab53f9f0761995b63abfcc1b48daa4355", "text": "What types of evidence may be used to assess whether the reproductive units threshold is met?

The reproductive-unit threshold cannot be inferred from the presence of suitable habitat, or habitat maps or models. Evidence should be recent, ideally collected within 8-12 years (see Section 9.2.3). If the species has suffered population declines at the site or the site has suffered habitat loss during that period, more recent evidence of presence should be provided. 3.4 Overview of area-based assessment parameters (A1, B1-3, E) Figure 3.4 provides a schematic demonstrating the range, ESH, AOO, and localities or occurrences. Range defines the geographic space within the major system(s) in which a species occurs, after removing areas of unsuitable habitat, climate or physical geography (e.g., altitude, bathymetry, hydrology). ESH refers to the extent of habitat available to a species within its range, and thus is a refinement of range that takes additional environmental conditions and habitat information into account. For some species, range may approximate ESH. AOO is a further refinement of range and ESH, and is restricted to the area of suitable habitat that is presently occupied by the species, based on known, inferred and projected occurrences. Known localities are the specific points, defined by latitude and longitude, where a species is known to occur. Inferred/projected occurrences are locations (e.g., grid cells) where the species is inferred/projected to occur. (See Appendix I for complete definitions.) For example, a freshwater invertebrate occurs in shallow sandy habitat in freshwater lakes (Fig. 3.4). A single locality, in a distant lake with no shallow sandy habitat, is assumed to be a vagrant occurrence (perhaps dropped by a bird). All other known localities occur within a single large lake. Additional occurrences are inferred for shallow sandy habitat in the same lake as known localities, and projected for similar habitats in a neighbouring lake without known localities. The range comprises all freshwater lakes with known, inferred, or projected occurrences, and excludes terrestrial areas. The ESH comprises all shallow sandy habitats within the range. The AOO comprises 2 x 2 km grid cells with known, inferred, or projected occurrences. A Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 51 few areas of shallow sandy habitat within the range are currently occupied by voracious predatory fish \u2013 the freshwater invertebrate does not occur in these areas, so they are included in ESH but not in AOO. Figure 3.4 Schematic demonstrating localities, extent of occurrence (EOO), range, ESH and AOO. How can area-based assessment parameters be applied to migratory species? For migratory species, estimates of known localities, AOO, ESH, or range at the global and site levels must be calculated separately for each season, such that percentages of the global population in the site can be inferred for the relevant season or phase in migration. For example, a species will trigger a KBA if the ESH in its breeding range at the site exceeds the threshold percentage of the global ESH in its breeding range. Can area-based assessment parameters be applied to species with spatially dynamic habitats? For species with spatially dynamic habitats, including many pelagic marine species, AOO and ESH are seasonally and interannually variable at both global and site levels. AOO and ESH will not generally provide a reliable basis for inference about the proportion of the global population size at a site in this context, and should not be used.

It may include large areas of unsuitable habitat (including marine areas in the case of terrestrial species and vice versa), and is not used in KBA identification. Where can proposers find data on range? For species that have been assessed for the IUCN Red List, proposers should use the extant range map (code = 1) included in the IUCN Red List account, which will be provided through the WDKBA. If no range map exists, proposers seeking to use range as an assessment parameter should follow the guidance in the IUCN Red List Mapping Standards on developing distribution maps for estimating range.

For species that occur patchily within their range, ESH or AOO may provide better information on the distribution of the global population. When is it important to use consistent range maps for entire taxonomic groups? Consistent range maps are important for identifying restricted-range species within a taxonomic group for Criterion B2. Consistent range maps are also important as a basis for estimating the median range size for a taxonomic group for Criterion B3. However, the median range size can be Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 53 estimated from a representative sample of species, so data on range are not required for the entire taxonomic group. When determining either the proportion of the global population size at the site, or whether a species is restricted to an ecoregion or bioregion, proposers should use the best available data for each individual species (see Section 3.1 on selecting assessment parameters.) This may be ESH rather than range, if ESH is available and provides better information on an individual species\u2019 distribution. 3.6 Extent of suitable habitat (ESH, Criteria A1, B1-3) How is ESH defined? The KBA Standard (IUCN, 2016) defines ESH as: \u201cThe area of potentially suitable ecological conditions, such as vegetation or substrate types within the altitudinal or depth, and temperature and moisture preferences, for a given species (Beresford et al., 2011).\u201d ESH refers to the extent of habitat available to a species within its range and cannot extend beyond the range (Fig. 3.4). ESH is a refinement of range \u2013 for example, a range polygon may be clipped to exclude areas that do not contain suitable habitat, or the range may be converted into grid cells and cells that do not contain suitable habitat may be removed. For some species, range and ESH may be similar. Unlike AOO, ESH may include unoccupied suitable habitat within the species\u2019 range. Note that ESH is directly equivalent to \u201carea of habitat. However, as the term \u201cextent of suitable habitat\u201d is established in the KBA Standard (IUCN, 2016), it is also used in the KBA Guidelines for consistency. Where can proposers find data on ESH? Maps of ESH are available for several taxonomic groups, including birds, mammals, amphibians and some reptiles. Available ESH maps will be provided through the WDKBA. If no ESH map exists, proposers seeking to use ESH as an assessment parameter should follow the guidance in Appendix III to develop an ESH map.

Proposers should avoid using AOO when species are distributed on very fine scales such that the standard 2 x 2 km is likely to significantly overestimate the area of occupied habitat. Number of localities may be a more appropriate assessment parameter in this context. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 55 3.8 Number of localities (Criteria A1, B1-3) How are localities defined and identified? The KBA Standard (IUCN, 2016) defines localities as follows: \u201cA sampling locality is a point indicated by specific coordinates of latitude and longitude. Note that the term \u2018locality\u2019, as defined here, is fundamentally and conceptually different from the term \u2018location\u2019 used in the IUCN Red List (IUCN, 2012a).\u201d Known localities refer to known points of occurrence, and do not include inferred or projected occurrences. For the purposes of KBA identification, old records from areas where the species no longer occurs and vagrancies (i.e. records from areas where the species has only been recorded sporadically and is not known to be native) are excluded from known localities. Where can locality data be found? Sources of locality data include museums, herbaria, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, Global Seabird Tracking Database, Ocean Biogeographic Information System and NatureServe\u2019s National Species Dataset (for the US and Canada). Locality data should be checked by an appropriate species expert to ensure that the taxonomy is up-to-date and erroneous records are removed. How are thresholds applied to locality data? Each locality should represent a discrete population, to the extent this can be inferred, given the degree of habitat fragmentation and what is known about the dispersal capabilities of the species. Observations that clearly represent multiple replicates of the same population should be treated as a single locality. Where the threshold is \u2265 1%, a site qualifies as a KBA if it represents one of 100 or fewer localities; where the threshold is \u2265 20%, a site qualifies as a KBA if it represents one of 5 or fewer localities. Localities may be weighted by estimated population size (e.g., based on the relative size of habitat patches) given that abundance may vary considerably across localities. When is it inappropriate to use number of localities? Generally, number of localities should only be used where there are insufficient data to develop reliable maps of range, ESH or AOO. Locality information is typically most useful for species that occur patchily within suitable habitat or AOO and have been well sampled. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 56 Number of localities should only be used as the basis for KBA identification if sampling intensity has been sufficiently high that the known localities can be assumed to represent adequately the range, ESH and AOO of the species (IUCN, 2016). Locality information should not be used if the only sampling effort has been opportunistic, such that known localities provide a poor representation of the species distribution. The judgement that sampling effort has been adequate should be justified in the documentation. 3.9 Relative density or abundance of mature individuals (Criterion B3) Under subcriterion B3c, \u201cmost important occupied habitat\u201d can be observed or inferred through the following assessment parameters: (i) density of mature individuals. (ii) relative abundance of mature individuals. [Note. The remainder of this section is in preparation and will be included in the next version of the KBA Guidelines.

Identifying Key Biodiversity Areas using ecosystem-based criteria (A2, B4) 4.1 Overview NCGs and/or KBA proposers are encouraged to conduct a comprehensive scoping analysis (Steps 1-4 in Fig. 4.1) to identify potential trigger ecosystem types and potential KBAs in the region of interest for which there are adequate data. Assessing sites against multiple criteria and biodiversity elements will strengthen the robustness of KBAs to changes in the status of particular trigger species. For KBA Criterion A2 (threatened ecosystem types), the first major step in the scoping analysis will be to check whether there are any globally threatened ecosystem types in the region of interest. For KBA Criterion B4 (geographically restricted ecosystem types), the first major step in the scoping analysis will be to identify an appropriate ecosystem classification for the region of interest (see Section 4.2.1). In practice, the process of KBA identification is likely to vary greatly between countries. Some KBA proposers may wish to focus on identifying KBAs for a particular ecosystem type or ascertain whether a particular site qualifies as a KBA under Criterion A2 or B4. In this case, KBA proposers should check the list of globally threatened ecosystem types and consult with the NCG (if one exists) or RFP and the IUCN RLE team to identify an appropriate ecosystem classification in the region of interest (see Section 4.2.1). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 58 Figure 4.1 Overview of possible workflow for applying Criteria A2 and B4. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 59 4.2 Identifying ecosystem types 4.2.1 Ecosystem classification The KBA Standard (IUCN, 2016, pp. 17, 20) states that Criterion A2 and B4 should be applied to ecosystem types \u201cat an intermediate level in a globally consistent ecosystem classification hierarchy\u201d. The IUCN RLE team is currently working to develop a hierarchy for terrestrial, freshwater and marine systems (Table 4.1). In this hierarchy, biogeographic functional ecotypes (Level 4) and ecosystem types (Level 5) are the intermediate levels that may be used for KBA identification. In the meantime, NCGs or KBA proposers should investigate whether some other suitable ecosystem classification exists for the region, in consultation with the IUCN RLE team. If an appropriate ecosystem classification does not yet exist for the region of interest, then NCGs or KBA proposers may consider developing such a classification in consultation with the IUCN RLE team. (Please see the IUCN RLE Guidelines (IUCN, 2017) for further information.) Note that the global geographic distribution of any ecosystem types used for KBA identification must be mapped; for ecosystems that extend beyond national boundaries, for example, a national map is insufficient. Alternatively, NCGs or KBA proposers interested in identifying KBAs using ecosystem-based KBA criteria will need to wait until an appropriate ecosystem classification has been developed for the region of interest. 4.2.2 Local ecosystems As stated in the KBA Standard (IUCN, 2016), the thresholds associated with the ecosystem-based criteria (i.e. both A2 and B4) are designed to be applied at intermediate levels in a globally consistent ecosystem classification hierarchy. Lower level ecosystem types (e.g., local ecosystem types in Table 4.1) cannot trigger global KBAs.

The list of globally threatened ecosystem types that have been assessed for the IUCN RLE (IUCN, 2017) and may trigger KBA Criterion A2 in each country will be provided automatically through the WDKBA when it is fully functional. In the meantime, this information can be found on the IUCN RLE website. How are globally threatened ecosystem types identified for the purposes of applying KBA Criterion A2? Ecosystem types that have been assessed as globally CR or EN or VU using the IUCN RLE Guidelines (IUCN, 2017) can trigger KBA Criterion A2. Given that a relatively small number of the world\u2019s ecosystems have been assessed to date, in many cases, the first step in identifying KBAs under Criterion A2 will be to assess candidate ecosystem types using the IUCN RLE Guidelines (IUCN, 2017). NCGs or KBA proposers interested in assessing ecosystems for the IUCN RLE should consult with the IUCN RLE team. 4.3.2. Ascertain the relevant threshold for each potential trigger ecosystem type given its threat category. A site qualifies as a KBA under Criterion A2 because it holds one or more of the following: a) \u22655% of the global extent of a globally CR or EN ecosystem type; b) \u226510% of the global extent of a globally VU ecosystem type. How is the global extent of an ecosystem type defined? In the context of KBA identification, \u201cextent of an ecosystem type\u201d refers to the current geographic distribution of an ecosystem type, representing all spatial occurrences of an ecosystem type (IUCN, 2017, p. ix). KBA identification is based on geographic distribution maps, not the extent of ecosystem occurrence or the area occupied by the ecosystem (see IUCN, 2017, p. 57 for comparison). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 62 4.3.3 For each potential trigger ecosystem type, compile readily available data on the ecosystem\u2019s global distribution and distribution in the region of interest. Where can proposers find data on the global extent of an ecosystem type? Available information on the extent of globally threatened ecosystem types will be provided through the WDKBA when it is fully functional. In the meantime, available information can be found on the IUCN RLE website. 4.3.4 Overlay boundaries of existing sites on spatial data for each potential trigger ecosystem type. Boundaries of existing sites (e.g., existing KBAs, other sites of importance for biodiversity, protected or conserved areas) can be overlaid on spatial data for each potential trigger ecosystem type in a GIS to generate a table of potential trigger ecosystem types and the existing sites where they might trigger a KBA (i.e. a preliminary version of Table 4.3.6).

Existing or potential sites may be overlaid on an ecosystem map in a GIS to estimate the percentage of the ecosystem type\u2019s global extent that lies within each site\u2019s boundaries.

The final step in assessing a site against KBA Criterion A2 or B4 is to confirm the presence of the potential trigger ecosystem type at the site. How is the presence of an ecosystem at a site confirmed? Most ecosystems are relatively stationary, at least in the 8-12 year time-frame for KBA reassessment. KBA proposers may overlay a validated or peer-reviewed map of the trigger ecosystem type on recent high-resolution satellite imagery to confirm presence of the ecosystem type within the proposed KBA boundaries. In the case of a forest ecosystem type, for example, KBA proposers should confirm that the forest ecosystem type is still present within the KBA and has not been converted to other types of land cover, such as pasture or crops. This can be done using open access tools such as Google Earth. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 64 More subtle distinctions or transformations, such as forest types or the degradation of arid shrublands by overgrazing, may require targeted field-based sampling or other recent documentation. 4.3.8 Refine ecological boundaries, if necessary, to yield practical KBA boundaries. KBA delineation is not complete until ecological boundaries have been evaluated and refined, if necessary, to yield a manageable site or sites (see Section 7.3 for further guidelines). 4.3.9 Compile required and recommended documentation. See the Documentation and Mapping Standards for guidance on required and recommended documentation for Criterion A2 or B4. 4.4 Applying Criterion B4 to identify KBAs for geographically restricted ecosystem types 4.4.1 Identify an appropriate ecosystem classification in the region of interest and the ecosystem types that could trigger Criterion B4 in the region of interest. Once the RLE team has developed a globally consistent ecosystem classification hierarchy, the list of ecosystem types that may trigger Criterion B4 in each country will be provided automatically through the WDKBA. In the meantime, alternative suitable ecosystem classifications may be used for KBA identification. What types of ecosystem classification are appropriate for KBA Criterion B4? See Section 4.2.1.

The definition of geographically restricted given in the KBA Standard (IUCN, 2016) is indicative rather than prescriptive.

Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 66 5. Identifying Key Biodiversity Areas based on ecological integrity (Criterion C) 5.1 Defining ecological integrity How is ecological integrity defined? The KBA Standard defines ecological integrity as \u201cA condition that supports intact species assemblages and ecological processes in their natural state\u201d (IUCN, 2016, p. 12). Intact species assemblages or intact ecological communities have \u201cthe complete complement of species known or expected to occur in a particular site or ecosystem, relative to a regionally appropriate historical benchmark, which will often correspond to pre-industrial times\u201d (IUCN, 2016, p. 13). Ecological processes include species\u2019 natural movement patterns and natural disturbance regimes; their natural state is defined relative to the same regionally appropriate benchmark (see Stoddard et al., 2006 and Woodley, 2010 for a discussion of reference conditions and measurement of ecological integrity). Sites qualifying under Criterion C represent outstanding examples of ecological integrity at the global scale, where all ecosystem components (including highly mobile predators and herbivores and long-lived structural plant species) can still be found fulfilling their functional roles in the ecosystem. Sites qualifying under Criterion C are also characterised by contiguous natural habitat with minimal post-industrial anthropogenic disturbance, and are large enough to maintain their ecological communities through most natural disturbance events and accommodate most broad- scale ecological processes (Janzen, 1986; Newmark et al., 1995; Balmford et al., 1998; Scott et al., 1999; Laurance et al., 2002; Leroux et al., 2007; Woodley, 2010). How is ecological integrity measured? Ecological integrity is a multidimensional concept that is difficult to measure directly. For the purposes of identifying sites qualifying under Criterion C, ecological integrity should be observed or, more likely, inferred from a structured set of evidence based on both: (1) direct measures of species composition and abundance/biomass/density across taxonomic groups (particularly for species indicative of long-term structural stability and functionality or those known to be highly sensitive to human impact); AND Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 67 (2) absence (or very low levels) of direct industrial human impact, as quantified by appropriate indices at the scale of interest and verified on the ground or in the water. Measures of species composition and abundance/biomass/density across taxonomic groups may be based on indicator species (see Section 5.2.3). Absence, or very low levels, of direct industrial human impact does not necessarily imply absence, or even low densities, of human inhabitants. Rather, for a site to qualify as a KBA under Criterion C, human impact must not have eroded ecological integrity (see Section 5.2.1). Some sites with outstanding ecological integrity have been used by indigenous peoples for millennia. Information on additional indicators of ecological integrity (e.g., patch size and fragmentation for forests, coral cover for coral reefs, and water quality for rivers and lakes) may be provided as supporting evidence, but are not a substitute for (1) or (2). Use of such indicators should be accompanied by explanations of why they are relevant as indicators of ecological integrity in the ecoregion in question. 5.2 Applying Criterion C to identify KBAs with outstanding ecological integrity A site qualifies as a KBA under Criterion C because it is \u201cone of \u22642 per ecoregion characterised by wholly intact ecological communities, comprising the composition and abundance of native species and their interactions\u201d (IUCN, 2016, p. 21).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c388bdcc-5e75-4703-b42b-a514d4282a7c": {"__data__": {"id_": "c388bdcc-5e75-4703-b42b-a514d4282a7c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e0e4675b688d111edf985a4ee12bc2283531e323ff6ab79539b439784d0508d4"}, "2": {"node_id": "b75b773e-57ce-4581-b095-191fa3c4c2e5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b65c618d539e8bd25220985697dc2b2242ab55a20e9defce6def4a9e2461b85a"}}, "hash": "b606b15f27c55685d7b49bb508479aacd78b8b6ffbc851a237596370141be0c1", "text": "21). Ecoregions provide the units of analysis for the assessment of Criterion C.

Ecoregions have been mapped for terrestrial (Olson et al., 2001; Dinerstein et al., 2017), freshwater (Abell et al., 2008) and near-shore marine (Spalding et al., 2007) environments and are nested within bioregions or provinces.

Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 68 5.2.1 Conduct a scoping analysis to identify ecoregions with potential for sites that could trigger Criterion C. In many cases, it will be useful to identify Criterion C KBAs through a step-based process, beginning with regional scoping and following with site evaluation and selection within ecoregions (Fig. 5.3). Identification of potential areas of outstanding ecological integrity will usually start with a preliminary scoping analysis to identify ecoregions, or areas within ecoregions, with low levels of industrial human impact using readily available global and/or regional-level \u201chuman footprint\u201d type datasets (e.g., roads and infrastructure). This analysis can then be refined using additional data at the ecoregion level, where available. Assessments of species composition and abundance/biomass/densities will generally be focused on particular sites (see Section 5.2.3). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 69 Figure 5.3 Overview of possible workflow for applying Criterion C. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 70 How is absence (or very low levels) of human impact measured? Understanding the key drivers of change within the ecoregion or across similar ecoregions can help to identify the most appropriate datasets and indicators for identifying areas with low levels of direct anthropogenic disturbance. Some types of infrastructure have different levels of impact in different regions. KBA proposers may develop quantitative indices based on global/regional/ecoregional datasets and analyse the cumulative impacts of these pressures to identify sites with very low levels of direct industrial human impact. Pervasive global-scale threats that affect all marine and/or terrestrial areas (e.g., climate change, ocean acidification, overharvest of cetaceans) should not be included as binary factors in this analysis (i.e. as a simple yes/no layer) but may be included as relative factors (e.g., high/moderate/low impact), as no sites would be identifiable under Criterion C otherwise. In regions where indicators of human impact are similar across adjacent ecoregions, the same indices may serve for multiple ecoregions. But, in other regions, ecoregion- specific indices of human impact may be appropriate, especially where more detailed or up-to-date information is available than in global or regional datasets. For a site to qualify as a KBA under Criterion C, human impact must not have eroded ecological integrity, as characterised by intact ecological communities and ecological processes in their natural state (especially ecological processes characteristic of the region, which the native flora and fauna are adapted to, such as wildfire in boreal forest or flooding patterns in the Amazon basin). 5.2.2 If there are no suitable delineated sites in areas of potential importance, derive initial KBA boundaries using ecological data. Some large existing KBAs and other sites of importance for biodiversity may qualify under Criterion C. (See the WDKBA, Plantlife IPA Database, Ramsar Sites Information Service, and the Protected Planet Database for GIS data on existing sites.) Scoping analysis may also reveal areas of potential importance where there are no existing KBAs, other recognised sites of importance for biodiversity, or protected or conserved areas. In this case, initial boundaries for potential KBAs may be based on ecological considerations (see Section 7.2). These boundaries may need to be refined later to yield practical KBA boundaries (see Section 7.3). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 71 Are there any special considerations for delineating sites under Criterion C? KBAs identified under Criterion C should ideally be delineated to be at least 10,000 km2 in size, within the confines of manageability. Large size is a characteristic of ecological integrity, except on isolated islands with intact ecological communities. KBA size should be sufficient to sustain the life-cycle processes and natural movement patterns of area-demanding species and other species that are sensitive to human disturbance, and to accommodate natural disturbance regimes (see the concept of minimum dynamic area; Pickett & Thompson, 1978; Leroux et al., 2007).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5a77414f-be97-499e-bcb5-e80f9d51971a": {"__data__": {"id_": "5a77414f-be97-499e-bcb5-e80f9d51971a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e60c50559b7f2c02b01f16950327cfbea3263423e3228436cbe1a7ea3c8bfc5b"}, "2": {"node_id": "ed7885cc-e875-4590-af0e-e81412f550bf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cdd9b47e03b01957a108282ad8e830913df20ec99103345258c3fe58ced34492"}}, "hash": "c1944b7aa7b81f558ea9408897a6597703411dfc85f5c6faf250aa8f516d1f85", "text": "Criterion C KBAs should be large enough to be resilient to edge effects where appropriate and delineation should minimise the edge:area ratio to the extent possible.

A site qualifies as a KBA under Criterion C because it is \u201cone of \u22642 per ecoregion characterised by wholly intact ecological communities, comprising the composition and abundance of native species and their interactions\u201d (IUCN, 2016, p. 21). How can areas with intact ecological communities be identified? An ecological community is a complex of native plants, animals and other organisms that interact together within an ecosystem (Smith, 1992). Ecological communities are complex and constantly changing due to both natural processes and anthropogenic changes, compounded by climate change. Intactness must be evaluated in this context. Assessments of species composition and abundance/biomass/densities are essential for the identification of sites under Criterion C. Nevertheless, it is recognised that comprehensive assessments will be impractical in many areas with high ecological integrity, especially in remote ecoregions with few human settlements and limited road access. Ecological assessments may therefore be focused on a set of species Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 72 indicative of intact ecological communities. The set of indicator species should include species indicative of long-term structural stability and functionality (e.g., top predators, other keystone and foundation species; Paine, 1969; Dayton, 1972; and species sensitive to broad scale ecological processes such as fire, flood, grazing and predation; Carignan & Villard, 2002), area-demanding species (e.g., low density and highly mobile species; Boyd et al., 2008; Didier et al., 2009), species that are sensitive to human impact (e.g., all large hunted and harvested species; Redford, 1992; Thiollay, 1992), and species that indicate ecological condition (e.g., limnic invertebrates that indicate water quality; Karr, 1981). The set of indicator species must be accompanied by a documented justification of why such species are appropriate and sufficient to infer intactness of ecological communities. It is important to note that species richness is not a surrogate for ecological integrity. A Criterion C site should contain designated indicator species at ecologically functional densities (Soul\u00e9 et al., 2003). A simple presence/absence assessment against a list of expected species at the site is not adequate for assessing ecological integrity, as species may be present at levels well below ecologically functional densities (Soul\u00e9 et al., 2003). Given that natural ecosystems are dynamic, assessments of ecological integrity should take into account the expected range of variability in ecosystem composition, structure, and function under natural environmental conditions and phases of natural disturbance (e.g., a site in a fire-adapted ecosystem should not be excluded because it has relatively few fire-intolerant seedlings immediately following a natural fire). If an indicator species has been extirpated through overexploitation, invasive alien species, or disease but the required habitat/ ecosystem conditions still exist at the site, such that the species would be expected to thrive if reintroduced and threats addressed, then the site would not qualify as a Criterion C site now but would have the potential to qualify under Criterion C in the future. In addition, assessments of ecological integrity should investigate the occurrence of invasive alien species and other species associated with anthropogenic disturbance, as these species may indicate a loss of ecological integrity. 5.2.4 In ecoregions with more than two sites that could trigger Criterion C, use comparative analysis of ecological integrity to support site selection.

(iii) Global biodiversity: Other factors relating to the importance for the global persistence of biodiversity may also be taken into consideration (for example, some sites may support greater diversity of intact ecological communities than others; sites that encompass elevational gradients may facilitate species range shifts in response to climate change; Elsen et al., 2018), but are not a substitute for ecological integrity. (iv) Manageability: As with all KBAs, sites qualifying under Criterion C should be manageable as a unit (see Section 7.3 on delineation). The spatial relationship to existing KBAs should also be taken into consideration, bearing in mind that KBAs boundaries may need to be resolved to avoid overlap. 5.2.5 Conduct site evaluation of existing/potential sites to confirm ecological integrity. Site evaluation should be conducted prior to proposing any site as a KBA to confirm the presence of intact ecological communities by reviewing recent data or conducting new field surveys if necessary. For Criterion C, KBA proposers should verify information gained from remotely sensed datasets, as well as information that cannot be inferred from remotely sensed data, such as overexploitation, presence of invasive alien species, and water quality. Evidence may come from workshops or interviews with biodiversity knowledge-holders, including taxonomic experts, biologists, and Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 74 holders of Indigenous and local Knowledge (ILK, see below and Section 8.1), recently collected data, or new field surveys. If assessments of species composition and abundance/ biomass/ densities are based on field surveys that may be out-of-date, site evaluation should include interviews with local knowledge-holders and/or new field surveys. (No specific time limit is proposed here given that sites that might qualify under Criterion C are generally remote and difficult to survey.) Interviews and field surveys may be conducted by local experts other than the KBA proposer, but must be documented (see Section 9.2 on data quality). In ecoregions with more than two candidate sites, site evaluation should be designed to support comparative analysis of ecological integrity based on consistent parameters across candidate sites (see Section 5.3.4). What is the role of Indigenous and Local Knowledge (ILK) in site evaluation ? Many sites that may qualify as KBAs under Criterion C will coincide with indigenous territories and local communities, and Indigenous and Local Knowledge (ILK) will play an important role in all aspects of site evaluation and delineation in this context. For example, ILK can be applied in assessing species composition, abundance and distribution, and in discovering the extent of natural resource use and exploitation over time. Note that any KBA proposal based on data derived from previously unpublished ILK should be flagged during the submission process (see the Guidance on the process of Proposing, Reviewing, Nominating and Confirming Key Biodiversity Areas). Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) is required prior to the publication or display of previously unpublished ILK. (See Section 8.1 for further guidelines). 5.2.6 Refine ecological boundaries, if necessary, to yield practical KBA boundaries. KBA delineation is not complete until ecological boundaries have been evaluated and refined, if necessary, to yield a manageable site or sites (see Section 7.3 for further guidelines).

Delineation is an iterative process that typically involves assembling spatial datasets (Section 7.1), mapping the distribution of trigger biodiversity elements and deriving initial boundaries based on ecological data (Section 7.2), refining ecological boundaries to yield practical KBA boundaries (Section 7.3), and documenting delineation (see the Documentation and Mapping Standards). Stakeholder consultation and involvement is an essential element of the delineation process (see Section 8 for detailed guidelines). In particular, consultation with a range of knowledge holders is recommended when assembling spatial datasets, mapping the distributions of biodiversity elements, delineating ecological boundaries, and refining ecological boundaries if necessary to yield practical KBA boundaries (Section 8.1). Consensus-building with proposers of existing KBAs (including AZE sites, IBAs and KBAs identified under previous initiatives) is required before any existing KBA boundaries are modified and to avoid overlapping KBAs (Section 8.2). Involvement of customary rights-holders is recommended and involvement of legal rights-holders is encouraged during the delineation process (Section 8.3). Once KBA identification and delineation are complete, additional consultation and involvement will generally be required before advancing any form of conservation or management action that might affect indigenous peoples or other natural resource dependent communities (Section 8.4). Is there a minimum or maximum size requirement for a KBA? There is no absolute minimum or maximum size requirement for a KBA. The size of a KBA will depend on the ecological requirements of the biodiversity elements triggering the criteria, and consideration of site manageability (see Section 7.3). The size distribution of existing protected or conserved areas may provide some guidance on the practical scale of management in each region. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 77 Sites identified under Criterion C are likely to be larger on average than sites identified under other KBA criteria, as are those in the open ocean compared with ones on land (see Section 5.3.2). Why do KBAs need to be manageable as a unit and what does this mean? The KBA Standard defines \u201csite\u201d as: \u201cA geographical area on land and/or in water with defined ecological, physical, administrative or management boundaries that is actually or potentially manageable as a single unit (e.g., a protected area or other managed conservation unit)\u2026\u201d (IUCN, 2016, p. 7). The KBA Standard defines \u201cmanageability\u201d as: \u201cThe possibility of some type of effective management across the site. Being a manageable site implies that it is possible to implement actions locally to ensure the persistence of the biodiversity elements for which a KBA has been identified. This requires that KBA delineation consider relevant aspects of the socio-economic context of the site (e.g., land tenure, political boundaries) in addition to the ecological and physical aspects of the site (e.g., habitat, size, connectivity) \u2026\u201d (IUCN, 2016, p. 13). Taking site manageability into account during delineation will enhance the prospects for biodiversity persistence because conservation actions are more likely to be undertaken. However, the process of KBA identification and delineation does not include steps to advance management activity and does not imply that any specific form of conservation action, such as protected area designation, is required (IUCN, 2016, p. 8). A KBA should be a manageable unit, but does not need to be a single management unit. Rather, there needs to be scope for effective management across the site. For example, a site that comprises several different ownership or management units (e.g. a protected area and adjacent private reserve) may be proposed as a single KBA if management can be coordinated across the site. Where a proposed KBA comprises multiple management units, KBA proposers should make the case that there is scope for some type of effective management across the site to support the persistence of trigger biodiversity elements. (See the Documentation and Mapping Standards for guidance on documentation). Can the boundaries of KBAs overlap one another? KBA boundaries should not overlap. KBAs with clear, non-overlapping boundaries are much easier to communicate to end-users than a set of overlapping sites that are important for different biodiversity elements and meet different KBA criteria.

(See Resolving complex boundary overlaps for further guidance.) Can KBAs have dynamic boundaries? KBAs should have fixed boundaries because sites displayed in the WDKBA must be stable. Where dynamic features are important, as for many marine species and freshwater/terrestrial species that depend on dynamic or ephemeral habitats, KBAs should be large enough to encompass those features, as long as there is scope for effective management at that scale. KBAs that support trigger biodiversity elements seasonally (e.g., KBAs that support seasonal aggregations under Criterion D1) are also displayed with fixed boundaries in the WDKBA. 7.1 Assembling spatial datasets What types of spatial datasets are useful for KBA delineation? A range of different types of data may be useful for KBA delineation (see Table 7.1 for examples). Data layers should be of an appropriate resolution to form the basis for delineating manageable KBAs. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 79 Table 7.1 Spatial datasets that may be useful for KBA delineation Ecological datasets Species data: \u2022 locality data, including information on localities known to be important for specific life-cycle processes (e.g., breeding or moulting) or as ecological refugia (e.g., deep pools in rivers); \u2022 tracking and movement data, including information on migratory bottlenecks; \u2022 validated habitat maps (see Appendix III.4). Ecosystem data: \u2022 topographic data (e.g., elevation, bathymetry, slope, sub-catchments, ridges, rivers, seamounts, outer reef passages); \u2022 boundaries of land cover and benthic habitat classes; \u2022 ecosystem type boundaries; \u2022 ecoregion and bioregion boundaries. Existing sites of biodiversity importance: \u2022 boundaries of any existing KBAs (e.g., AZE sites, IBAs and KBAs identified under previous criteria); \u2022 boundaries of other sites of biodiversity importance (e.g., IPAs, Important Marine Mammal Areas (IMMAs)) and designated biodiversity conservation sites (e.g., natural World Heritage sites, Ramsar sites, EBSAs). Socio-economic datasets Management data: \u2022 customary indigenous and community lands (both informal and formally recognised); \u2022 other management units (e.g., private lands and concessions); \u2022 other protected or conserved areas; \u2022 administrative boundaries. Human use data: \u2022 human use areas (e.g., such as agricultural areas, fishing areas); \u2022 infrastructure, including cities, ports, roads, shipping lanes. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 80 7.2 Deriving initial KBA boundaries based on ecological data The boundaries of a KBA should always be based on ecological considerations, with adjustments for manageability as required. 7.2.1 Distribution maps for individual KBA trigger biodiversity elements Separate distribution maps are not necessary for biodiversity elements that align with existing KBA boundaries (section 7.3.1) or the boundaries of other sites of biodiversity importance (section 7.3.2). This may well be the case where existing sites encompass remaining areas of natural habitat. However, distribution maps of biodiversity elements are a useful starting point for delineation where there are no existing sites in the area of interest, or biodiversity elements overlap with existing sites but do not align with their boundaries. For well sampled KBA trigger biodiversity elements, it may be possible to derive distribution maps that represent the known local geographic extent from observed locality data. In contrast, for elements with relatively few sampling localities, it may be necessary to infer the approximate geographic extent using knowledge of habitat requirements combined with maps of remaining habitat or by using habitat models. Distribution maps should contain enough of each trigger biodiversity element to meet KBA thresholds. For trigger biodiversity elements that do not occupy a whole KBA, maps showing their distribution within the KBA should be submitted with the KBA proposal, where possible, to support monitoring, potential targeted management actions and possible re-delineation in the future. These will be visible in the WDKBA when it is fully functional. 7.2.2 Deriving initial KBA boundaries based on ecological data Where there is no existing site, initial KBA boundaries can be derived that encompass the distribution of overlapping trigger biodiversity elements.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1a983dee-6a42-449a-af84-2436aea3cec9": {"__data__": {"id_": "1a983dee-6a42-449a-af84-2436aea3cec9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ae075f04615de2366f375165f5b66a5b925216ee525948c83c90cf5dbeea273f"}, "2": {"node_id": "3cd75044-f17b-4d26-8faf-15c79c859a66", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fb4eb45811b62a448e0ed7275204252d434a8bed7fec45a88f3bbb1474402448"}}, "hash": "0ceae6c8ea7e259e34107fde5342e83804ee9c54db9286e73e79378bb5a789d8", "text": "These initial KBA boundaries should generally be delineated so that the area contained within them is distinct from surrounding areas in terms of importance for the trigger biodiversity elements or habitat, while minimising the inclusion of land or water that is not relevant to the trigger biodiversity elements.

Does the area contained within a KBA need to support a minimum viable population of each trigger species? No. Populations of trigger species within KBAs may form part of a larger meta- population and so do not need to be self-sustaining. The area contained within ecological boundaries needs to meet the relevant KBA thresholds, including the threshold number of reproductive units (if applicable). It should be sufficient to sustain the threshold population size and number of reproductive units during the relevant seasons of the annual life-cycle (e.g., year-round for resident species and seasonally for migratory species), although it is recognised that this information will be unavailable for many species. How can ecological boundaries be defined in wilderness areas? KBA delineation may be challenging in areas of continuous habitat, such as wilderness areas (Upgren et al., 2009). Data on species distributions are often lacking and data on remaining habitat may be of limited use because much of the habitat still remains. Over the long-term, the best approach may be to generate predictive maps of species distributions through habitat modelling, validated by additional surveys (see Section 3.11). In the meantime, topographic and environmental data such as elevation, bathymetry, ridgelines, seamounts, geological features and other identifiable elements of the land/seascape may be used to delineate provisional ecological boundaries that can be refined using additional data to yield practical KBA boundaries (see Section 7.3.3). 7.3 Refining ecological boundaries to yield practical KBA boundaries KBA delineation is not complete until ecological boundaries are evaluated for their manageability and refined, if necessary, to yield a manageable site or sites. Initial ecological boundaries based on the trigger biodiversity element should be retained for future reference, even if they do not become the final KBA delineated boundary. Refining ecological boundaries to yield practical KBA boundaries will generally involve additional information (e.g., on land/resource tenure considerations) as well as stakeholder input. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 82 Once practical KBA boundaries have been delineated, KBA proposers should check that these contain enough of each KBA trigger biodiversity element to meet relevant KBA thresholds. 7.3.1 Refining boundaries with respect to existing KBAs KBA delineation must take into account the boundaries of existing KBAs (including AZE sites, IBAs and KBAs identified under previous criteria). Many of these sites have national recognition, active conservation and monitoring initiatives and/or are linked to legislative and policy processes. This provides an opportunity for reassessment of existing KBAs for the original trigger biodiversity elements (especially if these have not yet been assessed based on the KBA Standard) and a review of manageability. Any reassessment should involve consensus-building with proposers of the existing KBA(s). The boundaries of an existing global KBA may not be modified in such a way that the site no longer qualifies as a KBA for its original trigger biodiversity element(s). See Figure 7.3.1 for an overview. Delineation with respect to other sites of biodiversity importance and to protected or conserved areas is treated separately (see Section 7.3.2).

What if ecological boundaries for new KBA trigger biodiversity elements extend beyond the boundaries of an existing KBA? Where KBA trigger biodiversity elements extend beyond the boundaries of an existing KBA, the options are as follows: \u2022 The additional area may be disregarded if it is not important for the persistence of the KBA trigger biodiversity element(s) at the site and the KBA trigger biodiversity element(s) will still meet relevant KBA thresholds if the existing boundary is adopted (Fig. 7.3.1.2a). Data on the new trigger biodiversity element(s) should be added to the existing KBA\u2019s qualifying data. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 85 \u2022 The existing KBA boundary may be modified (Fig. 7.3.1.2b) based on consensus- building and agreement with the proposers of the existing KBA (see Section 8.2), and within the confines of manageability. The data on the new trigger biodiversity element(s) should be added to the existing KBA\u2019s qualifying data. If the change in boundary affects existing KBA trigger biodiversity elements (for example, it increases the population of a potential trigger species or extent of an ecosystem type contained within the KBA), this information also needs to be updated. \u2022 If the proposers of the existing KBA are unwilling to modify its boundary (for example, because the site is linked to legislative or policy processes, or would no longer be a manageable unit) and the additional area is important for the persistence of the new KBA trigger biodiversity element(s), a new adjacent KBA may be delineated as long as it qualifies independently as a KBA (Fig. 7.3.1.2c). Information on biodiversity within the existing KBA boundary should also be updated. If proposers of the existing KBA are unwilling to modify its boundary and the additional area does not qualify independently, KBA proposers should seek advice from the NCG or RFP (in that order). The choice between these options will depend on the ecological significance of the areas outside the existing KBA for relevant biodiversity elements, the scale of manageability, and consensus-building with proposers of the existing KBA (see Section 8 on stakeholder consultation and involvement, and Resolving complex boundary overlaps for further guidance). The case for modifying the existing site will generally be stronger if trigger species periodically move between the existing KBA and the additional area, such that coordinated management is required to ensure their persistence. Figure 7.3.1.2 Ecological boundaries for biodiversity elements extend beyond the boundaries of an existing KBA: (a) additional area is ecologically insignificant; (b) boundary of existing KBA is modified to encompass the ecological boundaries of additional biodiversity elements; (c) a new KBA is proposed adjacent to the existing KBA.

Like KBAs, sites of biodiversity importance identified using other criteria or processes often have national or local recognition, active conservation and monitoring initiatives, and may be linked to legislative and policy processes; and most protected or conserved areas are recognised management units with the goal of safeguarding the biodiversity contained within them.

In some cases, management units may be too large to be useful (e.g., state/ provincial boundaries or EEZs) or may not exist (e.g., in wilderness areas or on the high seas, Fig. 7.3.3.1e).

In many cases, freshwater biodiversity elements fall within or align with the boundaries of existing KBAs identified for terrestrial biodiversity. In some cases, however, the boundaries of existing terrestrial KBAs are inappropriate for delineating KBAs for freshwater biodiversity. For example, boundaries that follow rivers may exclude some or all of the area important for freshwater trigger biodiversity elements. Where freshwater biodiversity elements overlap with an existing KBA, KBA proposers should follow the guidelines in Section 7.3.1. Where freshwater biodiversity elements overlap with other sites of biodiversity importance, or protected or conserved areas, KBA proposers should follow the guidelines in Section 7.3.2. What if ecological boundaries for single biodiversity elements extend to the landscape or seascape scale? For some biodiversity elements, especially area-demanding species that occur at low densities across large areas of contiguous habitat, it may not be possible to delineate manageable sites that encompass a sufficient quantity to meet a KBA threshold. These biodiversity elements may depend primarily on conservation actions at the land-, water- or seascape scale rather than the site scale of KBAs (Boyd et al., 2008; IUCN, 2016, p. 4). What if overlapping biodiversity elements extend to the landscape or seascape scale? In some cases, distribution maps for different biodiversity elements yield multiple polygons that overlap in such a way that ecological boundaries surrounding them extend to the land- or seascape scale (i.e. beyond the scale that is manageable as a unit, Fig. 7.3.4.2). In this case, delineation may involve parsing the different biodiversity elements into sites that are manageable in scale. The decision on whether to combine or separate management units into one or more KBAs will depend on whether ecological boundaries for some biodiversity elements align with management boundaries, whether management units qualify independently as KBAs, and the scope for effective management across management units. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 93 Figure 7.3.4.2 Ecological boundaries overlap and extend to the landscape or seascape scale. Management units are shown as irregular shapes with a dashed boundary; ecological boundaries are shown as ovals; proposed KBAs are shown as hatched areas. What about transboundary areas? Transboundary areas are an extreme example of sites where ecological boundaries extend over multiple management units (Fig. 7.3.3.1), and the principles are the same: \u2022 If the area within each country would qualify independently as a KBA, then identifying separate KBAs in each country will most likely align with the practical division of management responsibilities and implementation. \u2022 If the area within either country is ecologically significant (i.e. essential for the persistence of trigger biodiversity elements) but would not qualify independently as a KBA, and there is scope for effective management across the transboundary site, then a KBA may be delineated across the international boundary. \u2022 If the area within either country is ecologically significant (i.e.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "31943ac9-05de-41a4-89b2-024f42839402": {"__data__": {"id_": "31943ac9-05de-41a4-89b2-024f42839402", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c60b2751836112594bcfd77e38467c58b2d741f4d6a0537a1122fff35fc62e13"}, "2": {"node_id": "f762c561-df65-4bd4-a616-21aae6c1879d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6cbc0a9194dfe4c1c16db793c14cbb5a67c1755d8643683df405539c0e487e0c"}}, "hash": "a8374a0bcd31b2cfedc8fc240d9c98127cb4725c893baf7d13513613db819b34", "text": "\u2022 If the area within either country is ecologically significant (i.e. essential for the persistence of trigger biodiversity elements) but would not qualify independently as a KBA, and realistically there is no scope for effective management across the transboundary site, the area may meet thresholds for national or regional significance, once these thresholds have been developed.

Stakeholder consultation and involvement The purpose of this section is to set out the stakeholder consultation and involvement that is required or recommended during the KBA identification and delineation process prior to publishing details of a confirmed KBA through the WDKBA, consistent with the KBA Standard. The process of KBA identification and delineation by itself does not include steps to advance management activity. According to the KBA Standard, \u201cKBAs are sites of importance for the global persistence of biodiversity. However, this does not imply that any specific conservation action, such as protected area designation, is required. Such management decisions should be based on [subsequent] conservation priority- setting exercises, which combine data on biodiversity importance with the available information on site vulnerability and the management actions needed to safeguard the biodiversity for which the site is important\u201d (IUCN, 2016, p. 8). The KBA Guidelines on stakeholder consultation and involvement relate solely to the KBA identification and delineation process, and do not cover steps to advance management activity (but see Section 8.4 for some relevant policies). For the purposes of KBA identification and delineation, we define key terms as follows: \u2022 Rights-holder: has legal or customary tenure or use rights over land/water/resources within a proposed or confirmed KBA; \u2022 Stakeholder: may affect or may be affected by the outcome of the KBA identification and delineation process; all rights-holders are stakeholders, but not all stakeholders are rights-holders; \u2022 Consultation: sharing information and seeking input; \u2022 Involvement: working with stakeholders to ensure their concerns and aspirations are understood, considered, and reflected in the alternatives developed; \u2022 Collaboration and consensus-building: extends beyond consultation and involvement to building consensus and seeking agreement, where possible. Stakeholder consultation and involvement are important at various stages of the KBA identification and delineation process, as summarised in Table 8.1. Three types of stakeholder consultation or involvement are considered here \u2013 these may take place simultaneously, especially if the same individuals or organisations are involved: \u2022 consultation with knowledge-holders (Section 8.1); Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 96 \u2022 consensus-building with proposers of existing KBAs in the area of interest (Section 8.2); \u2022 involvement of customary rights-holders (Section 8.3). A brief final section (Section 8.4) addresses the statement in the KBA Standard: \u201cAs the extent to which KBA boundaries inform active management increases, more extensive consultation will be needed, for example with local and indigenous communities living in or near the site.\u201d (IUCN, 2016, p. 26) Table 8.1 Stakeholder consultation and involvement Who?

additional trigger biodiversity elements or criteria without overlapping the existing KBA, then the KBA proposer should involve the NCG, RFP or KBA Secretariat (in that order) to try to find a mutually acceptable solution. If this process fails, then one or both parties may submit an Appeal to the KBA Standards and Appeals Committee for a final binding decision. 5 While KBA identification and delineation do not include steps to advance active management, these rows are included here for consistency with the KBA Standard which states that \u201cAs the extent to which KBA boundaries inform active management increases, more extensive consultation will be needed, for example with indigenous and local communities living in or near the site\u201d (IUCN, 2016, p. 26), as well as the Guidelines on Business and KBAs. These rows are shown in grey as a reminder that active management occurs after KBA identification and delineation and therefore falls beyond the remit of the KBA Standard and KBA Guidelines. NCGs are expected to play an important role in facilitating stakeholder consultation and involvement at the national level, and are encouraged to build good relationships with biodiversity knowledge-holders, socio-economic and cultural knowledge- holders and national organisations representing diverse sectors of society, including indigenous peoples, local communities and resource users (e.g., forest-dependent peoples, farmers, pastoralists, fishers), and relevant government agencies. 8.1 Consultation with knowledge-holders KBA proposers are encouraged to consult with a range of local knowledge-holders to share knowledge during KBA identification and delineation. In particular: \u2022 It is recommended that KBA proposers invite biodiversity knowledge-holders (including taxonomic experts, biologists, and holders of ILK to contribute their knowledge of the occurrence and distribution of biodiversity elements relevant to KBA identification and delineation. In many cases, it will not be possible to identify a KBA without this knowledge. \u2022 It is recommended that KBA proposers invite local tenure and resource management knowledge-holders (including social scientists and holders of ILK) to share their knowledge of local legal and customary tenure and resource management systems and other information relevant to the delineation of practical KBA boundaries. KBA proposers are encouraged to contact relevant individuals and organisations directly. This may be supplemented by online consultation, where appropriate, but in many cases online consultation will not be an effective substitute for a direct approach. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 98 What is the role of Indigenous and Local Knowledge (ILK) in KBA identification and delineation? Integrating ILK can improve KBA identification and delineation by ensuring that these are informed by the best available information, including information on species abundance and distribution patterns. In many cases, a biodiversity element\u2019s range may fall wholly or mostly within the territory of an indigenous or local community; in others, ILK may need to be interpreted in the broader context of the species' or ecosystem\u2019s overall distribution. ILK can also play an important role in KBA delineation by ensuring that this is informed by the best available information on customary tenure and resource management systems. Accessing ILK can be complex and will require different approaches in different communities. It is generally advisable to approach the leadership of the community first before going directly to particular knowledge holders. This should be done with an understanding of the community's cultural practices, language(s) and traditions, in order to ensure any approach to an ILK knowledge holder is done in a respectful, culturally appropriate manner, recognising they are equal partners in the information- sharing process. It is generally important to build trust with knowledge holders, be open and transparent about how the information will be used, and consider issues relating to ownership of the information and permission to use the information (see below).

FPIC should therefore be sought prior to the publication or display of previously unpublished information regarding sacred natural sites. The location of sacred natural sites may not be widely known \u2013 it is therefore strongly recommended that KBA proposers involve relevant ILK-holders, especially when working in regions Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 99 where sacred natural sites may occur, to avoid publicly revealing information on sacred natural sites inadvertently. How is consultation with knowledge-holders documented? Any consultation with knowledge-holders during the KBA identification and delineation process should be documented. This is especially important if FPIC is required. 8.2 Consensus-building with proposers of existing KBAs Consensus-building with proposers of existing KBAs (including AZE sites, IBAs and KBAs identified under previous initiatives) is required before any existing KBA boundaries are modified to account for additional biodiversity elements or additional criteria (see Section 7.3.1). As outlined in the KBA Standard (IUCN 2016, p. 28), the aim is to avoid KBA boundaries that overlap with each other. KBA proposers are also encouraged to consult with proposers and managers of existing KBAs in the area of interest, even if there is no proposed modification to the boundaries, as proposers and managers of existing KBAs may well have relevant information on the occurrence and distribution of biodiversity elements, and managers should be informed of any new KBA trigger biodiversity elements identified for the site. What happens if proposers of existing KBAs in the area of interest cannot be contacted or do not respond? KBA proposers are required to make a genuine attempt to build consensus with proposers of existing KBAs that may overlap with newly proposed KBAs. If efforts to contact proposers of existing KBAs directly are unsuccessful, then KBA proposers should involve the NCG or RFP (in that order). What happens if proposers of existing KBAs in the area of interest are unwilling to modify them to accommodate additional trigger biodiversity elements or criteria? If proposers of existing KBAs are unwilling to modify site boundaries so that it is not possible to delineate KBAs for additional KBA trigger biodiversity elements or additional criteria without overlapping an existing KBA, then KBA proposers should involve the NCG, RFP or KBA Secretariat (in that order) to try to find a mutually acceptable solution. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 100 How is consensus-building with proposers of existing KBAs documented? KBA proposers should provide text briefly summarising the process and outcomes of consensus-building with proposers of any existing KBAs that may overlap with a newly proposed KBA when submitting a KBA proposal (see the Documentation and Mapping Standards). This text should provide enough information for independent reviewers, the NCG, RFP and the KBA Secretariat to understand and assess the decision and rationale. 8.3 Involvement of customary rights-holders The process of KBA identification and delineation does not directly affect the customary or legal ownership/management/use rights of any rights-holders because KBA identification and delineation does not include any steps to advance management activity. Nonetheless, involvement of customary rights-holders is recommended during the KBA identification and delineation process because KBAs can provide the basis for future conservation and management actions. Customary rights-holders need to be in a position to shape and anticipate this momentum early on, so they can be involved as they wish in decision-making about future management activities. This is especially important in situations where customary rights do not have legal backing and/or indigenous or other natural resource-dependent communities are typically marginalised in decision-making processes.

Here, we note that the IUCN Policy on Conservation and Human Rights for Sustainable Development includes the guiding principle that Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) is required when IUCN projects, activities, and/or initiatives take place on indigenous peoples\u2019 lands and territories and/or impact natural and cultural resources, sites, assets etc. More specifically, the IUCN Standard on Indigenous Peoples includes the following principle: \u201cIndigenous peoples are consulted and are active and effective participants in decision-making processes relevant to them and related to conservation activities supported by IUCN. Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) is obtained for any intervention affecting their rights and access to their lands, territories, waters and resources.\u201d More generally, there is a responsibility to involve any natural resource-dependent communities, including forest-dependent peoples, farmers, pastoralists and fishers, when considering conservation or management actions that might affect their rights. The Guidelines on Business and KBAs include the following recommendation: \u201cThe establishment of an inclusive and transparent stakeholder and right-holder engagement process (including, for example, representatives of national, regional, and local government; Indigenous peoples; local communities; and other elements of civil society) in planning and decision making is recommended. International best practices for stakeholder and right-holder engagement, including a rights-based approach and Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) for engaging with indigenous and traditional peoples and local communities, are implemented as early as possible in the project cycle and follow recognised best practices.\u201d Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 102 9. Data availability, quality and uncertainty The KBA Standard (IUCN, 2016, p. 5) states: \u201cThe KBA criteria have quantitative thresholds to ensure that site identification is transparent, objective and repeatable. It is important to compile the best available data for KBA identification, but the availability of high quality data differs significantly between different taxonomic groups\u2026\u201d The KBA Standard (IUCN, 2016, p. 7) states that: the data used to support KBA identification and delineation \u201c\u2026must be traceable to a reliable source and be recent enough to give confidence that the biodiversity elements are still present given the history of land use [and other types of] change in an area.\u201d 9.1 Data availability Do data used in KBA identification and delineation need to be published? All data used to observe or infer the proportion of the global population size or ecosystem extent at a site, or the ecological integrity of a site, must be referenced to a publication that is available in the public domain, be publicly available (e.g., in the WDKBA or through a free data-archiving service, such as the Dryad Digital Repository), or be made available on request. In the case of area-based assessment parameters, such as range, ESH, or AOO that are not derived from the IUCN Red List account and have not been published previously, KBA proposers should document how these parameters were estimated so that the method can be reviewed. Global values of some assessment parameters will be included in the WDKBA (see the Guidance on the process of Proposing, Reviewing, Nominating and Confirming Key Biodiversity Areas). KBA proposers are responsible for ensuring that data used to estimate site-level values of assessment parameters are referenced to a publication, are publicly available, or are made available on request. In the latter case, a brief description of the data and data source and contact details for the data-holder should be included in the KBA proposal; this information can then be cited as in litt.

It is recommended that KBA proposers do not include sensitive location data in KBA proposals. If a site only qualifies as a KBA based on sensitive data, KBA proposers may consult the NCG, RFP or KBA Secretariat (in that order). 9.2 Data quality 9.2.1 Observing and inferring the proportion of the global population size at a site For some of the species-based criteria (i.e. A1, B1-3), the proportion of the global population size at a site may be observed or inferred based on one or more assessment parameters. For D1-3, the proportion of the global population size at a site may be observed based on the number of mature individuals. How can the proportion of the global population size at the site be \u201cobserved\u201d? The population size at a site may be observed from well documented recent direct observations of mature individuals (e.g., the number of sea lion females observed nursing sea lion pups at a site). This may be based on counts of all mature individuals at a site or on counts of mature individuals in sampling areas (e.g., points, transects, quadrats) together with statistical assumptions about sampling (e.g., point sampling, distance sampling). Animal tracking data collected using geolocators with high location accuracy (e.g., GPS) are considered equivalent to direct observations. Any statistical assumptions regarding the representativeness of sampling or detectability should be justified in the documentation. (Note that the definition of \u201cobserved\u201d here is similar to the definition of \u201cestimated\u201d in the IUCN Red List Guidelines (IUCN SPSC 2017; Section 3.1); \u201cestimated\u201d is not used in the KBA Standard, except in the definition of mature individuals.) Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 104 How can the proportion of the global population size at the site be \u201cinferred\u201d? The proportion of the global population size at a site may be inferred based on indirect evidence, such as indices of the relative abundance of mature individuals (e.g., the number of sea lion pups at a site may serve as an index of the abundance of mature individuals), or using the area-based assessment parameters (e.g., AOO, ESH, range, or number of localities), as indicated for each criterion in the KBA Standard. Inference is generally based on biological assumptions about the relationship between observed variables (e.g., sea lion pups) or modelled output (e.g., ESH) and the variable of interest (i.e. number of mature individuals). Animal tracks may be inferred from analysis of data from low-accuracy geolocators (e.g., light-level loggers). Any biological or statistical assumptions should be justified in the documentation. How recent do data need to be when used to observe or infer the proportion of the global population size or ecosystem extent at a site, or ecological integrity? Estimates of abundance and distribution are likely to become less accurate over time. Data that were collected more than 8-12 years before the assessment should be used cautiously and only if there is no information suggesting that there has been significant relevant change in global or site-level population size or distribution patterns (i.e. a change likely to affect KBA qualification or delineation). Thus, for example, older data may be acceptable in a remote wilderness area that has seen little change in the last 50 years, but not in one that has seen recent extensive habitat transformation, or where trigger species may have suffered significant decline due to disease, invasive species, or over-exploitation etc. See Section 9.2.3 below for confirmation of presence. 9.2.2 Known, inferred and projected occurrences Range is defined as the current known limits of distribution of a species, accounting for all known, inferred or projected sites of occurrence (IUCN 2012a).

Note that inferred occurrences may be used to estimate the proportion of the global population size found at a site, but a KBA must include at least one known locality (i.e. confirmed presence). What are \u201cprojected sites of occurrence\u201d? \u201cProjected\u201d refers to spatially predicted occurrences based on habitat maps or models (IUCN SPSC, 2017, Section 4.10.7). Any projected occurrences beyond the spatial extent of known localities (as defined by a minimum convex polygon based on known localities) should have very high likelihood of presence, based on known localities and the species\u2019 dispersal capability. When used to estimate AOO, projected occurrences are subject to the three conditions outlined in Appendix III.4. Note that projected occurrences may be used to estimate the proportion of the global population size found at a site, but a KBA must include at least one known locality (i.e. confirmed presence). 9.2.3 Confirmation of presence What types of data can be used to confirm species presence? Confirmation of species presence should, ideally, be based on direct observations of mature individuals. Animal tracking data collected using geolocators with high location accuracy (e.g., GPS) are considered equivalent to direct observations. For highly cryptic species, indirect evidence (e.g., scat, tracks, burrows, or environmental DNA that can be identified unambiguously to species) may be used to infer presence. Clear justification should be given in the documentation for using indirect evidence. With the exception of CR(PE) species, presence cannot be inferred from the presence of suitable habitat, or habitat maps or models. In the case of CR(PE) species, the species must be very likely to occur at the proposed KBA if it still exists. KBA proposers should confirm that suitable habitat conditions persist at the site and explain why the species may have escaped detection if it still exists. For example, a reasonable case may be made for a species with cryptic Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 106 morphology, ecology or behaviour making it difficult to detect (such as a plant for which viable seed may persist in the soil seed bank, or an elusive invertebrate that is adapted to a certain hostplant which is still present). What types of data can be used to confirm presence of an ecosystem type? See Section 4.3.7. How recent do data need to be when used to confirm a species or ecosystem\u2019s presence at a site? For all sites proposed as KBAs, the presence of the KBA trigger biodiversity elements at the site must be confirmed and documented (see the Documentation and Mapping Standards). This is especially important where KBA identification relies on area-based parameters (i.e. AOO, ESH, or range). Ideally, the data used to confirm presence, including data on the number of reproductive units, where required, will have been collected within 8-12 years before KBA identification. Clear justification should be given in the documentation for using older data (up to a maximum of 50 years). This may include expert judgment that the species is still likely to be present. Older data should not be used for species listed as globally threatened on the IUCN Red List under Criterion A2, A3 or A4, for other species known to have suffered recent population declines, or if the site has suffered significant habitat loss or other types of degradation in the intervening period. It is recommended that presence of the KBA trigger biodiversity elements is reconfirmed during KBA reassessment (i.e. data used to confirm presence in KBA reassessments should not be older than 8-12 years, unless the justification for older data is strong and it is unlikely that the species has been extirpated). 9.3 Uncertainty 9.3.1 Types of uncertainty There are two main types of uncertainty that may affect KBA identification: \u2022 Measurement uncertainty, such as uncertainty about the true number of mature individuals at any point in time, can often be reduced by collecting more data (for example, by increasing the sample size or number of sampling occasions) using the appropriate sampling, measurement, and estimation methods.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "34908a94-8d3b-49e1-8b98-26c358d47c99": {"__data__": {"id_": "34908a94-8d3b-49e1-8b98-26c358d47c99", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "99eb242d41dc4c685b30a28acff12595d7b632b91240d968321405538e5f7780"}, "2": {"node_id": "78bbb683-85a6-4286-9a4c-4db46a114e92", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "806e54e5b99d90f92a017d8639e596e66d844f6caee8df75f07f0130dfd55040"}}, "hash": "0f533ebfd6949d3838455d309f9a979a5246e3e9f0b606169b8a815ffac46778", "text": "\u2022 Ecological variation (often called \u201cprocess variation\u201d), such as variation in the true number of mature individuals at a site from one year to the next, can be a source Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 107 of uncertainty as to whether a site qualifies as a KBA, even if the number of mature individuals is counted precisely every year. 9.3.2 Dealing with uncertainty In", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f180fe05-a796-4d85-9e96-2458fbd2f0bc": {"__data__": {"id_": "f180fe05-a796-4d85-9e96-2458fbd2f0bc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dea109f5d234eae8ccd4eb30b815b4b0d23c7a05675744f4c86c5d227c0cbf09"}}, "hash": "dea109f5d234eae8ccd4eb30b815b4b0d23c7a05675744f4c86c5d227c0cbf09", "text": "many cases, the population size at a site will be either well above or well below the threshold for qualification as a KBA. Uncertainty is only significant for KBA identification when the estimated site-level population size lies close to the relevant threshold, such that there is uncertainty about whether or not the site qualifies. For example, if the minimum site-level population size estimate exceeds the relevant threshold based on the maximum global-level population size estimate, then the site would qualify as a KBA regardless of uncertainty. In the process of identifying sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity, it is important to balance the risks of omission and commission errors, i.e. the risks of failing to identify a site that actually qualifies (omission error) and the risks of identifying a site that does not actually qualify (commission error). High rates of omission error may lead to biodiversity loss, but high rates of commission error would deflate the value of identifying KBAs and may dilute conservation resources. Note that the low thresholds for Criteria A1 and A2 relative to the other criteria provide a built-in precautionary approach to identifying sites of importance for globally threatened species and ecosystem types. How to deal with measurement uncertainty? The general principle for handling measurement uncertainty is to balance the risks of omission and commission error. In the context of measurement uncertainty, a site should be proposed if it is more likely than not that it meets the relevant threshold. For example, if the global population size is 10,000 mature individuals, and the site- level population size is most likely greater than 1,000 individuals, then the site population most likely exceeds a 10% threshold. In other words, the site would qualify if there was a greater than 50% chance that the site population exceeds 1,000 mature individuals. Consider the data summarised in Table 9.3.2.1 \u2013 in this case, the site would qualify because the median estimate exceeds the threshold. The determination of whether a site is more likely than not to meet the relevant threshold may be based on quantitative or qualitative analysis (e.g., a statistical analysis or an expert-based weighing of various types of evidence). Table 9.3.2.1 Example of measurement uncertainty. The true number of individuals is not observed directly; rather, the estimated number is based on counts by three Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 108 observers. The site population-size threshold in this example is 1,000 mature individuals. Unknown true number True number \u2265 threshold? Observer 1 Observer 2 Observer 3 Median count Median count \u2265 threshold? Year 1 1,100 \uf0fc 1,060 1,032 876 1,032 \uf0fc Measurement uncertainty may occur at both global and site levels. If no global estimate of the chosen assessment parameter is provided in the WDKBA, KBA proposers will be asked to provide the best estimate of the assessment parameter at both global and site levels. The same type of estimate should be used at both levels for comparison. Where there is a choice, the order of preference is as follows: maximum likelihood estimate, median, mean, mid-point of the maximum and minimum. If the only data available are presence/absence data, then KBA proposers will need to infer the proportion of the global population size at the site based on one of the area- based assessment parameters, which include number of localities. How to deal with ecological variation? Ecological variation likely occurs to some extent for all species at all sites, as well as for dynamic ecosystem types. Ecological variation is often substantial for sites important for biological processes, such as demographic aggregations (D1), ecological refugia (D2), and recruitment (D3). The general principle for handling ecological variation is based on the application of Ramsar Criteria 5 and 6 (Ramsar, 2008). A site is considered to hold a species predictably if the species is known to have occurred at the site in at least two thirds of years for which adequate data are available for the relevant season (e.g., the breeding season in the case of a breeding aggregation). The total number of years with adequate data should not be fewer than three. For example, adult female marine turtles return to specific nesting beaches to lay their eggs, but, in most cases, individual females do not return every year, so that the number of nesting females that use a site over a breeding season can vary substantially from one year to the next. A nesting beach that predictably holds \u2265 1% of the global population size of mature individuals of a species of marine turtle qualifies as a KBA", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d71b2e06-7f2a-4d1f-91b5-1aa3bdce0021": {"__data__": {"id_": "d71b2e06-7f2a-4d1f-91b5-1aa3bdce0021", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f873595546c8773e70942a82d6cd65ce677a0840a1a72f5c6bb779ee65536f2a"}, "3": {"node_id": "76d5a511-c47b-4ff9-a00e-698d5ee70946", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7d9b9c9fbb49c26de10bd39b3ed26abed71a004d41cb248b13d19791d7b7d3a5"}}, "hash": "c5c95127712da16a8033f7a1f031661447d197b013178cc4f3055de51b7c9cd6", "text": "under Criterion D1.

Reassessment The term \u201creassessment\u201d is used synonymously with the term \u201cre-evaluation\u201d throughout the KBA Guidelines. Confirmed KBAs should be reassessed against the KBA criteria and thresholds at least once every 8-12 years, although more frequent monitoring of KBAs is recommended wherever possible. If the original KBA proposer is no longer available, the NCG or RFP (in that order) may identify a group to work on reassessment. Reassessment of sites identified as KBAs is especially important in the context of climate change, as climate change may affect biodiversity to such an extent that a site increases in importance and qualifies under additional criteria or loses importance and ceases to qualify. 10.1 Reasons for a change in KBA status Why might the status of a confirmed KBA change? The focus here is on changes in the status of confirmed KBAs and delisting of KBAs. KBA proposers or NCGs may also decide to reassess sites that almost qualified in previous KBA identification processes, but information on sites that do not qualify is not stored in the WDKBA, so that process is not covered here. A site that has been confirmed as a KBA may change status for one or more of the following reasons: A.

A confirmed KBA will not lose its KBA status solely on the basis of old data or the need for reassessment. New data showing that the site does not qualify would be required in any KBA Appeals process. Earlier reassessment is encouraged, especially in the following circumstances: \u2022 Earlier updates to documentation, and reassessment if appropriate, is encouraged in the case of a taxonomic change to a trigger species; or a change in threat category of a trigger species or ecosystem type for a site confirmed as a KBA under Criterion A1 or A2. \u2022 Earlier reassessment is also encouraged if new information becomes available, or a site suffers a catastrophic event (i.e. a genuine change) leading to the irreversible loss of trigger species or ecosystem type, or to loss of a site\u2019s ecological integrity). 10.3 Reassessment process What does KBA reassessment involve? During the reassessment process, NCGs or KBA proposers should address the following questions: \u2022 For sites that were confirmed as a KBA under any of the species-based criteria (i.e. A1, B1-3, D1-3), check whether there have been any taxonomic changes to trigger species (see Section 2.2.1). \u2022 For sites that were confirmed as a KBA under Criteria A1 or A2, check whether there has been any change in the threat category of the trigger species or ecosystem type, such that the site no longer qualifies as a KBA under Criteria A1 or A2. \u2022 For each KBA trigger biodiversity element for each confirmed KBA, check whether there has been a change in the global or site-level values of assessment parameters (e.g., based on new or more reliable information), such that the biodiversity element no longer meets relevant thresholds. \u2022 For each KBA trigger biodiversity element for each confirmed KBA, reconfirm the KBA trigger biodiversity element\u2019s presence at the site, in numbers that meet or Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 113 exceed the reproductive-unit threshold, where applicable. It is recommended that data used to confirm presence in KBA reassessments under any of the criteria should not be older than 8-12 years. \u2022 For each confirmed KBA, check whether there have been any changes (including changes in manageability) indicating that KBA delineation should be re-visited. This is especially important for sites considered potentially rather than actually manageable as a unit during the original KBA delineation. Any outstanding overlaps with other KBAs should also be addressed during reassessment. What happens if a KBA no longer qualifies because of a genuine increase in the global population size? If the reassessment process indicates that a site no longer qualifies as a global KBA because of a genuine increase in the global population size, the site should be reassessed against all the KBA criteria to clarify its status. Any change in status will be indicated in the WDKBA after it has been reviewed and confirmed. Effective conservation of a trigger species at a KBA may contribute to an increase in the global population size. In that case, the proportion of the global population size held at the site would be expected to increase. The KBA would only lose its status if successful conservation of a globally threatened trigger species led to its downlisting on the IUCN Red List and a change in the relevant KBA criteria or thresholds (e.g., KBA Criterion A1 no longer applies). If the site did not qualify under any KBA criteria, it would no longer be a KBA, but may be highlighted as a conservation success on the IUCN Green List (subject to meeting the IUCN Green List criteria). What happens if a KBA no longer qualifies because of a genuine reduction in site-level population size? If the reassessment process indicates that a site no longer qualifies as a global KBA, the site should be reassessed against all the KBA criteria to clarify its status.

understood to ensure that the KBA criteria are applied correctly. The following terms are defined in the KBA Standard (IUCN, 2016, pp. 9-15).

Contributing/Contribution The contribution of a site to the global persistence of biodiversity depends on the global distribution and the abundance of the biodiversity elements for which the site is important. Sites holding biodiversity elements that are globally restricted, or at risk of disappearing, make high contributions to the persistence of those elements. The global persistence of a biodiversity element occurring at any given KBA, unless it is entirely confined to the site, depends not only on the fate of the site itself but also on that of other sites and of the land-/seascapes where it occurs. Global Global implies that the contributions of a site to the persistence of a given biodiversity element are measured in relation to its worldwide population size or extent. Persistence Persistence of a biodiversity element means that its loss (e.g., species extinction, ecosystem collapse) or decline (e.g., of numbers of mature individuals of a species, ecosystem extent and condition) is avoided, both now and into the foreseeable future. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 125 Significantly/Significant Significant means that an outstanding proportion of a biodiversity element (e.g., species population size or ecosystem extent) occurs at the site, as defined by a quantitative threshold. Site A geographical area on land and/or in water with defined ecological, physical, administrative or management boundaries that is actually or potentially manageable as a single unit (e.g., a protected area or other managed conservation unit). For this reason, large-scale biogeographic regions such as ecoregions, Endemic Bird Areas and Biodiversity Hotspots, and land-/seascapes containing multiple management units, are not considered to be sites. In the context of KBAs, \u201csite\u201d and \u201carea\u201d are used interchangeably. Terms used in the KBA criteria and delineation procedures Aggregation (Criterion D) A geographically restricted clustering of individuals that typically occurs during a specific life history stage or process such as breeding, feeding or migration. This clustering is indicated by highly localised relative abundance, two or more orders of magnitude larger than the species\u2019 average recorded numbers or densities at other stages during its life-cycle. A difference in relative abundance of two orders of magnitude is advisory rather than required. Most aggregative species, such as many shorebird species (family Scolopacidae), aggregate for specific life-history functions (e.g., during migration or on wintering grounds) and are more widely dispersed at lower densities during other seasons. A few species, such as the Lesser Flamingo (Phoeniconaias minor), are aggregated through most or all of their life-cycles. Criterion D1 may be applied to species that aggregate for some or all of their life-cycle (IUCN, 2016, p. 22). Area of occupancy (Criteria A, B, E) The area within the range of a species that is actually occupied (IUCN, 2012a). Assemblage (Criterion B) A set of species within a taxonomic group having: a) their ranges \u226595% predictably confined to a single ecoregion for at least one life-history stage; b) their ranges \u226595% predictably confined to a single biome for at least one life-history stage (for taxonomic Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 126 groups with a global median range size >25,000 km2); or c) their most important habitats in common with multiple other species. In the definition of \u201cassemblage\u201d, the term \u201cbiome\u201d should be replaced by the term \u201cbioregion\u201d. This will be corrected in the next version of the KBA Standard.

Distinct genetic diversity (Criteria A, B) The proportion of a species\u2019 genetic diversity that is encompassed by a particular site. It can be measured using Analysis of Molecular Variance or similar technique that simultaneously captures diversity and distinctiveness (frequency of alleles and the genetic distinctiveness of those alleles). Ecological integrity (Criterion C) A condition that supports intact species assemblages and ecological processes in their natural state, relative to an appropriate historical benchmark, and characterised by contiguous natural habitat with minimal direct industrial anthropogenic disturbance. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 127 Ecoregion (Criteria B, C) A \u201crelatively large unit of land (or water) containing a distinct assemblage of natural communities and species with boundaries that approximate the original extent of natural communities prior to major land-use change\u201d (Olson et al., 2001). Ecoregions have been mapped for terrestrial (Olson et al., 2001), freshwater (Abell et al., 2008) and near-shore marine (Spalding et al., 2007) environments and are nested within bioregions or provinces. Ecosystem type (Criteria A, B) A defined ecosystem unit for standard and repeatable assessment, at an intermediate level in a globally consistent ecosystem classification hierarchy such as macrogroup or equivalent (Faber-Langendoen et al., 2014). It is defined by a particular set of variables related to its characteristic native biota, an abiotic environment or complex, the interactions within and between them, and a physical space in which these operate (Keith et al., 2013, Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2015). Other terms such as \u201cecological communities\u201d and \u201cbiotopes\u201d are often considered operational synonyms of ecosystem type. Endemic (Criteria A, E) A species having a global range wholly restricted to a defined geographic area such as a region, country or site. Environmental stress (Criterion D) Natural events like floods, droughts, storms, wildfires, earthquakes as well as high or low temperature caused by global change; it can also describe the lack of food due to the bottom-up effect of environmental stress or massive die off of prey in ecosystem due to infectious disease. Environmental stress refers to extreme environmental conditions, whether natural or anthropogenic. Extent of suitable habitat (Criteria A, B) The area of potentially suitable ecological conditions, such as vegetation or substrate types within the altitudinal or depth, and temperature and moisture preferences, for a given species (Beresford et al., 2011). ESH refers to the extent of habitat available to a species within its range. ESH cannot extend beyond the range, but may include unoccupied suitable habitat within the species\u2019 range, unlike AOO. ESH is directly equivalent to Area of Habitat. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 128 Geographically restricted (Criterion B) A biodiversity element having a restricted global distribution, as measured by range, extent of suitable habitat or area of occupancy, and hence largely confined or endemic to a relatively small portion of the globe such as a bioregion, ecoregion or site. Intact ecological community (Criterion C) An ecological community having the complete complement of species known or expected to occur in a particular site or ecosystem, relative to a regionally appropriate historical benchmark, which will often correspond to pre-industrial times. Irreplaceability (Criterion E) Either (a) the likelihood that an area will be required as part of a system that achieves a set of targets (Ferrier et al., 2000) or (b) the extent to which the options for achieving a set of targets are reduced if the area is unavailable for conservation (Pressey et al., 1994). Irreplaceability is heavily influenced by geographically restricted biodiversity, but it is a property of an area within a network rather than of an element of biodiversity and is related to the concept of complementarity. Locality (Criteria A, B) A sampling locality is a point indicated by specific coordinates of latitude and longitude. Note that the term \u201clocality\u201d, as defined here, is fundamentally and conceptually different from the term \u201clocation\u201d used in the IUCN Red List (IUCN, 2012a).

This requires that KBA delineation consider relevant aspects of the socio-economic context Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 129 of the site (e.g., land tenure, political boundaries) in addition to the ecological and physical aspects of the site (e.g., habitat, size, connectivity). Mature individuals (Criteria A, B, E) The number of individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction as defined in IUCN (2012a). Population size (Criteria A, B, D) The total, global, number of mature individuals of the species (IUCN, 2012a). Population size is used throughout the KBA Standard rather than simply \u201cpopulation\u201d, which IUCN (2012a) use to mean the total number of individuals of a species. In the KBA Guidelines, the term \u201cpopulation size\u201d is used to refer to the total number of individuals in a species, as in \u201cglobal population size\u201d; and for the number of individuals in a geographically or otherwise distinct group, as in the \u201csite population size\u201d. This differs from the IUCN Red List, in which the term \u201csubpopulation\u201d is used to refer to a geographically or otherwise distinct group in the population (IUCN, 2012a). Predictably (Criterion D) An expectation of species occurrence at a site during particular seasons or at one or more stages of its life cycle, based on previous or known occurrence, such as in response to specific climate conditions. Predictable occurrence includes both regular (seasonal) occurrence and irregular (episodic) occurrence, as long as the occurrence is a predictable response to environmental conditions. For Criterion D1, which is based on regular (seasonal) occurrence, a site \u201cpredictably\u201d holds a species if the species is known to have occurred at the site in at least two thirds of the relevant seasons for which adequate data are available; the total number of seasons being not less than three. This is consistent with the definition of \u201cregularly\u201d in the application of Ramsar Criteria 5 and 6 (Ramsar, 2008). For Criterion D3, which is based on the production of propagules, larvae, or juveniles, a site \u201cpredictably\u201d produces propagules, larvae or juveniles if it produces them in at least two thirds of the recruitment cycles for which adequate data are available; the total number of recruitment cycles being not less than three. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 130 Criterion D2 is based on irregular (episodic) occurrence. The term \u201cpredictably\u201d is not used in Criterion D2, but consistent with D1 and D3, a site may be considered to hold a species during periods of environmental stress if the species is known to have occurred at the site in at least two thirds of the periods of environmental stress for which adequate data are available. (There is no minimum number of periods of environmental stress given here, as periods of environmental stress are assumed to be rare events.) Range (Criterion A, B, E) The current known limits of distribution of a species, accounting for all known, inferred or projected sites of occurrence (IUCN, 2012a), including conservation translocations outside native habitat (IUCN SPSC, 2014) but not including vagrancies (species recorded once or sporadically but known not to be native to the area). Range thus defines the geographic space in the major systems (e.g., terrestrial, freshwater, marine or subterranean) in which a species occurs. The term \u201crange\u201d is not defined in the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN, 2012a), but the definition of \u201crange\u201d in the KBA Standard is consistent with the term\u2019s use in IUCN Red List assessments. For the purposes of KBA identification, range also explicitly includes areas where species were introduced for conservation purposes outside their native habitat, as these are included in IUCN Red List assessments.

Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 131 Reproductive unit (Criteria A, B, E) The minimum number and combination of mature individuals necessary to trigger a successful reproductive event at a site (Eisenberg 1977). Examples of five reproductive units include five pairs, five reproducing females in one harem, and five reproductive individuals of a plant species. Restricted range (Criterion B) Species having a global range size less than or equal to the 25th percentile of range- size distribution in a taxonomic group within which all species have been mapped globally, up to a maximum of 50,000 km2. If all species in a taxonomic group have not been mapped globally, or if the 25th percentile of range-size distribution for a taxonomic group falls below 10,000 km2, restricted range should be defined as having a global range size less than or equal to 10,000 km2. For coastal, riverine and other species with linear distributions that do not exceed 200 km width at any point, restricted range is defined as having a global range less than or equal to 500 km linear geographic span (i.e. the distance between occupied locations furthest apart). Species known only from their type locality should not automatically be assumed to have a restricted range, since this may be indicative of under-sampling. Target (Criterion E) A conservation target is the minimum amount of a particular biodiversity feature for which conservation is desirable through one or multiple conservation actions (Possingham et al., 2006). Taxonomic group (Criterion B) Taxonomic ranks above the species level. Threatened (Criterion A) Assessed through globally standardised methodologies as having a high probability of extinction (species) or collapse (ecosystems) in the medium-term future. Threatened species are those assessed as Critically Endangered (CR), Endangered (EN), or Vulnerable (VU) according to The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (IUCN, 2012a). For the purposes of KBA criterion A1, Threatened also includes species assessed as regionally/nationally CR, EN or VU using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN, 2012b) that (a) have not been assessed globally and (b) are endemic to the region/country in question. Threatened ecosystems are those assessed as CR, EN or VU according to the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (IUCN, 2015). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 132 Threshold (Criteria A-E) Numeric or percentage minima which determine whether the presence of a biodiversity element at a site is significant enough for the site to be considered a KBA under a given criterion or subcriterion. Trigger (Criteria A-E) A biodiversity element (e.g., species or ecosystem) by which at least one KBA criterion and associated threshold is met. Additional terms The following terms defined here were not defined in the KBA Standard. Life-history function (Criterion D) See life-cycle process. Life-history stage (Criterion D) In the KBA Standard, including the definition of \u201caggregation\u201d, the term \u201clife-history stage\u201d is intended to be synonymous with \u201clife-cycle process\u201d and does not refer to developmental stage (e.g., egg, chick, juvenile, adult). Life-cycle process (Criterion D) Life-cycle process refers to a period in a species\u2019 life-cycle when some or all members of a population perform essential activities such as spawning/mating, feeding, moulting, migration, over-wintering (see also biological processes). For many species, these life-cycle processes occur at predictable sites in predictable seasons.

III.1 Estimating range Please see the IUCN Red List Mapping Standards for detailed guidelines on developing distribution maps for estimating range. Any KBA proposals based on new range maps, not derived from the IUCN Red List account or provided through the WDKBA, must be flagged for expert review when the KBA proposal is submitted to the WDKBA.

III.2 Estimating extent of suitable habitat (ESH) ESH is the area of potentially suitable ecological conditions for a species within the species\u2019 current range (see Fig. 3.4). Note that ESH is directly equivalent to \u201carea of habitat\u201d. For species that do not yet have an ESH map, but for which proposers seek to use ESH as an assessment parameter, the first step is to map the range (see Appendix III.1). Any KBA proposals based on new ESH maps, not provided through the WDKBA, must be flagged for expert review when the KBA proposal is submitted to the WDKBA.

If ESH is based on grid cells, the proportion of a species\u2019 ESH that is found within a site will depend in part on the spatial resolution of analysis. Analysis at a finer spatial resolution (for example, using 1-km2 or 4-km2 grid cells rather than 100-km2 grid cells) will generally lead to a lower global ESH and make it more likely that a site that consists solely of suitable habitat exceeds the thresholds specified in the criteria. The standard resolution for AOO is 2 x 2 km grid cells; a link to a standardised 2 x 2 km grid is provided in Appendix V. KBA proposers are encouraged to use this grid where appropriate, but may use other resolutions if the 2 x 2 km grid is not suitable given the species\u2019 distribution patterns or the resolution of available data.

III.4 Using habitat maps and models to infer or project occurrences Habitat maps show the distribution of suitable habitat for a species (e.g., ESH) and are used as the basis for estimating ESH. Habitat maps may be based primarily on expert knowledge (deductive models) or statistical analysis (inductive models). Habitat models may also be referred to as species distribution models, ecological niche models, bioclimatic models, spatial density models, etc. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 136 Mapping suitable habitat based on published data and expert knowledge (deductive models) ESH maps have been developed for birds (Beresford et al., 2011), mammals (Rondinini et al., 2011), and amphibians (Ficetola et al., 2015). Specifically, ESH maps have been developed by classifying topographical and environmental data layers (e.g., altitude, bathymetry, land cover and benthic habitats, distance to water bodies), using information on altitudinal limits and major or suitable habitats in IUCN Red List accounts (see IUCN Red List Habitat Classification Scheme) derived from published and unpublished literature and expert knowledge. A similar approach may be applied in marine systems, using bathymetry and other physiological limits (e.g., sea-surface temperature and salinity) together with benthic habitat classes. This type of approach is well suited to developing consistent binary habitat maps (e.g. ESH maps) for entire taxonomic groups, including data-limited species. It is well suited to sedentary species and species with fixed breeding and/or non-breeding habitats. It is less well suited to species with spatially dynamic habitats, including many pelagic marine species. Mapping suitable habitat based on statistical analysis (inductive models) Habitat models may also be developed by applying statistical methods (e.g., generalized linear or additive models, classification or regression trees) to known localities and topographical and environmental covariates (Elith and Leathwick 2009; Franklin 2010). Statistical habitat models are generally used to estimate (a) the probability of occurrence of the species, and/or (b) the expected relative densities (in terms of numbers of individuals or biomass) based on correlation between known localities and topographical/environmental covariates. A threshold may then be used to generate a binary map of suitable habitat (e.g. an ESH map) by selecting areas with high versus low probability of occurrence or high versus low expected densities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c744a51-e807-480c-a0f8-d179db223311": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c744a51-e807-480c-a0f8-d179db223311", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c00ef93ef9dbe886630db69ce1b2b9729a6853aa07819c35f9381670da604311"}, "2": {"node_id": "b8b29a57-d69e-43d9-8fb0-3dd612217bb5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d630e84afcc5c72bf8dc34e8321cba602fc5a8775f47e52520511b02a64224b4"}}, "hash": "834bdc28e56eea8d7d9687abf092fc3e832993f256b0193ca9b9202a40d0458e", "text": "This type of approach requires a large number of sampling localities (presence only, presence/absence, or abundance) and is usually applied to a single species or small group of species because of the data, technical, and computational demands.

Habitat maps and models may need to be filtered to produce a valid depiction of AOO for use in KBA identification. In some cases, filtering out areas that are unlikely to be occupied may be fairly straight- forward. For example, projected occurrences in habitat patches that are small and distant from habitat patches with known localities may be filtered out using knowledge of the species\u2019 dispersal limitations; projected occurrences in areas close to roads or human population centres may be filtered out if hunting is a threat; areas that lack recent known occurrences and are known to have been affected by pathogens may be filtered out. The IUCN Red List Guidelines (IUCN SPSC, 2017, Section 4.10.7) provide the following three conditions for using habitat maps or models to estimate AOO: i) Habitat maps and models must be justified in the documentation as accurate representations of the habitat requirements of the species and validated by a means that is independent of the data used to construct them. ii) The area of potential habitat must be interpreted to produce an estimate of the area of occupied habitat. iii) The estimated area of occupied habitat derived from the map must be scaled to the reference scale of 2 x 2 km. These conditions generally require observed presence/absence data in 2 x 2 km grid cells and adequate sampling intensity to be confident that the absence of records in cells represents a genuine absence of the species. Unfortunately, this information is lacking for many species. Justification and validation of habitat maps and models used to estimate ESH and AOO Habitat maps and models can vary widely in quality and accuracy. A map or model may not provide an accurate representation of habitat if key variables are omitted. For example, a map would overestimate the habitat of a forest-dependent montane species if it identified all forest areas as potential habitat, irrespective of altitude. Any habitat maps or models used in KBA assessments should therefore be subject to a critical evaluation based on biological and statistical considerations, where applicable. The selection of environmental covariates should be based on knowledge of the biology of the species and not simply fitted statistically from a pool of candidate variables that are conveniently available. Appropriate methods for statistical model evaluation Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 138 should be employed (e.g., cross-validation using independent datasets). Habitat maps and models should be sufficiently rigorous to pass peer review. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.0 139 Appendix IV: Mapping ecosystem extent The following guidelines on estimating ecosystem extent (i.e. geographic distribution) are extracted from the IUCN Red List of Ecosystem (RLE) Guidelines (IUCN, 2017, p. 46 ff). Remote sensing is a common approach for mapping the geographic distributions of many terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Global data sets, such as those available for forests (Hansen et al., 2013), mangroves (Giri et al., 2011), water cover (Pekel et al., 2016), and coral reefs (Andr\u00e9fou\u00ebt et al., 2006), may provide a useful basis for superimposing appropriate classifications of ecosystem types. Spatial proxies for ecosystem distributions, such as climate, substrate, topography, bathymetry, ocean currents, flood regimes, water cover, aquifers or some synthesis of these that can be justified in the documentation as valid representations of the distribution of ecosystem biota or its niche space may be used in some cases. Physical factors such as sea floor characteristics, ocean currents, water temperatures and water chemistry may be appropriate predictors of ecosystem distribution for marine ecosystems. Spatial distribution models offer an additional opportunity to formally select and combine the most suitable set of spatial proxies to predict ecosystem distributions. Clark et al. (2015), for example, used bathymetric spatial data and remote sensing data on sea ice concentration to model the distribution of suitable light conditions for under-ice marine benthic invertebrate communities in Antarctic waters. When using spatial proxies or developing spatial distribution models, a mechanistic understanding of the relationship between occurrence of the ecosystem and limiting environmental factors is essential for developing a valid representation of the geographic distribution of an ecosystem type. Spatial distribution models should follow best practice recommendations for each model type and should be validated (see IUCN SPSC, 2017, p. 76). Once the geographic distribution of an ecosystem has been assessed using the methods described above, areas that have been lost to settlement, agriculture or other forms of habitat conversion should be removed before calculating the global and site- level ecosystem extent.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "024f1b3e-99cc-487d-b77c-25f647124c38": {"__data__": {"id_": "024f1b3e-99cc-487d-b77c-25f647124c38", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9e8d8000766e66ef2cd5dc992857b068f8ea416081f418bfe5945250e72dfb87"}, "3": {"node_id": "40df910d-5fd5-4af0-9198-58a615b9db16", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6990a4e9fc333bd5ea92c241f3d4cfd4a5214bdcd256da356ccf7b4cf23e548a"}}, "hash": "2778b407083c0801c92ee4c25998851169b4bc1cd406728bde3510df0da1e03b", "text": "The spatial resolution (e.g., pixel size) of an ecosystem map should be as fine as practical, consistent with the input data and the scale of the ecosystem (e.g., Fig. A5).

Mumford IUCN \u2013 International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN is a membership Union uniquely composed of both government and civil society organisations. It provides public, private and non-governmental organisations with the knowledge and tools that enable human progress, economic development and nature conservation to take place together. Created in 1948, IUCN has evolved into the world\u2019s largest and most diverse environmental network. It harnesses the experience, resources and reach of its more than 1,300 Member organisations and the input of some 13,000 experts. IUCN is the global authority on the status of the natural world and the measures needed to safeguard it. Our experts are organised into six commissions dedicated to species survival, environmental law, protected areas, social and economic policy, ecosystem management, and education and communication. The ability to convene diverse stakeholders and provide the latest science, objective recommendations and on-the-ground expertise drives IUCN\u2019s mission of informing and empowering conservation efforts worldwide. We provide a neutral forum in which governments, NGOs, scientists, businesses, local communities, indigenous peoples groups, faith-based organisations and others can work together to forge and implement solutions to environmental challenges. By facilitating these solutions, IUCN provides governments and institutions at all levels with the impetus to achieve universal goals, including on biodiversity, climate change and sustainable development, which IUCN was instrumental in defining. Combined, our knowledge base and diverse membership make IUCN an incubator and trusted repository of best practices, conservation tools, and international guidelines and standards. As one of the only two environmental organisations with official United Nations Observer Status, IUCN ensures that nature conservation has a voice at the highest level of international governance. IUCN\u2019s expertise and extensive network provide a solid foundation for a large and diverse portfolio of conservation projects around the world. Combining the latest science with the traditional knowledge of local communities, these projects work to reverse habitat loss, restore ecosystems and improve people\u2019s well-being. They also produce a wealth of data and information which feeds into IUCN\u2019s analytical capacity. Through their affiliation with IUCN, Member organisations are part of a democratic process, voting Resolutions which drive the global conservation agenda. They meet every four years at the IUCN World Conservation Congress to set priorities and agree on the Union\u2019s work programme. IUCN congresses have produced several key international environmental agreements including the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), the World Heritage Convention, and the Ramsar Convention on wetlands. We continue to help these conventions strengthen and evolve so that they can respond to emerging challenges. Our Member organisations are represented by the IUCN Council \u2013 the governing body. Headquartered in Switzerland, IUCN Secretariat comprises around 950 staff in more than 50 countries.

The political will of Asia regional governments for recovering forest cover is strong. More than 24 million ha of land are pledged towards the Bonn Challenge for restoring degraded land using Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR) principles. Furthermore, many more ambitious national and sub-national restoration programmes exist. If done well, restoration can not only deliver the environmental and socio- economic benefits that millions of forest- dependent communities rely on, but also transition our economies and societies to a more forward-looking model. The Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM) has encapsulated the philosophy, principles and operational guidance of FLR, an approach that is gaining recognition among restoration practitioners particularly for countries that need to address the dual challenges of nature conservation and socio-economic development. Since its release in 2014, ROAM has been piloted in many countries, supporting governments and land managers to implement FLR and address real policy objectives, including recovering forest cover, enhancing food security, addressing climate change challenge and preparing ground-level restoration models for", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c7bb3364-fdd9-419f-b329-8611a33bd0f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "c7bb3364-fdd9-419f-b329-8611a33bd0f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/application-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam-asia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Application of Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM) in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/application-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam-asia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "713ebd2eb349d91ae2eac707602fc1b3e5221562ec8526cabfbca54231555dba"}}, "hash": "713ebd2eb349d91ae2eac707602fc1b3e5221562ec8526cabfbca54231555dba", "text": "REDD+ action, and supporting local communities to transform land management practices to meet current and future needs. Using ROAM, six different landscapes in Asia- Pacific have developed pragmatic landscape restoration strategies that meet FLR objectives, driven by interactive stakeholder engagement processes and based on thorough baseline research of local land use legacy and available land for restoration; the types and potential of appropriate FLR interventions and socio- economic cost-benefit analysis; and a comprehensive diagnosis of key barriers and enabling factors for restoration programmes in legal, institutional, policy and financial dimensions. The six case studies all employ the ROAM process, but still show great diversity in their ecosystem types (from mountain to coastal mangrove landscapes), FLR scale (from national to local, and from focusing on halting deforestation to forwarding-looking plantation management models), and the subsequent FLR strategies. Looking across different ROAM country case studies, a number of common lessons learnt emerge: \u2022 There is a significant diversity in the socio-economic, environmental contexts, degradation drivers, and the scale at which the ROAM approach was applied. This showed the ability of ROAM to address different restoration challenges in a wide spectrum of landscape contexts and for different restoration needs. vi \u2022 A well-structured, stakeholder-driven spatial analysis on degradation drivers and restoration potentials has proven to be a powerful way to stimulate stakeholder discussion on the threats and problems facing landscape restoration objectives and needs, as well as helping them to reach consensus on future restoration benefits and distribution. \u2022 The key barriers to restoration success continue to be insufficient restoration funding and the lack of well-established fundable restoration models. Across different landscapes, there seems to be a need to continually look for innovative and locally appropriate restoration models, as well as all the technical and financial information for such models, underlining the importance of identifying locally appropriate restoration interventions and the associated cost- benefit analysis. \u2022 Insufficient technical capacity continues to hinder the uptake of FLR. In some countries there is already a strong technical capacity in plantation establishment, but the transition to landscape-level restoration implementation that adheres to FLR principles remains lacking. Enhanced extension support is an effective measure that land managers could take to enhance their performance, particularly relating to landscape-level planning, stakeholder engagement, sustainable use of farming additives, longer rotation of plantation management and certification. \u2022 In landscapes that are more advanced in FLR implementation, local heads of the government, especially line agencies and government representation outside of the traditional forest sector, play a crucial role. However, this is continuously overlooked in many restoration programmes, due to the different disciplinary backgrounds practitioners have and dominant institutional barriers. A potential strategy to overcome these difficulties is to identify common goals and shared interests through multi-stakeholder platforms, which again highlight the role of stakeholder engagement and consensus-building. In summary, ROAM has been applied in diverse landscape contexts in Asia in the past few years, helping to reverse the trend of deforestation and forest degradation. Through the implementation of FLR, ROAM provides scalable pragmatic solutions to addressing different policy goals, be it the enhancement of local livelihoods, the conservation of critical habitats, or combatting climate change. The ROAM approach has gained recognition and has the potential to provide lessons learnt what would be valuable for restoration practitioners and policymakers across different countries and landscapes. 1 1 Background Over the last several centuries, vast forest areas have been cleared as agricultural land has spread and human populations have grown. About 30% of global forest cover has now been completely cleared and a further 20% has been degraded. Land degradation and loss of supporting ecosystem functions now impact 24% of the global land area, equivalent to foregoing the production of 20 million tonnes of grain per year. The costs of lost agricultural productivity, deforestation and the wider impacts of land degradation are EUR 1.5 to 3.4 trillion, or approximately 3.3% to 7.5% of global GDP. Water security for billions of people is also under pressure, with the water crisis a top-ranked global risk. One-third of the world\u2019s population live in water-stressed regions, but this is likely to grow to 50% by 2050. Restoration of degraded land not only helps people cope with these trends but also leverages nature\u2019s intuitive solutions for pressing environmental concerns and climate change1. Degradation accounts for 5% of GDP based on commonly cited figures. In effect, this means that countries are fighting poverty and advancing economic development with one hand tied behind their back. Land degradation increases recurrent government expenditure by requiring frequent reinvestment in damaged infrastructure or making the provision of government more expensive.

For example, in a series of fire and haze events in 2015, Indonesia experienced forest degradation of 2.6 million hectares, some 1750 million metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions (MtCO2 eq), and 100,000 premature deaths across Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore2 3. The World Bank estimated the economic loss from the Indonesian Fires was over US $16 billion4. Breaking the spiral of loss and degradation and restoring these lands would bring many benefits. Restored land supports ecosystem services and biodiversity through the supply of clean water, reduced erosion and wildlife habitat, as well as of biofuel and other forest products. Forests and trees mitigate climate change by sequestering carbon. Beyond environmental benefits, the multiple benefits of landscape restoration can reach and make a positive impact on millions of citizens and communities by enhancing soil fertility, boosting agricultural productivity, increasing and diversifying rural income, and strengthening resilience to pests and natural disasters. More than two billion hectares worldwide are suitable for restoration. Most of these lands are in tropical and temperate areas, as identified by a global assessment of forest landscape restoration opportunities5. One and a half billion hectares would be best-suited for mosaic restoration, in which forests and trees are combined with other land uses, including agroforestry, smallholder agriculture, and settlements. Up to about half a billion hectares would be suitable for wide-scale restoration of closed forests. Croplands and densely populated rural areas on former forest lands amount to a further one billion hectares. They do not offer extensive restoration opportunities in terms of area, but some of this land would benefit from having trees planted in strategic places to protect and enhance agricultural productivity and other ecosystem functions. 1 IUCN, September 2016.

More than 150 million hectares are suitable for wide scale restoration; while around 300 million hectares are suitable for mosaic landscape restoration6. While a global assessment of FLR could potentially provide some indication of the extent and location of areas suitable for restoration within a given country, the constraints inherent in a global assessment (including the low resolution and the inability to use country-specific data) make it of limited use for supporting restoration strategies within countries. The global assessment therefore needs to be refined and improved through national and sub-national assessments, the results of which may be quite different from those seen in the global assessment map. A landscape FLR assessment can: 1. Provide missing landscape-level land-use and economic analysis data that can improve and inform more effective reforms (e.g. of land tenure or of agricultural and forestry sectors); 2. Provide an overview of the priority areas for restoration, the different restoration options available and their relative costs and benefits; 3. Identify key stakeholder groups who will need to be involved in any follow-up work on FLR in the country; 4. Build high-level support for FLR by engaging key policy and decision-makers from different sectors as well as other stakeholders with interests in, or influence on, how landscapes are managed; 5. Enhance a shared understanding of FLR opportunities and the value of a multi-sectoral, landscape-level approach to restoration, by bringing government agency staff, civil society actors and researchers together to work on the assessment. 6 Minnemeyer, S., Laestadius, L., Sizer, N., Saint-Laurent, C. & Potapov, P. 2011.

As of March 2018, IUCN has been involved in ROAM processes in six landscapes in the Asia-Pacific region, including: 1. The provinces of Kampong Thom, Preah Vihear, and Siem Reap, Cambodia 2. A national network of state forest farms, China 3. The state of Uttarakhand, India 4. Tanjung Panjang Landscape, Sulawesi, Indonesia 5. Myanmar 6. Quang Tri Province, Viet Nam Chapter 3 of this report documents the implementation of ROAM processes in the six landscapes. Additional discussion on FLR opportunities in Lao PDR, Thailand and Sri Lanka is captured in chapter 4. Chapter 5 provides a comparison of different ROAM processes and attempts to draw common lessons learnt. With understanding the importance of FLR and building on the experience of ROAM in Asia region, Chapter 6 discusses the international and national opportunities for scaling up FLR initiatives and provides a list of action points for the IUCN regional network in Asia. 4 3 Country experiences Cambodia (Kampong Thom, Preah Vihear, and Siem Reap) According to FAO reports, as of 2015 Cambodia had approximately 53% forest cover, which \u2013 despite being in decline \u2013 is a relatively high percentage when compared with other countries in Indo-Burma. In light of this, Cambodia is still in a good position to secure its wealth of valuable natural resources through landscape-level approaches to forest landscape restoration and improved land management. Cambodia\u2019s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) to maintain 60% forest cover in 2030 is ambitious but also achievable if the underlying drivers of forest degradation can be addressed. This report utilises ROAM to determine an appropriate suite of restoration interventions that can restore forests and improve the ecological function of multi-use landscapes. The target provinces of this study \u2013 Kampong Thom, Preah Vihear, and Siem Reap \u2013 make up a large part of the Northern Tonle Sap catchment area. This region includes evergreen, semi-evergreen, deciduous dipterocarp, and seasonally inundated flooded forests, as well as areas of settlements, rice cultivation and upland agriculture. The landscape restoration interventions proposed in this report are intended to address the specific objectives set forth by local stakeholders: primarily to increase forest cover, reduce soil erosion, increase the availability of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) to local communities, and improve local livelihoods. This assessment has identified the major underlying drivers of landscape degradation in the region to include: forest encroachment, illegal logging, land conversion for economic land concessions, and forest fires. Considering that many of the forest fires are the result of anthropogenic activities, principally land clearance, it becomes evident that these main drivers are largely the result of people needing new land and more natural resources to support their livelihoods. Forest encroachment and land grabbing are symptoms, not causes, of land degradation. In order to address these drivers of degradation this assessment provides recommendations for land use changes that will improve the livelihoods of communities managing community forests (CFs), community protected areas (CPAs), and community fisheries institutions (CFis), as well as improve the sustainability and profitability of lands already in cultivation. Through the analysis of geospatial data and local consultations, degraded areas within the landscape have been identified as well as areas that present viable opportunities for restoration interventions. Degradation within the landscape has been defined as areas having been deforested during three different time spans of 2007-2011, 2012-2014, and 2015-2016; areas of high slope (greater than 15 degrees); and frequently burned areas. One of the major hurdles to successful landscape restoration in Cambodia is unclear land tenure. For this reason, the opportunity areas for restoration focus mainly on areas with clear land tenure rights and areas under community management. These include protected areas (PAs), conservation corridors, CFs, CPAs, and CFis. Additionally, riparian areas and flooded forests were considered opportunity areas given their importance for improving water quality and fisheries, and reducing erosion. Guided by stakeholder input and credible spatial analysis, the multi-criteria analysis combined locations of degradation and FLR opportunity in the target landscape. Paired with key stakeholder discussion and 5 field surveys of restoration options, the results of the multi-criteria analysis (MCA) was further developed to a spatial explicit of FLR opportunity maps.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "710c9034-f56f-44bf-a0b2-63a404402863": {"__data__": {"id_": "710c9034-f56f-44bf-a0b2-63a404402863", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/application-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam-asia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Application of Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM) in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/application-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam-asia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d2f3c64e964d27a163de216166a9dc2957feded34918fc5fa43877438bc9dcdf"}, "2": {"node_id": "9d1fef87-093e-4533-bfad-83d7ca8bb967", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/application-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam-asia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0dc955d50a6c0fffab2e42512383928f8394b23fb582639e99629ba61e219dbd"}}, "hash": "d88de13fd05625b5a91a80852ee2e9a9a5af1cce8033627a79f394a75f6266e5", "text": "The ROAM process also provided a draft list of packages of FLR options, including their CBA results and technical guidance.

Areas of overlap between opportunity criteria and degradation criteria were determined to be priority areas for restoration opportunities. 7 Figure 3.2: FLR Opportunity Areas by types (unit: ha) According to the FAO forest cover estimate from 2015, to meet the INDC target of 60% forest cover by 2030 Cambodia needs to restore approximately 1.2 million hectares of forest. Approximately one- quarter (approximately 280,000ha) of that area has been identified inside of opportunity areas in this assessment, and restoring some of the degraded land outside these opportunity areas (approximately 325,000ha) could add considerably to this 60% forest cover goal. Given that the opportunity areas are largely areas with clear land tenure rights, this represents the most easily accessible land for forest restoration in Cambodia. It should be noted that focusing restoration efforts solely in public and community-managed areas would not likely be sufficient to meet these ambitious targets for restoration. Given this, in order to meet these targets, it will be critical to also engage private landowners and users to expand these interventions into private land. Recommendations for FLR interventions include options for native forest restoration on deforested land with an emphasis on NTFP species in CPAs, economic timber species in CFs, and locally extirpated species in PAs and conservation corridors. Restoration of flooded forests in and around CFis is recommended due to their critical role in creating and maintaining healthy fisheries near the Tonle Sap. Throughout agricultural areas, general principles of conservation agriculture should be applied (e.g. green mulching and reduced tilling) and alternatives to season-after-season cassava monoculture should be considered. These alternatives could include intercropping with peanuts, growing cassava with grass hedgerows (especially on sloping lands), or implementing new rotation cropping strategies such as maize-maize-fallow, maize-maize-sunflower, maize-soybean-fallow, and maize-soybean- sunflower, which have been shown to reduce erosion and improve soil fertility. An additional option for unproductive rice cultivation land and areas for riparian restoration is planting of bamboo species, which can be utilised in construction or sold as canes, shoots, or propagative cuttings. 8 China (State Forest Farms) China has a population of over 1.3 billion people and is the most populous country in the world.

As the most populated country on the planet, China needs its FLR programmes to address these other environmental and development needs at local and landscape level. If successful, their approaches and lessons learnt would be of great value to developing countries and regions. For the last decade or so, there have been multiple key FLR projects undertaken by IUCN in partnership with local government and NGO partners, including the Livelihood and Landscape Strategy (LLS), Megacities and Watersheds Initiative (MWI), and The Restoration Initiative (TRI). They focus on different aspects of conservation at the stakeholder, watershed, policy, and other levels. For LLS, which is applied primarily in the Miyun watershed (the drinking water reservoir for the 19 million residents of Beijing), there was a focus on field-level demonstration of integrated forest management practice compatible with development strategies through the implementation of a participatory forest management plan. Measures were also taken to improve local livelihoods and wellbeing, such as putting in place a sustainable energy use framework (energy efficient stoves and bedding systems); rural cooperation development; and a multi-stakeholder platform for the key stakeholders of Beijing municipality and Hebei province for information sharing, joint watershed management and restoration efforts, as well as discussion on PES schemes. MWI continued to the work in the Miyun Reservoir Watershed, which is a key source of Beijing\u2019s water supply. It includes work with three major work streams to a) demonstrate nature-based solutions in priority sub-basins, b) advocate for the watershed and increased institutional development, and c) monitor the results and use them to educate stakeholders, decision-makers, and the public. China\u2019s national attention is now turning towards improving the quality of forests and maximising ecosystem service benefits ranging from water regulation and carbon sequestration to the mitigation of natural disasters arising from climate variability and long-term change. The TRI project has the goal to reform logging lands to management zones, with 3 municipalities and forest landscapes in general. There is a focus on forest quality and soil and water conservation, using the metrics discovered to assess how the ROAM process can transform concerted local restoration efforts. This is a multi-tiered process involving a) a focus on State Forest Farms; b) use of FLR and SFF reform; c) intervention at the site, municipal, and national levels; and d) using field, policy, institutional, and knowledge-based components to outline the continued study. Specifically, the project will enable China\u2019s State Forestry Administration to develop and test new standards of planning, implementation, monitoring and ecosystem service valuation, building expertise and awareness to support longer-term and broader restoration initiatives far into the future. Centred around the state forest farm system of former production forests covering 8% of national territory, the project will increase collaboration across sectors 9 and scales to restore forest ecological functions and increase the benefits of forest ecosystem services to society.

Restoration of degraded forest landscapes would also enhance the mitigation and adaptation potential of the landscape and local communities to climate change. The ROAM assessment identified the following as the major drivers of landscape degradation in the state: forest fires, invasion by unwanted species (especially chir pine), free livestock grazing, landslides, increasing anthropogenic pressure, and growing community apathy towards agriculture and forest management. The assessment also provided an overview of the major restoration-related efforts undertaken by various agencies, both government and non-government, in the state and in the two intensive sample sites. Using multi-criteria spatial analysis, the assessment developed a functional degradation map for the state of Uttarakhand; functional degradation refers to the deterioration in quality and standard of performance of a functional unit or area due to degradation drivers. 11 Figure 3.4: Functional degradation map of Uttarakhand (Source map: Bhattacharjee et al., 2018) As per the assessment, nearly 69.4% of the state of Uttarakhand is experiencing some form of functional degradation, with 21% of the geographical area under high levels of degradation and 8.8% under very high levels of degradation. Most of the functional degradation is in the mid elevation zone (1,000\u20132,000 m asl). Using the functional degradation map as one of the base layers, along with other factors and criteria identified through stakeholder consultations, the assessment prepared an FLR priority map for the entire state of Uttarakhand. This is crucial because unless one knows where to restore and what the priority areas may be, a restoration plan will neither be feasible nor practical. The FLR priority map was prepared using multi-criteria spatial analysis, which examined a combination of ecological, social and biophysical factors such as forest density, forest type, population, poverty, elevation, slope, and aspect, among others. The FLR priority map can be used to facilitate holistic, collaborative planning and implementation of interventions by different agencies and avoid duplication of resources and efforts. 12 Figure 3.5: Forest landscape restoration priority map of Uttarakhand (Source map: Bhattacharjee et al., 2018) According to the assessment, 69.6% of the geographical area of the state is in need of restoration using the FLR approach, with 19.1% of the state having high FLR priority and 18.1% having very high FLR priority. The process identified the mid-elevation zone (1,000\u20132,000 m asl) as the highest FLR priority zone. This report presents the identified restoration interventions as per the stratification of the assessment area (i.e. altitudinal zones) of the state. The suggested restoration interventions for each altitudinal zone are summarised in table 2.3 below. 13 Table 3.2: Suggested restoration interventions for different elevation zones in Uttarakhand Elevation Zone Landscape characteristics Recommended restoration interventions High altitude zone (2,000\u20133,000 m asl) \u25cf Characterised by high tectonic activity, frequent landslides, intense precipitation, etc. \u25cf Rich in medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs), forests and biodiversity, alpine meadows and sacred natural sites \u25cf Disaster management \u27a2 Establishment of disaster management mechanisms (especially at district level) - repositories of all information - disaster maps, vulnerability analysis etc. \u27a2 Use of bio-engineering measures (mountain risk engineering techniques) for control of flash floods, soil erosion and small-scale hill slope instabilities \u27a2 Capacity building of community on disaster preparedness and mitigation \u25cf Forest protection through promotion of sacred groves/spiritual forests \u27a2 Documentation on sacred sites \u27a2 Documentation of the process, key players, results and incentives to improve the mechanisms through which communities create new sacred sites (dev vans) \u27a2 Documentation of case studies on community-notified sacred sites and their impact on regeneration of these sites \u27a2 Promotion of the concept of dev vans across the state and their scale up where possible \u25cf Promotion of livelihood options \u27a2 MAP cultivation (on abandoned cropland and community forests) \u27a2 Promotion of eco-tourism Mid altitude (1,000\u20132,000 m asl) \u25cf Forest-dominated region (a large part under community forests) \u25cf Rain-fed agriculture \u25cf Increasing urban centres \u25cf Chronic forest degradation through invasion of chir pine \u25cf Increasing water scarcity \u25cf Forest fire management \u27a2 Introduction and protection of broad-leaf and non-timber forest product (NTFP) species (e.g.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4de919ff-d13a-4840-aaaa-24e1b42c805a": {"__data__": {"id_": "4de919ff-d13a-4840-aaaa-24e1b42c805a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/application-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam-asia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Application of Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM) in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/application-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam-asia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "469551470fe50e58f9201695361436a0109b495b7cad67facbe8114f79db7184"}, "2": {"node_id": "19d6d7bb-cc79-4c7f-b3c7-841c262714b8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/application-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam-asia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7382e82144b6aab17430afd4431d3ab6366c82944c49373265591e31bafe7818"}}, "hash": "9863a1818ea3fb4d2f40db9bdf2ec4d7cb048469e17d643cc51dad91bc14619e", "text": "Kaifal (Myrica esculenta) and Amla (Emblica officinalis) in areas occupied by chir pine.

Some of the recommended strategies are already being adopted in the state. For instance, the District Magistrate in Pithoragarh district has started organising a GIS cell under him to ensure convergence of all mapping exercises within the district. The Uttarakhand forest department has also started identification and restoration of dry springs in forested areas. 15 Indonesia (Tanjung Panjang landscape) Indonesia is one of the world\u2019s largest island countries, and home to the second most endemic species of any country. The country spans 1.9 million km2, with 257.6 million people living in the island nation, 46% of those as rural populations. Much of Indonesia\u2019s (non-mangrove) deforestation is due to palm oil plantations, which have cleared over 18 million ha of native forests for the expansion of oil palm. Indonesia also has much of its mangrove forests and coastline being degraded at unsustainable rates, and the land converted into aquaculture ponds and agricultural areas. Indonesia has committed to restoring 4.7 million ha of these degraded areas by 2020, which is a 2.5% increase in forest cover, bringing the total official forest cover to 56.5% countrywide. The Indonesian study site was focused on mangrove forest landscape restoration (MFLR) in Tanjung Panjang, Gorantalo, a critically degraded Indonesian coastal landscape. Tanjung Panjang mangrove cover has reduced from 8,847 ha to some 3,500 ha, about 40% of its primary cover, mainly due to the rapid expansion of fish aquaculture run by South Sulawesi fish farmers. While there were both political willingness and a local policy framework for restoration, tenure disputes coupled with stakeholder conflicts have yet to see much progress. Figure. 3.6: Trend analysis depicting mangrove cover change (pink) between 1994-2015 for Pohuwato District. The map depicts reduction from 8,847 to 3,543 ha of mangroves over a 21-year period. (Source map: Brown et al, 2015) Through the ROAM process, both the biophysical and socio-economic conditions for restoration were reviewed and stakeholders were facilitated to discuss common grounds on restoration objectives, priorities, timeframes and ecological restoration techniques. Currently, stakeholders have developed three mangrove restoration scenarios in the landscape, totalling 2,493 ha of mangrove restoration priorities out of the landscape of around 5000 ha.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "849e04c4-2bea-43ed-be0c-081a66438314": {"__data__": {"id_": "849e04c4-2bea-43ed-be0c-081a66438314", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/application-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam-asia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Application of Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM) in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/application-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam-asia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "766a8ec2267ec0e5c94be5c90ae3ea475477064762b7d590cd907761a5bfc7f3"}, "2": {"node_id": "10ca5ccf-5448-4343-9e5a-adda4de9f02c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/application-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam-asia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "98917f17e9926ba6989b37c75b04a6228aace855b82d0dd4e0087ef9ccafcb5c"}}, "hash": "27de2c99c875f3375041b6a25796046caac2f20b1968abdf1097f9f116d8edb8", "text": "The three phases of restoration vary in terms of the extent of ecological restoration implementation in degraded mangrove areas: Scenario 1 calls for conservative mangrove restoration (133 ha); scenario 2 calls for essential ecotone restoration (842 ha), and scenario 3 calls for more ambitious mangrove restoration coverage (2,493 ha). 16 Figure 3.7: Scenario III: Mangrove Forest Landscape Restoration includes 2493 ha of mangrove restoration and 525 ha of hinterland agroforestry enhancement (Source map: Brown, 2018) The main method of restoration identified primary areas and plans for ecological mangrove restoration (EMR), which requires human-assisted natural and hydrological amendment.

Overall, there is a positive ecosystem services benefit from restoring the landscape but the main challenge remains that more market-based incentives should be imposed. More incentives will help fish-farms to switch to more sustainable land-use models. Implementation of either Scenario 2 or 3 will require alternative livelihood generation and proper compensation. Despite the positive ecosystem services gain, various future barriers exist that could impede these restoration scenarios in the future. One of the key barriers identified by stakeholders is insufficient incentives and funds for rehabilitation. Within the current system, restoration methods can be funded through a variety of potential sources, such as government, private foundations, private corporations, development banks, and multilateral institutions. Other financial opportunities are possible, but less likely at a landscape-level scale of restoration. Finance analysis reveals that numerous institutions, both national and international, have mechanisms in place and interest in supporting FLR in Tanjung Panjang. In light of this challenge associated with tangible financial incentives, a special study was commissioned through the ROAM process on the carbon mitigation impacts of the three restoration scenarios, in the hope of exploring the possibility of tapping into carbon finance. When annual returns on a per ha-1 basis from other afforestation / reforestation (A / R) projects and REDD+ projects are compared to the potential mangrove A / R of aquaculture ponds at Tanjung Panjang under Scenarios 2 and 3 (-32.94 Mg CO2e ha-1 year-1), results indicate that mangroves may be highly competitive purely from a carbon returns perspective (leaving aside consideration of project implementation costs) with an emissions mitigation potential ~2-4 times greater than that of other currently listed A / R and REDD+ projects encompassing various habitat types (figure 2.9). 18 Fig. 3.9: Comparison of potential net ERR resultant from mangrove restoration of aquaculture ponds at Tanjung Panjang with other A / R and REDD+ projects.

While the uptake of FLR strategy is yet to be fully realised, during the final validation phase of ROAM, the results of scenario 1 were adopted by the Planning Agency of Gorotalo Province (BAPPEDA) for inclusion in the 2018 budget and planning process. Myanmar Myanmar has undertaken an ambitious plan to restore 1.2 million ha of forest cover to the country by 2026, mainly through its National Rehabilitation and Restoration Plan (NRRP). This would amount to a 2% increase in forest cover, but means immensely more, as it would also stall a deforestation rate from logging that is the third highest in the world (a rate of roughly 1% loss per year for the past 100 years) In light of the forest loss in Myanmar and its government\u2019s plan to restore ecosystems for the benefit of Myanmar\u2019s people and environment, IUCN conducted a national ROAM mapping process from January 2017 to January 2018, with funding from the UK Department for International Development (DFID) International Forestry Knowledge (KNOWFOR) programme, and The Nature Conservancy (TNC). The ROAM process identifies strategically important geographical areas in Myanmar to address key FLR objectives, including \u2022 Supporting Myanmar to recover from its forest loss, \u2022 protecting key watersheds which are the foundation of production activities depended on by millions of rural people, and; \u2022 protecting key biodiversity areas, The identification of objectives and the consequential multi-criteria mappings were conducted in a participatory manner with extensive consultation at national and field levels. The final outcome was 19 produced in support of the National Reforestation and Rehabilitation Program in Myanmar (NRRPM), which was approved in 2016, as well as other restoration efforts in Myanmar, including the Global Environment Facility (GEF)-funded The Restoration Initiative (TRI).

Priority FLR areas include the dry deciduous forest of central Sagaing Region, the mangroves of northern Rakhine State and the Ayeyarwady Delta, the lowland evergreen forest of southern Tanintharyi Region, and the mixed deciduous forest of the Bago Yoma. The map is indicative only. The identification of specific FLR sites requires on-the-ground assessments. A multi-criteria spatial analysis guided by FLR principles has been completed in Myanmar (see figure 3.10) to appropriately combat both deforestation and other barriers for effective ROAM and FLR strategy implementation. The generated maps culminate in an overarching \u201cForest Landscape Restoration Opportunities\u201d map for the country, which includes data on forest degradation rates, exclusion zones, and overlapping priority areas, along with additional valuable metrics such as watershed and biodiversity conservation priority zones. This ROAM analysis identified 2.5 million hectares as key FLR opportunity areas, and determined from this data that 713,000 hectares were considered high-priority areas, with 1.9 million hectares classified as river basins that have more than 10% of their land covered by these FLR priority areas. 20 Figure 3.10: Myanmar FLR Opportunities Map (Source map: Constable et al, 2018) 21 Viet Nam (Quang Tri Province) Landscape challenges and goals Located on the Demilitarised Zone, Quang Tri Province of Viet Nam was devastated during the American War. Following the economic reforms initiated in the late 1980s, the province embraced forest restoration by planting fast-growing eucalyptus and acacia species. Forest cover quickly increased from 98,000 hectares in 1989 to 235,000 hectares in 2016. However, forest quality is generally low, and plantations are almost entirely geared toward short rotation acacia for low-value wood chip. Meanwhile, natural forest has declined. The spatial analysis of the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility shows that between 2005 and 2015, Quang Tri lost 35,000 hectares of natural forest, which was offset by a 57,000- hectare increase in plantations, resulting in a net forest gain of 22,000 hectares. The planned conversion of natural forest to plantations has been accelerated by rules that allow forest below a certain volume per hectare to be converted to plantation. Virtually all of Quang Tri\u2019s good- quality natural forest is confined to two special-use forests (SUFs) or protected areas. Quang Tri also faces increased pressure on its forests from expanding agriculture. The expansion of cassava cultivation on steep slopes is of particular concern. The expected increase in droughts, intensive rainfall events, storms, and pests and diseases in north-central Viet Nam as a result of climate change further undermines the resilience of forest landscapes and forest-dependent communities, demanding a strong and strategic approach to cope with these challenges. In collaboration with Quang Tri Province, IUCN conducted a ROAM study to map FLR opportunities. Provincial stakeholders defined three FLR goals: 1. Increase forest biodiversity and quality. 2. Enhance ecosystem services (including watershed protection, erosion prevention and habitats for biodiversity). 3. Improve livelihoods for local people to reduce incentives to encroach on the forest. FLR options Four FLR options were identified to help meet these goals: 1) enrichment planting and assisted natural regeneration (EP/ANR) in degraded natural forest, 2) extended rotation (ER) and 3) native species introduction (NSI) in plantations, and 4) soil and water conservation (SWC) in rain-fed agriculture. 1. EP/ANR are used to increase the density of desired tree species in degraded natural forests and the protection and preservation of natural tree seedlings in forested areas; these techniques improve forest quality and biodiversity, reduce erosion, improve water quality, and can provide an alternative source of income for farmers and landholders. 2.

For FLR purposes, \u201cpoor evergreen forest\u201d and \u201cbare land with regenerating trees\u201d within SUFs were prioritised for EP/ANR since it will be easier to restore forests within a protected area. To reduce forest fragmentation and enhance biodiversity, a corridor is proposed to connect the two SUFs and allow wildlife to move between them. Short rotation plantations frequently expose soil to erosion. To reduce soil loss and its impact of water quality through longer rotations, an assessment was made of plantation types in major upstream river basins; 16,674 hectares of acacia plantations were identified for ER. Family holdings of less than 3 hectares covering 3,141 hectares were excluded because ER is not economically feasible on such small holdings. ER is recommended for all plantations larger than 3 hectares. NSI is recommended for plantations larger than 10 hectares as this requires a longer timeframe to financially \u201cbreak even.\u201d Given the growing demand for legal timber from Viet Nam\u2019s booming wooden furniture sector, sustainable forest management certification like FSC is relevant to all sizes of timber from plantations. The advantages of FSC certification may be particularly important for small, family-owned plantations. The Revised Uniform Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) was used to map areas at risk of soil erosion based on maximum rainfall, slope length and steepness, and erosion-susceptibility of land cover type. Based on this analysis, 27% of rainfed agriculture, almost 25,000 hectares, is at high risk of erosion and recommended for SWC. Most of this 27% is in mountainous areas in the west of the province, mostly in Huong Hoa District, the main cassava growing area. Another 11,600 hectares of transitional area with high erosion risk (especially in the south) were identified that show extensive signs of human use. Due to the dynamic and small-scale nature of agriculture (mainly swidden) in these areas, it is difficult to target them with specific interventions; they require further attention. Benefits, costs and barriers FLR options were assessed in terms of benefits, costs and barriers. EP/ANR are effective in restoring degraded natural forest and enhancing biodiversity, but their costs are high and vary greatly depending on the amount of labour required, and success depends strongly on follow-up and maintenance. Alternatives were explored to transition short rotation acacia plantations.

The application of fertiliser optimised for cassava allows for continuous cropping and increased yields pay back the higher fertiliser cost within two years. 24 Intercropping is financially attractive but labour intensive. Cross-slope barriers are particularly effective at preventing erosion on steep slopes but yield increases take longer to materialise. These FLR options make the forest landscape and its communities more resilient to climate change by reducing the impact of storms, high-intensity rainfall, pests and diseases, especially when combined with measures that increase the diversity of tree species. They also contribute to the conservation of carbon stocks and increased carbon sequestration. On a per unit area basis, the highest potential gains are from natural forest regeneration. But in terms of total carbon sequestration over 25-30 years, the highest gains come from agricultural land because this covers a much larger area. This demonstrates the need for a landscape approach to FLR. Enabling conditions Four factors are considered critical for successful FLR: 1) motivation of key actors, 2) capacity and resources for implementation, 3) policy support and enforcement; and 4) access to markets and value chains. In Viet Nam, factors both support and impede FLR. For example, a high degree of tenure security allows farmers to invest in higher-value timber species, but the need to generate immediate income forces most farmers to rely on short rotation acacia for low-value wood chip. Similarly, logging bans often lead farmers to engage in \u201ccut and run\u201d logging rather than in sustainable harvesting of natural forest, which a series of pilot projects in Viet Nam has shown to be profitable. An issue in Quang Tri is the dominance of acacia, which has expanded across the province. This has resulted in the rapid increase in forest cover and rehabilitation of degraded lands. However, the large- scale monocultures that dominate the province are vulnerable to disease and declining quality, which is a growing economic risk. The almost exclusive focus on acacia has resulted in the forestry sector, from research to extension to marketing, becoming \u201cacacia-ized,\u201d which limits the scope for the province to move up the value chain by investing in ER and NSI. There is also a significant lack of technical capacity at the provincial level to support the availability of high quality native tree species seedlings, sophisticated silviculture methods (beyond \u201cplant and cut\u201d), or FSC certification. In the agricultural sector, the rapid expansion of cassava on steep slopes increases soil erosion and threatens natural forests. The International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) has tested a range of SWC measures in Viet Nam, but smallholder adoption is low, partly because of the high labour requirements and uncertain yield increases. This is an area where government can play a key role by strictly protecting the remaining areas of natural forest and training farmers in sustainable intensification while improving access to inputs. The key barriers to FLR are not only technical but also financial, policy-related, and institutional. Except for EP/ANR, all proposed FLR options are profitable, albeit often over relatively long time periods and in most cases with high up-front costs, which may be unaffordable to farmers. This is where government can alleviate financial bottlenecks that would allow the forestry sector to achieve its full potential. A focus on forest quantity rather than quality remains a key policy and institutional barrier. Nationally, forest cover is rising but this is almost exclusively due to monoculture plantations with very low biodiversity value. Shifting priority from quantity to quality would require reforms at the highest level of government. Under the revised 2017 Forestry Law all national sectorial plans will have to incorporate environmental protection, biodiversity conservation and climate change, providing an opportunity to accelerate FLR. 25 Figure 3.11: Priority Restoration Areas in Quang Tri Province, Viet Nam (Source map: Rizzetti et al., 2018) 26 4 FLR Programme opportunities There are many past and on-going FLR initiatives across Asia-Pacific, whether the ROAM methodology has been applied or not.

To approach this 70% goal, forest cover would need to return to 1940 levels, which requires sustainable native plantations and rapid action. Priority targets for Lao PDR involve addressing the rampant deforestation of native forests, instead producing a positive annual net forest cover rate, reaching 1.5 million hectares restored by 2020. More than 50% of Lao PDR\u2019s GDP results from agriculture, forestry, livestock, and fisheries, so a sustainable reforestation of the country will require a multifaceted and dynamic approach. Currently, Lao PDR is putting together a viable FLR plan through national forest restoration policies. These policies must incentivise private citizens and households to restore forests for environmental protection and conservation and remove incentives for deforestation as a purely commercial process. Many organisations are aiding the Lao PDR government to put together an affective plan, with the United Nations Development Programme stating that environmental protection of Lao PDR\u2019s national resources is critical for sustainable economic growth and effective poverty reduction. Additionally, FAO is currently supporting implementation of FLR in Lao PDR (in line with government strategy) through the \u201cTechnical Cooperation Programme\u201d project labelled \u201cPromoting Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR) in Selected Southeast Asian Countries.\u201d Habitat loss and degradation are primarily caused by: 1. Forest product extraction 2. Infrastructure expansion 3. Wildfires 4. Conversion of forests to and expansion of agricultural land Unclear policy initiatives and the current lack of a national forest restoration programme are still the main barriers for FLR in Lao PDR, but national meetings with NGOs, government agencies, and other key stakeholders are currently underway to develop the best solutions for successful implementation of ROAM and other effective FLR options. Sri Lanka Sri Lanka has a land area of 65,610 km2, a population of nearly 21 million, and has a current forest 27 cover of 29.7%. The country has lost more than 70% of its vegetative cover, while also being home to more than 1,700 endemic species that are threatened by rampant deforestation and land degradation nationwide. Currently, forest cover has been increasing slowly since 2010 after sinking to 22% cover in 2010. Most of the land use in Sri Lanka consists of forestry, which relates directly to 29.7% of remaining forest cover in the country. Home gardens use roughly 15% of the land, with economic crops (coconut, tea, and rubber production) making up 10% of land use. Sri Lanka does not yet have a planned FLR strategy, but is looking towards other successful initiatives in ROAM pilot countries to attempt the framework in its own study side. Sri Lanka\u2019s pledge of 200,000 hectares in support of the Bonn Challenge to be completed by 2020 requires the nation to take a significant measure towards conservation on a national scale, and address barriers that may impede future FLR implementation. Possible FLR opportunities going forward, for funding in particular, involve the National REDD+ Investment Framework and Action Plan, pledging US $100 million in 5 years. An additional opportunity is the Eco-Systems Conservation and Management Project (ESCAMP) \u2013 funded by The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs \u2013 pledging roughly US $75 million from 2017-2021 to fund applications of FLR in local and community settings. This involves general conservation and restoration of small tank cascade systems as practical approaches to better meet the Sri Lanka government\u2019s targets set forth under the Bonn Challenge. Additionally, the expansion of Kandyan home gardens would help to meet the general goal of creating 10,000 more Blue-Green villages. Guided by the UN- REDD Programme, these villages will be created to maintain economic growth, minimise natural disaster risk, and conserve biodiversity in a structured and focused manner. Presently, Sri Lanka faces complex challenges, but has significant funding and interested parties that are ready to implement designated FLR policies. Currently, the country is at the \u201creadiness phase,\u201d setting the ground for future FLR initiatives.

The migrant labour of 5,000 unexpected refugees has resulted in land tenure, improper agriculture, and land cost and availability issues. There is a need for a new and pragmatic approach to restoration in Doi Mae Salong both in terms of its ecological value as well as the community livelihoods. By request of the Royal Thai Army, IUCN supported and implemented an FLR project called the \u201cLivelihoods and Landscapes Strategy\u201d, which used a multi-stakeholder platform to restore the Doi Mae Salong landscape. This project has adopted a participatory approach to negotiate a landscape vision to reduce poverty and enhance forest quality. Stakeholder negotiations were conducted on land-use trade-offs and agricultural productivity to inhibit and reduce the incentive of further illegal encroachment on forested 28 areas. Priority restoration areas were steep slopes and headwaters, and environments that were key to maintaining ecosystem health, and water and soil quality. Land use planning and zoning would be paramount, and school environmental education would help prevent degradation in the future. The key concern for the local community is development prospects, so creating community-based ecotourism and other alternative livelihood options would help to combat deforestation while slowing transforming local ecology to a sustainable model. The key is to balance different stakeholder needs and create common ground that would be the foundation of the long-term sustainability of such projects. It is important to scale up and replicate FLR approaches in order to support Thailand\u2019s ambition of restoring 40% of its land to be under forest cover, an estimated increase of 2.3 million ha of restored land. IUCN Thailand is working with the PTT7 Forest Restoration Institute, an organisation that has many projects of various sizes in place extending throughout the country. There are also conservation and education facilities in place in the form of the Toyota Eco Forest restoration and learning centre. This facility and various other financiers (such as the Thailand Business Council for Sustainable Development) will allow the possibility for restoration at proposed study sites. 7 PTT Public Company Limited, or simply PTT, (Thai: \u0e1b\u0e15\u0e17) is a Thai state-owned SET-listed oil and gas company. It is formerly known as the Petroleum Authority of Thailand. 29 5 Comparing ROAM processes across different landscapes In this chapter, a comparison between different ROAM processes is provided. Attempts are made to draw common lessons learnt. ROAM analysis and process Scale: In general, the scale of ROAM analyses in each country was done on a municipal or multi- provincial level (Cambodia, China, Viet Nam), with India and Indonesia focusing on a state or larger area of the country, and Myanmar at a national scale. Data quality (type and quality): Data quality is high for most global and national data concerning landscape type and degradation levels. Socioeconomic and demographic data (concerning stakeholders and local information) is most readily available in China, India, Indonesia, and Viet Nam, with limited access among other countries. Data concerning forest canopy condition, plantations and agriculture, land tenure, and economic metrics can be improved across the board. Nature and extent of interaction with stakeholders (led by IUCN with consultation; collaborative or shared; or led by partners): The majority of countries led or co-led stakeholder consultations and collaborations, with several countries partnering with other organisations (Cambodia with FAO; Indonesia with Blue Forests, JAPESDA, and KKMD Gorontalo Province; Myanmar with TNC). Additionally, countries worked in coordination with local and national governments (Cambodia, China, India, and Viet Nam) at varying landscape scales. Indonesia was a unique example, with intensive stakeholder surveys completed by over 20 institutions and partner NGOs, providing a complex local analysis of the region. The landscape (issues relevant to deforestation and forest degradation) Area (size): Study site sizes (approximate) in ascending order from smallest to largest: 1. Indonesia: around 5000 ha 2. Viet Nam: 473,630 ha 3. Cambodia: 3,704,738 ha 4. China: 4,800,000 ha 5.

Additionally, the size of population indirectly relates to the complexity of issues and the costs involved in the ROAM process. Interaction with stakeholders can be increasingly difficult with larger study site populations. Indonesia in particular showed significant success with stakeholders due to its small study site population, though India\u2019s intensive stakeholder surveys are evidence that higher population sites may still generate valuable stakeholder information. Forest extent and condition: The country study sites in general experienced quite substantial forest loss in the last 2-3 decades. In general, study sites are experiencing forest loss (Cambodia, Indonesia, and Myanmar), except two countries (China and Viet Nam) which can largely be attributed to the increase in tree plantation. The combination of forest loss and national targets on increasing forest cover gains have implications for framing the restoration mentality to more target-driven rehabilitation approaches which are not aligned with FLR. Forest tenure and management: Forest tenure stability varied across ROAM countries, with some countries experiencing highly unstable tenures prone to high value logging and agri-development and commercial plantations such as palm oil, rubber, and acacia (Cambodia and Myanmar). China and Viet 31 Nam experienced more stability, with most forested land owned by households or communes or by forestry-focused branches of the government. Due to historical reasons, land management in India and Indonesia have been influenced by various types of land tenure and traditions. In general, unclear tenure and sometimes conflicting legal and policy frameworks of tenure systems are common issues in Asia, hindering any progress towards coherent and sustainable landscape governance by local communities, multiple government agencies, and other stakeholders. Degradation drivers: All landscapes face multiple degradation drivers, but the most common are deforestation and degradation for land conversion for economic production purpose, such as agriculture land use in Cambodia and Myanmar, aquaculture in Indonesia and partially Cambodia, and land degradation due to plantation with limited ecological benefits in China, India and Viet Nam. In some countries, such as Cambodia, India, and Myanmar, populations continue to increase and the need for additional land development is expected to continue or even accelerate. Illegal logging for luxury timber and fuelwood demand are additional common occurrences, with mismanagement of these forest areas by individuals, companies, and national governments only worsening this issue. Some countries struggle with forest degradation due to forest fires (Cambodia, India and Myanmar), though others struggle for reasons more unique to their particular landscapes (mining in northern Myanmar and landslides in the Himalayan regions of India). Key stakeholders within the landscape: Locating key stakeholders in a respective landscape leads to more efficient restoration initiatives and effective combat of degradation drivers. Every country works with different governance institutions, both nationally and locally. For example, forest departments often act as government representation of forest land management, while agriculture departments also have significant influence on other land uses that are an integral part of landscapes. Virtually every ROAM process works closely with forest departments and agricultural departments or owners of agricultural land. Every ROAM landscape worked with local community members and organisations to varying degrees, from extensive community consultation in India on one end, to information gathering on local land use practices in Myanmar on the other end. Several countries (India, Indonesia, and Viet Nam) also actively engaged with local NGOs to facilitate the ROAM process and mobilise local stakeholders. Due to its national-level focus, the Myanmar ROAM process was generally more government-focused and used parallel processes (project preparation for The Restoration Initiative funded by GEF) to collect on-the-ground information on stakeholder involvement. The Viet Nam ROAM process engaged with a wide range of government agencies, community representatives, plantation owners, NGOs and research organisations to facilitate an integrated planning of forestry transition strategy for Quang Tri \u2013 from low-quality forest plantation-based forestry to high-quality forestry industry supported by resilient forested landscape. Indonesia involves the University of Gorontalo in addition to other institutions, coordinating with researchers to further strengthen current conservation efforts.

Myanmar: 713,000 ha in northern Rakhine, Ayeyarwady Delta, Bago Yoma, southern Tanintharyi, and central Sagaing Most priority sites are near areas prone to rapid deforestation, bodies of water, and sites at risk of urbanisation or land conversion. Additionally, locations near lower socioeconomic zones will likely be at a greater risk of deforestation and timber poaching. Proposed FLR interventions: Every country had priority FLR interventions focused solely on general restoration (e.g. improving corridors to aid biodiversity, mangrove and protected forest replanting strategies, and improving local soil and water quality). There were a few other similar themes between FLR strategies focused on agroforestry and silviculture (in Cambodia, China, India, and Viet Nam), and valuable restoration-founded approaches to sustainable livelihood development. In line with silviculture, several countries see the importance of the timber industry and high value timber sales to incentivise conservation, restore degraded land, and provide employment (Cambodia, China, India, and Viet Nam). Various countries prioritise local and government partnerships paired with proper programme management as key FLR interventions, focusing on staff and work efficiency in conjunction with effective conservation (China, India, and Myanmar). India in particular focused on forest fire and landslide disaster management, as Uttarakhand is rife with natural disasters that can impede conservation efforts. FLR financing opportunities: These vary across different countries and landscapes. Generally, programmes utilised government financing on the regional, state, and national levels to fund FLR initiatives. In some cases, FAO or another organisation was able to provide funding as well (Cambodia). Additionally, several countries looked towards the private sector and international donors to provide capital for restoration projects (India, Indonesia). Funding options using financial mechanisms such as GEF or GCF funds are being utilised in Cambodia and Myanmar as alternative financing strategies. Viet Nam is an interesting country case, as many sustainable plantation models are self-financing but require improved targeting and monitoring of state funding, bank credit and institutional arrangements between value chains actors to overcome financial bottlenecks and ensure a stable and high-quality supply of timber. Sustainable options such as these, or a more aggressive and measured approach to generating finances, could assist the creation of larger-scale FLR projects in Asia. Key barriers to effective FLR implementation: Available funding is a constant concern and barrier to FLR implementation in every country, with a limited budget hampering effective conservation initiatives at local and national levels. Costs for certain programmes are not sufficient in several countries (Cambodia and Viet Nam). This lack of funding, coupled with the lack of capacity or unclear policy and education of staff and stakeholders (Cambodia, China, and India) makes it increasingly difficult to implement FLR at any scale. A constant impediment to FLR is continued human encroachment and the resulting land conversion from forests into agricultural and developed areas (Cambodia, Indonesia, and). Weak market linkages and value chain difficulties hamstring several countries that are focused on the implementation of specific sustainable livelihood initiatives (India, Indonesia, and Viet Nam). Enabling factors Policy support (national policies, NDCs, Bonn Challenge commitments, etc.): Every country is committed to meeting their respective Bonn Challenge goals, ultimately attempting to restore 350 million 33 hectares of degraded land by 2030. Additionally, China and Myanmar are committed to GEF TRI projects currently and into the coming years, with Myanmar also looking at a possible GCF FLR project. Every country is supplementing their Bonn Challenge commitments with national and local government policies targeting forest cover and corridor restoration (e.g. National Law 88 in Indonesia, focused on the restoration of protected areas). Several countries have additional policy support (e.g. Viet Nam with REDD+, PRAP, and FCPF proposals for their Quang Tri site), with others working at different levels of connectedness with their respective national and local governments to develop effective policy support.

Country and local experts must work closely with government bodies (such as forest departments), local NGOs, research institutes, and stakeholders to further improve FLR implementation in every country. Institutional and stakeholder support (motivation): Overall, institutional and stakeholder support remains steadfast in essentially every country. Local and national governments see the importance of FLR and sustainable community and alternative livelihood development, as do the stakeholders in these areas. Enforcement of these FLR plans put in place by strong support networks is important to ensuring continued stakeholder engagement and that institutional statements of support are upheld. In landscapes that are more advanced in FLR implementation, local heads of the government, especially line agencies and government representation outside of the forest sector, play a crucial role. However, this continues to be overlooked in many restoration programmes, due to the different 34 disciplinary backgrounds practitioners have and the institutional barriers. A potential strategy to overcome this difficulty is to identify common goals and shared interests, which again highlight the role of stakeholder engagement and consensus-building. Markets and value chains: Primary markets and value chains for every country generally involve the agriculture and timber industries, with certified timber or hardwood and luxury tree plantations, wild capture fisheries, intercropping-friendly products, and medicinal plants underlining the reach and complexity of the possible market for sustainable FLR initiatives. Certain programmes (such as in Myanmar and Viet Nam) have more-developed value chains than some other countries with burgeoning markets or markets with varying rates of success (Cambodia, China, India, and Indonesia). In general, there is significant room for improvement in this realm for every country. 35 6 Scaling up FLR strategies It is clear that FLR offers countries, especially the environmental and agriculture ministries, the potential to demonstrate leadership and innovation, both nationally and internationally. Nationally, environmental and agriculture ministries can push their governments to include restoration activities as national policies and priorities. This is important because restoration activities can contribute to other long-term national goals, such as alleviating poverty and hunger, building sustainable cities and communities, ensuring clean water and sanitation, and improving the country\u2019s economy and societal well-being in the long run8. At an international level, environmental and agriculture ministries have demonstrated global leadership in aligning restoration programmes with Sustainable Development Goals in recent years. By championing restoration, ministers can expose their governments to international financing for environmental and sustainable development-focused projects. Regional experience shows that the use of ROAM can support the application of FLR principles within national and landscape contexts, as described in Chapters 3 and 4. The challenge is how to adopt FLR at scale, particularly tackling the financial bottleneck of scaling up FLR in the Asia-Pacific region. This segment of the report focuses on how national FLR initiative can be better supported going forwards, with a strong focus on identifying financing opportunities. Restoration efforts are often perceived to be costly, slow and only for the environmental good. This is only true when the approach to restoration is solely for timber production, is based on large-scale plantation, and is not integrated into other sectorial programmes. It is for this reason that an integrated approach to land restoration and complementary financing must be followed. The multi-objective, integrated landscape approach FLR is based on presents major opportunities for governments to mobilise new sources of international financing and innovative public and private investments. A recent economic analysis of the potential benefits of restoration, carried out by IUCN, demonstrated that the returns on restoration are much quicker than often assumed. For example, contributions to soil and water conservation through agroforestry and better watershed management can start to manifest tangible benefits within two to three years. Mangrove restoration in coastal areas begins to show returns within the first year with respect to improvements in fish stocks and fishery-based livelihoods, as even young mangrove saplings are highly effective at protecting juvenile fish from predation. As rural communities are interested in a range of non-timber products \u2013not just timber or fibre \u2013 enclosure of degraded areas and management of natural regeneration can see important goods and services return after two to three years. Nevertheless, estimates of total financial allocation for land use mitigation and adaptation range from US $1.3 billion to 51.8 billion per year. A critical gap exists between current financing for FLR needs and the action steps necessary to realise stated commitments. Funding for FLR will need to come from a portfolio of public and private sector sources, but in order to attract private sector investment, public investment in pilot experiences must be facilitated, reinforced and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f78fee22-f679-4696-b5fa-a2183e9197c3": {"__data__": {"id_": "f78fee22-f679-4696-b5fa-a2183e9197c3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/application-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam-asia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Application of Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM) in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/application-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam-asia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "97c6e4de8f445ca56d6630bd0e3477af0d431a73da40f13a555c1c45fa99227d"}}, "hash": "97c6e4de8f445ca56d6630bd0e3477af0d431a73da40f13a555c1c45fa99227d", "text": "scaled to match the demands of the 8 United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015; Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015- 2030. 36 market. Unlocking private finance requires the right architecture, including innovative financial instruments and an appropriate domestic regulatory environment within national strategies. It is clear that bridging the gap between investors and investees and making the case to both groups to engage in FLR investments is a vital ingredient for achieving scale. In addition, refined strategies that promote commercially viable FLR options and enhance opportunities for private-public partnerships, with a keen focus on benefits to land owners and particularly smallholder farmers, would be beneficial. International initiatives like the Bonn Challenge can play a key role in mobilising finance for FLR. Countries and jurisdictions that commit to the Bonn Challenge send a strong signal to donors and investors that political will to implement restoration and create an enabling environment for FLR is present. Bonn Challenge commitments also provide a platform for countries and jurisdictions to raise awareness of in-country restoration opportunities and needs for donors, investors, and other stakeholders. Underpinning the Bonn Challenge is an extensive and growing network of practitioners and resources that stand ready to assist countries in planning and implementing FLR. Asian countries have the potential to become global leaders in the international push against land degradation. This significant role can only be fully realised if countries and communities are able to pursue and deliver a balanced package of locally defined forest goods and services. To achieve a successful policy, FLR excels at bringing people together to identify and implement appropriate restoration activities ranging from agroforestry, to planting native tree species, to watershed protection and much more. By actively addressing degradation and considering key stakeholders\u2019 needs, Asian governments can present innovative development models to the world that satisfy the needs of social, economic and environmental development. Multilateral and bilateral donor funding Official Development Assistance (ODA) has been a major source of financing for environmental projects in many Asian countries over the last 30 years. The ODA comes from two sources, namely bilateral (official, from country to country in the form of international cooperation) and multilateral (official arrangements between international monetary institutions and countries and in the form of international cooperation from United Nations agencies). International institutions that mobilise resources for mitigation and adaptation, such as the GCF and GEF, have included forest landscape restoration as a priority in their investment portfolios. The GEF intends to expand its support for restoration in the coming GEF-7 restoration cycle. A recent analysis by the GEF Secretariat found restoration and reforestation to be the most frequently occurring theme in GEF country INDCs, NBSAPs, NAPs, as it was present in 98% of GEF-eligible countries\u2019 policy frameworks. The strategy provides options for tackling the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation and aims to support improved management in 20 million hectares of forest landscapes. Since its inception in 1991, the GEF has financed over 300 projects and programmes focusing on forest conservation and management in developing countries, amounting to more than US $1.6 billion total, which it supplemented by leveraging US $5 billion from other sources. In the period from 1991 to 2008, the GEF funded 79 initiatives focused on Sustainable Forest Management and 61 projects focused on land degradation9. This creates a solid opportunity to strengthen the mobilisation of innovative and enhanced levels of financing for the restoration of degraded lands. Restoration of deforested and degraded landscape to address climate change challenges presents opportunities for countries to tap into one of the biggest funding sources for forest management and restoration \u2013 the Green Climate Fund (GCF). Currently, the GCF has over US $10 billion in assets, 9 GEF online reference needed here 37 raised over a period of six years from developed country donors, and has a mandate to fund 50% mitigation and 50% adaptation projects10. The GCF board identified forest and land use as one of five cross-cutting investment priorities. Currently, GCF projects that fall under this area include Sustainable Landscapes in Eastern Madagascar, Building Resilient Communities, Wetlands Ecosystems and Associated Catchments in Uganda, and Bhutan for Life. These support improved protected area (PA) management and increased forestry and land use for climate change mitigation11. The GCF board has also defined six investment criteria that all GCF projects must demonstrate in order to receive GCF support. These include the potential for a paradigm shift in the management of environmental resources. One way in which GCF projects can meet this requirement is through the use of innovative financing opportunities, like micro-business loans and personal community loan funds.

However, there is still the need to look into new ways to increase the amount of multilateral funds directed to FLR in the region. There are a number of emerging funders from the Asia region that would provide additional support for investing in FLR. These include new ODA sources from a number of large economies such as China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. Public sector expenditure Domestic public financing is the major source of financing for forestry activities in Asia, which generally comes from government budgetary allocations to official forestry institutions and revenue generated from state-owned forests. Proactive countries have developed integrated financing strategies and mechanisms blending different capital sources (national, international, public, and private) to invest in FLR in both in their readiness and implementation phases. 10 OECD (2016), 2020 projections of Climate Finance towards the USD 100 billion goal: Technical Note, OECD Publishing https://www.oecd.org/environment/cc/Projecting%20Climate%20Change%202020%20WEB.pdf 11 Source: https://www.greenclimate.fund/what-we-do/projects-programmes#gcf-project 12 https://www.thegef.org/council-meetings/gef-7-replenishment-first-meeting) CASE STUDY: BUILDING THE FOUNDATION FOR FOREST LANDSCAPE RESTORATION AT SCALE The GEF, in partnership with WRI and the United Nations Environment Program (UN Environment), is supporting the \u201cBuilding the Foundation for Forest Landscape Restoration at Scale\u201d project operating in five countries including India and Indonesia. This project is helping these countries to identify restoration opportunities, define FLR commitments, and create enabling environments for FLR. This project was followed by a larger GEF-supported programme on FLR, \u201cThe Restoration Initiative (TRI),\u201d implemented by IUCN in partnership with FAO and UN Environment, and operating in 10 Asian and African countries including China, Myanmar and Pakistan. Among the interventions supported by TRI is a programme of work to develop \u201cbankable\u201d FLR proposals that identify sound opportunities and actions for investment in FLR by businesses and other private sector actors. In addition, it is anticipated that the GEF will significantly expand its support for restoration over the coming GEF-7 replenishment period (covering years 2018-2022), with a dedicated restoration \u201cImpact programme\u201d1. 38 Besides setting up new funds, country can also review its national policy framework and try to remove disincentives for forest landscape restoration, such as removing subsidies for unsustainable land use and securing tenure and harvest rights for restoration programme developers. Incentives and funds for restoration A number of innovative approaches show promise, such as the public\u2013private partnership model of the Land Degradation Neutrality Fund being developed by the Global Mechanism of the UNCCD. Private-sector investors \u2013 businesses and individuals \u2013 are the key to long-term FLR finance, whether as social investors in the framework of corporate social responsibility or as impact investors looking for a mix of social and financial returns. More than ten private equity impact funds (already operational or in design) seek to invest in landscape restoration projects. They are small relative to the needed budget, but even so, it is a challenge to find bankable projects. This challenge is what makes traditional investors (pension funds, commercial banks) reluctant to invest in FLR even though they have available capital and interested potential clients. Increasingly, practitioners are seeking to adapt a \u201cblended finance\u201d approach. Blended finance refers to \u201cstructured transactions in which development finance and private capital achieves [\u2026] environmental impacts, while at the same time delivers adequate risk-adjusted financial returns for the private investor\u201d13. Blended finance helps to attract private investments in the much-needed environmental sectors to achieve greater social and environmental improvement impacts, while reducing the burdens on the limited development funding from a handful of developed country ODA programs. Such investment, while promising significant environmental and social returns, would not otherwise happen in a traditional commercial setting, because the risks are considered too high and the returns are either unproven or not commensurate with the level of risk. 13 GEF, 2017, GEF Innovations in Blended Finance: A Summary.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "22a7f343-1322-492f-afbc-8bff1fd6dd0f": {"__data__": {"id_": "22a7f343-1322-492f-afbc-8bff1fd6dd0f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/application-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam-asia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Application of Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM) in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/application-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam-asia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c12bb492bd28900a151f14fdf971a61f8e56feadc034319fa8151ef64918f2cc"}, "2": {"node_id": "6a805c5e-0f12-427e-9675-e17ffe506298", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/application-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam-asia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "82d3b9ff8c9111f84128a62b7a31324cba4bf30bb12c4d8963d43e6eada21a79"}}, "hash": "947e95b15c7fdf913e827c85eeb4ba5be425a45679e74e52b3ddb2eeff7ed7bc", "text": "13 GEF, 2017, GEF Innovations in Blended Finance: A Summary.

These collective efforts have been augmented by policies like the National Agro-forestry Policy (NAP), REDD+, the Joint Forest Management and National Afforestation programmes, and the proposed distribution to states of about US $6 billion under the Compensatory Afforestation programme. India is demonstrating how to build a strong FLR strategy by utilising already-existing public sector funds. 39 How ROAM can help with securing funding for scaling up FLR In order for FLR strategies to attract sustainable finance, it is important to address a number of investment issues to potential investors: 1. Investment returns, investment impacts and expected investment cycles. 2. Risks and risk management strategies (especially concerning social and environmental risks ) 3. Implementations and institutional supports. For future landscapes and countries interested in FLR programmes, ROAM can additionally help provide analytical outputs to communicate to potential investors. ROAM includes analytical modules to analyse the costs and benefits, investment cycles and conditions of restoration options. This is best shown in the Cambodia ROAM example, and the Indonesia and Viet Nam processes to a lesser extent. Additionally, through ROAM, appropriate mitigation strategies for investment and business risks (especially concerning social and environmental risks) can be developed, with locally appropriate monitoring indicators, through a participatory multi-stakeholder process. ROAM is also now supported by additional guidelines on gender and social risks, maximising biodiversity benefits from FLR projects and programmes as well as ecosystem services assessment and modelling. CASE STUDY: BLENDED FINANCE AT GEF (TAKEN FROM GEF INNOVATIONS IN BLENDED FINANCE: A SUMMARY, 2017.) Guarantees and subordinated debt for land restoration: The \u2018Risk Mitigation Instrument for Land Restoration\u2019 project, managed by the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), combines a GEF investment of US $15 million with US $120 million in co-financing to deploy innovative risk mitigation instruments to support public and private sector investment in restoring degraded land in Latin America. The private sector is increasingly seeking investments in the restoration of degraded land as a means of bringing low-productivity land back into production. Such investments, however, have longer payback periods and represent various types of high financial risk, making them difficult to finance. GEF funds will be used to provide guarantees and subordinated loans, helping catalyse additional public and private sector investments by reducing perceived risk. The project will support land restoration and integrated natural resources management activities such as sustainable management for increased ecosystem services; landscape regeneration; intercropping; shade-grown systems; high-value forest products; and silvo-pastoral systems yielding benefits on at least 45,000 hectares. The enhancements to carbon stock in these investments are estimated to yield emissions reductions of 4.5 million tons CO2 equivalent. Junior equity for agro-forestry: The Moringa Agro-forestry Fund for Africa, managed by the African Development Bank, will promote sustainable land management in production landscapes in Burkina Faso, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Kenya, Mali, Tanzania, Zambia, and Congo DR. The Fund will invest in 5-6 scalable, replicable agroforestry projects that combine plantation forestry with agricultural elements to capture most of the value chain. The GEF has taken a junior equity position in the fund with an expected return of 6%. GEF\u2019s position helps lower risks for private sector investors who may be reluctant to consider land management projects on purely commercial terms due to, for example, long payback periods, lack of track record, and uncertainty over product prices. The project also targets 79,000 hectares to maintain significant biodiversity and associated ecosystem goods and services, and more than 200,000 hectares of production systems under sustainable land and forest management. The project is expected to yield GHG emissions benefits of 9.5 million tons CO2e. (Source: GEF (2017). GEF Innovations in Blended Finance: A Summary.

It provides public, private and non-governmental organisations with the knowledge and tools that enable human progress, economic development and nature conservation to take place together. Created in 1948, IUCN is now the world\u2019s largest and most diverse environmental network, harnessing the knowledge, resources and reach of more than 1,300 Member organisations and some 13,000 experts. It is a leading provider of conservation data, assessments and analysis. Its broad membership enables IUCN to fill the role of incubator and trusted repository of best practices, tools and international standards. IUCN provides a neutral space in which diverse stakeholders including governments, NGOs, scientists, businesses, local communities, indigenous peoples organisations and others can work together to forge and implement solutions to environmental challenges and achieve sustainable development. Working with many partners and supporters, IUCN implements a large and diverse portfolio of conservation projects worldwide. Combining the latest science with the traditional knowledge of local communities, these projects work to reverse habitat loss, restore ecosystems and improve people\u2019s well-being. www.iucn.org https://twitter.com/IUCN/ about Interdisciplinary Centre for Conservation science The ICCS are an academic research group based in the Department of Zoology, University of Oxford. Our work addresses the challenges that humanity faces in halting the decline of global biodiversity. We work at the interface of social and ecological systems, using a range of methodologies and interdisciplinary approaches to address key issues in current conservation. Our underlying philosophy is that in order to make progress we need to consider the incentives, pressures and challenges faced by individual decision-makers, and to bring together multidisciplinary teams who are best placed to address these issues. www.iccs.org.uk https://twitter.com/ICCS_updates The development and use of biodiversity indicators in business: an overview The designation of geographical entities in this book, and the presentation of the material, do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of IUCN or other participating organisations concerning the legal status of any country, territory, or area, or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries.

However, challenges exist to develop indicators that can cut through the complexity of natural systems, display clear and simple measures of biodiversity, and be relevant to different business applications. Whilst some businesses are seeking one indicator to be used across a variety of business applications, the reality is that assessing biodiversity performance for different business applications at different temporal and spatial scales will often require different indicators. This paper introduces a spectrum of business applications for biodiversity indicators, which is designed to be a resource for businesses seeking to clarify the business application where biodiversity indicator(s) are required. This spectrum outlines four prominent scopes for business applications of biodiversity indicators, which range from site- level to corporate-level assessment of biodiversity performance (scopes A \u2013 C), through to third-party biodiversity performance assessment (scope D). The spectrum illustrates the variety of business applications for biodiversity indicators, which can be differentiated depending on specific elements of biodiversity indicator use: Why? What is the context and objective for biodiversity indicator use? What? What aspect of biodiversity is measured by indicator(s) to address what objectives? When? Are biodiversity performance assessments for current or future operations? for who? What is the primary audience of the indicator assessment and reporting? How often? What is the temporal frequency of the assessment and reporting? How detailed? What is the spatial scale of the assessment and reporting? A variety of biodiversity indicators, tools, and guidance documents exist for businesses that address many specific business contexts, and these are highlighted in the spectrum. However, to help businesses successfully navigate the selection or development of indicators to measure their biodiversity performance, what is missing is a big picture perspective and process to navigate the variety of business contexts where indictors are relevant. This paper introduces an overarching process, which acknowledges the full spectrum of business applications, to help businesses seeking to use existing indicators or embark on developing their own to measure their biodiversity performance. This process has many similarities with business decision-making frameworks, and offers a logical series of steps to work through in order to develop robust and reliable biodiversity indicators. As with other frameworks, this process emphasizes that indicators should always be built into larger management processes, with initial scoping phases being critical for indicator development answering questions that clarify the business application for indicator use (i.e., \u2018why?\u2019, \u2018what?\u2019, \u2018when?\u2019, \u2018for who?\u2019, \u2018how often?\u2019, and \u2018how detailed?\u2019). The process introduced in this paper offers a contribution to the current dialogue on biodiversity indicators for business. It is designed to help businesses seeking to integrate biodiversity into their business know where to start, by asking the right questions upfront and to seek out existing indicators that could help measure and track their biodiversity performance. This paper is aimed at businesses and practitioners already involved in the development of biodiversity indicators, to help provide context around the additional business applications where biodiversity indicators may be required for current or future business needs; and, also for businesses commencing their journey in exploring their impacts and dependencies on biodiversity, that may want to take the next step to assess their biodiversity performance for a specific business need.

Introduction Many businesses are aware of the importance to understand and measure their impacts and dependencies on biodi- versity. The motivations for doing so relate to a variety of drivers, such as: external drivers (e.g., businesses needing to adhere to environmental regulation and policies, financial lending requirements, certification schemes, or standards, or to report against Sustainable Development Goals), and internal drivers (e.g., business can be internally motivated to improve operational efficiencies that have an environmental co-benefit, they may wish to gain a reputational or compet- itive advantage, or simply want to be an environmentally responsible business). Businesses are now seeking biodiversity indicators to help assess performance for a range of business applications to address these internal and external drivers. However, challenges exist to develop indicators that can cut through the complexity of natural systems, display clear and simple measures of biodiversity, and be relevant to different business applications. The reality is that assessing biodiversity performance for different business applications at different tem- poral and spatial scales, will often require different indicators.

As a result, a range of frameworks for, and approaches to, biodiversity indicator development have been developed and used by governments and civil society groups (see reviews in Addison et al, 2018a&b). Much of this science has not reached the business world. There are many lessons that can be drawn from the conservation science community and applied to business contexts where biodiversity indicators are needed. IUCN and Oxford University have a shared interest in bringing the latest thinking from the conservation science com- munity to business. This project has worked in parallel with the initiatives that are developing and reviewing biodiversity indicators for business (e.g., Berger et al., 2018; Biodiversity Core Initiative, 2018; Lammerant, 2018; UNEP-WCMC, 2017), and acknowledges the substantial body of work that has gone into developing tools and guidelines that have been developed for specific business contexts to help integrate biodiversity into business decision-making (e.g., IUCN French Committee, 2014; Natural Capital Coalition 2014 & 2016). Building on this work, this paper: 1. Clarifies the variety of applications where biodiversity indicators are currently used by businesses, and may be adopted in the future, by presenting the spectrum of biodiversity indicator applications for business. 2. Recommends a process to guide companies and supporting practitioners in the development of fit-for-purpose biodiversity indicators for all business applications. 3. Proposes a way forward to support businesses in developing fit-for-purpose biodiversity indicators, including test- ing the process against a variety of business case studies representing a variety of business contexts. Biodiversity indicators to measure \u2026 what? From a business perspective, biodiversity indicators are needed for many different reasons, and at very different levels within a business: from individual operations or sites all the way to corporate, business unit or group level decision-mak- ing, and for very diverse audiences. These differences will influence the selection of existing indicators or development of new indicators, and the way they are assessed and reported. Whilst some businesses are seeking the emergence of a single biodiversity indicator to measure their impacts on nature from site-level to global scales (e.g., what tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent is for climate change), the reality is that biodiversity measurements made at different scales cannot necessarily be captured within one single indicator, particu- larly when these indicators need to address potentially very different business applications. Indicator \u2013 a definition An environmental indicator is a parameter, or a value derived from parameters, that points to, provides informa- tion about and/or describes the state of the environment, and has a significance extending beyond that directly associated with any given parametric value. The term may encompass indicators of environmental pressures, conditions and responses (OECD, 2001). An indicator can be defined as, \u201ca measure based on verifiable data that conveys information about more than itself\u201d. This means that indicators are purpose-dependent - the interpretation or meaning given to the data de- pends on the purpose or issue of concern. Describing this need in the form of a \u2018key question\u2019 helps to guide indicator selection and communication (Biodiversity Indicators Partnership, 2011). Biodiversity indicators are used to represent components of the environment that are relevant to decision-making - the state of biodiversity (e.g., a species or ecosystem), or the pressures (e.g., a threat) on biodiversity. Related indicators that are indirect measures of biodiversity, can also include business response or actions (e.g., the business response The development and use of biodiversity indicators in business: an overview 2 to mitigate biodiversity impacts), and the benefits that people derive from biodiversity (e.g., ecosystem services). In- dicators can be a single measure (e.g., the abundance of a species of bird), or a composite/constructed measure (e.g., an aggregation the abundance of a threatened species of bird, forest condition and extent). A number of reviews have been undertaken to assess existing biodiversity indicators that are being developed for, and already used by, business (as mentioned in the Introduction). These are useful accounts of the emerging variety of biodiversity indicators for business, illustrating that indicators are being developed for specific business contexts, and draw on specific biodiversity data, which means that the business use of these indicators is by necessity quite specific.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e4ef96f5-0301-409d-bec9-2e44b1656b8d": {"__data__": {"id_": "e4ef96f5-0301-409d-bec9-2e44b1656b8d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/development-and-use-biodiversity-indicators-business", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The development and use of biodiversity indicators in business", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/development-and-use-biodiversity-indicators-business", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d76b20bfca8f385266af32c245cc27fca43c24ea8078072996d0903341f41fea"}, "2": {"node_id": "8b0ebd7f-0a9b-471c-b398-45d3dabb3e87", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/development-and-use-biodiversity-indicators-business", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4a107159ce2407fd0c50ebaf74888c17726dd6f54b8f373439f78571d4f731ee"}}, "hash": "62b39b495b6ac26bde3b52b3674ae84e2a01dd1eabe00e16299b6be51e4a80cf", "text": "The development and use of biodiversity indicators in business: an overview 3 2. the spectrum of biodiversity indicator applications for business Introduction to the spectrum Through consultation with practitioners who work with business, and the IUCN business network, a spectrum of biodiversity indicator applications for business has been developed (Table 1).

The spectrum will never be fully complete, as the business applications where biodiversity indicators are needed will likely evolve considerably across different sectors as recogni- tion of the material risk and opportunities to business of biodiversity continues to increase. This spectrum outlines four prominent scopes for business applications of biodiversity indicators. These four scopes are summarised in the infographic below: Within each scope, a variety of business applications are listed in Table 1, which define the main business uses of the biodiversity indicators. While there may seem to be overlaps between each application, they are further differentiated depending on specific elements of biodiversity indicator use: Why? What is the context and objective for biodiversity indicator use (Column 2) What? What aspect of biodiversity is measured by indicator(s) to address objectives (Column 2) When? Are biodiversity performance assessments for current or future operations (Column 2) for who? What is the primary audience of the indicator assessment and reporting (Column 3) How often?

Companies may wish to assess their corporate biodiversity performance for their current operations (e.g., environmen- tal management of assets), or future operations (e.g., forecasting to screen for risk and differentiate between alternative investments or operations). Corporate biodiversity performance assessment may only need to be undertaken once, or may need to be repeated through time. Finally, companies have a variety of spatial contexts in which businesses may need to measure biodiversity performance indicators \u2013 from their site-level operations, through their supply chains, and at aggregated levels such as business unit, product, or corporate-level. Matching biodiversity indicators with business applications Within the spectrum of business applications, existing biodiversity indicators and tools that are being used by business are matched to the business applications (see Column 2, example biodiversity indicators used). The spectrum refers to some of the most prominent biodiversity indicators for business that have been developed and reviewed recently, such the UNEP-WCMC impact-focused biodiversity indicators for extractive companies, and the Global Biodiversity Score (GBS) to measure a company\u2019s biodiversity footprint. The spectrum also references prominent tools and guidance that have been developed for businesses that provide biodiversity information that can be used by businesses as biodiver- sity indicators for specific applications; such as, the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool for site-level screening of biodiversity risks, the Biodiversity Indicator and Reporting System (BIRS) for cement and aggregates sector, and the Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Guidelines. The spectrum highlights that indicators of biodiversity state are generally more common for site or landscape level applications (e.g., assessment of threatened species; Scope A). Whereas, for higher orders through the value chain, such as corporate-level biodiversity performance assessment (Scope B and C) the focus of the indicators switches to inferring the state of biodiversity through measurement of indicators of pressure (e.g., reduction in pressures on threat- ened species) and response (e.g., avoiding operating in or near protected areas). The indicators and tools shown in Table 1 have been developed and tested for very specific contexts \u2013 to address specific business objectives, for a specific business sector, to communicate to specific audience, and for assessments that are for a restricted scope (e.g., site level assessment) and frequency (e.g., one-off assessment only, as biodiversity data used is not updated through time), and focus on specific elements of biodiversity state, pressures and responses. Some level of adaptation will generally be necessary when applying these to new business contexts. The spectrum also illustrates a lack of existing indicators that measure corporate-level biodiversity state.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "19f58344-3559-43c5-ae2f-6da20f0be0c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "19f58344-3559-43c5-ae2f-6da20f0be0c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/development-and-use-biodiversity-indicators-business", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The development and use of biodiversity indicators in business", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/development-and-use-biodiversity-indicators-business", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ea7603f132232926826535573ceb93f2511d626db334dfa14bf6d64efde1a1c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "ff01ef04-f022-4fef-a727-d2d62404dd59", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/development-and-use-biodiversity-indicators-business", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "daf8ef16fc03d390ef493b72fd31e894946f0d0bf658174cfd32c7c46d1bc084"}}, "hash": "bf9ba926959ff8d748f666d33618c86d7b30589444b19bd98e4021edc40ffd1b", "text": "The spectrum also illustrates a lack of existing indicators that measure corporate-level biodiversity state.

Develop or select indicators \u2022 Select existing indicators, or develop new indicators, that will help measure whether management or monitoring objectives are being achieved, which take into consideration an understanding of the natural system, and uncertainty in how the system will respond to management. 5.

Adapt and refine \u2022 As new information is revealed about the system, adapt management and/or monitoring as required. The development and use of biodiversity indicators in business: an overview 11 This process outlined in Table 2 has many similarities with business decision-making frameworks, like the Plan-Do- Check-Act (PDCA) process which is used to guide the control and continual improvement of business processes (BSI, 2015a), environmental management systems (BSI, 2015b), and the Natural Capital Protocol (Natural Capital Coalition, 2016). These all emphasise that indicators should always be built into larger management processes, with the initial scoping phases (steps 1 & 2; Table 2) being critical for indicator development. The initial stages focus strongly on an- swering the following questions: What do you want to measure? The answer to this question is rooted in the aim and objectives of the business management interventions for biodiversity. Those will define not only what you should measure but also what type of indicators would be most suitable for the objective and application: an indicator that will represent the pressure on biodiversity? Or the state, or the response? Why do you want to measure? Clarify what is the main reason for the development of the biodiversity indicators, e.g., site-level assessment of the effectiveness of mitigation measures on biodiversity, landscape-level or commodity-level assessment of biodiversity dependencies and impacts, through to a corporate-level holistic overview of how a compa- ny is doing with regards to its commitments to biodiversity. Who do you want to communicate the results to? Define up front the target audience as this will influence the format of the output, e.g. site level operations managers, investors, regulatory bodies, stakeholders, and the general public. By working through the initial steps of the process to clarify the decision context, a good foundation is set to explore and set out the management actions (step 3) that can be implemented to help influence biodiversity and help achieve management objectives (see Smith et al (2018)) for comprehensive analysis on business actions for biodiversity). Fol- lowing this, practitioners can assess whether indicator(s) exist already that will help meet the specific business appli- cation, context, and objectives, or whether new indicators will need to be developed (step 4). What is particularly im- portant at this stage is ensuring that the underlying biodiversity data that is used in the indicator(s) matches the spatial scale and temporal frequency of the assessment and reporting (as specified in step 1). For indicator(s) to be useful in a business application, they will need to take into consideration an understanding of the natural system, and an idea of how the system will respond to management (i.e., the indicator will provide a signal that can be attributed to a business).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "92e39a2d-88bb-4ed9-a8e9-a7e005c51d90": {"__data__": {"id_": "92e39a2d-88bb-4ed9-a8e9-a7e005c51d90", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/development-and-use-biodiversity-indicators-business", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The development and use of biodiversity indicators in business", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/development-and-use-biodiversity-indicators-business", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dfe60dae12c857cc0f87d59fb78f6080eabbf41d18ccfefe0802f08d81faaddc"}, "2": {"node_id": "3b428c56-30ca-47ce-81ab-bd53d33776e7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/development-and-use-biodiversity-indicators-business", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "efadb5c4d25604ed206b75076bdc4255c88598bb991ffb868a94c5c8b69b7baa"}}, "hash": "6a1feeab964a2f37b8ee5dfa201e1485d9045e9bd460fa00bd89b9d6500bd0e5", "text": "Once indicator(s) have been selected, the final steps of the process must be worked through, which include monitoring, assessment and reporting (step 5), with flexibility built into the processes to adapt and refine monitoring and management through time (step 6).

What these approaches, along with the overarching process, support is the development of robust and relevant biodiversity indicators for different business applications. This will help ensure that biodiversity indicators will be both responsive1 to, and meaningful2 for, the business application. 1 A responsive indicator is sensitive to and respond predictably to business activities, by providing direct and unambiguous signals of change, e.g.: the temporal scale of indicator data matches the temporal scale of the business need (e.g., annual evaluation & reporting will require data for a biodiversity indicator that is collected/updated <12 months); and, the spatial scale of indicator data matches the spatial scale of the business need (e.g., site-level evaluation & reporting will require data for a biodiversity indicator that can differentiate between site level activities, therefore should be collected at the site-level). 2 A meaningful indicator measures important component(s) of biodiversity, or addresses priority biodiversity issues (as identified in the decision context and through setting management objectives). The indicator and its reporting format are meaningful to the target audience (e.g., business decision-makers, shareholders, investors or the general public). The development and use of biodiversity indicators in business: an overview 12 Box 2. examples of approaches from conservation science to support practitioners work through the process of developing indicators Methods to develop ecosystem understanding and select indicators Using conceptual models to help explore local and landscape scale ecosystems, how management ac- tions could influence the system, and determine what indicators could help detect important changes in the system (e.g., Bal et al, 2018; de Bie et al 2013). Using qualitative loop models to work with stakeholders, explore ecosystems, and develop fit-for-purpose indicators for monitoring (e.g., Vugteveen et al 2015). Approaches to develop scalable Indicators (i.e., indicators are consistent from site to corporate level) Selecting a \u2018core set of indicators\u2019 across the country-level Vital Signs monitoring program in the USA, that support both site level monitoring and management, and a national scale assessment of biodiversity information in a standardised format (e.g., National Park Service, 2012). Using two sets of monitoring for International Bird Areas (IBAs) in Kenya to construct site and national indictors, where broad-scale monitoring involves remote sensing of pressures across all IBAs, and detailed on-ground monitoring is undertaken for species, threats and actions at selected IBAs (e.g., Nature Kenya. 2016). Using Essential Biodiversity Variables, which include core indicators for biodiversity (from genes to species to ecosystems) that are consistent across countries and sectors and are designed to be used by multiple stakeholders (e.g., Pereira et al, 2013). Approaches to aggregate indicators (i.e., indicators can be combined to provide a high-level summary) Using approaches to develop composite indicators for national scales, which could be adapted for corpo- rate application (e.g., the Ocean Health Index, Local Biodiversity Intactness Index, and the Biome Health Metric); noting a review by Burgass et al (2017) and colleagues that outlines how composite indicators can hide uncertainties, and mask important changes, and how these can be addressed during composite indicator construction. Developing condition assessments for indicators (e.g., the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) Common Standards Monitoring; JNCC (2016)), where baselines and targets to define favourable to un- favourable condition of species and habitats. This supports standardised assessments across species / ecosystems at site to national scales.

The process introduced in this paper offers a contribution to the current dialogue on biodiversity indicators for business. It is designed to help businesses seeking to integrate biodiversity into their business know where to start, by asking the right questions upfront and to seek out existing indicators that could help measure and track their biodiversity perfor- mance. It can be used alongside the full spectrum of business applications, to help clarify the decision context (step 1) where biodiversity indicators are required. Moving forward the intention is to use this process, and translate supporting conservation science approaches, to tackle the most challenging business application for biodiversity indicators \u2013 the aggregation of site, product and raw material biodiversity performance to a corporate-level biodiversity assessment used for both internal decision-making and external disclosure of non-financial performance (e.g., to meet corporate reporting requirements and to report against the Sustainable Development Goals). The IUCN and the University of Oxford are also seeking, with businesses and conservation practitioners, to further develop and test this process for indicator development across a variety of business applications. The aim of this next phase of work is to test the process with many business case studies, and translate a range of useful methods that have been compiled from the scientific community that supports the entire process of indicator development. The out- come of a next phase of work will be a selection of business case studies highlighting a range of business applications for biodiversity indicators across different sectors, and illustrating the general process to help businesses seeking to measure and track their biodiversity performance.

Martin Mehers INTERNATIONAL UNION FOR CONSERVATION OF NATURE ABOUT IUCN IUCN is a membership Union uniquely composed of both government and civil society organisations. It provides public, private and non-governmental organisations with the knowledge and tools that enable human progress, economic development and nature conservation to take place together. Created in 1948, IUCN is now the world\u2019s largest and most diverse environmental network, harnessing the knowledge, resources and reach of more than 1,300 Member organisations and some 13,000 experts. It is a leading provider of conservation data, assessments and analysis. Its broad membership enables IUCN to fill the role of incubator and trusted repository of best practices, tools and international standards. IUCN provides a neutral space in which diverse stakeholders including governments, NGOs, scientists, businesses, local communities, indigenous peoples organisations and others can work together to forge and implement solutions to environmental challenges and achieve sustainable development. Working with many partners and supporters, IUCN implements a large and diverse portfolio of conservation projects worldwide. Combining the latest science with the traditional knowledge of local communities, these projects work to reverse habitat loss, restore ecosystems and improve people\u2019s well-being. www.iucn.org https://twitter.com/IUCN/ IUCN Niger Delta Panel: Stories of influence Gillian S.

Preface Executive summary During the period 2012\u20132016, a group of international and national scientists convened and facilitated by IUCN, worked together to produce a set of focused recommendations on the remediation and rehabilitation of biodiversity habitats in the Niger Delta. With a range of technical expertise from oil spill recovery to mangrove rehabilitation, the IUCN Niger Delta Panel (IUCN NDP) was established at the request of Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) in its capacity as operator of the SPDC Joint Venture. Working independently from SPDC but in close cooperation with the company, the Panel presented its advice in two major reports to SPDC, and collaborated in a number of other publications and guidance documents. The IUCN Niger Delta Panel: Stories of influence captures the effects of the Panel\u2019s work and explores the influence that ensued directly from their recommendations and from the collaborative process they followed to produce them. Derived from evidence and observations from the actors most deeply involved \u2013 the Panel members, SPDC staff and IUCN \u2013 influence can be found in both expected and surprising areas. SPDC\u2019s policy and practice has changed because of the NDP\u2019s work; it helped the company strengthen its internal capacity in remediation and biodiversity conservation and it fostered improvements in SPDC\u2019s oil spill and emergency response approach. The Panel\u2019s recommendations provided SPDC with a pathway for improvement in remediation execution and as a result a remediation standard was developed. Mangrove habitat guidance, used both internally and shared internationally, was an output catalysed by the IUCN NDP. The Panel helped the company develop a biodiversity conservation strategy, and provided input and support for SPDC\u2019s move towards implementation of a risk-based approach to oil spill remediation in the Niger Delta. This latter area of work launched a process involving regulators from the Nigerian Department of Petroleum Resources that included: formation of a working group to develop a set of recommended risk-based screening levels for soil and groundwater in the Niger Delta; a capacity development programme for regulators and; a collaborative pilot test of the risk-based approach. The Panel\u2019s work and process also inspired changes within IUCN. It helped strengthen its capacity and confidence to work in highly complex environments, increasing the organisation\u2019s risk tolerance and risk capacity. The experience helped IUCN formalise its peer review process, increasing the robustness and quality of its publications. As an early example of an Independent Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (ISTAP), the Panel provided a proof of concept for the organisation, and learning from this experience has fed directly into the creation by IUCN of subsequent ISTAPs in other parts of the world. The Panel proved to be a rich learning experience for all parties involved and, after five years of active operation, its influence is still being felt. The Panel\u2019s formal recommendations are now being followed up in a next stage of collaboration between IUCN and SPDC, as well as a number of other partners, who have formed the Niger Delta Biodiversity Technical Advisory Group (BTAG) that will continue to monitor the Panel\u2019s recommendations and the sites that have been remediated from the biodiversity perspective.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "99385238-2f95-4330-bd83-ccac6f67eb15": {"__data__": {"id_": "99385238-2f95-4330-bd83-ccac6f67eb15", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-niger-delta-panel-stories-influence", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN Niger Delta Panel : stories of influence", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-niger-delta-panel-stories-influence", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "650058b773c36c6c0dd8eaee2991ca9b041975a456b738ee7d66509acf8ad3dc"}, "2": {"node_id": "5f73d147-fa11-4b92-817e-481028485940", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-niger-delta-panel-stories-influence", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cd8de30c299767648c26c8f124eeff9e80ec7f26a48b44d6295fba737d8cee54"}}, "hash": "c4070fe3395ec28ad009be593f81c4f2f9060a7add7941ec017e2d37e787f97a", "text": "vii UYO AWKA ENUGU ASABA OWERRI UMUAHIA CALABAR YENEGOA ABAKALIKI BENIN-CITY PORT-HARCOURT EDO DELTA RIVERS CROSS RIVER IMO BAYELSA ONDO ABIA ENUGU EBONYI AKWA-IBOM OGUN ANAMBRA BENUE LAGOS KOGI 6\u00b040'0\" 6\u00b040'0\" 6\u00b040'0\" 6\u00b040'0\" NIGER-DELTA ECO-ZONE MAP Source : Niger Delta Environmental Survey (NDES) Phase Two Report \u00ad \u00ad 0 600 1,200 1,800 2,400 300 Kilometers Situation Map Scale 1:4,000,000 Legend \" State Capital Hilly or dissected country Dry flat country Fresh water swamps Mangrove swamps Estuaries Beaches and Bars Marine Environment Boundaries - State Dry land with abundant swamp zones IUCN Niger Delta Panel and the Niger Delta conservation challenge WORKING WITH THE COMPLEXITY OF A PRODUCTIVE AND FRAGILE ENVIRONMENT The Niger Delta has featured in the media for decades, bringing to global attention the challenges of environmental impact as a result of oil spills in this resource rich, yet economically under-developed part of Nigeria. With its immense reserves of oil and gas, there have been hundreds of reports of deliberate sabotage and organised oil theft from pipelines, criminality, and related consequences of oil spills impacting the fragile Niger Delta biodiversity. The Niger Delta is an extensive and unique ecosystem. The rain and flood forests, swamps and unique mangrove ecozones are home to a large number of species and contain biodiversity not found anywhere else in the world.

FOCUSING THE WORK OF THE IUCN NIGER DELTA PANEL In 2012, Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) request IUCN for scientific advice on the remediation and rehabilitation of biodiversity habitats in the Niger Delta. In response, IUCN established an independent expert advisory group referred to as the IUCN Niger Delta Panel (IUCN NDP). The Panel was established to operate in a manner that was independent from SPDC, the IUCN Secretariat and other third-party influences. The Panel\u2019s work was endorsed by IUCN Members in Nigeria, including Nigerian Environmental Study/Action Team (NEST), Nigerian Conservation Foundation and CERASE Environmental Services Limited. In particular, the Panel benefited from the leadership of a prominent member of IUCN\u2019s expert Commission on Environmental, Economic and Social Policy (CEESP), Professor Emmanuel Obot, who sadly passed away in the first year of the NDP\u2019s work. The efforts of the IUCN NDP focused on delivery of independent science-based recommendations globally with the aim to help SPDC improve its remediation work and support biodiversity recovery in oil spill-affected areas. At its inception, both IUCN and SPDC considered the Panel\u2019s work within the greater context of the Delta as paramount. The Panel needed to understand and take into consideration the dynamics and challenging historic and contemporary context in the region, while offering concrete and practical recommendations to specific non-technical challenges faced by SPDC in their onshore operations. Ultimately, the Panel\u2019s work and subsequent recommendations would cover five broad areas: \u2022 Redefining environmental management procedures; \u2022 Revising oil spill response procedures; \u2022 Working on new, but proven, scientific approaches to boost and support in situ biological remediation and rehabilitation processes; \u2022 Supporting the sustainability of remediation at the community level; and \u2022 Developing a biodiversity strategy for the Niger Delta. 1 1 WHO\u2019S WHO? IUCN Niger Delta Panel (IUCN NDP) consisted of a Chair and six other international and national scientists and experts from universities and private research institutions. The Panel, which was convened and administered by IUCN, operated during the period 2012\u20132016. IUCN managed and facilitated the IUCN Niger Delta Panel. IUCN also helped maintain the independence of the Panel and ensured the transparency of the Panel\u2019s reports and recommendations. Nigerian Environmental Study Action Team (NEST) is a national non-governmental organisation which is an IUCN Member in Nigeria. NEST was involved in the creation of the NDP; it endorsed and supported the initiative through providing in-country logistical and administrative support. Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) is the operator of a joint venture (SPDC JV) between the government-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (55% share), SPDC (30%), Total E&P Nigeria Ltd (10%) and the ENI subsidiary Agip Oil Company Limited (5%). It is focused on onshore and shallow water oil and gas production in the Niger Delta and operates around 1,400 oil and gas wells, a network of approximately 4,000 km of oil and gas pipelines and flowlines, nine gas plants and two major oil export terminals. It also operates one power plant. Photo: SPDC HOW THE IUCN NIGER DELTA PANEL OPERATED Prior to the formal start of the IUCN Niger Delta Panel\u2019s work, its members were identified and engaged by IUCN in their individual capacities as scientists. During its five years of operation, 2012\u20132016, the Panel followed a process that included consultation and information collection with a range of stakeholders; discussions among themselves and with SPDC through a schedule of face-to-face and virtual meetings; and the production of written recommendations specifically for SPDC. The Panel began with a number of in-person meetings to develop its baseline understanding of the situation and build relationships amongst the Panel members and with counterparts in SPDC and IUCN. The Panel meetings were structured to provide a forum for learning about the SPDC context and challenges, to facilitate discussion among Panel members and SPDC experts, and to generate and explore ideas and options for SPDC. Early on in the process, in addition to its face-to-face and virtual meetings, the Panel conducted several field studies in different parts of the Delta.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "00fb0de0-a1a9-45db-8f60-97a338df9f5a": {"__data__": {"id_": "00fb0de0-a1a9-45db-8f60-97a338df9f5a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-niger-delta-panel-stories-influence", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN Niger Delta Panel : stories of influence", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-niger-delta-panel-stories-influence", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a4a94277eba4d36c9ede084a8e47c0f63c237fcdb76e6d5166f3713e63e2cc56"}, "2": {"node_id": "dffa8f94-c1ba-4857-a916-c5c212a8160f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-niger-delta-panel-stories-influence", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a28dcfc85040a4939d93e0e7c875d9f76c79062a17cbb633d7d26caaae2ae9d9"}}, "hash": "5dde293fd560f9a3025f9280595db23c106beef9403e92b519f4c2417e0861a7", "text": "The aim of these visits was to collect soil samples and carry out visual inspection of oil spill impacts and existing biodiversity recovery efforts.

The emergence of the Ebola crisis in West Africa, which hit in 2014 and continued into early 2016, along with security issues around the 2015 elections, effectively halted travel in the region at the height of the Panel\u2019s work. A virtual meeting format therefore became the modus operandi. During this period, five renowned biodiversity experts based in Nigeria carried out an assignment for the Panel. The group consisted of foremost Nigerian academics knowledgeable on different taxonomic groups. They produced two synthesis reports on the status and trends of biodiversity in the Niger Delta, which served as input to the Panel\u2019s recommendations on biodiversity. As an independent scientific panel, maintaining some distance from SPDC was of critical importance to the Panel\u2019s work. Independence was assured by IUCN, as the Panel convener, and by the individual Panel members through their Terms of Reference, the assumption being that they were open and free to identify issues and make recommendations for SPDC\u2019s consideration. During its work, however, Panel members did maintain regular and continuous contact with relevant SPDC staff, who joined the formal meetings, and were asked for information, explanations and feedback throughout the process. The Panel\u2019s independence was considered to improve the quality of its results, as well as the legitimacy of its work in the eyes of all stakeholders, including the science community. 3 THE PANEL\u2019S KEY WRITTEN OUTPUTS The Panel produced two major reports during its work. In 2013 it produced its first main report of recommendations, Sustainable remediation and rehabilitation of biodiversity and habitats of oil spill sites in the Niger Delta, which was followed up with the identification of areas of further collaboration between SPDC and the IUCN NDP. The second report, Developing a biodiversity conservation strategy for the Niger Delta, written at the end of the Panel\u2019s formal work, was published in 2018, and provided SPDC with more focused advice on strengthening the biodiversity aspects of its oil spill remediation work. These reports are publicly available and can be found archived on IUCN\u2019s online portal. How the IUCN NDP process and its recommendations influenced the company is elaborated further in the next section.

Photo: SPDC INFLUENCE AND IMPACTS IN THE COMPANY There were a number of motivations for SPDC\u2019s initial request for an independent scientific panel, among these were the desire for greater transparency, and the realisation that the company could benefit from independent expert support to improve its oil spill remediation and biodiversity recovery work. The Shell Group was already working with IUCN on another independent scientific technical advisory panel \u2013 the Western Gray Whale Advisory Panel (WGWAP) \u2013 and felt that a similarly structured collaboration with an independent panel of experts could help improve SPDC\u2019s Niger Delta remediation and rehabilitation work. Although Shell had experience from working with IUCN in this way through the WGWAP panel, SPDC itself was new to this type of collaboration. Participating in a process that involved a group of independent scientists reviewing, analysing and presenting recommendations to strengthen its practice in oil spill remediation and habitat recovery was a new experience for SPDC. Although SPDC was, in principle, open to the idea of seeking independent assurance and verification of its activities in this area, they experienced the process as challenging at times. Over time, the relationship evolved. Towards the end of the Panel\u2019s formal work with SPDC, their collaboration developed into an authentic peer exchange and alignment around effective implementation of Panel recommendations to facilitate long-term biodiversity recovery and ecosystem protection. Not only did the Panel make recommendations that drove SPDC towards improved remediation and biodiversity conservation, it also provided a new format for doing so.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a7c3c03a-1a13-4cb7-bbff-9925c1203cdb": {"__data__": {"id_": "a7c3c03a-1a13-4cb7-bbff-9925c1203cdb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-niger-delta-panel-stories-influence", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN Niger Delta Panel : stories of influence", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-niger-delta-panel-stories-influence", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "11048e52a234cbc53c7ff7356bdf38cb13d47dcb2d12c031a16041318d4efa3b"}, "2": {"node_id": "a4ce7f13-e63f-420d-8a13-a41f2c778d3a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-niger-delta-panel-stories-influence", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9ac640ffda34f31648b6a511672dd8cdd81d71935754f9d6a1e0fe7be5f23071"}}, "hash": "4a92c37ab45881869644e9e5bfcf09286b0e5cf3a23eec3192f0a7b6a601973e", "text": "The Panel meetings created a platform for dialogue and a forum for the external Panel members, Shell Group experts and SPDC operational teams to discuss solutions to issues faced in the Delta.

SPDC developed a similar appreciation for the input and independence of the Panel\u2019s work. STRENGTHENING INTERNAL CAPACITY One of the first changes SPDC made as a result of its engagement with the Panel process was to strengthen its remediation and biodiversity recovery teams. A Project Manager was appointed to oversee and manage the remediation improvement programme. Based in Port Harcourt, the Project Manager worked with the Panel throughout the process. This provided a \u201chome\u201d within the company for the Panel\u2019s work, effectively increasing the touch points among the Panel members, IUCN and SPDC, and helped ensure ongoing focus by the company on the Panel\u2019s work. The relationship-building process over the course of the collaboration helped the Panel endure some challenging situations, such as the traumatic loss of the first IUCN NDP Chair in an airplane accident. In addition, there were staff changes in IUCN, and the move from a face-to-face meeting format to more virtual work. Having continuity within SPDC, through a dedicated Project Manager, helped maintain stability and continuity, as well as ground the IUCN NDP\u2019s work within the company. The Panel\u2019s recommendations and focus on strengthening company practice resulted in an overall upskilling of SPDC operational teams and ongoing assurance of remediation activities based on an updated remediation management plan and internal guidance Influencing company policy and practice 2 5 documents. This was undertaken by a newly established SPDC assurance team, ensuring continuous improvement and implementation of international best practice. IMPROVING SPDC COMPANY PRACTICE IN A RANGE OF TECHNICAL AREAS The Panel recommendations also led to a number of practical changes in company practice and approach, particularly in oil spill and emergency response, remediation and management procedures. Each of these changes were influenced directly by the work of the Panel as described below. \u2022 Improving the oil spill and emergency response approach On oil spill response, Panel recommendations focused on improvements in the speed of delivery and nature of intervention. When a leak is identified within SPDC areas of operation, the impacted infrastructure is immediately shut (production stopped) and efforts made to contain any spilled oil. A joint investigation visit is then carried out to establish the cause and volume of oil spilled with representatives from communities, regulators, government security agencies, state government and the company; sometimes local NGOs are invited as observers. This is a regulated procedure done within 24 hours of the spill, provided it is safe to do so and the community has provided access. Once the investigation has concluded and the cause of the spill has been determined, a team is mobilised to clean up the spill site irrespective of cause. In the case of operational spills, compensation is paid to people and communities impacted by the spill. A remediation action plan is then prepared, and the remediation of contaminated soil subsequently takes place. The Panel\u2019s recommendations changed how this process is set up and the speed of intervention. The regulators \u2013 Nigerian National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA) and the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) \u2013 are involved throughout and issue site remediation certifications once the contaminant levels have reached regulatory limits. The Panel identified in their recommendations the need to understand site-specific conditions for effective remediation. This articulated need resulted in SPDC developing a new set of Conceptual Site Models (CSMs) for the identified Niger Delta ecozones: lowland forest, flood forest, swamp forest, mangrove swamps and coastal barrier islands. These models support differentiated evaluation of risks if oil spills occur within any of the ecozones, as each has unique characteristics and site-specific conditions. The models continue to provide a framework for risk evaluation and help the selection of the most appropriate mitigation, remediation and rehabilitation options. \u2022 Developing a new remediation standard The IUCN NDP recommendations provided the SPDC team with a pathway for improvement Photo: SPDC 6 in remediation execution. Based on Panel recommendations, SPDC developed a remediation standard, which outlines SPDC\u2019s requirements for the remediation teams. The standard is based on experience within the company and recommendations from the Panel and involved an iterative dialogue with the Panel members. The standard sets out expectations in terms of outcome, and outlines standards to which the company internally commits.

Landfarming is a well-practiced technique used in the Niger Delta, and elsewhere, to bioremediate crude oil contamination in soils with the objective of restoring the land to conditions acceptable to human health and the environment. It stimulates the natural microbial processes that break down and use the carbon-rich oil contamination as a source of food and energy, ultimately leading to its removal. The key to the process is providing the microbes with the nutrients they need to perform optimally. Landfarming is a tried and tested approach to reduce the concentration of oil in soils. To improve the effectiveness of this process, the IUCN NDP proposed the use of amendments, such as biosurfactants, enzymes and sorbents. The trials were conducted in the first half of 2016, followed by result analyses. International remediation experts and scientists were involved in the study, in addition to members of the Panel. It was found that the treatments were successful in removing up to 53% of the total petroleum hydrocarbon in the soil within 16 weeks. A comparison between different treatments demonstrated that most were no more effective than adding agricultural fertilizer alone. As a part of the follow-up on the Panel\u2019s recommendations, SPDC is collaborating with IUCN and the Nigerian Conservation Foundation to monitor the long-term biodiversity recovery of remediated sites. Remediation work also has a social performance component. SPDC has a tradition for actively involving communities in the company\u2019s work. The IUCN NDP advised even more openness and more community involvement, including the integration of impact assessment, biodiversity, remediation and response to oil spill work in SPDC\u2019s Global Memorandum of Understanding with community clusters. SPDC already involves community contractors in their remediation work and is open about the fact that this must be done in a manner that does not incentivise sabotage against its pipeline infrastructure. Local communities are involved in clean up and remediation of operational spills; however, when oil spills are confirmed to be the result of theft or sabotage, the recovery and remediation work is managed by local contractors from other parts of the Niger Delta. \u2022 Elaborating on mangrove habitat guidance With over 3,100 km of coastline and an estimated 1 million hectares covered in mangrove forests, the Niger Delta is the location of the largest mangrove system in Africa, and one of the largest in the world. The Panel noted that each ecosystem in the Niger Delta demanded a different approach following oil spills, prompting the development of the CSMs described previously. Mangrove ecosystems are particularly valuable ecosystems from a number of perspectives. From the climate perspective, they are important as carbon sinks; they provide 7 nurseries for coastal fisheries, timber and forest products, and guard against erosion and storm surges. For all of these reasons, this makes them valuable from the livelihood and ecosystem services perspective as well. Successful rehabilitation of impacted mangroves is challenging due to the significant amount of time they need to regenerate, and it requires site-specific considerations. Although oil spills in these areas are not frequent, SPDC has had a keen interest in improving its management procedures and consulted the Panel on how to best handle them when they occur. Thus, the Panel, which included a mangrove specialist, identified rehabilitation in this important ecozone as an area of great importance and provided a set of recommendations for scientifically viable ways to strengthen the company\u2019s practice in this habitat. The resulting mangrove restoration plan advocated active planting and monitoring of mangroves in oil-affected areas. SPDC took the recommendations to the next level. With the collaboration of two other external experts hired by SPDC, two web-based information sessions were hosted by the company, attracting a wide audience including regulators, NGOs and other international and local experts. Those participating were invited to have a discussion and share their experience on the best approach to handle oil spills affecting mangrove ecosystems. Built on information included in the 2013 IUCN NDP Report, this process resulted in a guidance document titled, \u201cManagement and Adaptive Monitoring of Mangrove Habitats in the Niger Delta\u201d, produced by SPDC in 2016. This best practice guidance was developed by SPDC together with IUCN and other external international specialists for use by SPDC and others working on oil spills in mangrove forests. It includes a methodology for planning, implementation and adaptive monitoring of mangroves when rehabilitation efforts are needed. Available from SPDC, the aspiration is that this is a living document and that those who use the guidelines anywhere in the world can share case studies and lessons learned from these application experiences. SPDC commits to sharing its own learning by updating", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "82495c35-9633-4ea5-b842-16d42c65ac36": {"__data__": {"id_": "82495c35-9633-4ea5-b842-16d42c65ac36", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-niger-delta-panel-stories-influence", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN Niger Delta Panel : stories of influence", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-niger-delta-panel-stories-influence", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "96166fd1199e867a4caa27749b9a70977c9f1d03990d051d1804c5f31da5e8cb"}}, "hash": "96166fd1199e867a4caa27749b9a70977c9f1d03990d051d1804c5f31da5e8cb", "text": "the document as it implements the guidelines in the Niger Delta. This unique document establishing new best practices has continued to garner attention nationally in Nigeria, within Shell and in the broader international soil and groundwater community. Regulators expressed an interest in this document, including those from the DPR and NOSDRA. As Shell companies work to protect mangroves in other locations, such as the Gulf of Mexico, having best practices established is of great value. The findings were also presented at the 2017 AquaConSoil annual conference in France, together with the work done to establish Risk-Based Screening Levels (RBSL) in Nigeria and the work undertaken to map the Niger Delta ecozones. As noted, these were inspired by, and expanded, following input from the Panel. \u2022 Implementing a risk-based approach The IUCN NDP has provided input and support to SPDC as it has moved towards implementation of a risk-based approach to remediation in the Niger Delta. The use of a risk-based approach has been considered international best practice for more than a decade, and Shell has worked with regulators around the world to adapt the approach to the local contexts in which they operate. Through the work of the Panel, SPDC was encouraged to adopt this in Nigeria also. SPDC and the Panel had a series of discussions and meetings focusing on regulatory standards, to explore if they were suitable and appropriate. Their comparison of standards from other parts of the world challenged the current practice and 8 regulatory standards to which SPDC complied. The work concluded with a recommendation to advocate, demonstrate and build capacity among regulators for a new way of working, where locally adopted RBSLs are a key component. The screening levels developed are based on the latest science and international approaches, and take account of Nigeria- specific conditions, such as climate, land-use and patterns of human activity. The principle behind a risk-based approach is to consider the mechanisms by which oil spill contamination can potentially impact biodiversity and human health. In the application of sustainable development principles, where the aim is for the benefit of undertaking remediation to be greater than the impact remediation activities can have on the environment, the goal is to avoid intrusive remediation techniques with serious impact to biodiversity (e.g. uprooting trees and vegetation to undertake remediation), unless absolutely necessary to protect human health. This work is currently in its final stages. The initiative involved working with national Nigerian regulators, DPR and NOSDRA, and advocating for change to existing regulations, which currently require the company to remediate every oil spill area to the same level, rather than to base remediation on risks to human health and biodiversity. Final approval for use of the risk-based approach is expected in 2019, following the completion of pilot trials together with regulators at 10 sites across the Niger Delta. As part of the programme, the company has provided training for 150 DPR and NOSDRA personnel to support the implementation and assessment of remediation efforts. See Chapter 4 for more information on this work. \u2022 Strengthening biodiversity assessment As noted previously, the Panel\u2019s second major report and set of recommendations focused on helping SPDC develop a biodiversity conservation strategy and integrate these considerations into its operations. In the report, the IUCN NDP recognised SPDC as the industry leader in terms of considerations given to biodiversity in Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry operations, but it also encouraged further improvement. The Panel recommended that the impact assessment and biodiversity teams should be merged, as doing so would strengthen the biodiversity aspects of the impact assessment work conducted by SPDC. Practically speaking, this means that biodiversity experts would work together with the impact assessment team to conduct their fieldwork. If the impact assessment identifies potential for biodiversity impact, then biodiversity mitigation actions would be incorporated, with subsequent reporting. SPDC has now implemented these recommended changes. Strengthening the biodiversity assessment capacity in the company required resources that the company needed to provide. The internal biodiversity expert, who took over coordination and follow-up of the implementation of the IUCN NDP\u2019s recommendations in June 2018, received external support to do so from the University of Uyo in Akwa Ibom State in Nigeria, where SPDC funds a Biodiversity Chair (an independent initiative by SPDC). Photo: Steve Edwards/IUCN 9 \u2022 Emphasising prevention Many of the Panel\u2019s recommendations emphasised prevention and the need to reduce the number of oil spills overall. In response, SPDC teams have worked together internally to generate ideas for ways to accomplish this; for example, improving surveillance of facilities for early detection of third party activities.

SPDC is working to improve the competencies of community contractors and is developing tools for early reporting of any illegal practices detected in order to facilitate quick oil spill response. Internally there are significant resources allocated to prevention. There is a group looking at applying new technology, such as drones, to supplement the use of helicopters for daily surveillance, providing information to increase community competence, building an early warning system, and other initiatives. \u2022 Mainstreaming internal processes and capacity development The Panel\u2019s work throughout its tenure, and its support for strengthening company practice, has resulted internally in an overall upskilling of remediation execution teams, whose work is now assured on an ongoing basis through an updated management plan, and guidance documents. SPDC has also established a remediation assurance team (two soil and groundwater experts) that supports the implementation in two ways: training and competence development, and ongoing assurance, guaranteeing that the remediation work carried out by the execution teams follows internal standards. The team provides detailed assurance of the remediation activities throughout the process, from the Joint Investigation Reports produced together with regulators, through to final sign off and certification of sites. With a focus on improvement and implementation of best practice remediation, established processes now exist within the company to make continuous improvement of its remediation and rehabilitation work possible. \u2022 Influencing the broader corporate environment It is interesting to consider how the experience of SPDC as part of a large multi-national company might affect the other parts of the corporate environment. It is important to not overstate such attributions; however, certain elements of SPDC\u2019s experience with the IUCN NDP have provided insights which have been shared with other parts of the company. This is particularly relevant for other Shell companies operating in similar climatic conditions. The Mangrove Management Plan is one example. It can be helpful as a response to direct impact, or even when there has been no direct impact as a result of operational activity, it can support the company\u2019s wider social responsibility work for protection or rehabilitation of sensitive ecosystems. Photo: SPDC EXPERIENCING NEW THEMES AND CONTEXTS As the convener of the Panel, the IUCN NDP process provided IUCN with a number of new opportunities including moving into a thematic area beyond its traditional areas of expertise. This particular Panel\u2019s inquiry focused on bioremediation and chemistry, rather than on IUCN\u2019s familiar territory of species conservation and protected areas through community-based and rights-based approaches (RBAs). Not only did the Panel provide IUCN with an opportunity to look deeply into a new area, but to work in a context that was unusually complex and controversial, due to the challenging political and social environment \u2013 an environment where Panel members and IUCN staff could not easily go in person to conduct their onsite work. Saying \u201cyes\u201d to working with the Panel and SPDC in this new context helped strengthen capacity and confidence in IUCN to work in new fields and in highly complex environments, sparked the creation of new internal systems, and helped refine the ISTAP process, further improving the practice of future panels. More on each of these areas of influence below. \u2022 Working confidently on projects with a higher risk profile Because of its experience with the Panel, IUCN\u2019s risk tolerance and risk capacity have increased. Large complex projects such as this one are now less of an unknown for IUCN, and there are systems and processes in place, lessons learned, and value added from the outcomes of the experience. There is now more of a realisation of the risk profile the organisation is assuming when launching such a project, and more appetite to work on similar independent panel processes as a business strategy, even knowing that they are a higher risk. The experience with the Panel has further prepared IUCN, from an institutional perspective. The work with the Panel helped the organisation understand that it needed a more structured risk management and assessment process at the institutional level. In April 2018, the IUCN Council adopted an enterprise risk management policy, and future panels will have a risk assessment and management process in place, which will strengthen IUCN\u2019s risk capacity for similar work. \u2022 Bringing more expertise and learning opportunities into IUCN As the Panel process convened a set of scientific experts to work with IUCN and SPDC in a new area, it gave IUCN the opportunity to cast widely for the necessary expertise. The Panel process thus brought into IUCN\u2019s community additional technical competencies that could influence other areas of its work.

This expert subsequently joined IUCN\u2019s Species Survival Commission (SSC), and became one of the founding members of a new IUCN-SSC Mangrove Specialist Group, now composed of over 100 members who support mangrove research and conservation projects globally. The new group is well positioned to provide inputs to other initiatives in this field. In addition to new expertise, the geographic location of the Panel\u2019s work in Nigeria presented new challenges to IUCN, as there was no official IUCN office in the country. As Nigerian legal requirements stipulated that the Panel process required a Nigerian partner organisation, IUCN Member Nigerian Environmental Study Action Team (NEST) agreed to collaborate on the Niger Delta process. Through this partnership, IUCN gained valuable lessons on working closely with Members on extremely challenging issues. Influence and impacts in IUCN 3 11 Overall, participating in the IUCN NDP process provided a valuable organisational learning opportunity for IUCN. It helped the IUCN community learn that it is possible to work in, and make an important contribution to, highly complex environments and that, as an organisation, it should not shy away from such opportunities and requests. They learned that while issues of oil spills appear intractable, there are methods and approaches to be explored. Although this was a project outside the traditional area of work for the organisation, IUCN demonstrated that it can convene a technical panel by drawing upon its broader network to find the necessary expertise. Moreover, it showed that IUCN can catalyse change and have an impact at various levels, whether corporate, national, regional or potentially global \u2212 when other companies are able to benefit from the science-based outputs of such projects. \u2022 Helping inform the IUCN peer review system As oil spill remediation is a highly technical and specialised field, the IUCN NDP report provided an excellent opportunity to engage scientists and experts within IUCN\u2019s broader network on a controversial issue. The Panel\u2019s 2013 report provided an impetus to further develop and test a more formal peer review system within IUCN, including the creation of templates and an audit trail for gathering responses and providing comments. Since then, IUCN\u2019s peer review system has been further refined and is now well established within the organisation, thus continuing to ensure quality knowledge products. \u2022 Establishing Independent Scientific and Technical Advisory Panels (ISTAPs) IUCN has developed a set of internal procedures for creating and managing ISTAPs, of which the IUCN Niger Delta Panel is a notable one. In 2014, IUCN published a report, Procedures for establishing and managing IUCN-supported Independent Scientific and Technical Advisory Panels, which states: \u201cIUCN must be able to demonstrate that the panels are independent, transparent, accountable and scientifically-rigorous, and that they engage openly with all relevant stakeholders. These procedures are mandatory and must be applied in full by any group of experts convened by IUCN...\u201d The IUCN Niger Delta Panel helped inform these procedures. As a result, the ISTAP approach proves that IUCN, its Members and partners can address controversial and challenging issues. As the need to reconcile conservation and development becomes more common, the ISTAP approach has drawn the interest of financial institutions and companies. For example, following the experience from IUCN NDP, IUCN was requested by BHP Billiton following the Samarco tailings dam collapse in November 2015. Since then, IUCN established the independent Rio Doce Panel. 12 To achieve more systemic change, regulations are an interesting leverage point. Through its work, the Panel advocated the use of a risk- based approach for SPDC\u2019s work. This in turn encouraged an SPDC initiative to collaborate with regulators in the development of a risk- based approach to remediation. SCALING UP NEW APPROACHES SPDC is now working with regulators from the DPR, the government department responsible for this regulation, to obtain permission to use a risk-based approach to oil spill remediation.

Since its inception, this group has met five times and developed a set of recommended screening levels as presented in their report, \u201cTier 1 Risk- Based Screening Levels (RBSLs) for soil and groundwater in the Niger Delta\u201d (17 August 2017). In February 2018, SPDC received the regulators\u2019 endorsement to pilot the approach at 10 selected sites within the Niger Delta. The working group requested SPDC to assist with the capacity building of regulators. Between February and May 2018, 150 staff from DPR and NOSDRA were trained, with international experts from Shell Group acting as facilitators. The curriculum and training materials for the course, \u201cApplication of risk-based screening levels (RBSLs) for soil and groundwater in the Niger Delta\u201d, were developed by soil and groundwater specialists in Shell and used data and the Niger Delta-specific CSMs, jointly developed with the IUCN NDP. Through the pilot testing of the risk-based approach, regulators will participate in site assessments to establish correct exposure scenarios and target levels. Regulators will visit the sites periodically to assess the project remediation efforts and will certify the sites at completion. The pilots will run for four to five months per site, until mid-2019. Working with regulators 4 14 ENGAGING AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL The Panel\u2019s work with SPDC to develop a new approach to remediation had consequences for the company\u2019s work with 10 local vendors who conduct oil response and remediation. There existed some opportunities to strengthen capacity of local vendors in their provision of services, particularly those that could support IUCN NDP recommendations, and so SPDC embarked on a process to build their capabilities. Community contractors carry out a significant proportion of SPDC\u2019s remediation work, and by increasing the competencies of these locally-based vendors, they could better act as advocates for the company in the communities, where they and community members can see the long-term effect of oil spill pollution. This in turn raises awareness and helps communities ask better questions to understand cause and effect. Overall, better data and information provided locally can encourage communities to resist and restrict efforts of people whose actions ultimately create some of the oil spills. As their comprehension increases, communities can say \u201cno\u201d to pipeline tapping, because they understand that the oil spills can have long-term effects on human health and the environment. ADDING TO THE BODY OF KNOWLEDGE AND LITERATURE The previously mentioned reports and articles produced as a direct or indirect result of the Panel\u2019s work have helped contribute to the body of knowledge available on this particular issue in a remote geographical area. Experts around the world who following the latest development in oil spill-related issues, mangrove degradation, the rehabilitation of oil contaminated land and soils, and the Niger Delta, now have another source of knowledge to draw upon for their work. BRINGING THE IUCN NDP RECOMMENDATIONS INTO OTHER FORUMS AND PROJECTS Although the IUCN NDP process has officially ended, the Panel members \u2212 all acknowledged experts in their fields \u2212 carry the recommendations forward in their professional work, integrating findings, where possible. What follows are just a few examples of this: \u2022 One Panel member collaborated with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate and drew materials from the guidelines on mangroves. The same Panel member used the same guidelines and Panel recommendations for a Wetlands International project and for the International Blue Carbon Partnership, as part of his collaboration in a scientific working group with a special area on oil spills. Influence in the community and on other initiatives 5 Photo: IUCN 15 \u2022 Another Panel member built upon interactions with communities and other stakeholders during the Panel\u2019s investigative work to help shape best practice for inclusive growth as part of his contribution to the Low Carbon Development Strategy for Nigeria. This input included how several aspects of livelihoods and biodiversity can be rehabilitated after remediation, and how to incorporate mitigation approaches in project delivery. \u2022 The process and findings of the IUCN NDP have also been integrated into graduate- level university teaching by another Panel member, who uses the NDP to address issues of extensive degradation of wetlands and mangroves. The Panel members carry the learning and experience from their work on the NDP with them into their individual areas of work and influence. SPDC, Shell and IUCN colleagues also have substantive information and learning from the process to share, both in the form of the publications and their own experience.

A Phase 2 process has been put into place and SPDC will provide a dedicated staff member as a part-time coordinator. Phase 2 is supported by a technical working group \u2013 the Niger Delta Biodiversity Technical Advisory Group (BTAG). Composed of international and Nigerian experts, the Advisory Group has established a protocol framework to monitor the implementation of the recommendations and the sites that have been remediated from a biodiversity perspective. BTAG includes members from SPDC, Shell Group, IUCN, the Nigerian Conservation Foundation and Wetlands International, both IUCN Members, and several other independent experts. Its current timeframe is four to five years. As the IUCN NDP experience shows, business and governments facing seemingly intractable, complex and controversial issues can benefit from external, independent and evidence-based recommendations. Involved parties have much to learn from engaging in such processes, which must be juxtaposed with the cost of business- as-usual. For this type of intervention to work effectively, it is essential to adhere to ISTAP principles and procedures to build trust and credibility among all the stakeholders. Through its contribution in addressing the significant environmental challenges facing the Niger Delta and its people, the IUCN NDP has laid the groundwork for future research and partnerships.

It promotes examples of inspiring solutions that showcase how nature conservation can benefit society. Through a modular case study format, solutions are being dissected into their replicable \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d and their broader application is supported through cross- sectoral learning and exchange, relying on online as well as offline mechanisms. PANORAMA allows practitioners to share and reflect on their experiences, increase recognition for successful work, and to learn with their peers how similar challenges have been addressed around the globe. IUCN co-leads PANORAMA together with a growing number of partner organizations including GIZ, UN Environment, GRID-Arendal, Rare and IFOAM-Organics International.

This prompted a strong focus on the governance of protected and conserved areas, and ongoing efforts to better understand the diverse situations that exist. Governance diversity is a powerful concept for conservation, equity and livelihoods. In addition to the conventional state-led model of decision making by government (at different levels and across different institutions), the IUCN and the CBD recognise three other types: shared governance by various rights-holders and stakeholders together, governance by private individuals and organisations, and governance by indigenous peoples and/or local communities. In marine and coastal areas, this latter category may include locally managed marine areas, or LMMAs. These diverse governance types are vital for conservation in the coastal and marine developing world. Too often, conservation does not gain buy-in from local communities; when a marine protected area is created, rules and restrictions to the resources increase and this excludes them from sources of food security and other economic and non-cash benefits. It threatens the way of life that the ocean has fostered in such places, where the sea is interwoven into the cultural identity and rich heritage of these communities. Their needs have not been considered, nor has their know-how and traditional ecological knowledge been taken into account in the designation of new marine protected areas. Further, new restrictions on access don\u2019t necessarily address needs, nor do they contemplate the ongoing drivers and threats faced by communities, or help to deal with the exploitation of resources by outsiders, 9 The critical importance ofgovernance diversity the effects of extractive industries, industrial fishing and commercial poaching. Disempowered, many fishers become poachers themselves when excluded from these zones and their role in governing natural resources. By passing the reins to local communities through shared governance such as the Beach Management Units (BMUs) in Kenya, or LMMAs in Fiji, and by giving them legal rights to protect their own resources, an authentic and valuable sense of ownership provides the incentive to govern and manage their natural resources. The goals of biodiversity conservation to restore degraded ecosystems can effectively be reconciled with the needs of local communities and sustainable and small scale fisheries management methods that replenish fish stocks and other marine resources. The Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020\u2019s Aichi Target 11 makes provision for the recognition of areas that qualify as protected areas, but also for the recognition of \u201cother effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs)\u201d. Many of the examples of marine and coastal governance and management may well conform with this latter definition, whether conservation may not be the primary objective, but where effective governance results in conservation of biodiversity being achieved in the long-term. The PANORAMA - Solutions for a Healthy Planet initiative seeks out and highlights successful examples of conservation practice across a range of topics. In the current volume, a suite of examples that illustrate the diversity of approaches regarding governance of protected and conserved areas in the marine realm is offered for reflection and learning. We invite you to peruse these examples and draw your own conclusions on whether they conform to the protected area definition or the broader concept of OECMs. In the long-term, it is hoped that these best practices for the protection of our precious blue planet will move like waves across the world, influencing and engaging a wide spectrum of users to apply their lessons or to contribute their own examples. 10 Other effective area-based conservation measures: an update (August 2018) Harry Jonas, Kathy MacKinnon and Dan Laffoley IUCN WCPA Task Force on other effective area-based conservation measures This \u201cSolutions in Focus\u201d publication introduces examples of marine protected areas (MPAs) under various governance types as well as management approaches that likely do not fall under the IUCN definition of a \u2018protected area\u2019 but might qualify as \u2018other effective area-based conservation measures\u2019 (OECMs).

As an outcome of those workshops, a revised definition of OECMs and voluntary guidance for identification and management were submitted to the 22nd meeting of the CBD\u2019s Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA 22). WCPA also published a Special Issue of the journal PARKS on OECMs to inform the discussions at SBSTTA. SBSTTA deliberated upon and eventually adopted a draft decision on \u2018Protected Areas and Other Effective Area-Based Conservation Measures\u2019. The draft decision contains a refined definition of an OECM, based on the one proposed by IUCN/WCPA, namely: 11 Other effective area-based conservation measures: an update (August 2018) \u201cA geographically defined area other than a Protected Area, which is governed and managed in ways that achieve positive and sustained long-term outcomes for the in situ conservation of biodiversity, with associated ecosystem functions and services and where applicable, cultural, spiritual, socio\u2013 economic, and other locally relevant values\u201d. The draft decision will be considered again at COP 14 in November 2018 at Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt. Other effective area-based conservation measures can help deliver greater representativeness and connectivity within protected area systems and provide an exciting opportunity to recognize and engage a broader range of stakeholders in conservation management. However, there are important qualifications for marine areas. These include the need to manage the ocean as a whole through sensitive, real and effective management. By definition OECMs must lead to the in situ conservation of biodiversity and the management measures must benefit the entire ecosystem, not only select species. The temptation by some will be to report all fisheries management measures as OECMs to misleadingly inflate global ocean protection figures. In reality, many fishery management measures will be more accurately reported under Aichi Target 6, which celebrates sustainable, legal and ecosystem- based fisheries management, amongst other outcomes, and currently remains under-reported. IUCN WCPA and specifically the OECMs Task Force are committed to further developing and testing the OECM guidance in pilot countries to assist nations in meeting Aichi targets and further promote conserved areas beyond 2020, including through PANORAMA.

Overfishing and effects of climate change needed to be addressed before the marine ecosystem was damaged beyond repair. Fishers and concerned residents who could remember how healthy and productive the sea had been decades ago felt it necessary to take action before it was too late. In 2005 they took the unprecedented step of setting aside a 30 hectare Marine Protected Area (MPA). This was the first coral based Locally Managed Marine Area (LMMA) in Kenya. By now, the ecosystem has made a remarkable recovery. The area has become a fish breeding ground, and alternative income generating enterprises have been introduced such as tourism, furniture and agriculture. Kuruwitu is a model for sustainable marine conservation. The KCWA share their knowledge with other local and regional coastal communities.. Location: Kilifi, Coast Province, Kenya Impacts The development of sustainable non-fishing based initiatives has taken pressure off the fishing grounds. Fish stocks have improved dramatically within the LMMA and an independent report shows a huge increase in fish biomass and other biodiversity. This has increased fish catches in the neighbouring fishing grounds improving livelihoods. Turtles and nests in the area are protected through a community compensation scheme. Communities from along the coast and from other neighbouring countries visit Kuruwitu to see our living classroom. At least 20 other similar projects have been started by other coastal communities inspired by KCWA. KCWA demonstrated the importance of community involvement in natural resource management plans; a principle that has influenced a change of policy away from the state to the local communities. Kuruwitu has been chosen to pilot a co-management initiative working with various stakeholders covering an area of approximately 100 square kilometers. This is one of the first collaborative management schemes of its kind on the Kenyan coast and will set a precedent. SOLUTION Organizations Involved: 15 Kuruwitu Conservation and Welfare Association (KCWA) Building blocks Marine protected area (MPA) Following identification of stakeholders, awareness raising, and an exchange visit to Tanzania, it was agreed to close a lagoon area. Following legislative changes, Kuruwitu LMMA was set up under a collaborative governance model. Institutional framework, legal requirements and management When Kuruwitu LMMA was initiated , the policy that regulates the recognition of an LMMA was not clear. With support from other stakeholders, the area was recognized under the National Enviromental Management Authority (NEMA), securing fishers rights to manage their own area. A 5 year adaptive management plan, and a constitution document built on local knowledge, were drawn up. Community welfare Part of the management plan was to introduce other enterprises, to achieve self-sustainability and become independent of outside funding. A tourism business attracted visitors, created employment and took pressure off the ecosystem. This was then complemented by diverse livelihood options, such as honey and crafts making, with a portion of profits going towards community welfare needs like water,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "26720eed-d109-42a1-a73b-74af100d0555": {"__data__": {"id_": "26720eed-d109-42a1-a73b-74af100d0555", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/solutions-focus-community-led-successes-marine-conservation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Solutions in focus : community-led successes in marine conservation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/solutions-focus-community-led-successes-marine-conservation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d6924cf242a62c1290d9ef0a0bfce3ddd8cbd781be785fc6a9e7f4f3e50c162c"}, "3": {"node_id": "f11cc4b7-79dd-4b26-a9a6-39ea45583d47", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/solutions-focus-community-led-successes-marine-conservation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1cc268533728a9bde3465ddc48f4fb497d374ecd56c677bb0eb2b0ae33734995"}}, "hash": "747b8927661e808d8a4b166c038ab0915354020eeac7cef4396b2e7004d1ff86", "text": "health and education.

Closures typically cover 25% of a community\u2019s overall octopus fishing area and are in place for 2-3 months at a time. There is compelling evidence that this improves fishery yields and local incomes, thereby building support to protect natural resources through locally managed marine areas (LMMAs); areas where the management of marine resources are at least in part under community control. These LMMAs often employ marine management strategies such as bans on destructive fishing practices and community-enforced permanent no-take zones. Location: Andavadoaka, Madagascar SOLUTION Impacts Octopus closures can improve catches and income, with landings from closed fishing sites increasing by 700% in the month following the lifting of a closure, boosting the catch per fisher per day by 90% over the same period. 1 dollars\u2019 worth of octopus left in the closed fishing site grows to $1.81 by the end of a closure. In Madagascar, the success of early closures has led to communities following suit, with 270 closures to date. Adoption continues to grow each year in other countries in the region. The approach has been introduced to artisanal fisheries for mud crab and spiny lobster. Fishing communities across Madagascar have grouped together to establish more than 190 management associations and 70 LMMAs that ban destructive fishing practices. MIHARI, Madagascar\u2019s LMMA network, now covers over 17% of the island\u2019s seabed, and is championed at the highest levels of government. At the end of 2017, Blue Ventures\u2019 work in Madagascar is improving the lives of over 200,000 people. The imperative now is to bring this successful approach to coastal communities across the Indian Ocean. Organizations Involved: 17 Kick-starting marine conservation through local fisheries management Building blocks Community assessment Preliminary diagnostics are carried out with communities to assess their perception of the state of marine resources, the need for management and their motivation to take responsibility for management. The support organisation should not pressure the community into agreeing to management measures that they are not motivated to enforce. Peer-to-peer learning exchange Fishers from target communities visit other communities already implementing temporary fishery closures or other marine management strategies. By learning directly from real fishers from similar backgrounds, target communities realise they can adapt strategies in their own contexts. Collaborative closure design Communities select a target species, an area for temporary closures. Good collaboration between villages for surveillance and benefit sharing is helpful as well as discussing the timing of closures and openings with the fishers to ensure that everyone is party to the decision. Collaborative regulation setting The rules and regulations of the closure are decided upon in a village meeting setting, encouraging participation of as many as possible to ensure a high level of community ownership and support. Once the community is satisfied with the rules and regulations, local laws should be discussed openly and agreed upon. Community-based opening of closures All closures in an area need to open the same day, opening day procedures are established in advance with the participation of all concerned villages and coordinated with buyers.

The locally managed marine area (LMMA) favored regular exchange between community members and the establishment of new social groups such as the core and the communication teams. Most are willing to maintain the marine reserve even without financial and technical support from MCD. However, the recovery effect increased violations by local people and outsiders making the core group\u2019s enforcement efforts difficult.

Capacity building for community empowerment is an important precondition to successful LMMA planning and establishment. Participative management Ownership of the LMMA is transferred to local governance and all outputs are handed over to local authority while establishing the legal status of local stakeholders in the co-management structure. The perception of local communities as owners ensures the inclusion of native knowledge. Ecological restoration Establishing a no-take reef zone and develop the enforcement of LMMA regulations, providing the required training for execution of coral transplantation for reef restoration. Regular monitoring investigations to monitor the resource recovery can be conducted. Fine-tuning site management Legalize LMMA at district and provincial levels and implement an initial 2-year management plan to be regularly revised. Regular monitoring and reporting includes annual meetings of all members involved in co- management, which creates networks at national and regional levels. 1 2 3 4 Raising awareness in Van Hung with a 3D model \u00a9 MCD MPA watch station at Trao Reef \u00a9 MCD 20 5 Participatory Marine Protected Area Management Solution provider: Bruno Monteferri, Conservamos por Naturaleza Summary: The local fishermen of Marcona (Ica, Peru), who benefit from the marine resources of San Fernando Cove (Ensenada de San Fernando), were engaged in participatory processes to create and categorize a National Reserve. The fishermen are active partners in current management through the Management Committee of the National Reserve of San Fernando. Location: San Fernando Cove, Marcona, Ica, Peru SOLUTION Impacts Traditional fishery rights are respected to avoid the tragedy of the commons. When the Reserved Zone of San Fernando was created, exploitation of marine macroalgae increased. In the process of classifying the Reserved Zone as a National Reserve, local fishermen generated revenue from resource collection. This led to assignment of resource use rights, ensured that fishermen contribute to control and surveillance. Co-management helped slow migration from the highland in search of economic benefits from macroalgae use. The creation of a Management Committee, bringing together different associations of fishermen and stakeholders, allows for different perspectives in management dialogues and reduces conflicts. This creates a formal communication channel regarding the MPA and helps with zoning permitted and not permitted uses in the MPA. Organizations Involved: 21 Participatory Marine Protected Area Management Building blocks Dialogue between fishermen groups and MPA officials Local participation, dialogue and scientific data have to be considered to decide the future management scheme of the protected area. Agreements should be recorded, consistency of the different actors\u2019 positions documented. A General Assembly open to the public generates a sense of openness and disseminates general information. Management committee Interested local stakeholders are invited, members are registered and a council with a president are elected by the General Assembly. The management committee becomes a space for dialogue, facilitates support to the protected area management authority. Hence, decisions are based on formal processes and communication between the government authorities and locals is fluid. Legal resource use rights Legal resource rights were assigned to local management groups to carry out sustainable use activities if the groups commit to providing support in surveillance and enforcement. If allocated rights to use a specific resource, the locals can be a vital ally. 1 2 \u00a9 Triglav National Park 3 Macroalgae being processed at the plant in Nazca before being sent to the alginate industry.

Location: \u014ctautahi / Christchurch, New Zealand, Oceania region SOLUTION Impacts Monitoring has shown that restoration techniques are effective in re-establishing coastal dunes in New Zealand. Increased abundance and cover of indigenous dune plant species and the persistence of dune landforms are some of the measures of success. At the species level there are several threatened and at-risk species reliant on dunes. At the ecosystem level both \u2018active\u2019 and \u2018stabilised\u2019 sand dune systems are priorities for protection due to historical declines. Another feature of many New Zealand dune restoration projects has been a community-based approach. At the management level the focus on community involvement has been facilitated by initiatives such as \u2018Coastcare\u2019 projects that provide opportunities for public participation. Positive effects of this approach include increasing the awareness and understanding of dune conservation needs, and direct gains for management through volunteer contributions to restoration work.

Effective strategies need to provide participation opportunities to suit different groups and address the sustainability of key volunteer inputs. Research on the effectiveness of restoration methods Research into the effectiveness of restoration methods can assist community-led projects in both the design and implementation of initiatives. Working off a sound knowledge base is especially critical for community- based projects where voluntary inputs are high. This not only improves the likelihood of success from a restoration
