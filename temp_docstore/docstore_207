gthen local governance systems. As part of this initiative, the regional team supported, 16 UNDP Country Offices and government counterparts respond to emerging local governance demands in 2015. Key achievements include: In Pakistan, following local elections and a change in provisions related to fiscal transfers to local levels, UNDP BRH supported UNDP Pakistan to review its local governance portfolio to work more closely with provincial and sub-national administrations to establish local governance systems and capacities at the lower tiers of government (village level). In Afghanistan, Lao PDR and Sri Lanka, local economic development is increasingly used as an entry-point to advocate and strengthen local governance systems. This approach has given more the voice to communities in local decision making, helped establish new Public- Private Partnerships and simplified business processes (i.e.: One-Stop-Shops). In the Solomon Islands and in Papua New Guinea, UNDP\u2019s work on local governance was commended for having improved sub-national public financial management and resulted in central governments deciding to increase fiscal allocations to sub-national administrations. In Vietnam, the Regional Hub helped organize, together with the Country Office and the University of Oxford, a regional workshop to discuss Ho Chi Minh City\u2019s experience on Multi- Dimensional Poverty Index. The workshop brought together participants from six countries and discuss how MPI helps improve targeting, planning and budgeting. In 2015, partnerships were also strengthened with development partners, multilateral banks (ADB), technical/advocacy networks (LOGIN), municipalities and research institutes. The BRH team worked with India, China, Nepal, Myanmar and Republic of Korea to document innovative local governance processes for South-south Cooperation and is planning a regional forum on local governance in Chengdu (China) in September 2016. The team was also part of the regional Development Solutions Team (DST) on Urbanization and contributed to the Asia-Pacific urban strategy. It contributed to the development of the BPPS policy papers, \u201cLocal governance in fragile states\u201d; \u201cLocal governance and Local Economic Development\u201d and other policy briefs on localizing the SDGs. STRENGTHENING THE GOVERNANCE OF EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES FOR SUSTAINABLE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT The extractives sector is a vital sector in Asia and the Pacific. Countries in the region are among the largest producers and consumers of fossil fuels and mineral resources in the world. The region accounts for nearly half of the global production and consumption of oil and gas, and around 70 percent of mineral products such as coal, copper, iron, nickel and zinc. Although the extractives sector is vital for modern economies, the very nature of extraction is environmental destructive. Further, lack of a strong governance framework of the extractives sector is exacerbating existing challenges and has broad repercussions on inclusive economic development, environment protection, human rights, conflict, and gender equality in the region.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f5e6ef46-35be-47d2-862c-a095af8cdedc": {"__data__": {"id_": "f5e6ef46-35be-47d2-862c-a095af8cdedc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-peace-building-annual-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance & Peace-Building Annual Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-peace-building-annual-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dc27cb6d37df9d0d51d3647708544e3838a628aac7394e21ebfe0a1af391788b"}, "2": {"node_id": "ec4dd266-b066-4de7-abec-93c090b7fb9d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-peace-building-annual-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "da483c17f903dc9038d7668cac4e3ed091ead13d052d3b565e298a74512d11f2"}}, "hash": "48c7ee7a3740be6f40b7ad52bd60d8aae1a2c2fe1e68811fff8ad761b43b2ace", "text": "To address the multiple challenges of the extractives sector, BRH adopted a multidimensional and interdisciplinary approach to address the multiple challenges of the extractives sector in Asia-Pacific.

The Strengthening Governance of Extractive Industries for Sustainable Human Development project funded by BCPR (now BPPS) supported regional and country level activities. . Activities were implemented in four countries (Indonesia, Mongolia, Pakistan and the Philippines). In Indonesia, support was provided to the development of Coal Mining Road Map, Feasibility Study on Sovereign Wealth Fund in Bojonegoro, and the development of Mining Governance Index with the Anti-Corruption Agency (KPK). The Mining Governance Index builds on the corruption risk assessment pilot supported by the UNDP anti-corruption programme. The Mining Governance index methodology was developed and implemented by KPK, UNDP, and partners (academics, experts, NGOs working on mining issues, and Indigenous People\u2019s organizations). The quality of governance in extractives sector in 12 provinces was assessed and scored in five categories: licensing arrangements, fulfillment of financial obligations, production supervision, processing supervision, and sales supervision. Targeted activities are expected to be implemented in 2016, based on the findings from the mining governance index. In Mongolia, preparatory activities were completed and experts were hired to conduct three studies: a. Mining revenue allocation study, b. Consultancy on Responsible mining, c. Study on Corruption Risk mitigation. The three studies will be completed in 2016. In Pakistan, a mapping and analysis of constitutional, legal, institutional and financial aspects of the extractive industries governance is currently being conducted, and will be completed in 2016. . In the Philippines, the GREENR project supported local and national consultations on governance of the mining sector. The project also brought together all the oversight institutions to discuss their role in strengthening environmental governance in the Philippines. A regional South-South Exchange and Training meeting was held in Bangkok in October 2015.

This commitment was embodied in the 2030 Agenda and its 17 Sustain- able Development Goals (SDGs) endorsed by the member coun- tries of the United Nations. This new agenda underpins several landmark agreements adopted on tackling climate change, fi- nancing development, managing disaster risks, and responding to humanitarian crises. Countries across Asia and the Pacific played central roles in negotiating these agreements. The region has much to celebrate and share with the rest of the world. Its emerging economies have become engines of global growth, and it has led the remark- able decline in poverty under the Millennium Development Goals. In 2000, 15 of the region\u2019s 36 countries qualified as low income; today, only 4 remain in that cate- gory. A number of countries have achieved gender parity in educa- tion and some are now providing universal health care. Nonetheless, countries in the region, like all others, still have progress to make. The 2030 Agen- da recognized that the current trajectory of global development is not without peril to people and the planet. That is why, in an historic first, the Agenda\u2019s goals apply to all countries, from the least to the most developed. Inequalities remain stark in the Asia and the Pacific region, and in some cases have become worse. People in rural areas and minority groups are among those still left behind. Gender gaps con- tinue in employment and political representation. Youth populations have reached record numbers, but they are not consistently making smooth transitions into adult- hood, for reasons that include inadequate training and insuffi- cient employment. People across the region are increasingly aware of the impacts of unsustainable depletion of natural resources, severe air pollution, and deadly natural disasters. Asia and the Pacific today are increasingly poised to meet these complex challenges. Many countries will continue to turn to UNDP as a trusted and indispens- able partner and source of solu- Foreword 3 tions. As we celebrated UNDP\u2019s 50th anniversary in 2016, it was a moment to look back at our long legacy of development support to countries, and also to highlight our strong potential for provid- ing support to people around the world to realize their high aspira- tions of the 2030 Agenda.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ca26d0d3-a74d-4f49-b5bc-303c66c9705c": {"__data__": {"id_": "ca26d0d3-a74d-4f49-b5bc-303c66c9705c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-results-report-2015-2016", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Results Report 2015-2016", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-results-report-2015-2016", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1f13e4e5f927dff5c46b59495d026c0397046fd11fdda116f4e53ef415c7c5c1"}, "2": {"node_id": "701c4037-db71-4b45-8ae7-bee8038ddb8d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-results-report-2015-2016", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e156d7184935507e15f5d97d703a229eab317aa8959adc7d38ba3f21ae076719"}}, "hash": "fad18287324a67238d9916308698ca9c150af3391a72757b13d124789f9ea3f0", "text": "Already we are assisting coun- tries in moving forward to plan, finance, and track the steps they need to take to reach the SDGs.

Everything we do reflects our strong commitment to account- ability and integrity, and to mak- ing the most of investments in development which will be signif- icant in the era of the SDGs. In 2016, for the second year in a row, UNDP was named the world\u2019s most transparent aid organization by the non-governmental group Publish What You Fund, and is a leading advocate for universal adoption of the International Aid Transparency Index standard. This annual results report highlights just some of UNDP\u2019s outstanding contributions made in Asia and the Pacific over the last year with our partner gov- ernments and with the support of donors. It shows, country by country, that the need for sus- tainable, inclusive development is often great. At the same time, transformative change is hap- pening. Millions of people have greater hopes for well-being than ever before, whether that means a decent job, quality public ser- vices, or a freely cast vote. The right choices and actions, taken systematically and starting right now, will put us on track for a more peaceful and prosperous region\u2014and world\u2014within reach by 2030. Helen Clark Administrator United Nations Development Programme 4 The story of the Asia-Pacific re- gion in recent years is the story of remarkable change. From widespread poverty to increasing prosperity, from main- ly rural communities to urban megalopolises, development has boomed, and that trend is expect- ed to continue. Progress is the hallmark of the 2030 Agenda and its 17 SDGs, which commit to transformative development that leaves no one behind. UNDP in Asia and the Pacif- ic has embraced this drive for change. We support 36 coun- tries in the region, as this annual results report demonstrates. In a world committed to a better future, we aim for speed, inno- vation, agility, competitiveness and quality. UNDP has the flexibility and expertise to tailor our assistance to large economies as well as small and fragile states, to countries seeking to fine-tune development progress and to those striving to restore foundations in the wake of protracted crises. A powerful vote of confidence for our work comes from govern- ments in the region. Increasingly, these governments are dedicat- ing a growing share of their re- sources to partner in development work with us. During 2015-2016, UNDP received approximately US $116 million in co-financing from 17 Asia-Pacific governments. The 2030 Agenda is a major undertaking. It draws on political commitment at all levels, attracts development expertise, and po- tentially gives rise to trillions of dollars for developing new ser- vices and infrastructure. Long active in tackling the triple challenge of poverty, in- equality and exclusion, UNDP in Asia and the Pacific is partnering with governments to integrate the SDGs across their development programmes and investments. We are providing thought leader- ship to solve emerging challenges, and are at the vanguard of a data revolution to comprehensively measure progress of the goals. The new Agenda calls on ev- eryone to think and act in new ways, including through inno- vation. UNDP has a growing re- cord of reaching out to the most vulnerable in innovative ways, so that essential services reach the most remote areas. For instance, our programmes have tapped into mobile technology, and global Preface 5 positioning systems to boost par- ticipation in elections, and help finance and forestall the worst impacts of disasters. We believe that innovation is key to mobilizing new resources and diversifying partnerships, and to prototype and test bright ideas that can be scaled up to transform development. Given the ambitious scope of the SDGs, closer engagement be- tween the public and the private sector is essential.

In adopting the 2030 Agenda and its 17 Sustain- able Development Goals (SDGs), countries everywhere agreed that we can wait no longer. The time has come to fight all forms of poverty and inequality, and combat climate change. We have the knowledge to tackle the for- mer, and the last opportunity to fend off the worst consequences of the latter. That means thinking big, act- ing with bold ambition, and aim- ing for no less than the transfor- mation of our world. Much will need to happen in Asia and the Pacific, home to half the global population. Recent years have shown the region\u2019s enormous possibilities. Its diverse and dynamic econo- mies power global growth, and on the global stage, it is increas- ingly a leader and generator of innovations shared within and beyond the region. From the start of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2000 until now, Asia and the Pacific\u2019s share of the world economy expanded from 30 percent to 40 percent. The number of people in poverty plummeted from 1.1 billion then to just over 300 million today. These gains, while remarkable, have not come without costs. The region faces mounting pressure from unprecedented urbaniza- tion and unsustainable drains on natural resources. Rapid growth has ushered in many benefits, yet these elude some popula- tion groups, who remain on the fringes of the economic miracle. Deep-seated gender discrimi- nation persists in much of the region. Complicating these and other concerns is acute vulnera- bility to natural disasters. So there is work to do\u2014but also, in the 2030 Agenda, a com- mon vision for how to move for- ward. As the global successor to the MDGs, the 2030 Agenda was shaped and endorsed by coun- A Time of I.High Ambition 7 tries across Asia and the Pacific and the world. It represents the first universal agenda commit- ting all nations, whether more or less developed, to development that is sustainable and leaves no one behind. No country has yet achieved this. And no country will by the Agenda\u2019s 2030 endpoint with- out dismantling barriers such as those related to inequality, unsustainable consumption and production patterns, the lack of decent work and exclusion from public decision-making. Despite complex challenges, Asia and the Pacific today is in a better position to meet and rise above these challenges. Its growing strengths, in people, knowledge and financing, are the foundation for realizing the 2030 Agenda. UNDP works in close partnership with countries across the region to help make change happen on the scale that transformation demands. Making gains, reducing risks In 2015, at the beginning of the 2030 Agenda, strong economic growth continued across much of Asia and the Pacific, with a record number of countries hav- ing moved into a middle-income ranking. Elections deepened and extended democratic governance in Mongolia, Myanmar, Pakistan and Papua New Guinea\u2019s Bougain- ville, while a ceasefire agreement in Myanmar promised an end to one of the longest civil conflicts. Nepal appointed its first woman President, and the finalization of the Cook Island elections ushered women into 17 percent of parlia- mentary seats, the highest share ever in the Pacific region, where women\u2019s representation has long lingered in the low single digits. The year also saw worrisome threats to democratic space and rights, from attacks on activists and religious minorities in Ban- gladesh, to pressure on space for civil society in Malaysia. In Afghanistan, an escalation in conflict spurred a new flood of migrants fleeing the country. Nat- ural disasters including earth- quakes, typhoons and droughts stole thousands of lives and im- posed heavy economic costs\u2014$7 billion in losses and damages after the Nepal earthquake, for instance, with an additional $6.7 billion required for reconstruc- tion. When Typhoon Maysak hit the Federated States of Micro- nesia, 90 percent of food crops in some states were obliterated. In 2015 and into 2016, across Asia and the Pacific, UNDP helped countries protect and ad- vance gains that have been made, while reducing risks of reversal. We assisted in connecting people to sustainable livelihoods, such as slum dwellers in Bangladesh and herders in Mongolia. Our pro- grammes aided people in Myan- mar and Pakistan in conducting successful elections, improving prospects for stability and se- curity along with the quality of democratic governance.

Afghanistan introduced gender-based budgeting through our assistance as part of extend- ing services and opportunities to women and girls. To achieve these and other development results document- ed in this annual report, UNDP brought people together, provid- ed cutting-edge analysis, pro- cured essential supplies, helped cultivate a variety of skills and capabilities, and advocated for development that is both inclusive and sustainable. Whatever forms our support took, it remained grounded foremost in respon- siveness to the priorities of the countries where we work. A testament to our continued success in Asia and the Pacific in the past five years has been the doubling in the financing that developing country governments have invested in UNDP pro- grammes in their own countries. Partnership and innovation Having served countries across Asia and the Pacific for 50 years, UNDP has become a trusted part- ner. Countries turn to us for de- velopment expertise in solving difficult issues, knowing that we can draw on extensive regional and global networks. Our sup- port, long rooted in the reali- ties of development, anticipated the emphasis on integration and inclusion in the 2030 Agenda. We work from a whole of society perspective, connecting different dimensions of sustainable devel- opment\u2014economic, social and environmental\u2014to unlock their combined power to accelerate and sustain progress. At the start of the 2030 Agen- da, we are bringing together the diverse actors, national and inter- national, public and private, who will need to combine their knowl- edge and resources to achieve the 17 SDGs. With our assistance, a number of countries have already forged ahead with the planning and data collection processes re- quired to put the SDGs at the centre of national development. Now and moving forward, UNDP will increasingly work with countries to capture innova- tions crucial in meeting the high ambitions of the 2030 Agenda\u2014 from crowdfunding to innovation labs to apps that give ordinary citizens a wider role in creating changes they want to see in their lives. Once new solutions have proven their worth, they need to be scaled up, within countries, around the region and beyond. In 12 countries, UNDP backed MDG action plans to close final gaps; 8 countries devised SDG transition plans. 10 10 Helping nations get a jump on the SDGs The 2030 Agenda is a milestone global com- mitment to development that improves hu- man well-being, leaves no one behind, and protects the environmental resources on which all societies depend. Even as govern- ments were putting the finishing touches on the agreement at the United Nations, UNDP began helping countries in Asia and the Pacific become among the first to move towards implementation. We provided detailed research and sup- ported a cross-ministerial dialogue that Chi- na used to become the first G-20 country to fully align its national development plan with achieving the SDGs. Lao People\u2019s Demo- cratic Republic finalized its 8th National Socioeconomic Development Plan with a monitoring and evaluation system based on measuring progress to reach the goals. UNDP supported mappings of national development strategies against the SDGs in Bhutan, Mongolia and Tonga. In Bhutan, this assessment established alignment with 134 SDG targets and is being used to advocate for implementation support. In Tonga, assess- ment results are informing the formulation of planning and budgeting frameworks. Mon- golia\u2019s assessment contributed to adjusting the national long-term sustainable develop- ment vision and is informing strategies and policies at the national and sub-national levels. It highlighted significant data gaps for three of the SDGs and identified 21 additional indicators for monitoring. An ongoing data ecosystem mapping, part of a global UNDP pilot exercise, is looking at the data gaps in greater detail as well as the institutional and policy changes required to close them. Pakistan, with UNDP assistance, has be- gun integrating the SDGs in provincial de- velopment plans.

At the 46th Pacific Islands Forum, UNDP helped countries from across the region agree on a framework to guide national ap- plication of the SDGs. In Papua New Guinea, which hosted the forum, the Government drew on a number of UNDP analyses in de- veloping its Mid-Term Development Plan 2. Its aims, in line with the SDGs, include tripling the number of people employed in small and medium businesses by 2017. In Malaysia, UNDP helped organize the Global Transformation Forum, a draw for over 3,000 participants from 70 countries, includ- ing former heads of state and government, ministers, senior policy makers and repre- sentatives from civil society and business. Together, they reflected on global lessons from the MDGs, exchanged their own expe- riences from diverse development situations, and collaborated in \u2018thinking forward\u2019 to rapid SDG implementation. With the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), UNDP took part in produc- ing a final sub-regional assessment of MDG achievements. It will help lay the ground- work for implementing the 2030 Agenda, including through highlighting emerging challenges and recommending areas of regional support. For the Asia and the Pacific region as a whole, a partnership between UNDP, the Asian Development Bank and the Unit- ed Nations Economic and Social Commis- sion for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) has highlighted implementation issues related to financing and the transfer of technology, and is positioned to systematically assess progress moving forward. 12 Learning from a changing world High performance will be criti- cal in moving towards the 2030 Agenda. To that end, UNDP, as a learning organization, will con- tinue seeking to understand what drives or holds back the delivery of strong results, and refine strat- egies accordingly. Other priorities will include further sharpening our programmatic focus on the poor and excluded, recognizing that social and economic inclu- sion is a vital concern. We have learned from experi- ence that programmes are more successful when they are focused but flexible enough to build on the interdependencies among the many dimensions of development, whether between livelihoods and natural resources management, or democratic governance and essential services, among many other issues. Some UNDP coun- try offices are moving to reduce the number of standalone proj- ects, aiming for a more strategic portfolio. Area-based approaches with a geographic concentration of projects are one way forward. There is a need to consistently codify best practices, including as part of providing strong technical advisory services. Engaging with all those involved in and affected by a given programme from the earliest stages of development builds a level of awareness and ownership that often leads to greater, more lasting impacts. The potential of South-South cooperation is increasingly clear. Within UNDP, country offices pursuing more of these initiatives in many cases show higher levels of performance. We have also learned the critical importance of factoring the interplay of risk and devel- opment into planning, manage- ment, monitoring and evaluation. The ability to adapt to changing circumstances\u2014at times with no advance warning\u2014is cru- cial. Routine, rigorous analysis helps understand risks that can derail local communities, econ- omies and development overall. It supports timely programming adjustments and risk-informed decisions. Delivering results in high-security contexts, in par- ticular, requires more innovative modes of programme delivery and partnerships to sustain de- livery of support, as well as the broader prerogative of forging links between humanitarian, peace and security and develop- ment interventions. Flexibility in using existing programmes for a crisis response can accelerate recovery efforts. UNDP\u2019s commitment to the 36 Asia and Pacific countries where we work is that we will stand by all efforts to meet the transforma- tive promise of the 2030 Agenda. Through inclusive, sustainable development, an ever-growing number of people will see steady improvements in their lives, and know that these can be sustained far into the future, for generations to come. 13 The N-Peace Network helps grass-roots peace-builders in Afghanistan, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan and the Philippines make connections with each other and develop new skills.

The report highlighted the need for the continued and effective engagement of youth in the economy, politics and develop- ment. Young people are more vulnerable to long-term unemployment and increasingly reluctant to vote, implying that the country\u2019s democratic institutions are not sufficiently responsive to their concerns. In Pakistan, the 2016 National Human Development Report on youth stressed sig- nificant opportunities from a \u2018youth dividend\u2019, provided the country makes the right invest- ments in quality education, gainful employ- ment and meaningful engagement. Guided by an Advisory Council represented by major political parties, the Government and leading intellectuals, the report built on a comprehen- sive outreach process that included 130,000 individuals across the country, who expressed their ideas through surveys, consultations, research and social media exchanges. 16 Countries trust UNDP\u2019s record of results\u2026 And to innovate Our ability to connect India provided over a million social assistance benefits to HIV affected people. 40,000 voting sites for Myanmar\u2019s first-in-a-generation multiparty election.

Sustainable Development Sustainable development is a commitment to deeply rooted, transformative change. It calls for in- clusive economies and societies that meet the needs of all people. It rests on sound environmental stewardship that supports human well-being without overstretching natural resources. UNDP helps countries across Asia and the Pacific achieve sustainable development. We assist in crafting the right policies, building well-equipped institutions and services, and pursuing innovations that unleash rapid change. Countries at all stages of development draw on our expertise in tackling poverty and exclusion, and embedding environmental considerations in a range of development programmes, including to improve people\u2019s livelihoods. Our solutions respond to pressing challenges, from diversifying economies so they deliver decent work, to fostering a fair sharing of the benefits of natural resources. Towards achieving the SDGs, we are a leading partner in measures to integrate the goals in national and subnational plans, mobilize financing and develop robust data to assess progress. 21 Highly vulnerable to climate change, Viet Nam aims to adapt agriculture to safeguard livelihoods, raise agricultural production and boost food security. 22 UNDP helps marginalized rural women in Bangladesh find decent work and play empowered roles in their communities.

At an earlier time, she lived in desperate straits, with no public services, not even a regular water supply. She and her husband struggled to take care of their children on meagre wages as cooks. And then they encountered Urban Partnerships for Poverty Reduction, a UNDP programme that has begun to transform the lives of Khadija and over 3 mil- lion slum dwellers like her. Under the programme\u2019s Settlement Im- provement Fund, Khadija gained a safe water supply and clean san- itary facilities, as well as a proper footpath connecting her home to the road. By participating in a local savings group, she was able to set up a small business that improved the family income. As importantly, the programme taught Khadija leadership skills and urged her to speak up for herself and her community.

Through it, in 23 towns and cities, poor and extremely poor people, especially women and girls, saw improve- ments in health, education and living standards. UNDP, by drawing together diverse expertise and building on strong partnerships, designed the programme to comprehensively tackle the many dimensions of urban poverty\u2014a lack of income, poor housing, no political voice and inadequate services, among many others. Taking these on one at a time can leave little lasting impact, so the programme worked on them together, helping people transform their lives for the lon- ger term. The starting point was the community itself, recognizing that people best understand their own needs and priorities. Supported by the programme, groups of households created 2,600 community development committees, 90 percent of which are led by women. These are fur- ther grouped into federations at the municipal level, many of which are now represented within municipal governments, deep- ening the reach of democratic governance. Through the com- mittees, slum dwellers have mo- bilized around community action plans and skillfully advocated for including these in municipal pov- erty reduction plans and budgets. The committees helped slum dwellers create savings and loan groups that provided much-need- ed access to credit, while encour- Scaling up social protection India has a number of well-devel- oped poverty reduction and social protection schemes, but it has only been recently that these have paid explicit attention to the distinct con- cerns faced by people living with HIV. Through UNDP assistance, over 100 state and central social assistance schemes extended benefits related to pensions, scholarships, travel allow- ances, subsidies for food and shelter, among others, to address the needs of HIV-affected people. Lowering the pension age for spouses, for instance, recognizes that they may lose their partners at an earlier stage of life. So far, the schemes have responded to over a million requests for benefits, in- cluding multiple types of assistance for individuals with diverse requirements. Almost 200 districts in areas with high HIV prevalence rates and/or high vulnerability have set up single-win- dow service centres to connect peo- ple to the full range of services that can improve their lives. The experience has informed efforts to expand social protection to HIV-af- fected people in Cambodia. HIV-sen- sitive measures in survey instruments now allow the more precise identifi- cation of all poor urban households eligible for social protection schemes. 25 Combatting threats to health In partnership with the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Ma- laria (GFATM) and the World Health Organization, UNDP has helped Iran develop and implement a compre- hensive national strategy to eradi- cate malaria. Connecting the array of actions required to combat this debilitating disease, the plan guides the reduction of mosquito breeding grounds, and has established over 400 diagnostic posts in remote and high risk rural villages. More than 3,700 local volunteers, mainly women, have been trained to educate their communities on malaria risks and encourage test- ing. Nearly 800,000 nets treated with insecticide have been distributed, and 1.5 million people trained to use them. By 2016, Iran could claim a 96 per- cent reduction in annual local ma- laria cases since 2010. Over 800,000 people living in remote and socially and economically underdeveloped rural areas, who used to be at risk of malaria, now live in places free from the disease.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1edeb168-d38c-4789-bb6a-375d7a8ba9f1": {"__data__": {"id_": "1edeb168-d38c-4789-bb6a-375d7a8ba9f1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-results-report-2015-2016", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Results Report 2015-2016", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-results-report-2015-2016", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "46c50a986a55b8dca165e6183e29d47ce1bcacf67b189a9068ff24d83d29e907"}, "2": {"node_id": "0bd245e1-603d-4196-b059-60fe2354d6f1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-results-report-2015-2016", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a049d0d38db79f0c3caa7e1f5a6d5ecf15f5dc0b97c39bcb365500f205f6b347"}}, "hash": "becd0f54cafad7e7b14835a360fd50b671fc0888f0cd81f1177fd34a49dcc5ba", "text": "aging people, often for the first time, to plan, invest in and aspire to higher standards of living.

They helped women in particular build skills and secure local employment opportunities. A number of innovative urban planning processes were intro- duced. Settlement land maps pre- sented some of the first compre- hensive records of infrastructure and services in poor community, while a community contracting model opened doors for com- munity-based organizations to participate in contracts for public services. Both are now used by municipalities across Bangladesh. In 2015, the World Bank agreed to finance the national scale-up of the Community Housing Devel- opment Fund, which makes low- cost financial services for housing improvements available to poor urban communities. Lessons learned from Urban Partnerships for Poverty Reduc- tion have become the foundation for the new National Urban Pov- erty Reduction Programme.

The programme aims to reach 6 mil- lion slum dwellers, scaling up many of the strategies that UNDP helped to introduce, with their value now well demonstrated by communities themselves. Sharing natural resource benefits The fair sharing of natural resources helps make development more in- clusive and sustainable. In Sri Lanka, a community forestry programme backed by UNDP allows poor house- holds to use degraded government land as it is being reforested. People who live nearby can grow crops for food and income among newly plant- ed sapling trees, which reduces the likelihood of encroachment on nearly 2 million hectares of mature local for- ests. Nearly 34,000 households have benefited so far, with income levels rising almost 36 percent. The govern- ment Forest Department, one of the country\u2019s largest landholders, plans to extend the strategy nationwide. In Bhutan, a project financed by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) is bringing together local commu- nities, deeply steeped in traditional knowledge of medicinal plants, with pharmaceutical companies testing new medications. The process is linked to a new national access and benefit-sharing framework that spells out the rights and responsibilities of all parties. It aims at ensuring that communities are equitably involved in exploring new uses of natural resourc- es, and draw direct benefits through economic opportunities that have otherwise eluded remote rural areas. Farmers learn about the framework as well as new cultivation techniques for promising plants. 14 countries adopted new partnerships to fund the sustainable management of natural resources, ecosystems, chemicals and waste. 26 27 A mobile app, \u201cBaidu Recycle,\u201d connects users in 22 Chinese cities to legally certified e-waste disposal companies, like this one in Tianjin.

Today, 40 percent do, largely through a part- nership between the Pacific Financial Inclu- sion Programme, a joint initiative by UNDP and the United Nations Capital Development Fund, the Central Bank and a series of private banks. They worked together to overcome the geographical barriers of a country with 1,000 islands and many remote communities, developing a system involving point-of-sale terminals at small local shops where custom- ers can deposit and withdraw cash using a swipe card. By the end of 2015, 195,000 new accounts had been opened, allowing peo- ple to save, invest and plan their finances in a way that had never been possible before. China\u2019s e-waste problem is huge\u2014a stag- gering 65 million tonnes of discarded mobile phones, laptops and so on estimated by 2017. To step up recycling on a mass scale, UNDP partnered with Chinese tech giant Baidu to debut an app linking people with waste to businesses legally certified to recycle it.

Funded by the GEF Small Grants Programme and implemented by UNDP, the project has helped two minority groups displaced two de- cades ago by a giant dam project in the Lashihai Lake watershed. Left without sufficient resources for their traditional methods of farming, they resorted to cultivation on hills, which caused devastating mudslides. Over- fishing as people struggled to survive seriously depleted local fisheries. Through the Green Watershed proj- ect, local communities formed auton- omous associations to sustainably manage water and land resources. The collective adoption of agroforestry, for instance, has increased incomes and preserved over 1,300 hectares of mountain forest. Improved infrastruc- ture provides reliable supplies of wa- ter for cooking and feeding livestock. Protective forests have been planted to prevent landslides, and houses reinforced to resist earthquakes and snowstorms. The project has now be- come widely recognized in China as a model for poverty alleviation and watershed protection, as well as di- saster preparedness. Nearly 700,000 people in 15 countries benefitted from improved natural resources management. 32 Democratic Governance and Peacebuilding Democratic governance allows all citizens a voice in the decisions that affect them, whether through voting in elections or holding public officials accountable for delivering high-quality public services. As such, it is fundamental to development that is inclusive, stable and sustainable over time. UNDP helps foster democratic governance through more responsive and transparent institutions. We assist in organizing credible elections, strengthening the effectiveness of parliaments, and bolstering the quality and inclusiveness of local governance. Our support backs the extension of quality pub- lic services to all citizens, particularly poor and marginalized communities, and reinforces the rule of law and citizen security through policies and laws as well as broadly accessible legal services. As a trusted partner in Asia and the Pacific, UNDP fosters spaces for dialogue that encourage social consensus and reconciliation, and can cut the risk of conflict. In bridging the gap between human- itarian, peacebuilding and longer term development efforts, we help countries and communities resolve disputes, and progress towards a firm foundation for peace and democratic governance. 33 In India, 65-year-old Basi proudly holds a land deed in her name; it was secured at a \u201cMy Land\u201d centre that provides rural women with information on land rights and resources for better farming.

The fact that the poll came off successfully showed the strength of ongoing reforms and the faith of Myanmar\u2019s peo- ple, the vast majority of whom felt the election would shape the country\u2019s future. Thet Thet Win, the financial officer of a self-help community group in the Ayer- awaddy Region, echoing a com- mon sentiment, proclaimed, \u201cThe ink on my finger means that I have voted, and I am really proud of that.\u201d As one of the leading providers of electoral assistance around the world, UNDP supported the election in Myanmar from the beginning, through a series of measures aimed at keeping it se- cure and peaceful. The challenge was great, involving the establish- ment of 40,000 voting sites, even in areas with minimal roads and electricity.

Women also saw gains in Papua New Guinea\u2019s autonomous region of Bougainville, where UNDP\u2019s extended support to the electoral pro- cess encompassed training women candidates. Four women, including two of the trainees, gained seats in the 40-member House of Representa- tives. While their share of seats is still low, it signifies a slow but steady shift in a region where rates of women in office have traditionally been among the lowest in the world. Three of the women won seats reserved for women, but a fourth competed against men for an open constituency and won, another sign of progress. It was the first time in the history of Bougainville that a woman won an unreserved seat. Over 9.5 new people in the Asia-Pacific region registered to vote. 36 after dark. Improved coordination in man- aging the elections came through intensive training for 14 subna- tional electoral security manage- ment committees. Sessions delved into enhanced electoral security planning, risk reduction and en- hanced communications across different levels of government. The training provided some of the first chances for committee members to work together and for members outside of the police to contribute to security planning. This encouraged a shift from the traditional emphasis on stopping physical violence to a much great- er focus on public safety and an environment actively fostering public participation. Briefings for 400 candidates in 13 states and regions under- scored how they could contribute to tranquil elections, including by acting in line with the established Code of Conduct for Political Par- ties and Candidates. Sessions Improving laws and legal access Sri Lanka\u2019s recent efforts to firm up its foundations of democratic gover- nance have included the 19th Amend- ment to the Constitution, approved by Parliament in 2015. The amend- ment, which drew on UNDP expertise, scaled back executive powers, rein- stated nine independent oversight commissions on critical issues such as elections and human rights, and introduced procedures to oversee higher level judicial appointments. The amendment also introduced the principle of the right to information, which has already shaped a draft Right to Information Bill. Eleven years of sustained UNDP support helped the Maldives reform its penal code, including to ensure more uniform sentencing, and emphasize rehabilitation and social reintegration. To introduce the new code, UNDP as- sisted the development of the Legal Sector Resource Centre within the Attorney General\u2019s Office; it has trained over 98 percent of police officers and public prosecutors on the new legal concepts and practices. In Timor-Leste, a system of mo- bile court sessions in 12 districts has extended access to justice among some of the most disadvantaged communities, while reducing large backlogs of pending cases. By 2015, more than 2,200 people had turned to the mobile courts to adjudicate over 1,100 criminal and civil cases. This system has proven particularly valuable in protecting the rights of women; half the cases relate to gen- der-based violence. UNDP supported Fiji for the first time to expand legal aid and other basic services to hard-to-reach rural areas and outer islands. A mobile service has already helped nearly 2,000 people. In Nepal, socio-legal aid centres expanded from 5 to 10 districts in 2015, serving nearly 5,400 people; another 26,000 received information from legal aid outreach programmes in those districts. In 11 countries, Parliaments increased administrative and human resources capacities. 37 clarified polling day procedures and electoral dispute resolution mechanisms, and corrected mis- conceptions. Civil society net- works in seven states and regions disseminated information to edu- cate voters, making special efforts to reach women, rural areas and marginalized groups. After the polls closed and the votes had been counted, inter- national observers affirmed that the election had significantly strengthened the democratic pro- cess. People in Myanmar agreed. Voter turnout was high, and ready access to information resulted in a soaring share of people feeling they could make informed deci- sions, from a mere 21 percent in the last poll in 2010 to 71 percent in 2015. Calm prevailed during the election and beyond, even where tensions initially had been high.

UNDP has helped Afghan- istan\u2019s Ministry of Finance develop such a strategy, now being implement- ed by six ministries covering an array of issues related to health, education, rural development and labour. All six ministries have established parame- ters to track service beneficiaries, 40 percent of whom are expected to be women in 2016. Several ministries have set aside specific funds to improve training for female staff. The Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs has become a full member of the National Budget Com- mittee to help oversee the process. Support to the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs has also helped it to develop a gender policy review kit aimed at embedding gender priorities into na- tional development strategies. This has, for instance, led the Ministry of Higher Education to draft a policy for setting up a gender studies curriculum. Children and youth represent the future, but still have little say in public decision-making, constraining the reach of democracy. Bhutan took a stand against this form of exclusion by launching the country\u2019s first Chil- dren\u2019s Parliament in 2015, developed by the Election Commission and the National Assembly with support from UNDP and the United Nations Chil- dren\u2019s Fund. Members come from a national network of Democracy Clubs where youth learn the principles and practices of electoral democracy. The Parliament will meet twice a year to debate top concerns for children and youth, with summary proceedings sent to the Prime Minister, Speaker of the National Assembly, Opposition Leader and other senior officials. Across the Asia and the Pacif- ic region, the Being LGBTI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex) initiative has increased attention to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Under a partnership led by UNDP\u2014involving the Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions; regional civil society organizations; the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the Inter- national Labour Organization; among others\u2014reports in eight countries com- prehensively analysed the state of LGBTI rights. The findings drew wide- spread media attention and sparked public debates. More awareness and solid data are now fuelling advocacy across the region. In Nepal, civil soci- ety groups joined forces to push for a historic victory in the new Constitution, which explicitly protects gender and sexual minorities from discrimination. 38 As Pakistan\u2019s provinces of Khyber Pakh- tunkhwa, Punjab, Sindh and Islamabad com- pleted a long-running exercise to extend democratic governance through electing local officials, UNDP worked with the Election Commission to help keep the polls free and fair. We turned to some traditional methods, such as voter education, which reached over 10 million women, encouraging many to vote for the first time. We also pursued promising new strategies. In Islamabad, we assisted the Commission in piloting an innovative GIS scheme that made polling station details available online. This allowed voters to identify the correct place to vote, and aided the Commission in complying with an election law requiring that stations be no more than two miles from where voters live. It reduced the possibility that stations might be moved at the last minute, a practice provoking widespread protests in the previous election. The scheme proved so valuable that the Commission plans to roll it out nationwide in the next general election, coupled with a mass information campaign to reach people without online access. Innovation in Action A GIS system helps keep polls free and fair 38 39 SMS reporting cuts the cost of corruption Foresight at the forefront of national development Corruption costs are high and pose a for- midable challenge to Papua New Guinea. UNDP collaborated with the Australian tele- com provider MobiMedia to prototype an SMS reporting system that sends warnings of corruption to a government watchdog. An initial pilot with staff in the Department of Finance resulted in 6,000 reports from over 1,500 users, the investigation of 251 cases of corruption and the arrest of two public officials for funds mismanagement entailing over $2 million. This success led to the expansion of the pilot to six government departments involving 25,000 staff\u2014towards the goal of eventually covering all of Papua New Guin- ea\u2019s nearly 84,000 civil servants. UNDP engaged policy makers in Sri Lanka in putting foresight techniques and innovation at the forefront of the national development framework, including through a national summit headlined by the Prime Minister. Over 300 leaders from the worlds of government and business participated, learning about key concepts such as disruptive innovation, game-based foresight, big data, digital in- frastructure, reimagining governance and sustainability. The event led to agreement on a Policy Innovation Lab, a private-public-people endeavour anchored in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office.

Bangladesh has drawn on UNDP\u2019s assistance to help establish nearly 5,300 digital service centres nationwide, mainly in areas with high rates of poverty and margin- alization. The centres offer 102 public and private services, such as for birth registration, land records, passport applications, and access to email and the Internet. By the end of 2015, people had use them 216 million times. UNDP has also helped the Govern- ment of Bangladesh establish an e-file document management system that processed 700,000 requests for in- formation and services in 2015, with a 50 percent increase in response times. In the judicial arena, a pilot digital case management system has replaced the former system of manual entry. Mobile devices now record court cases, making the process faster and more efficient. Information is imme- diately uploaded online so it is read- ily available to different branches of the judiciary system as well as the public at large. In India, UNDP helped design and roll out the Vaccine Intelligence Net- work, known as eVIN. It digitally records all vaccine supplies, and tracks their storage and distribution. Over 1,000 government staff have been trained in using the new system, and vaccine \u201cstock-outs\u201d have already fallen from 10 percent to less than 1 percent. Over time, this will make a major contribu- tion to India\u2019s goal of immunizing all of its children, up from the current rate of 65 percent. 42 Climate and Disaster Resilience A changing climate presents an unprecedented challenge, with mounting risks from a range of natural hazards, such as floods, storms and drought. Many developing countries are not yet fully equipped to cope with the impact and are more likely to suffer harm, posing a threat that decades of development could be lost. Actions will be needed to reduce risks and build resilience across societies, in agriculture and health, energy and water resources, among many other areas of life. UNDP helps countries in Asia and the Pacific mitigate and adapt to climate fallout, manage disaster risks and purse greener growth. Our support aims to improve resilience and reduces the severity of crises. When a disaster does strike, people prepared with the right mechanisms can more quickly respond and speed recovery. Around the region, we are working with countries in gaining access to significant sources of climate finance. We support the integration of climate and disaster risk management measures into devel- opment planning, guided by the SDGs as well as the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. Assistance with climate and disaster-risk related budget formulation and tracking systems helps countries bring together and manage development and climate finance, including to channel an equitable share of resources to the poor and vulnerable. 43 Nepal\u2019s 2015 earthquake was the worst in over 80 years, requiring immediate support to manage and remove rubble so people could resume their lives.

Their community suffered some of the most severe damage when Tropical Cyclone Winston hit Fiji in early 2016. A once picturesque landscape had been obliterated by a mess of crumpled corru- gated iron sheets, metal scrap and broken concrete, along with piles of coconut trees uprooted or snapped in half. Nationwide, the cyclone left a trail of devastation for 540,000 people. Many lost homes and land vital to livelihoods. Some 120,000 people required shelter and access to schools and hospitals, many of which were destroyed.

Our own programmes restored livelihoods for nearly 12,000 people, provided emer- gency cash for work on house demoli- tions to 4,300 people and connected 7,500 people to renewable energy supplies. Around 3,800 private and public buildings were safely demol- ished after a series of vulnerability assessments. We helped install pre-fab offices so multiple local government offic- es could restore vital public services for 300,000 people. Legal aid desks allowed nearly 4,000 families in the district of Sindhupalchok to obtain identification cards and compensa- tion for lost homes. A partnership with Microsoft developed a smart phone app that monitored reconstruction in real time, tracking, for instance, the demolition of buildings and the remov- al of debris, and ensuring that peo- ple in the cash-for-work programme were paid promptly. With the National Human Rights Commission, UNDP es- tablished mobile human rights clinics to protect against human trafficking and gender-based violence, among other violations. Towards lessening the toll of future disasters, UNDP brought in engineer- ing expertise to train 1,200 engineers and masons on the safe reconstruc- tion of houses, and assisted in the development of safer building codes. Other support is helping the National Reconstruction Authority better equip emergency operation centres and create a system for community-based early warning. Nearly 78,000 emergency jobs were created in crisis or post- crisis settings. 46 Philippines, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. Longstanding relationships with national authorities helped define and channel resources to areas most in need. In Nacodu, the villagers were willing to do whatever it took to restore normalcy, but had to be careful in handling the tons of debris. The session at the school spelled out what could be reused, what must be discarded, and what items might be dangerous. The villagers listened closely and asked questions. \u201cHow do we store the debris safely to avoid having it fly away during storms?\u201d wondered Josvini, 27. Each query was answered in detail, and the session closed with the distribu- tion of laminated sheets of pic- tographs to guide clearance and waste management. Shovels and sledge hammers were provided, along with protective equipment such as gloves and boots. Within six weeks after the storm, in eight villages of Koro Island, including Nacodu, and 15 villages in Ra province, UNDP had jumpstarted mass debris re- moval in communities with some of the poorest families and most extensive damage. Hundreds of youth had joined a cash-for-work programme that prioritized the rehabilitation of basic community infrastructure and access paths to essential services for transport, water sources, health services and so on. In Ra province, rapid debris clearance freed over 210 hectares of farming land so villag- ers could cultivate new crops and vegetables. Community sessions showed how to reuse timber and roofing iron to create home gar- dens on small plots that provide adequate and nutritious food for families as well as income. Nationally, UNDP helped the Fijian Government quickly scale up overall management of the disaster response. New staff coor- dinated assessments to define re- covery priorities, oversaw targeted food and seed distribution, and guided measures to protect wom- en and children vulnerable to violence and other abuses. Part- nership with the private sector pulled in additional support, with two traditional competitors from the telecommunications industry, Digicel and Vodafone, delivering free text messages on steps to stay healthy and safe to 200,000 of the most affected people. Full recovery will take years, but UNDP has accelerated early progress by leading a post-disas- ter needs assessment. It maps the main socio-economic impacts of the cyclone, quantifying damages and losses in critical sectors of the economy, such as agriculture, as well as to infrastructure and ser- vices. In developing a framework to guide longer term recovery actions and investments, UNDP has advocated activities that de- liver on multiple fronts, such as public works projects that link employment and much-needed income with the restoration of communities and the natural re- sources on which they depend. The cyclone has also under- scored the urgency of expand- ing disaster risk management in Fiji, an area where UNDP is also providing support.

We helped install series of pumping wells, rainwater harvesting tanks, community ponds and water pumps powered by renewable energy. Improved access to water tripled the amount of rice paddy fed by irrigation; yields per hectare rose as much as 80 percent. In three municipalities of Timor-Les- te, UNDP is helping the Ministry of Pub- lic Administration, local administra- tions and communities climate-proof essential small-scale rural infrastruc- ture, such as roads, bridges and water networks. Protective features such as drainage canals, diverters and retain- ing walls have been introduced, and local grasses, bamboos and other plant varieties are stabilizing slopes. So far, these moves have protected lives and livelihoods for nearly 70,000 peo- ple. They also help to ease burdens on scarce local financial resources, which can now be invested in infrastructure with a lower risk of damage. Climate changes in Mongolia have increasingly threatened fragile areas in its mountains and steppes, and consequently, the livelihoods of rural herders, who struggle with more limited water resources and overgraz- ing. A UNDP partnership with the Ad- aptation Fund has helped improve local ecosystems to protect both the herders and the environment on which they depend. An integrated water management plan has been put in place aimed at preserving existing resources and teaching farmers to use land and water sustainably, such as through advanced irrigation systems, pasture rotation and techniques to slow erosion. So far, 80 communities are involved in learning about these practices, while the restoration of water resources has rehabilitated 133,000 hectares of abandoned pastures. Protected watersheds\u2014vital to the maintenance of entire water supply systems\u2014have expanded by 6,000 square kilometres. Curbing the pace of climate change UNDP supported Pacific island states as they successfully argued for global agreement at the 2015 Paris climate talks to restrict the global temperature rise to less than 1.5 degrees Celsius. Above that level, fallout could be catastrophic, particularly for island nations. In the course of the year, we also helped these countries access over $89 million in environment and climate financing and begin defining national contributions to emissions reductions. Samoa, for instance, has set a target of having 100 percent re- newable electricity generation by 2017. Under the 2015 climate talks, Viet Nam made the first unconditional global commitment in the develop- ing world to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, setting a target of 8 percent by 2030, or 25 percent with international support, compared to a business-as-usual scenario. UNDP provided technical advice in formu- lating the commitment. We also back steps to \u2018green\u2019 Viet Nam, such as through improved fuel and energy efficiency standards, and incentives to invest in low-carbon development and renewable energy. 48 Despite massive flooding, children returned to school a month after Tropical Cyclone Pam struck Tuvalu due to speedy recovery efforts.

UNDP re- sponded through support for a new National Disaster Management Au- thority complemented by disaster management committees in all 20 districts of the country. Mongolia used UNDP assistance to develop a National Disaster Management Plan and programme for risk reduction that includes extending an early warning system to 75,000 people. Similar efforts are underway to help establish early warning systems in Papua New Guin- ea and Tuvalu, including to reach the remote outer islands of the latter. The Maldives established a Nation- al Disaster Management Authority in 2015 along with a national emergency operation plan. UNDP assisted this process, while supporting a series of climate adaptation measures. Two islands tested coastal protection and flood risk management options, in- cluding through the use of geotex sandbags and revegetation, and un- derground drainage that uses gravity to reduce floods while replenishing groundwater. Small grants, mainly for youth organizations, have aimed at improving the local environment and economy. They have, for example, al- lowed a youth group to place special baskets in the ocean that encourage coral to grow and increase fish yields. As part of national efforts to man- age fallout from natural hazards and climate change in the Philippines, UNDP developed a simple guide for local governments to assess risks to vital parts of the local economy, such as agriculture and fisheries, as well as health, infrastructure and water supplies.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c77bfd82-789f-42db-90c2-d18884609058": {"__data__": {"id_": "c77bfd82-789f-42db-90c2-d18884609058", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-results-report-2015-2016", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Results Report 2015-2016", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-results-report-2015-2016", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "55fed97d8eef96a4fd543877684f3e56e1f88062db71cf88fd3fc2499be1e578"}, "2": {"node_id": "9cb5e264-64ed-4dce-8cd0-ac7267e56513", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-results-report-2015-2016", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "018c837001ddd532fdbc54bd16ef29c407d83dff62f736564fa037f45c9f94b0"}}, "hash": "a991c67ed4186094429ba27f12d46f94b06d8abacf20f12ccc661731a9dc2a6c", "text": "This information, captured in tools such as multi-hazard maps, can guide development planning geared towards lowering risks and strengthening the resilience of vulnera- ble communities.

The resulting Integrated Metro Manila Con- tingency Plan is the first of its kind in the country. Coordinated earthquake drills have been among early imple- mentation measures. In response to the El Ni\u00f1o phenom- enon, UNDP partnered with Regional Integrated Multi-Hazard Early Warning System for Africa and Asia or RIMES to develop a methodology for assessing social, economic and environmental impacts so that countries can take measures to minimize potential losses and build resilience. Pulse Lab Ja- karta has been engaged to devise an El Ni\u00f1o dashboard for Asia and the Pacific that will use graphic pre- sentations to show risk and seasonal forecasting data. 50 Innovation in Action Insuring against climate vulnerabilities Climate insurance for smallholder farmers is among the new financial services that help people contend with climate change. It is affordable, readily accessible and geared towards smaller farms that still largely dom- inate agriculture in developing economies. In periods when, for example, drought leaves crops shriveling in the fields, insurance for the most vulnerable farmers can mean protec- tion from permanently losing their land and livelihood. In partnership with the Philippine Crop Insurance Corporation, the Philippine Rice Research Institute, the Philippine Atmospher- ic Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration and several banks, UNDP has helped introduce a climate insurance prod- uct in the Philippines that provides a quick payout in less than 10 days. This enables small farmers to restart their livelihoods during the same season, a critical cushion for people who have few other resources to recover. The insurance reduces a barrier\u2014payouts requiring months\u2014that had discouraged use by smaller farmers in the past. 51 Finding a bus to fight traffic congestion Making new tools work for social change Snarls of traffic in Dhaka, the capital of Ban- gladesh, cost $4.6 billion a year in lost time, fuel and health consequences, among other elements. That\u2019s the annual income of over a million citizens. But many people felt they had no choice but to commute by cars and scooters, since public transport seemed too unreliable. Enter a solution pioneered by UNDP with the Bangladesh Road and Transport Corporation and Go-BD, a local start-up. It placed GPS trackers on buses, linked to a mobile app showing where the buses are and how the traffic is flowing (or not). By the end of 2015, commuters had used the app nearly 34,000 times on one bus route alone, with some commenting that is has become the best way to navigate around their congested city. Across the Asia and the Pacific region, UNDP is bringing people from all walks of life together to solve problems through dynamic new tools such as crowdfunding and crowd- sourcing. In Thailand, crowdsourcing identi- fied innovations to reduce disaster risks, with the best now being further developed by 23 partner organizations from civil society and the private sector. Indonesia\u2019s \u201cBring Water for Life\u201d campaign used crowdfunding to provide a remote village with a solar-powered system to pump clean drinking water, saving time and improving health. In the Maldives, young people shared their salhi halleh (cool ideas) on inspiring social change through a dedicated Facebook page, with standouts further incubated through an innovation camp and seed funding. 52 The high aspirations of the Asia and the Pacific region, bolstered by the 2030 Agenda, underscore the importance of scaling up ac- tion to reach all people and sus- tain progress over time. UNDP stands behind many development innovations that can help unleash transformative changes. At the same time, we draw on a long history of proven strategies and a nearly universal presence, allow- ing us to see that what delivers well in one country may offer value when adapted in another. Within nations, we are equipped to pilot new approaches in one locality, extend them to other areas, and help countries integrate the most successful cas- es in national policies and invest- ments. This process is at work in Bangladesh through the mass extension of essential services, in the Solomon Islands through the first mass penetration of financial services across a 1,000-island ter- ritory, and in Viet Nam through its commitment to pivot towards a green economy. Our orientation towards big-picture outcomes\u2014sustain- able development, democratic governance and resilience to cri- sis\u2014allows us to connect diverse issues, build on the ways they reinforce each other, and respond flexibly to national needs. Mobilizing finance for the climate challenge Across Asia and the Pacific, UNDP has helped countries put sustain- able development commitments into public budgets, one of the most direct routes to scaled-up action.

The exercise provides a comprehen- sive mapping of climate change issues as a basis for steering and apportioning sufficient climate finance. As climate change accel- erates, the reviews help reorient development planning to build in greater resilience. China, Pakistan and Viet Nam launched reviews in 2015. China is using its review to track progress towards its target of devoting 20 percent of public expenditures to climate change. Cambodia completed a climate finance framework based on an earlier review that has already helped guide budget proposals to boost climate-resilient agri- culture. Bangladesh has adopted climate finance frameworks for planning and budgeting on the national and local levels, with around 7 percent of public spend- ing now geared towards tackling climate issues. Through a com- prehensive development finance assessment supported by UNDP, it has also set up a sophisticated new system linking official devel- opment assistance, South-South cooperation and climate finance in one package connected to the national budget. With rising demand for ex- pertise in managing climate fi- nance, UNDP introduced a series of new knowledge tools related to the Climate Public Expendi- ture and Institutional Review in 2015, including a methodolog- ical guidebook launched at the 2015 regional meeting on Climate Change Finance and Sustainable Development, an analysis of les- sons learned worldwide, and a study of climate budget tagging based on experiences in four Asia and the Pacific countries. In 2015, UNDP became one of the first international organiza- tions accredited as an implement- ing agency of the Green Climate Fund, which operates under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. With our assis- tance, within a few months after the historic Paris Agreement on Climate Change, Maldives, Sri Lanka, Tuvalu and Viet Nam ob- tained more than $120 million from the fund. Similar support is underway for another 12 coun- tries in the region. The first round of approvals included a $23.6 million grant for climate change adaptation in the Maldives. It will build on a pilot UNDP project on three is- lands that set up integrated water resource management systems to harvest rainwater, recharge ground water and supply desali- nated water during dry periods. For the first time, 6,000 people were connected to an uninter- rupted supply of safe freshwa- ter for drinking and household use. The Green Climate Fund grant will extend similar efforts to 49 islands suffering recurrent water shortages. Bringing the private sector on board Over the last decade, the Gov- ernment of India, its Ministry of Steel and UNDP have partnered to introduce a range of technolo- gies to improve energy efficiency in the secondary steel industry. Through technical assistance, customized solutions and skills development, the partnership has set benchmarks for energy effi- ciency and strengthened vendor networks. As a result, the produc- tion of almost 10 percent of total steel produced by 330 steel units 10 countries gained greater access to climate financing. 56 consumes less energy, saving 400 million units of electricity, equal to lighting 3,000 villages. The partnership has been notable in achieving significant buy-in from the private sector, with much of the investment in cleaner production processes driven by small mill owners. An initial investment of $13 million in public grants by the Minis- try of Steel, AusAid and UNDP leveraged $22 million in private investment.

This was supported by a UNDP study that found a pronounced shift in people going to local courts and police in cases of disputes, rather than relying on traditional community mechanisms. The programme connected different parts of the judicial sys- tem to strengthen it as a whole. Assistance to lower courts cut case backlogs by 12 percent. The development of a legal aid system, which included outreach to build awareness among nearly 46,000 marginalized women, later be- came the basis for a national legal aid strategy. Training has improved skills across diverse members of the justice and security sectors. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Judicial Academy, operational since 2011, has trained over 2,000 judicial officials, while support through scholarships and the payment of attorney licenses helped 40 women become lawyers. The renovation of dormitories and provision of daycare facilities at the Police Regional Training Centre has encouraged a large share of women trainees, who have comprised over a third of 1,500 trained police personnel. In 2015, UNDP supported the development of judicial guidelines on court-annexed alternative dispute resolution mechanisms as well as a paralegal course to support such mechanisms, reduce case backlogs and make justice more accessible. Eighteen mod- el police stations were set up to perform community policing and offer gender-responsive po- licing desks. 57 Connecting countries to share experiences UNDP helped the Republic of Korea work with six developing countries, including Bolivia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Rwanda, Uganda and Viet Nam to scale up a compre- hensive, multifaceted rural devel- opment model known as Saemaul Undong. It applies successful experiences in the Republic of Korea, with an emphasis on in- clusion and sustainability. In Viet Nam, with UNDP\u2019s sup- port, community empowerment and self-help approaches have been introduced in eight prov- inces.

Thousands of poor households now participate in shaping and implementing the programmes, and have improved their livelihoods. For the country as a whole, community-based de- velopment and multidimensional poverty concepts have been fully integrated in the new National Targeted Programmes on Sus- tainable Poverty Reduction and New Rural Development, which will be rolled out in the poorest rural communities. 58 Volunteers staff community radio stations in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic that offer local shows reaching 285,000 people.

Development has lagged signifi- cantly behind as a result. But now, community radio is showing the way forward, supported by UNDP. Initially, three stations reached more than 80,000 people in the poorest and most remote regions of the country. The stations en- courage local people to partici- pate and make their voices heard, in their own languages, on key development concerns. They also offer programmes grounded in local cultures and equipped to spread messages aimed at im- proving people\u2019s well-being. In one area, health education programmes have spurred a 50 percent jump in vaccination rates and a 70 percent increase in women using health facilities during pregnancy. Today, eight stations reach 285,000 people. A network of local volunteers has been trained to manage the sta- tions, which have now garnered support from local governments, the private sector and other in- ternational organizations.

UNDP and India\u2019s Ministry of Finance have established a funding instrument known as the Development Support Services. In entails UNDP implementing priority activities funded through the national budget. These are based on government demand for specific services to accelerate implementation of flagship pro- grammes, nationally and at the state level, and aimed at longer term development of national ca- pacities to sustain the services. To date, the government has devoted $45 million to start and scale up initiatives for rural sanitation, energy, housing, disaster risk reduction, skills development, the nurturing of small and me- dium enterprises, and financial inclusion. In Pakistan in 2015, the Plan- ning Commission provided $7 million to UNDP for civil ser- vice reform. Another agreement finalized in early 2016 dedicated an additional $7 million for lo- calizing the SDGs at the national level and in one pilot province. A new set of services provides implementation support to pro- vincial and local governments as they carry out development plans and programmes. The Government of Palau committed $40,000 to produce a Household Income and Expendi- tures Survey Analysis report, and is now allocating additional re- sources to start a local governance project with UNDP to develop skills in four state governments. On- demand, tailored support UNDP, over its 50 years, has sup- ported countries at many stages of human development. This ex- perience allows us to respond to a wide range of country demands, whether those of a small island state at high risk from climate change, or those of a country that has done well in recent years on national averages but still faces stark disparities among differ- ent regions and social groups, or those of an emerging economy poised to offer new forms of assis- tance to other developing nations. We recognize that in achieving the SDGs, some countries require relatively light support, such as through specific types of policy expertise. In small and fragile states, UNDP will help meet the challenges of weak capacities and limited resources. In the coming years, UNDP will build on traditional strengths. We will continue helping coun- tries develop institutions and ca- pacities, assist in managing the risks of crisis, and respond quick- ly and comprehensively if disas- ter strikes. We will also pursue new directions as issues emerge and evolve, as demonstrated by recent leadership on issues such as urbanization, youth, ageing and the demographic dividend. Our growing track record in the innovative use of technology to accelerate change will receive continued emphasis, particularly in reaching marginalized com- munities, and encouraging voice and participation. UNDP also plans to support efforts to deepen regional inte- gration, whether to build bond markets to facilitate development finance or ensure more reliable energy supplies. In response to demands from governments across the region, we will advise on practical ways to engage the private sector in achieving the 67 SDGs, including through part- nership strategies and monitoring frameworks that keep consistent progress towards the goals on track.

UNDP helped introduce a more comprehensive measure of poverty and steps to improve the quality of subnational data. Socio-spatial and GIS data mapping have already informed strategies to improve hous- ing and services in low-income communities. With Malaysia well on the way to becoming a high-income nation in the next few years, the plan is primarily self-financed, under- scoring the shrinking role of international assistance.

In close partnership with the Central Plan- ning Ministry and line ministries responsible for different parts of the national plan, UNDP grounded its country programme in respond- ing to remaining national and sub-national development challenges, prioritizing inclusive growth and climate-resilient development. Over the next five years, UNDP will help bol- ster capacities for analysis that links multiple dimensions of development and provides rigorous evidence for policy-making. We will assist in strengthening public service qual- ity, and enhancing the voice of citizens in steering the course of national development. More engagement with non-state actors will 69 69 seek to accelerate the pace of development, particularly in vulnerable communities. The country programme is in part backed by government co-financing. This is geared towards whole-of-government approaches to develop more systematic coordination across different institutions and consistent alignment of all policies behind the objectives of the national plan. Other priorities are the scale-up of proven development innovations and support for research and development linked to national plan objectives. For the first time, the UNDP programme offers a new fee for services mode, so that the government, as needed, can secure technical and policy advisory services through UNDP\u2019s national, regional and global networks of experts. 70 Financial Resources V.

Transnational Organized Crime ACRONYMS iv EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This report examines patterns of forced marriage in the context of broader migratory flows between Cambodia and China. It primarily draws on the accounts of 42 Cambodian women who experienced conditions of forced marriage, with interviews having taken place in both countries. Key informants from government and non-government stakeholders in Cambodia and China were consulted as well. The objective has been to analyze recruitment, brokering, transportation and exploitation patterns as well as the links between these; to determine service needs amongst Cambodians trafficked to China for forced marriage, in China, during the repatriation process and upon return to Cambodia; as well as to identify opportunities for interventions to prevent forced marriages from occurring and to extend protective services to those in need, at both policy and programming levels. The phenomenon of forced marriage has received increasing recognition and attention in the Greater Mekong Sub-Region, initially from Myanmar and Viet Nam into China and within China itself, but lately also from countries further afield especially Cambodia. In Cambodia, the lack of employment opportunities and low wages, amongst other factors, are leaving young people with few alternatives but to seek work outside their home country. Cambodian women have especially limited educational and job prospects whilst at the same time facing high pressures to contribute financially to their families. Given restrictive labor migration policies especially in low-skill sectors in the region, marriage migration to improve economic conditions has become a viable alternative. China is confronted with an unusually high gender imbalance derived primarily from more than 30 years of one-child policy coupled with gender selection due to son preference. The latter is linked to Chinese traditions that see the sons carry on the families\u2019 lineage over generations as well as care for their aging parents, together with their wives that join the husbands\u2019 families. In this environment, particularly the economically disadvantaged rural men in China look to women from other countries like Cambodia, Myanmar or Viet Nam. Both countries, however, prohibit international marriage broker services, meaning marriage migration is often facilitated by agents cooperating across borders without licenses and oversight. Whilst anecdotal evidence suggests that some, perhaps even many, of the Cambodian women living in arranged marriages in China are content in their situations, this study outlines the possible downsides of engagements brought about in non-regulated manners. The report is divided into the five key stages of the respondents\u2019 marriage migration experience, namely: 1. RECRUITMENT 2. MIGRATION 3. MARRIAGE 4. ESCAPE AND RETURN 5. CONDITIONS AFTER RETURN TO CAMBODIA v Some of the key findings by stage are as follows: \u2022 The first-contact broker was often known to the respondents or their families: a neighbor, co- worker or client at the work place such as a hair salon. Some brokers referred to a daughter who was allegedly in China and remitting money home; \u2022 The enticement was that women could send money home to their families by marrying a rich man or working and earning more than they would in Cambodia, or both. In some cases, they were told that, in order to get a well-paying job, they needed to marry a Chinese man; \u2022 Some brokers provided the women with money before departure, which was referred to in interviews as \u2018dowry\u2019, travel expenses or advance salary. Such payments ranged from $100 \u2013 $1,000; \u2022 Families varied in their positions towards their daughters moving to China. Some families strongly encouraged them to go, whereas others equally strongly resisted such plans. Several families seemed indifferent or left it to the women to decide; \u2022 A second and sometimes third broker typically arranged passports, visas and flight tickets. Documents required were photographs, a family- commune identification and a birth certificate. \u2022 Many women reported being seen off at Phnom Penh airport by a broker, traveling as a group without agents, and then being met by broker(s) in China. Very few spoke of an agent accompanying them on", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5770cc3a-067b-4d38-a980-1846e65f829e": {"__data__": {"id_": "5770cc3a-067b-4d38-a980-1846e65f829e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/study-forced-marriage-between-cambodia-and-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Study on Forced Marriage between Cambodia and China", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/study-forced-marriage-between-cambodia-and-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8ee1e1a99f33098b9cbfb844dc37bff281fd4fee87df7ec2c3612fc45aa7c7c2"}}, "hash": "8ee1e1a99f33098b9cbfb844dc37bff281fd4fee87df7ec2c3612fc45aa7c7c2", "text": "the flight; \u2022 A typical route was from Phnom Penh to either Shanghai or Guangzhou, and from there to distant rural locations; \u2022 A few women spoke of being taken to China via Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Viet Nam. They stayed in HCMC for a few days to get a Chinese visa. The journey to Viet Nam was by road and they were accompanied by broker(s); \u2022 At the final destination, women were typically accommodated in or around the agents\u2019 houses for a few days or weeks and introduced to Chinese men until they were selected as brides and 'agreed' to the marriage. 1. RECRUITMENT 2. MIGRATION vi \u2022 Women were both deceived and coerced into marriage to varying degrees: a) Some came to China for the purpose of work and only later found out that they had to get married instead; b) Others were told that they needed to get married in order to find work in China, or better-paying work, which is inaccurate as marriage doesn\u2019t grant employment opportunities to foreigners in China for a minimum of five years. Further, the conditions of marriage proved to be significantly different to what was originally discussed. In both cases, however, circumstances left few to no opportunities for refusal; \u2022 Factors that contributed to women being coerced into marriage were: a) Their passports were with the brokers, constraining freedom of movement including opportunities to return home; b) The agents at times withheld food, restricted their communication opportunities, and threatened with or committed sexual abuse; c) The respondents lacked social support networks, familiarity with the broader Chinese context including organizations to turn to for assistance, and language skills; d) The women were generally unaware that they entered China on tourist visas with a validity of one month only, and many only found out in China that marriage was required for longer-term stay opportunities; e) The brokers typically threatened the respondents that they would be denounced to the police for overstaying their visas, or that they needed to repay the costs for their journey to China ranging from around $2,000 to $8,000; 3. MARRIAGE \u2022 Chinese men paid brokers significant sums for marriages, ranging from around $10,000 to $20,000; \u2022 Women indicated that, soon after they \u2018agreed\u2019 to marry a Chinese man, their marriages were registered and visas extended. As part of the registration, they needed to consent to the marriage in person before a competent authority, however the circumstances did not allow for help to be sought. vii \u2022 Information and contacts were passed around through informal networks of Cambodian women including at village markets or via mobile phones, which helped respondents design and refine their escape plans; \u2022 Women often had to travel far to find help. Sometimes, the escape was further complicated by Cambodian consulates not having the authority to handle their cases and passing them on to another consulate or the embassy; \u2022 When encountered, the police in the respondents\u2019 village or province typically returned them to the husbands\u2019 home and advised them to settle what were perceived as domestic problems. Police in larger towns and cities further away, however, often offered the women real chances to make their cases, and then usually contacted the Cambodian consulates or embassy to help repatriate them; \u2022 The Cambodian consulates or embassy provided a range of support services to respondents in preparation for and during repatriation.

CONDITIONS AFTER RETURN TO CAMBODIA viii Human trafficking is one of the worst forms of human rights abuses, whereby people are exposed to and maintained in conditions of severe exploitation by means of deception, coercion or force. It is one of the world\u2019s largest criminal industries, affecting tens of millions of people in every corner of the globe and generating estimated annual profits in excess of US$150 billion.1 People are most often trafficked within regions, each with its distinct forms and dynamics. Some of the most extensive and diverse human trafficking patterns occur in and between the six countries of the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS): In recent years, the phenomenon of forced marriage has received increasing recognition and attention in the GMS, initially from Myanmar and Viet Nam into China and within China itself, but lately also from countries further afield especially Cambodia.2 Marriage migration between Cambodia and China Despite significant economic growth, Cambodia remains one of the least-developed countries in Southeast Asia. A 2014 World Bank report shows that about 20% of the country\u2019s population continue to live in poverty.3 A lack of employment opportunities and low wages, amongst other factors, are leaving young Cambodians with few alternatives but to seek work outside their home country. Cambodian women have especially limited educational and job prospects4 whilst at the same time facing high pressures to contribute financially to their families. Given restrictive labor migration policies especially in low-skill sectors in the region, marriage migration to improve economic conditions has become a viable alternative. China, on the other hand, is confronted with an unusually high gender imbalance derived primarily from more than 30 years of one-child policy coupled with gender selection due to son preference. The latter is linked to Chinese traditions that see the sons carry on the families\u2019 lineage over generations as well as care for their aging parents, together with their wives that join the husbands\u2019 families. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences has calculated a sex ratio of 124 men for every 100 girls in the generation born between 2000 and 2004, which is one of the highest gender imbalances in the world. The resulting surplus of men of marriageable age is expected to reach 30 to 40 million by 2020,5 with many concentrated in rural or poverty-stricken areas.6,7,8 Myanmar Thailand Viet Nam Affecting TENS OF MILLIONS of people in every corner of the globe It is one of the world\u2019s largest CRIMINAL industries 1 See International Labour Organization [ILO], ILO Global Estimate of Forced Labour: Results and methodology (ILO 2012) and the follow-up publication ILO, Profits and Poverty: The Economics of Forced Labour (ILO 2014).

In the United Kingdom, e.g. \u201cforced marriage is understood to be \u2018a marriage conducted without the valid consent of two parties, where duress is a factor\u2019, [with the Court of Appeal having clarified] that the test for \u2018duress\u2019 is whether \u2018the mind of the [victim] has in fact been overborne, howsoever that was caused.\u2019 (\u2026) Duress can include physical, psychological, financial, sexual and emotional pressure\u201d (Nicola Sharp, Forced Marriage in the UK: A scoping study on the experience of women from Middle Eastern and North East African Communities (Refuge 2008) <http://www.refuge.org.uk/files/1001-Forced-Marriage-Middle-East- North-East-Africa.pdf> accessed 4 October 2015). 18 In the convention, \u2018institutions and practices similar to slavery\u2019 include those whereby \u201ca woman, without the right to refuse, is promised or given in marriage on payment of a consideration in money or in kind to her parents, guardian, family or any other person or group\u201d (Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery (adopted 30 April 1956, entered into force 30 April 1957) art 1(c)). 19 MacLean argues that \u201c(\u2026) focusing solely on what occurs within the forced marriage misses an earlier point of exploitation: the act of marriage itself. A person, whether a broker, the potential husband or a middleman, has deceived or compelled another to enter a marriage contract against her will because her ability to marry is in itself valuable (\u2026). No matter what takes place within the marriage, whether it is exceptional treatment (albeit while preventing the wife from ending the marriage) or domestic servitude and sexual abuse, exploitation has already occurred through the very act of forced marriage\u201d (Douglas MacLean, \u2018Commercial Marriage Trafficking: Uncovering A Growing New Form of Transnational Human Trafficking, And Shaping International Law to Respond\u2019 (2012) UC Davis Journal of International Law & Policy 68, 85). 20 Further, even in conservative interpretations where the exploitative dimension requires separate proof, forced marriage environments are likely to involve at a minimum non-consensual sexual relations, i.e. sexual exploitation. \u201cThe recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons [Act], by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person [Means], for the purpose of exploitation [with exploitation including] at a minimum the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs [Purpose].\u201d15 3 A marriage brought about, and subsequently maintained, without the free consent of at least one of the two parties can hence be seen as a form of human trafficking. This is in line with the Chinese government\u2019s interpretation of forced marriage, which in their victim identification efforts examine exclusively whether deceptive or coercive elements can be identified in how a person has entered into a marriage, and also appears to be the operational understanding in the Cambodian context.

National frameworks on human trafficking and forced marriage In China, human trafficking is defined in the country\u2019s criminal law (Article 210). It is limited to women and children, and covers various purposes including forced marriage, illegal adoption, and sexual exploitation. Men are excluded from being victims in the definition, but are covered by the forced labor provisions of the criminal law (Article 244). Upon establishment of a human trafficking case, those affected are automatically regarded as victims of human trafficking. The definitions of the above human trafficking offences, and hence of who is a victim of these, focus exclusively on the acts and means component in the Palermo Protocol. In the case of forced marriage, this implies that if a marriage has come about through elements of coercion,23 a criminal activity has been committed under the country\u2019s human trafficking definition, with the woman hence being a victim of human trafficking. In Cambodia, human trafficking is defined in the country\u2019s 2008 Law on Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation. The exploitative dimensions of the various acts stipulated include the purposes of \u201cprofit making, sexual aggression, production of pornography, marriage against will of the victim, adoption or any form of exploitation\u201d, with \u2018any form of exploitation\u2019 comprising \u201cthe exploitation of the prostitution of others, pornography, commercial sex act, forced labor or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, debt bondage, involuntary servitude, child labor or the removal of organs.\u201d The means component is specified to include \u201cthe actor\u2019s or a third person\u2019s control by means of force, threat, deception, abuse of power, or enticement.\u201d This may be seen as further explaining the notion \u2018against will of the victim\u2019 under the marriage reference, i.e. a marriage that has come about by force, deception, threat, etc. is seen as a situation of human trafficking. There are currently no formal mechanisms in place between the two governments to deal with bilateral human trafficking patterns. However, a bilateral MoU that is presently being negotiated is set to intensify their joint efforts. This research aims to inform that process. 21 Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable (adopted 25 September 2015, came into effect 1 January 2016). 22 'SDG 10' requires that the world \u201creduce inequality within and among countries\u201d (ibid). 23 As the analysis will show, it was typically deceptive recruitment in Cambodia coupled with coercive practices in China to bring about a woman\u2019s \u2018consent\u2019 to get married that resulted in conditions of forced marriage in the context of this research. 4 24 Khan Sophirom, \u2018Cambodia Asks Chinese Embassies and Consulates-General Abroad to Stop Providing Visas to Cambodian Single Women\u2019 Agence Kampuchea Presse (Phnom Penh, 2 August 2014) <http://www.akp.gov. kh/?p=49305> accessed 4 October 2015. 25 Jina Moore (n 2). Whilst the number of registrations of Cambodian brides as reported in some provinces in China has since dropped significantly, the policy raises serious rights-related concerns and may have made women\u2019s travel to China for marriage and other purposes more clandestine, less regulated and hence possibly more abusive. 26 In the context of this research, broker(s), or alternately referred to as agent(s), are the individuals, working alone or in groups, who facilitate the marriage migration process between Cambodia and China in return for the payment of service fees. Objectives of the study The objectives of the research are three-fold: 1. To analyze recruitment, brokering,26 transportation and exploitation patterns as well as the links between these; 2. To determine service needs amongst Cambodians trafficked to China for forced marriage, in China, during the repatriation process and upon return to Cambodia; 3. To identify opportunities for interventions to prevent forced marriages from occurring and to extend protective services to those in need, at both policy and programming levels. National policy frameworks on marriage with foreigners In Cambodia, marriage between Cambodian and foreign nationals is detailed in the 2008 Sub-decree on Inter- marriage.

The Cambodian citizen has to submit a similar request to the registration office at the commune of permanent residence. The marriage is only legal if both applicants provide thumbprints on a letter of marriage registration in the commune, along with two adult citizens as witnesses. Partly in response to cases and reports of forced marriage, the Cambodian authorities have introduced measures to curtail marriage migration to China. For example, the Cambodian embassy and consulates in China were instructed by MOFAIC in 2014 to stop issuing single status certificates to Cambodian women,24 although the extent of its application by consulates remains unclear. Further, Cambodian authorities have requested their Chinese counterparts to only issue tourist visas to single-traveling Cambodian women, if a deposit of $10,000 is made into a Chinese bank account.25 In China, marriages between Chinese and foreign citizens are regulated by the 2003 Provisions for the Registration of Marriages. These stipulate that, in the case of a Chinese citizen intending to marry a foreign national in mainland China, both man and woman shall register the marriage with a competent marriage registration authority. The foreign national is required to present a valid passport and a single status certificate proving their marriageability. The provisions also state that the marriage registration authority can reject the marriage application if either party is under the legal age for marriage, one or both of them are already married and, importantly, if the marriage is not voluntary for any of the two parties. The provisions further instruct that if the marriage is one under intimidation, the aggrieved party can appeal to the marriage registration authority or a competent court to annul the marriage. Further, international marriage broker agencies have been prohibited in China since 1994. The relevant notice also states that domestic dating agencies and other enterprises or institutions are prohibited from providing international marriage broker services, and equally outlaws that individuals engage in such operations for profit-making purposes. 5 Sample frame A purposive sample was developed for the study including a total of 42 Cambodian women who, at the time of the interviews, were either in China or had previously lived in China married to a Chinese husband. No respondents below the age of 18 years were included in the study. Data collection occurred between September 2014 and March 2015 in both countries. In Cambodia, interviews were conducted in Phnom Penh, Kampong Cham, Tbong Khmum and Kandal, and for China in Beijing, Guangzhou, Fujian and Jiangxi. A total of 33 women were interviewed in Cambodia, all of whom had escaped conditions of forced marriage in China27 and had been or were being assisted by local organizations. The latter included: \u2022 Chab Dai (Joined Hands) \u2022 Legal Support for Children and Women (LSCW) \u2022 International Organization for Migration (IOM) \u2022 Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights (LICADHO) \u2022 Cambodian Women\u2019s Crisis Center (CWCC) \u2022 Agape International Mission (AIM) \u2022 Community Legal Education Center (CLEC) Additional key informant interviews were conducted with respondents from: \u2022 Anti-Human Trafficking and Juvenile Protection Department, General Commissariat of National Police \u2022 Anti-Human Trafficking and Juvenile Protection Office, Provincial Police Commissariat of Kampong Cham \u2022 Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (MOFAIC) \u2022 National Committee for Counter Trafficking (NCCT) \u2022 General Department of Immigration Police \u2022 Ministry of Social Affairs, Veterans and Youth Rehabilitation (MOSVY) \u2022 Non-governmental organizations (NGOs), namely Chab Dai, LSCW and Winrock International \u2022 International Organization for Migration In China, the research team interviewed a total of nine28 Cambodian women: \u2022 One referred through local police in Fujian province \u2022 One through private citizens in Jiangxi province \u2022 One in Jiangxi province through community visits by the research team \u2022 Two in Beijing who were rescued by civil society and international organizations \u2022 One in Guangzhou who was rescued by a private citizen \u2022 Two in Beijing who were referred to the research team by another respondent to the study \u2022 One in Beijing who came to the Cambodian embassy for help and was referred to a government-run shelter to wait for identification and repatriation.

METHODOLOGY BEIJING 5 JIANGXI 1 FUJIAN 1 GUANGZHOU 2 6 Research tools and data collection The research project was led by an international consultant, with technical support provided by UN-ACT. Additional local consultants, one in each country, were recruited in Cambodia and China for data collection purposes. The lead consultant traveled to Cambodia for interviewing supported by the local consultant, whereas in China the local consultant was assisted by the UN-ACT National Project Coordinator for data collection, with help from interpreters when needed. Data collectors were all female with experience in conducting in-depth interviews on sensitive topics including exploitation and human trafficking, except for the local consultant in Cambodia who was male. The original international lead consultant had to be replaced as data analysis commenced. The instrument for Cambodian women in or returned from China included sections on their socio-economic background, such as education and employment; family information, especially dependents; factors that influenced their decision to travel to China, including details about brokers and their deceptive or coercive practices; pre-departure preparations, such as organizing a passport, visa and air ticket; the journey to China and transport to the final destination; the process of getting married including elements of coercion; marriage and employment life; the decision and attempts to escape from the marital home; the process of repatriation; and life after return. Additional interview guides were developed for the different stakeholder groups interviewed as key informants, sometimes through focus groups. The themes primarily covered their respective areas of expertise in relation to marriage migration, human trafficking and forced marriage. Ethical and safety considerations All research conducted or overseen by UN-ACT involves an ethics review process based on the standards and principles set out in the Guide to Ethics and Human Rights in Counter-Trafficking31 published by UN-ACT\u2019s predecessor project, UNIAP. Those involved in data collection in Cambodia and China respectively developed a joint approach to safeguarding ethical and security standards including an informed consent process, which were subsequently discussed and further refined with UN-ACT staff. Data collection involved a two-stage informed consent process, whereby possible respondents were first informed about the study and had their questions addressed before interviews were scheduled, sometimes with the assistance of others including NGOs. In addition, each interview began with a conversation about its objective, approximate duration, questions of confidentiality and the rights of the respondent during data collection. Interviews only proceeded if all questions were addressed and the respondent expressed their verbal consent. Two candidates declined to be interviewed. Interviews with Cambodian women in their home country were typically conducted in the premises of NGOs providing support, in private rooms and without involvement of parties external to the research project. If these levels of privacy could not be ensured, other facilities around such as local hotels were utilized instead. In China, most Cambodian women were interviewed in their own homes or that of other Cambodian women, others in environments of institutional care. Interviews usually lasted between 60 and 90 minutes. Notes were transcribed into English, in computer-readable form, for analysis purposes. All identifying details were deleted from the data, so as to guarantee the respondents\u2019 privacy. 31 United Nations Inter-Agency Project on Human Trafficking [UNIAP], Guide to Ethics and Human Rights in Counter-Trafficking (UNIAP 2008). 7 Data analysis The data analysis was done in a two-stage process by three researchers.

A similar process was followed for the China- based data by the local consultant there who drafted a report on her analysis and findings. When the lead consultant dropped out of the project, the coded data of the Cambodia-based analysis and the report of the China-based findings were provided to a new international consultant recruited to finalize the project. The coded Cambodia data and the China report were jointly analyzed for similarities, patterns and differences within each broad thematic area. Based on the joint analysis, the consultant drafted an integrated report consolidating the overall findings of the study. The findings of the study were validated through a peer review process involving government and non- government stakeholders in both countries and in line with UN-ACT\u2019s information sharing and publication protocol. Preliminary findings were also presented to relevant audiences in Cambodia and China for validation purposes. Study limitations This is an exploratory, qualitative study providing insights into an under-researched phenomenon of an unknown scale. The findings require testing through additional research; they cannot be generalized because of the non-probabilistic sample, the small sample size and the limited geographical coverage in Cambodia and China underpinning the analysis. Further, the study focused primarily on the accounts of Cambodian women who were formerly or still married to Chinese men, thereby leaving out the perspectives of parents, husbands, in-laws, brokers and others with relevant perspectives to share on the subject matter. Despite best efforts, it proved challenging to recruit adequate, Khmer-speaking interpreters in China. Nuances in the women\u2019s narratives may not have been captured in all their details as a result. Secondly, some interviews did not provide sufficient levels of depth; the data is \u2018thin\u2019 in parts and does not always support detailed analyses. This also applies to key informant interviews, where the expert knowledge of the selected respondents was not always reflected in the data and transcripts. Additionally, the surprise dropout of the initial lead consultant for the study and her failure to provide a significant part of the primary data to the research team proved a real obstacle for both the scope of the analysis as well as the timely implementation of the project 8 A 23-year old, never-married woman who had completed grade six. She quit schooling in order to contribute to the family income and to help repay debt that the family had assumed over time. Before leaving for China to make more money, she was working in Phnom Penh, earning $60 per month; A 32-year old widow with three children who also supported her sister\u2019s two children. She had worked in Thailand for some time, leaving her children in the care of her parents. A factory job had earned her a low wage, which was why she decided to move to China for what she assumed would be a better paying job; A woman aged 29 years, supporting a young child, an infant and her parents. Although she had completed grade two, she was illiterate. Before going to China, she worked as a daily wage laborer on a plantation. A friend who worked in China told her that she could have a good marriage there and work later to help her family at home; A 19-year old woman with six years of schooling. She dropped out of school and went with her older sister to earn a living in Phnom Penh. Her first job, at the age of 17, was in a garment factory. The combined earnings of the two sisters merely allowed them to meet their most basic needs. She took up an opportunity to work in a garment factory in China for what she thought would be a much higher salary, but ended up in conditions of forced marriage; A 34-year old woman who lived with her husband and two children in Phnom Penh where she worked in a garment factory. When she got into debt with local creditors for medical expenses for her mother, she decided to go to China for what she assumed would be a better-paying job. The respondents\u2019 ages spanned from 18 to 37 years,32 with most having attended some level of formal education ranging from three to 10 years, although some were illiterate.

Below are some of the profiles of respondents indicating the range of characteristics in terms of age, family conditions and number of dependents, work experience and income:33 32 The minimum age for women to get married in China is 20 years. Further, whilst the research only involved respondents aged 18 years or above, key informants to this study indicated to also have assisted some Cambodian girls below the age of 18 years upon escaping conditions of forced marriage in China. Reportedly, brokers often use family books and other documents of different persons and tell minors to lie about their age when processing passports for those underage. 33 It is worth noting that researchers interviewed a number of Cambodian women in China who had moved there for the purpose of marriage alone and continued to live with their husbands without apparent problems. However, the analysis of this report is limited to the accounts of respondents who experienced forced marriage, hence such positive notions are not featured further in the study. FINDINGS: SAMPLE CHARACTERISTICS 9 The first-contact brokers The first-contact brokers were typically known to the woman or her family. In rural areas, they were either a neighbor, someone running a grocery store, or simply a fellow village resident. Many respondents and their families tended to trust the agents because of familiarity with each other and the person\u2019s experience in sending women to China, allegedly without any reported problems. Brokers at times claimed to have a sister or daughter in China who regularly sent money back. In urban areas, some women knew the first-contact agents as co-workers or people whom they met through work.34 Brokers\u2019 appearance as \u2018well-dressed\u2019 or wealthy served to suggest legitimacy. Interestingly, there were respondents who had heard of or knew women who had returned home after facing hardships in marriages and at work in China. One indicated that she had gone to China despite being aware that in her neighborhood some women had returned due to problems like being married to men with physical or mental challenges. Others knew of cases where women had claimed to be financially secure and happy in China whilst experiencing a different reality, so that parents would not worry about them. All respondents were from low socio-economic backgrounds experiencing pressures to support dependents. Agents typically argued that the women would be able to make more money in China than in Cambodia, either by working or through marriage with wealthy Chinese men, or both. They sometimes provided illustrations of Cambodian women married in China who had returned with gold ornaments or other symbols of prosperity, and some showed videos of different possible grooms. Before moving to China, the respondents typically worked in garment factories, restaurants or as street food vendors, with monthly salaries ranging from $60 to $300. Brokers argued that job opportunities in China would pay $500 to $800 per month, often in similar sectors such as garment.35 At times, money was offered as further incentives for recruitment purposes. Respondents described this alternatively as \u2018dowry\u2019,36 money for travel preparations or as salary advance, and it amounted to between $100 and $1,000,37 however with conditions applying as the following example illustrates: Some brokers also gave money to the women\u2019s families, which later at times became an element of pressure for her to 'agree' to marriage in China. According to one respondent, for example, the agent said that she could choose to work or to find a husband in China, but when she arrived at her destination she was told that she had to marry a Chinese man. She then called her mother in Cambodia for advice who, because she had accepted a sum of money from the broker, told her daughter to agree to the marriage. Such family pressures, and sometimes even decisions on behalf of respondents, played important roles for marriage migration in other cases as well including the following example: 34 For instance, a garment factory worker said that her co-worker asked her if she was interested to work in China. Another woman said that she was approached by a well-dressed woman in her 50s who was a regular client at a beauty salon where the woman worked. 35 A typical case was that of a first-contact broker who told a woman that she could earn $500-600 per month as a garment factory worker in China. At the time, the woman earned $65 in Cambodia doing the same work. 36", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "88c85691-fc77-4579-8e25-c3a5b232eacd": {"__data__": {"id_": "88c85691-fc77-4579-8e25-c3a5b232eacd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/study-forced-marriage-between-cambodia-and-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Study on Forced Marriage between Cambodia and China", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/study-forced-marriage-between-cambodia-and-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "884f9e41a9c36b5262d43280cef61ffb8f544ef840bdcfed68727736b311e209"}}, "hash": "884f9e41a9c36b5262d43280cef61ffb8f544ef840bdcfed68727736b311e209", "text": "\u2018Dowry\u2019 is the term used in the interview notes, however the more accurate notion is likely to be that of \u2018bride price,\u2019 namely a sum of money paid by the groom, his kin, or in this case an agent on behalf of the groom, to the family of the wife-to-be. 37 In one case, a woman who was working in a garment factory in Cambodia was told by the broker that she could earn up to $1,000 per month in China because through her work in Cambodia she had acquired skills as a dressmaker. When the woman initially refused saying that she had no money for the travel expenses, he said that he would advance her $500 to prepare for the travel. \u201cThe man didn\u2019t oblige me to pay anything for the passport and flight ticket; on the contrary I was lent $1,000 as support for my family. However, I had to pay it back through deductions from my salary at work in China. If I changed my mind, I would be obliged to compensate $2,500.\u201d \u201cA broker lured my mother in Kampong Cham into persuading me to marry a Chinese man. My mother said, \u2018our neighbors went there and have sent large amounts of money back home, and working in Phnom Penh you can only earn $100 to support the family. It is not enough.\u2019 With my mother\u2019s advice and agreement, I decided to go to China to marry a Chinese man.\u201d FINDINGS: THE RECRUITMENT STAGE 10 Other respondents, however, appeared prepared to travel to China and had the support of their families, and in yet other accounts families strongly opposed the move but the respondents went regardless. Marriage was often deceptively introduced as a prerequisite for a job in China or as a means to obtain higher-paying work than otherwise available. Aside from this being wrong information,38 respondents were also typically told that they could choose their husband and had the right to refuse a marriage, which equally proved to be inaccurate for many as illustrated later. Some were informed that, after reaching China, they would have one month to decide about a husband, and that if the decision was not to stay but to return home, they would have to cover the brokers\u2019 costs allegedly ranging from $2,000 \u2013 $8,000. Some agents proved to be very persistent and repeatedly visited or called the respondents and their families, sometimes despite their initial refusals to consider the offer. An account of a broker\u2019s perseverance is provided below; the woman ultimately moved to China: 38 A registered marriage in China only grants access to employment opportunities after a minimum of five years. Other legal employment opportunities for foreigners are independent from marriage status and difficult to come by, especially in low-skill sectors. Second and third brokers Once an agreement had been reached, the first-contact broker typically put the respondents in contact with a second, and at times a third, agent to help organize the required documents for departure including passports and visas. Women from rural communities typically made one trip to Phnom Penh accompanied by a broker for this purpose, after which the agents organized the rest with the various departments and offices. Below is the account of a woman in this context. She worked in Phnom Penh where a co-worker approached and convinced her to travel to China: Overall, it took between a few days to two months to obtain a passport, although for most respondents it was two to four weeks. In almost all cases, the passports were collected and retained by an agent. Once the travel documents were secured, brokers bought the flight tickets for the women traveling to China. \u201cWhen I was working in Phnom Penh, a woman from my village called and said that my mother had no money and I should help her by going to China and marrying a Chinese man. She herself had married her two daughters off to Chinese men and they sent her $700 soon after they got to China, and $5,000 the next month. When I refused to go, she continuously called me once every two or three days in order to persuade me. She then enticed my mother to convince me to marry a Chinese man.\u201d \u201cThe woman introduced me to a man who would process my passport and travel documents. The man required me to give him a copy of my Cambodian ID, a birth certificate and family book. I went to meet with a person at the passport office who facilitated getting my thumbprint and picture taken, and I saw that four other girls", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4680ec1a-4530-4564-872f-a88e278f5eb9": {"__data__": {"id_": "4680ec1a-4530-4564-872f-a88e278f5eb9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/study-forced-marriage-between-cambodia-and-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Study on Forced Marriage between Cambodia and China", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/study-forced-marriage-between-cambodia-and-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ea0333d4562d48a820df232a2034674976604dbadb5d32c0d9f01757d52137f1"}}, "hash": "ea0333d4562d48a820df232a2034674976604dbadb5d32c0d9f01757d52137f1", "text": "were processing passports with the same man. It took us about two weeks to be ready to leave. I was given the travel documents just outside of the airport and was told to say that I would be visiting relatives.\u201d 11 With all documents arranged, brokers escorted the women to Phnom Penh airport and assisted them to complete the departure procedures. Respondents usually traveled in groups of three to six; only in very few cases did an agent accompany them on the flight. They received their passports and tickets at the airport and were instructed to say that they were going to China to visit family or for sightseeing, if asked. Most respondents were on direct flights to either Shanghai or Guangzhou. In a few cases, women traveled over land through Viet Nam to China.39 One respondent was taken by an agent from Cambodia to Ho Chi Minh City where she waited for several days while the broker was arranging her visa to China. She was then accompanied to Beijing and handed over to a local agent who took her to another location in China, whose name she did not know. Several respondents in fact stated that they did not know the name of their port of entry to China nor that of their final destination. Upon arrival at airports in China, the women were received by broker(s) waiting at the exit with their names on placards. They were taken to distant rural locations by car, bus or trains and typically accommodated in or around brokers\u2019 homes whilst being introduced to men looking for wives. In some cases, the agents in China had Cambodian wives. It was during this period that many respondents were informed that they either had to get married or repay the broker for the expenses incurred. 39 This may initially have been in response to changes in the visa regime between Cambodia and China that made obtaining tourist visas for single-traveling women significantly more complicated, although Cambodian authorities have since requested Chinese authorities to introduce similar restrictions for Cambodian women at embassies elsewhere, including in Lao PDR, Thailand and Viet Nam (see Khan Sophirom (n 23)). It is worth monitoring how travel patterns to China amongst Cambodian women have been influenced by these policies. Below is the account of a women describing her journey to the final destination in China: \u201cAt the airport in Cambodia, I met other four young women who were traveling with me. Each of us received a passport and a flight ticket. After checking in, we were led by a man whom I didn\u2019t know to the passport control and boarding. We landed in Beijing and were taken by a man to some town. We were put up at a guesthouse for a couple of nights and then separated into two small groups traveling in different directions. After a few hours, the car stopped and three people were waiting on the roadside. I was asked to leave the van and move along with those strangers in their car. I asked in Khmer where I would go and what I would be doing, but received no answer for the driver was Chinese.\u201d FINDINGS: THE MIGRATION STAGE 12 Matchmaking of spouses Upon arrival at or around the brokers\u2019 places, respondents were introduced to local men. Some were allowed a few days of rest, for others the process started immediately, as these accounts and interview notes illustrate: Brokers would typically inform local men about the women\u2019s arrival in advance, such as through advertisements on the internet or word of mouth. During the 30 days granted by the tourist visas, they sought to find a husband for each of the women brought to China, register the marriages and get certificates issued, and apply for a spousal visa for longer-term stay opportunities.40 The tight timeframe contributed to pressures and coercive practices towards women to have them 'consent' to marriages. The brokerage fee for a Cambodian bride was negotiated and influenced by various factors including her appearance and travel costs; it ranged from around $10,000 to $20,000.41 The agent typically received the largest part of his commission when a man selected a woman and she agreed to the marriage, with the remaining amount paid once that was registered and the spouse visa obtained. Nearly all brokers took away both the women\u2019s passports and money during the matchmaking process. The respondents\u2019 movement was usually restricted to the transit house environment, although some women said they were put to work on plantations or were allowed supervised visits to local markets or houses of potential husbands.

Women were told that it was expensive to make such phone calls, and if families called the agents to speak to their daughters, they were usually discouraged from doing so after a few calls. If the respondents initially refused to marry a local man, brokers utilized different types of pressures and forms of coercion to bring about 'consent'. A typical approach was to suggest that their passport would be revoked; that they would be arrested by the police due to overstay; or that return to Cambodia was only possible after they had covered the agents\u2019 expenses for bringing them to China. The amounts demanded for the latter ranged from $2,000 to $8,000. As most women were unable to afford such sums and were reluctant to ask their cash-strapped families to raise the money, they eventually agreed to marriages. 40 Spousal visas are typically issued for an initial 3-month period and may then be extended by 6 to 12 months. 41 Key informants noted that husbands at times marry their wives off to other men for money upon the birth of a child. This is reportedly to help recover some of the original broker expenditures and may be self-organized or facilitated by agents again. FINDINGS: THE MARRIAGE PROCESS \u201cUpon arrival when they walked to the broker\u2019s house, a family stopped them with a request for a bride. They asked if the broker could take the girls to a restaurant so they could pick up one of them as a bride.\u201d \u201cOne day after arriving, brokers asked us to put on fancy dresses and makeup. We waited in line in a room. Many Chinese men came and looked at us and chose the ones they wanted to marry.\u201d \u201cWe were put up in a house. Two days later, men came to look at us and took away some of the women. I asked my peer what was going on. She informed me that men came to pick up their wives. I was surprised since I had come here to find work. The friend told me that unless we had a husband, we would not find work.\u201d \u201cWe were put up at a house for about a week. I kept asking for the job that I would be doing, but the wife only said that her husband [the broker] was looking for a job placement. Later she told me that it would be more convenient to get a job if I got a Chinese husband. I felt disappointed but had no choice.\u201d \u201cThe respondent was locked in a room for a few days and told that either she would marry a Chinese man or else have to pay back the cost of bringing her to China.\u201d 13 Some women reported being raped or threatened with rape, partly in efforts to pressure them into marriages. Below is the write-up of one respondent\u2019s account in this context: Potential husbands were often in their 20s and 30s, some were widowers with children. They typically worked on their family farms or in low-skill sectors including as electricians, TV repairmen or construction workers. Not all had full-time work. As indicated in the above account, a number of women suggested that they were also introduced to men who were physically or mentally challenged. Marriage registration The Chinese Provisions for the Registration of Marriages requires that both partners consent to their marriage before a competent registration authority. In cases involving foreigners, this is done through provincial-level Foreign-Related Adoption and Marriage Registration Centers under the Department of Civil Affairs. An officer asks the two parties to confirm that they are applying for the marriage registration at their own will. However, many Foreign-Related Adoption and Marriage Registration Centers do not employ Cambodian-speaking staff, and even where they do exist other factors appear to prevent consent from being adequately verified. For example, an official at the Jiangxi Foreign-Related Adoption and Marriage Registration Center told the researchers, \u201cthe mandate of the center is to handle marriage registration for the two parties who provide the required documents; we do not ask personal questions, such as how the applicants got to know each other.\u201d42 Given the rising numbers of Cambodian brides in the province, the Jiangxi Foreign-Related Adoption and Marriage Registration Center has in fact employed Cambodian language interpreters, partly to help prevent forced marriages from occurring. According to the Civil Affairs Department of Jiangxi province, \u201ca number of new measures have been introduced this year to prevent forced marriages and bridal scams. One of the measures is to check the marriage will of the two", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "51922fe0-9865-40a2-94e3-ce060393638d": {"__data__": {"id_": "51922fe0-9865-40a2-94e3-ce060393638d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/study-forced-marriage-between-cambodia-and-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Study on Forced Marriage between Cambodia and China", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/study-forced-marriage-between-cambodia-and-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "14ab4dc4016a27c639420582415793691b1e02aa4db3950fd585c171e5dc627c"}}, "hash": "14ab4dc4016a27c639420582415793691b1e02aa4db3950fd585c171e5dc627c", "text": "parties through interpreters at the marriage registration office.\u201d 42 Another official from the same center indicated that sometimes they do ask questions about how the two parties got to know each other, but that the responses in such cases typically suggest that they were introduced by relatives or friends. They also noted that, in the past few years, two Cambodian women have in fact indicated that they were under threats when being brought to the center for marriage registration, with protection and other support services having been provided in response. \u201cOne night the broker took one of the girls away. She returned the next morning and told the girls that he had attempted to rape her. Two girls succumbed to the pressure and agreed to marry local men. This woman held out for 10 days. Some men who came to see her had physical deformities, so she said no. One day the agent said he was unhappy with her behavior. She refused to open the door to him. The broker then passed her on to another local agent. She stayed in that broker\u2019s house for five nights, after which he took her to a cheap guest house where she was not given enough to eat. The temperature dropped and though she didn\u2019t have sufficient warm clothes, the agent did not help her. More men came to see her. She refused to marry any of them, including a man who looked okay and said he earned $1,400. She felt scared the broker might try to rape her so she didn\u2019t open the door to take the food he had brought her. One night he tried to hold her but she screamed and he backed off. She felt under a lot of pressure. The broker showed her many men, most of whom had \u2018syndromes\u2019. She then decided that she would agree to marry the next man who looked normal. The agent got fed up and called the broker in Phnom Penh. She told the Phnom Penh broker that she would pay $2,000 through her mother but not stay in China. While they were talking, the phone got disconnected and she could not reach the broker anymore. She then agreed to marry the man who said he earned $1,400.\u201d 14 Further, Chinese law stipulates that, in order for a marriage between a Chinese national and a foreigner to be registered, the foreign party has to produce a single status as well as a premarital health examination certificate, in addition to a valid passport and visa. However, there have been concerns in recent times about the authenticity of the documents presented, according to the Jiangxi Foreign-Related Adoption and Marriage Registration Center: Single status certificates were reportedly issued by Cambodian consulates or the embassy in China for excessive fees and without the required verification.44 Given that such costs, together with all other expenses incurred by brokers, were transferred to the Cambodian women if they attempted to refuse to get married, the high fees further added to the coercive power of the looming debt. The issuance practices also resulted in females who were already married to get remarried in China, which if identified may be investigated as a possible indicator of forced marriage. However, respondents to this study indicated that the presence of a language interpreter failed to authenticate free will, as the following accounts exemplify: In some cases, the interpreter was hired by the agent, as this example indicates: In others, the translator had family relations to the agent: 43 Such intensified authenticity checks have reportedly been introduced as a result of consultations between Chinese officials and Cambodian diplomats, in an effort to jointly respond to document forgery and forced marriages. 44 Anecdotal evidence suggests that single status certificates have been issued by the Cambodian consulates and embassy without the presence of the women concerned. Further, the document does not currently state the purpose of its issuance, unlike in other countries including e.g. Viet Nam. \u201cThe interpreter was a Cambodian woman who had married a local man. She told me that it was not good to marry a local Chinese man. She knew I was against the arranged marriage. Before I went to the marriage registration office, the broker threatened me by saying that if I didn\u2019t say \u2018yes\u2019 I would have to refund all the money spent on my trip to and stay in China. There were 15 people in the registration office that day. The interpreter spoke Chinese, Khmer and Vietnamese.

Husbands typically kept their passports after marriage, in part to control their movement. Some women, however, managed to retain copies. Valid papers were needed to buy train tickets and to be able to stay in hotels. Respondents at times were helped by Chinese volunteers who used their identity cards to book a hotel room or to buy a train ticket. Once they reached a Cambodian consulate or the embassy, new travel documents would be issued after the required identity and background check. Respondents also needed a valid visa to exit from China. According to the Exit and Entry Administration Law, people in \u2018overstay\u2019 status are detained or fined. A woman who overstayed her visa said she had to pay a 5,000 Yuan, or $780, fine to get an exit permit. While she took shelter at the Cambodian consulate in Guangzhou, her parents sold livestock to raise the money. For victims of forced marriage with a valid visa but whose passports were withheld by their husbands, the Cambodian embassy would coordinate with the Chinese Ministry of Public Security to determine their status and facilitate the return. In some cases, the respondents\u2019 accommodation and return tickets were arranged by international organizations. One government-run shelter in Beijing has also started providing shelter for Cambodian women awaiting repatriation since March 2015. Further, financial resources were needed for transportation, food and accommodation. Some respondents said they had saved up some money given to them by their husbands and in-laws for grocery shopping. One woman indicated that she had taken 8,000 Yuan, or $1,250, from the house when escaping.45 Interviewees who were assisted by a Cambodian consulate, embassy or an NGO suggested that these had provided basic food and accommodation support. Respondents also needed money to purchase air tickets to return home, for which they usually contacted their families and waited till the money was sent to a Cambodian consular official in China.46 Timing was another crucial factor for successful escapes. The first few months were reportedly an unstable phase for bride and groom due to reasons such as culture shock or communication barriers and a mismatch between expectations and reality about life in China. Husbands were often concerned in these situations about possible divorce or escape attempts of their wives. The loss of a bride and along with that the significant resources invested were a worst-case scenario for husbands from rural backgrounds.47 As a result, they tended to closely watch and control their wives, such as by having them accompanied when they left the house, confiscating their passports, and withholding all money. After several months of marriage, or when the woman became pregnant, the surveillance and control often loosened somewhat, providing more opportunities and scope for escape. Below are some of the narratives from respondents in this context: Another woman said it took her eight months before she could escape, because language was a problem at the beginning. She got information about the Guangzhou consulate, which she called to ask for advice on how to leave. They said they could not help unless she went to the Beijing embassy. On Chinese New Year, she was given some money by her in-law family. She managed to save 1,000 Yuan, or $156, and kept it hidden. When she ran away, she embarked on a long journey alone taking two nights before she reached the embassy. 45 It is worth noting that the police did not file a case against the woman on the grounds that she had joint ownership of assets", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d9a2e9c9-1c3e-4d0c-a8bb-62a7863f03aa": {"__data__": {"id_": "d9a2e9c9-1c3e-4d0c-a8bb-62a7863f03aa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/study-forced-marriage-between-cambodia-and-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Study on Forced Marriage between Cambodia and China", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/study-forced-marriage-between-cambodia-and-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f8c9cb2de4650e0109f16ba0adf12d92dd074e43ddac3a74575cbdfccc318946"}}, "hash": "f8c9cb2de4650e0109f16ba0adf12d92dd074e43ddac3a74575cbdfccc318946", "text": "when the husband reported her. 46 Some respondents had their tickets paid for by civil society or international organizations. 47 Anecdotal evidence suggests that Cambodian wives trying to divorce are often threatened by their Chinese husbands or the marriage agents with having to repay the brokerage fees. The agents get involved if they are confronted by the husbands about the situation. It is worth noting that, in some of the online advertisements for marriage services, brokers offer insurance policies promising a free replacement if the wife runs away within a certain period of time upon marriage. \u201cThe situation was deteriorating. I was frustrated and decided to leave. I contacted the consulate for support, however they couldn\u2019t help me unless I presented myself at the office. I planned my escape. I pretended to be nicer to the family and built trust once again [she had attempted an earlier escape]. When they paid less attention to me, I sneaked out through the backyard, found the way to the bus station and headed to the consulate.\u201d FINDINGS: ESCAPE AND RETURN 16 The importance of mobile phones was highlighted in the escapes of other respondents as well. For example, one woman used a cell phone to contact her family in Cambodia, who went to a Cambodian NGO for help, which in turn established contact with a Chinese volunteer group. That group contacted the woman via cell phone and supported her escape. Another respondent in China was rescued after her location was identified by a Chinese civil society organization through messages sent from her cell phone. Yet another woman found support from Chinese volunteers who received information about her from a hotline for women in Cambodia. And finally, a respondent was in frequent contact with NGO workers via a cell phone while she was traveling to Beijing for her escape. The police Only few respondents turned to local police for help. In cases where they did, however, their situation was often viewed as a case of family conflict and the police were reluctant to intervene, given that there was a legitimate marriage certificate and at times because officers knew the husband and his family. Language barriers further compounded women\u2019s challenge to receive assistance. Local police often informed the husband and had the respondents returned to the family. Some inadvertently came into contact with the police and were detained, for instance when they were stopped at a bus or train station. The women were brought to the police station for questioning, with the next steps typically depending on their jurisdictional level. If the women were detained near their husbands\u2019 places and by local police, they often also arranged for her return to the spouse.48 If the women were stopped by police further away, they would usually detain them, contact their husbands to ascertain that they were married, and collect the women\u2019s passports and other documents from them. During this time, the respondents typically stayed in police custody or a shelter, followed by procedures Some women said they had made several attempts before they succeeded to escape. Villagers in their communities often provided little support, partly because of ties with the husband and his family. When residents suspected that a woman was trying to escape, they would sometimes inform her husband or mobilize family members to come to the bus or train station, where the woman was stopped from leaving. As indicated in the above account, reaching a consulate or the embassy was often a monumental task. Respondents regularly walked to the town closest to their village to take a bus to the county seat, from where they would get another bus to the provincial capital, and then a train or bus to Shanghai or Guangzhou where Cambodian consulates are located, or to Beijing to reach the embassy. Social networks and mobile phones Weekly village markets or fairs as commonly found in China\u2019s rural areas were an important place for Cambodian women to meet, comfort each other, share information and seek support. Anecdotal evidence suggests that informal networks of this kind are often existent in communities with many Cambodian brides. Even women from different villages and provinces appear to communicate with one another via mobile phones, with such communication being an important tool in escape attempts, as the following interview notes exemplify. \u201cAL was a Cambodian woman who wanted to escape from a situation of forced marriage with a Chinese man.

With XM\u2019s help, they established contact with each other for mutual support and planned to escape together. AL got SJ\u2019s cell phone number through an informal network amongst Cambodian women living in China who kept in touch via mobile phones. When AL called SJ, she was at the Cambodian consulate in Guangzhou being interviewed by the researchers of this study. SJ gave AL the researchers\u2019 contact information. AL called them for help who then introduced her to volunteers and local civil society organizations providing them with accommodation, transport and legal aid, and eventually they managed to escape and return home to Cambodia.\u201d 17 48 Chinese authorities noted that it was often challenging for frontline officers to differentiate between incidences of forced marriage; marriage scams, whereby women from abroad reportedly come to China with the assistance of brokers, get married to Chinese men and then disappear again, often collectively, upon receiving the bride prices; and arguments between the Cambodian women and their Chinese husbands or parents-in-law, especially given language barriers. \u201cI got the contact details of a consulate officer from another Cambodian woman in the area. I was planning my second run. I contacted the consulate officer for their advice. When I left again, I took a taxi to a bus stop in another town and I paid extra to the driver to purchase me a bus ticket. I finally managed to reach the consulate in Shanghai and the officer interviewed me. I was put up by the officer overnight. My husband was called in with my passport. He came and presented my passport to the officer. There were a police officer, the consulate officer, my husband and me in the room. I was asked about my decision and motives. I wanted to get divorced and be returned. I stayed outside at day and slept at the consulate at night for about ten days. The officer asked me whether I had money to cover the flight. He asked for 2,350 Yuan and I produced the amount in cash directly. Everything was done and they informed me when I was ready to leave. There were four women returning including me. A police and a consulate officer drove us to the airport and escorted us to boarding.\u201d \u201cIt was night and I couldn\u2019t find the embassy. I asked a passerby for a police station. I surrendered to the police. The police officer questioned me and I tried my best to communicate with him. He finally allowed me to stay overnight at the station. The next morning around nine, there was an officer from the Cambodian embassy who came to visit me.\u201d that would allow for them to be identified as victims of forced marriage with the nearest Cambodian consulate or the embassy being involved as well. The following account provides an example of this kind: Another respondent reported having escaped to Guangzhou where she asked a taxi driver to take her to the consulate, but the driver took her to the airport. There, she approached a police officer: The policeman contacted the consulate in Guangzhou and the woman was eventually returned to Cambodia. A further respondent who escaped from her village and went to the Shanghai consulate was told that she had to go to the embassy in Beijing. She took a bus there: \u201cI was in police custody after escaping from my husband. I took out a copy of my passport and presented it to the officer. It was night. He showed me a room for me to rest. The next morning, I was transferred to a larger office where a lot of policemen worked. Around mid-day, an officer from the Cambodian consulate came to meet me and to talk about my situation. Since I had a copy of my passport, my case was not complicated to address. I was sent to a shelter for temporary stay while they worked out my issue with the police. A day later, a police officer and consulate staff met me and my husband, who had been asked to come in and bring along my passport, to find a solution to the family matter. The police officer asked whether I wanted to return to my husband. I replied no. He sent me to a shelter again and the consulate asked me to stay there and wait for the required documents to be processed. I stayed in the shelter for about two weeks until the consulate officer informed me that the documents were done and I had to buy my ticket home.

I kept repeating the word \u2018Cambodia\u2019.\u201d The Cambodian consulates and embassy Respondents reported of mixed experiences with the Cambodian consulates or embassy in China. Some voiced appreciation towards them for providing or arranging shelter and food in China until they were being repatriated. Others commended the presence of consular staff at the police when the husbands were called in and the women asked for a divorce as well as to be sent back home. Support to use phones and contact family in Cambodia was equally appreciated. Further, consular staff often escorted the women to the airport and made sure they left the country safely. Below is the account of a respondent speaking of the support received from the consulate: 18 However, there were also concerns about the conduct of embassy and consular staff. Some respondents came to the Shanghai consulate from Jiangxi province and were told to go to the embassy in Beijing instead for jurisdiction reasons, with similar stories from others who contacted the Guangzhou consulate. Being referred to Beijing meant having to travel another 1,200km and 2,100km respectively, adding costs and risks of arrest to their escape. Respondents did not always know or understand such requirements and hence viewed the Cambodian authorities as unhelpful. Many felt that, overall, Cambodian officials perceived them as trying to get out of an unhappy marriage and made no efforts to determine their status as victims of forced marriage or to otherwise help them.49 Respondents awaiting repatriation at times indicated that the amount of money asked of them to cover their return ticket was far higher than the actual airfare. For example, one woman reported being told by a consular staff to ask her parents to send $700 for her flight ticket home.50 Her family sought the assistance of an NGO to help bring her back. When the consular official realized that the NGO was involved, he apparently reduced the amount required to $500. Other accounts were even more concerning including insults and abuse. Volunteer groups and other organizations Various individuals and organizations helped respondents escape from situations of forced marriage. Chinese volunteer groups in smaller cities in Jiangxi as well as in larger cities like Guangzhou, Shanghai and Beijing where the consulates and embassy were located provided support at various points. Many assisted those waiting for repatriation in metropolitan areas to obtain valid documents or to organize and pay for transportation back to Cambodia. The help sometimes also included food, medical checkups for pregnant women, legal counselling or relevant contacts. Below is an interview note outlining some of the assistance received through volunteers: \u201cTwo women escaped from their husbands\u2019 homes in Leping and presented themselves to the police in Nanchang, the capital city of Jiangxi province, asking for help. They had to wait for one day while the police in Nanchang and Leping investigated their case. The researchers to this study facilitated contact to two members of a volunteer group who reached the women, bought them lunch, clothes and shoes and booked hotel rooms for them. They also stayed with the women in the hotel room as a protective measure, should their husbands arrive. As both women had marriage certificates which the police viewed as proof that they were legally married and not trafficked, they did not receive any help from the police. Fearing that they could be taken back to their husbands\u2019 homes, volunteers from Jiangxi accompanied the women to Beijing to seek help. Unable to travel by train because they had no identity documents, the women and volunteers took a 30- hour bus ride to reach Beijing. In Beijing, the local volunteer group contacted the UN-ACT China office and the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Office of the Ministry of Public Security to establish whether the two women were victims of human trafficking. The volunteers helped the two women, one of whom was pregnant, to receive medical care, prepare signed statements and apply for new passports. Once they were officially identified as trafficked and issued new passports, volunteers helped the women book air tickets and dropped them off at the Beijing airport.\u201d 19 49 Since early 2015, the Cambodian embassy in Beijing has reportedly introduced standardized screening forms developed with support from", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "55c7db49-31ad-4203-aa4e-d8c01a3f2b16": {"__data__": {"id_": "55c7db49-31ad-4203-aa4e-d8c01a3f2b16", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/study-forced-marriage-between-cambodia-and-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Study on Forced Marriage between Cambodia and China", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/study-forced-marriage-between-cambodia-and-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f0e290e9769f35b6a3c69a662d0a364852ac3fbe07db877469f795c63e1c16d7"}}, "hash": "f0e290e9769f35b6a3c69a662d0a364852ac3fbe07db877469f795c63e1c16d7", "text": "the IOM to determine if women seeking help are victims of human trafficking. 50 A key informant indicated that many trafficking survivors supported by their organization reportedly had to pay between $1,800 and $2,000 to Cambodian consulate officials in China for their repatriation, without which they were threatened with being sent back to Chinese authorities and possible jail terms. she started working in a factory immediately after her return, but when her mother fell ill she returned home where she became a domestic worker in somebody\u2019s house. She noted that the work kept her away from home for over 12 hours a day, six days a week and she earned $150 per month. Two others were working in beauty salons, one of who had received a loan from a civil society organization to open her own parlor. Another two respondents worked in the food service sector earning $110 per month following vocational training received through NGOs. Some respondents, however, did not take up vocational training opportunities. For example, one woman said she had no time for training, because she needed to earn money immediately. Another respondent noted that she could not afford to always go to town for training purposes. Actions against brokers Most respondents said they had not taken any action against brokers, for varied reasons. Some did not want to be caught up in court visits and legal cases, which they described as going on for long periods of time; others did not want to relive the trauma of their experiences in China; still others were concerned about losing time to work and earn money. Below is the account of a woman who, although a case appeared to have been filed against her broker whilst she was in China, no longer wanted to pursue that after her return to Cambodia. Arrival back in Cambodia The women's parents typically awaited them at the airport, sometimes with representatives of an international organization. Immigration police usually questioned the returnees about the brokers involved in their migration to China. In some cases, they were released after the initial interview, in other cases however they were taken to the national police headquarters for further questioning. At times, the immigration police accompanied them and their parents to the office of a civil society or international organization. One woman who had returned to Cambodia at Siem Reap51 reported being threatened with jail upon arrival. Civil society and international organizations provided various kinds of support to respondents, ranging from food and personal care items to a few days of housing and travel costs for their return home. Several women reported being offered shelter stays including vocational training, some received cash of between $300 and $500 to support their (re)integration or were supported with rental subsidies. Different organizations provided different models of support to the respondents. Respondents\u2019 situation a few month after return A few respondents indicated that they were in debt because of the costs incurred for their travel to or their repatriation from China. One woman said she and her family owed $1,000 to a local moneylender, with their house given to the man as collateral. Paying about $70 each month, she estimated that it would take her about two years to repay the loan including interest. Another respondent who had returned home pregnant noted that she was in debt because her mother had borrowed money to arrange for her flight ticket home, and she herself had also accepted cash from another Cambodian woman in China who had since returned as well. Others also indicated to be in debt, at times with own family members, over the costs for their return from China. Most interviewees were employed and received wages after their return to Cambodia. Several women were working in factories including garment, sometimes part- time and in combination with agricultural labor. One said 51 Some women flew out of or returned to Cambodia via Siem Reap due to limitations on available flights to Phnom Penh.

And I do not want my name in the media or press.\u201d Another respondent did not want to take action against the broker because they continued to live in the village and her family feared a possible revenge.

When the family threatened to file a complaint against him, he said that he would give the family $500, which they refused. The family instead filed a complaint with the police in their commune but the broker escaped before action could be taken against him. Another woman had an ongoing case against an agent, which she launched with the support of a civil society organization in Cambodia: Stigma against returnees from China Some of the women alluded to fears or experiences of stigma related to being a female returnee from China. One respondent, for example, noted that when she was asked by an NGO whether she would like to visit her family in the village, she refused the offer because it had been her decision to go to China and she thought there would be a negative atmosphere due to her stay abroad. Another woman said that she did not return to her home village because she had returned from China pregnant and she was concerned that people might stigmatize her because of that and the stay in China. In a separate instance, the father of a returnee whom the research team encountered in a village repeatedly said that his daughter was no longer a virgin and her chances of marriage were hence low. In a particularly tragic case, a civil society organization reported of a woman who was not accepted by her family after she had returned from China and attempted to commit suicide in their office. \u201cI decided to lodge the complaint for two reasons, primarily to get compensated for the damage caused to me through deception and secondly, I wanted the broker behind bars so that other women would not fall prey to forced marriage as I experienced it.\u201d 21 52 In this research, it was typically deceptive recruitment in Cambodia coupled with coercive practices in China to bring about a woman\u2019s 'consent' to get married that resulted in conditions of forced marriage. 53 See the introduction for more details on this conceptual discussion. 54 Note that a number of Cambodian women who appeared to live in arranged marriages in China contentedly were encountered as part of this research, but their accounts did not inform the analysis on forced marriage. brokerage services, meaning whilst it is possible to register marriages between locals and foreigners once in China, the migration process cannot be arranged for that purpose through third parties. Further, the Cambodian authorities have taken other measures to curtail opportunities for women to go to China including for tourism, partly because of concerns about reports of forced marriages affecting their citizens. However, whilst such measures may have reduced the number of Cambodian women moving to China for marriage purposes, some raise very serious rights-related questions and constitute discriminatory practices on the basis of gender. Beyond that, these policies are likely to have further contributed to women\u2019s vulnerabilities to forced marriage by pushing them to enlist services of a series of irregular brokers operating without transparency and oversight. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some, perhaps even many, of the Cambodian women living in arranged marriages in China appear content in their situations,54 however this study has outlined the possible downsides of engagements brought about in non- regulated manners. Several brokers in both countries were involved in the marriage migration process. The first-contact agent was often familiar with the potential female migrant or her family because they lived in the same community or due to professional contacts. They drew interest with stories of financial gains by moving to China, either as a result of marriage with a wealthy Chinese husband or because of well-paying employment opportunities in China. Some provided upfront payments to strengthen their claims. At times, marriage was described as a prerequisite for job options and the right to stay in China long-term. All such narratives, however, proved to be deceptive: the Cambodian women interviewed were generally not introduced to wealthy husbands for reasons outlined above, and were unable to get well-paying jobs or any job beyond work associated with their Chinese families. Employment opportunities for foreigners in China are restricted and only available under specific circumstances, Forced marriage as part of broader marriage migration patterns remains as yet under-researched, and its relationship to human trafficking continues to be debated.

Whilst perspectives differ, this understanding is supported by international law53 and appears to be practice in both Cambodia and China where this study has been implemented. Different from other forms of human trafficking where research has come to focus more on the nature and extent of exploitation, key to forced marriage are hence the means by which a marriage has come about and is maintained. This moves the brokers involved to the center for deceptive or coercive recruitment practices, and the husbands \u2013 and at times their families \u2013 for coercive conduct in maintaining a marriage situation against the will of the bride. However, this study has also identified other important actors and factors in influencing marriage migration and forced marriage from Cambodia to China. Limited employment opportunities especially for females coupled with pressures to financially contribute to family life creates an environment, in which many women consider migration options as viable opportunities to help live up to their responsibilities at home. With anecdotal evidence suggesting that marriage migration to China has allowed females to remit money home, and at times faced by family demands to follow such examples, an unknown but seemingly significant number of Cambodian women has moved to China to marry local men. At the same time, the widening surplus of men over women in marriageable age in Chinese society, which is estimated to reach 30 to 40 million by 2020, has created a large pool of bachelors looking for partners. Whilst those in more urban areas with higher educational levels and successful professional careers often still manage to find wives, it is the rural men who struggle the most in this respect including to afford the ever increasing bride prices. They often turn to marriage brokers who bring in potential partners from abroad in exchange for comparably reasonable charges. It is in this environment of significant and ongoing push and pull factors that marriage migration from Cambodia to China takes place, however in an irregular manner. Both countries have prohibited transnational marriage CONCLUSIONS 22 and marriage with a Chinese citizen and residing in China grants access to jobs after five years at the earliest. Upon agreement, sometimes with strong encouragement from family members, agents in urban areas began to prepare the required documents including passports, visas and air tickets. The female migrants would receive their papers at the airport and then be sent off in small groups of three to six women, usually without anyone accompanying them. The destination was either Shanghai or Guangzhou depending on the onward travel plans as arranged by local agents, which usually took them to small towns or village communities hours outside the port of entry. At the final destination, women were typically accommodated in or around the brokers\u2019 houses for up to a few weeks whilst being introduced to Chinese men. It was often at that point that respondents started to comprehend the level of deception they had been exposed to. The agents commonly withheld their passports, and opportunities to move around freely or communicate with family in Cambodia were severely constrained. The visa situation was a very effective coercive tool for brokers to pressure women to 'consent' to marriages. Given that female migrants had generally entered China on tourist visas granting them stays of up to 30 days, which few \u2013 if any \u2013 respondents were aware of at first, brokers introduced marriage as the only opportunity for them to become eligible for longer-term stays, and hence to avoid arrest and deportation. In addition, agents utilized means including offered or committed sexual abuse, threats of repayment of travel costs and withholding of food to coerce women into agreeing to marriages. Once \u2018consent\u2019 was obtained, brokers would register the marriages and get the brides' visa changed and extended, after which their services were completed. Marriage registration in China requires the presence and explicit consent of both partners, which could have provided an opportunity for women to seek help from Chinese authorities. However, few of the marriage registration facilities provided Khmer translation support, and where they did the translators were often hired by or otherwise related to the brokers, hence undermining a transparent consent process. Chinese men paid significant sums for broker services, typically ranging from $10,000 to $20,000, which they were afraid to lose on wives escaping. The first few months of marriage were hence a period of high surveillance for the women. Their passports were kept by their husbands or the families, their movements were carefully monitored", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "562b2cff-ad40-4548-a690-53847bcbd17f": {"__data__": {"id_": "562b2cff-ad40-4548-a690-53847bcbd17f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/study-forced-marriage-between-cambodia-and-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Study on Forced Marriage between Cambodia and China", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/study-forced-marriage-between-cambodia-and-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eeb5baee08fb6830e10b1f47eb072a31d426f8ac33ca64e7bc678667ef290768"}}, "hash": "eeb5baee08fb6830e10b1f47eb072a31d426f8ac33ca64e7bc678667ef290768", "text": "and they were given little to no money for personal purposes. The control tended to ease somewhat with time and when respondents became pregnant. However, they were mostly unable to work beyond household tasks and involvement in family business, neither of which allowed them to remit much money to their Cambodian dependents. Some women made several escape attempts over time. Preparations benefited from social networks with other Cambodian females in China, such as at weekend markets or via mobile phones. The latter played important roles in the successful escape of women more broadly, including by allowing respondents to contact family for help or their location to be identified. Passports and money were key to successful escapes. The former was needed to book train tickets or hotel rooms as part of the journey, and given the long distances to reach consulates or the embassy, resources too were an important consideration. Villagers in communities tended to provide little support, partly because of ties with husbands and their families. In fact, residents suspecting that women were trying to escape sometimes informed their husbands or mobilized family members to help prevent them from leaving. At the same time, respondents found great levels of support from individuals and volunteer groups in China at various points of the escape and return journey, especially whilst awaiting repatriation. This included food, shelter as well as medical, counselling and legal support as needed. Experiences with police varied and often depended on where officers were encountered. Only few respondents proactively chose to reach out to law enforcement, however others came into contact inadvertently including at bus or train stations. If respondents met police in or around their communities, their cases were often treated as domestic problems and the women were returned to their husbands. If women encountered officers further away, such as in different provinces or major urban hubs, their case was typically treated differently, with Cambodian consulate or embassy staff being involved and significant support provided. Respondents\u2019 experiences with Cambodian consulates and the embassy were equally mixed. Some appreciated the various services provided to them, including shelter and food, opportunities to contact their families in 23 married to men in China are content with their lives. This report, however, has documented the possible downsides of marriage migration that is facilitated by sometimes unscrupulous agents operating in an irregular manner without transparency and oversight. Latest policy initiatives in Cambodia requiring high deposits of women visiting China alone and banning the issuance of single status certificates will do little to prevent incidences of forced marriages whilst constituting discriminatory practices based on gender. Instead, the two countries should establish regular cross-border marriage migration opportunities, drawing on examples and best practices from elsewhere. \u2713 Ensure that Chinese frontline responders and Cambodian officials in China have an adequate understanding of forced marriage as well as common tools to identify and respond to such situations. Given significant patterns of forced marriage in China, and increasingly involving foreigners, it is important for frontline responders and relevant diplomatic missions to understand the phenomenon and have tools available that help identify potential victims. The research has revealed that police officers, especially at the local level, at times seem ill-equipped for this task to date. A particular misunderstanding relates to marriage certificates, with law enforcement often dismissing women\u2019s cases on the basis of seemingly legitimate marriage registration papers. Cambodian consulate and embassy staff also sometimes fail to identify indicators of forced marriage and as a result do not extend services to Cambodians in need of support. Targeted, institutionalized trainings and the development of tools supporting the identification of forced marriage cases should be pursued to overcome current shortcomings. The two countries are encouraged to develop common approaches for victim identification, or ensure mutual recognition of outcomes, allowing for repatriation procedures and appropriate interim care to commence as swiftly as possible. \u2713 Extend services to trafficking victims free of charge including transportation and accommodation. Debt incurred as a result of the women\u2019s time in China including for return and repatriation has undermined Cambodia, and help with the arrangements for departure from China including reissuance of passports, visas and other documents. However, others experienced them as inactive and overtly bureaucratic. Some respondents were sent around between consulates and the embassy for alleged jurisdiction reasons, pushing up their travel time and costs as well as risks of arrest and deportation. A few women also spoke of incidences involving insults or abuse.

However, various factors complicated their successful (re)integration. These included at times significant debt incurred towards local moneylenders due to their journey to and return from China, additional family responsibilities including costs as a result of babies born out of marriages in China, as well as broken family relations and community stigma due to their stay abroad. Few respondents reported having taken any action against brokers in Cambodia. Sometimes, that was because of the agents\u2019 ongoing presence in their community and concerns about their possible revenge. Others simply wanted to move on with their lives and not relive some of the traumatizing experiences in judicial proceedings. Based on the analysis and findings, the following recommendations are proposed for consideration by policy-makers and practitioners, focusing primarily on prevention, identification and initial support including repatriation:55 TO BOTH COUNTRIES INCLUDING FOR BILATERAL COOPERATION: \u2713 Facilitate migration opportunities for marriage between Cambodia and China through regularized and monitored services based on established standards and practices. The push and pull factors, especially the gender imbalance in China, will continue to serve as drivers for marriage migration from Cambodia to China for decades to come. Anecdotal evidence, including from interviews conducted for this research, suggests that many Cambodian women 55 A much more detailed analysis on (re)integration needs including in Cambodia is found in Rebecca Surtees, After Trafficking: Experiences and Challenges in the (Re)integration of Trafficked Persons in the Greater Mekong Sub-region (UNIAP/Nexus Institute 2013). 24 successful (re)integration and increased risks of re- trafficking. Support services should hence be free for victims of forced marriage and other forms of exploitation, in recognition of the suffering endured and their rights as victims of human trafficking. Whilst this is primarily the responsibility of the states concerned, there are various funding and service pools from civil society and international organizations that can be drawn upon in support. Effective coordination, cooperation and referrals where needed are key in this context. TO STAKEHOLDERS IN CAMBODIA: \u2713 Include the following key messages in interventions informing behaviors of potential marriage migrants from Cambodia to China. a. Chinese men enlisting services of brokers to recruit wives in Cambodia are unlikely to be wealthy and living in urban areas; opportunities for financial remittances in support of families in Cambodia may hence be limited; b. Marriage to Chinese men does not as such provide employment opportunities in China for a minimum of five years; marriage introduced as a means to regular work is hence false information; c. Cambodian migrants are very likely to enter China on a tourist visa, which only grants the right to stay for up to 30 days; opportunities for extension are limited and costly, and overstays risk arrest and deportation; d. Migration services provided by brokers for marriage purposes are not free of charge; if a woman chooses not get married upon arrival in China, all costs and upfront payments incurred by agents will have to be borne by her; e. Passports are crucially important for various purposes in China, including transportation and accommodation; migrants should keep their passports - or at a minimum copies or pictures of them - at all times and memorize their passport numbers; f. If organizing transportation or accommodation without passport is inevitable, seeking the support from Chinese citizens or civil society groups can be a useful strategy; g. Social networks amongst Cambodian women in China may be able to provide support when needed; these exist in many communities with large numbers of Cambodian residents but also through mobile phone services and internet; h. There are other agencies in China including volunteer groups and civil society organizations as well as Cambodian consulates and the embassy that may be able to provide assistance; i. When attempting to escape from a forced marriage situation at community level, it may be better to seek support from police outside the village, especially in a different province or in urban centers. \u2713 Engage families and communities in Cambodia for effective trafficking prevention and (re)integration interventions. The study has shown that families and communities in Cambodia are vital actors in marriage migration decisions, affecting vulnerabilities to exploitation including forced marriage. Further, broker involvement at community level in marriage migration is very common, with local populations having an important role in monitoring migration outcomes and reporting deceptive practices. Upon return, family as well as community stigma has been a key factor in affecting (re)integration choices and outcomes. It is hence crucial to involve families and broader communities into trafficking prevention and (re) integration interventions. \u2713 Clarify and streamline authority between Cambodian consulates and the embassy on", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b599a3c-dde0-4a9c-9de6-8443bafbbb57": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b599a3c-dde0-4a9c-9de6-8443bafbbb57", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/study-forced-marriage-between-cambodia-and-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Study on Forced Marriage between Cambodia and China", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/study-forced-marriage-between-cambodia-and-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "28a4b232f6f8889bda4585bc0f700c78069efc8f87144d897c80791a9ab9bdf4"}}, "hash": "28a4b232f6f8889bda4585bc0f700c78069efc8f87144d897c80791a9ab9bdf4", "text": "providing services and support to Cambodian citizens in China, and enhance monitoring and accountability of their conduct. Women escaping situations of forced marriage require the support of Cambodian consulates or the embassy. Refusal to provide such services for reasons of limited authority exposes them to unreasonable risks including further exploitation, arrest and deportation, or at a minimum increased costs to reach assistance. Procedures should be put in place that clarify responsibilities for support and that ensure safe, timely and free transfers to where services are provided as needed. Further, given at times serious allegations about the conduct of Cambodian officials, mechanisms need to be put in place that provide more accountability of consulate and embassy staff including complaint mechanisms for those receiving services, and 25 the resident Chinese population, or the introduction to available services through government and non- government institutions. Many of the Cambodian wives in China come, at least in part, with the objective to financially support their families at home. Opportunities to do so influence their comfort including at times the decision to stay in China. Some of the respondents to this study managed to find work in local workshops, restaurants or factories, albeit on an irregular basis. The current spouse visa regime only grants access to employment opportunities after a minimum of five years in China, which is inadequate to attract Cambodian women to come to the country and help ease the gender imbalance in society. Key public services and insurances including those related to maternal health are equally available only after various years, which puts the lives of spouses and children born to Chinese citizens at unreasonable risks. The Chinese government maintains a wide network of shelters across the country, providing food, accommodation and other services to Chinese citizens facing various kinds of challenges. The system, however, is inexperienced in supporting foreigners in need of help. Anecdotal evidence suggests that Cambodian women escaping conditions of forced marriage, some pregnant, are at times not granted access to shelters and their services. Given the increasing number of foreigners identified as victims of forced marriage and other forms of exploitation, it is crucial for services to be extended and tailored to their needs as well. Non-government stakeholders also need to be involved in providing such support, and referral mechanisms bringing together government and civil society actors are required to make available comprehensive assistance packages. with disciplinary action to be taken if officials are found to be in breach of behavioral standards. \u2713 Reform the issuance of single status certificates for Cambodian women in China. The issuance of single status certificates through Cambodian consulates and the embassy is currently banned, although the extent of the policy\u2019s application is unclear. In the context of recommendation 1), the reintroduction of a reformed process for the issuance of such documents is encouraged including a mandatory interview with the Cambodian spouse-to-be to verify her free consent to a marriage. Further, the single status certificate should feature an indication of purpose, as this helps ensure that the person applying for the document is aware of its usage. An addition of this type has been introduced by Viet Nam, whose practice and experiences in this context may be worth learning from. TO STAKEHOLDERS IN CHINA: \u2713 Strengthen the consent process as part of the cross-border marriage registration procedures. The requirement for a foreign citizen to express their free consent to marriage before a competent authority in China provides another opportunity to seek assistance as needed. However, for Cambodian women to be able to voice their concerns and reservations, the registration offices need to be specifically tasked with, and trained in, assessing free consent. Such procedures also require the support from adequate, independent interpreters as well as social workers and counsellors, and must be free of the involvement of other external stakeholders including the husbands and possible brokers. \u2713 Support Cambodian wives of Chinese husbands in their integration into Chinese society. Cambodian women arriving in China, typically for the first time, face a range of challenges including language barriers, lack of familiarity with Chinese customs and norms, and many others. It is in the interest of all parties to ensure their smooth integration into Chinese society. This, however, requires deliberate efforts from various sides including the public sector and civil society, and may involve language and culture classes, support to the establishment of local networks amongst Cambodians living in communities, opportunities to engage with \u2713 Provide Cambodian wives with quicker access to the labor market and key public services in China. \u2713 Provide access to government and non-government support services to foreign trafficking victims,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "28989084-3477-4d19-a819-6303e919aaca": {"__data__": {"id_": "28989084-3477-4d19-a819-6303e919aaca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/study-forced-marriage-between-cambodia-and-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Study on Forced Marriage between Cambodia and China", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/study-forced-marriage-between-cambodia-and-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7ebd32f6e4f7c5ecd6d0c9c5b396cd72705aabf07087d51ce4d7432df0294090"}}, "hash": "7ebd32f6e4f7c5ecd6d0c9c5b396cd72705aabf07087d51ce4d7432df0294090", "text": "and ensure adequate referral mechanisms. 26 United Nations Development Programme Bangkok Regional Hub 3rd Floor, United Nations Service Building Rajdamnern Nok Avenue Bangkok 10200 Tel: (66) 2 304 9100 www.asia-pacific.undp.org www.facebook.com/undpasiapac Twitter: UNDPasiapac UN-ACT Regional Management Office 1st Floor, United Nations Service Building Rajdamnern Nok Avenue Bangkok 10200 Tel: (66) 2 304 9100 ext. 2310 www.un-act.org www.facebook.com/notrafficking Twitter: UN_ACT UNDP partners with people at all levels of society to help build nations that can withstand crisis, and drive and sustain the kind of growth that improves the quality of life for everyone.

Members of the reference group for the preparation of this manual 232 iv Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions Acknowledgements Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions is a publication of the Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions (APF) and the United Nations Development Programme Bangkok Regional Hub (UNDP). The manual was written by Chris Sidoti, APF senior consultant and Jack Byrne, APF consultant. The manual was enriched through materials, case studies and comments from members of the manual reference group, listed in Appendix 7, and by APF member national institutions. The APF and UNDP thank the following APF and UNDP staff and consultants who contributed to the development and production of the manual: APF Pip Dargan, APF Deputy Director and Gender Focal Point James Iliffe, Black and White Media Australia, editor Lisa Thompson, JAG Designs, layout and design UNDP Bangkok Regional Hub Edmund Settle, Policy Adviser, HIV, Health and Development Team Nicholas Booth, Programme Advisor, Governance, Conflict Prevention, Access to Justice and Human Rights Katri Kivioja, Programme Specialist, Coordinator \u2013 Being LGBTI in Asia, HIV, Health & Development Team v Foreword National human rights institutions (NHRIs) are official, independent, legal institutions established by the State and exercising the powers of the State to promote and protect human rights. In every country where they are established, they should be the principal mechanisms for human rights promotion and protection. They are concerned for the human rights of everyone within the jurisdiction of the State but they should have a particular concern for those who experience human rights violations or are most at risk of human rights violations. Because of this particular concern for those most at risk, NHRIs need to ensure that their work includes lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions (APF), individual NHRIs and non-government organisations have consistently found and reported that human rights violations based on sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics occur in every country and that people are at risk of violations based on these attributes. NHRIs therefore have a responsibility to respond with effective action to promote and protect the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people. Many NHRIs in the Asia Pacific region have already accepted this responsibility and have implemented significant activities and programs. This manual contains many excellent examples of their work. The APF has worked for almost ten years on human rights issues relating to sexual orientation and gender identity and more recently on human rights issues relating to sex characteristics. It has taken seriously the recommendation in the Principles on the Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (the Yogyakarta Principles) that \u201c[n]ational human rights institutions promote respect for these Principles by State and non-State actors, and integrate into their work the promotion and protection of the human rights of persons of diverse sexual orientations or gender identities\u201d. It has developed this manual to assist NHRIs further to respond more effectively to this responsibility. The manual has been produced as part of a longstanding partnership between the APF and UNDP. In recent years that partnership has included collaboration on a number of individual activities concerning human rights in relation to sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics. Now the partnership is moving to a new level of collaboration in a two-year integrated program of activities on these issues. The program will build on this manual with: \u2022 a regional conference to mark the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Yogyakarta Principles \u2022 training courses in the South Asia, South East Asia and Pacific sub-regions \u2022 support for NHRIs to mainstream into their strategic plans and work programs human rights issues concerning lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people \u2022 promotion of national level projects and activities by NHRIs \u2022 assistance for closer consultation between NHRIs and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex communities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f52d4e1b-a98a-4aca-bd69-76fafc3cafbd": {"__data__": {"id_": "f52d4e1b-a98a-4aca-bd69-76fafc3cafbd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2336f6ca345cf6cdd9b0d8553bad619e7da18b6318588fc72e10d6ead7cf9b9f"}, "2": {"node_id": "831a292e-dc03-42c2-b909-fef7a5f1dbd2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1113d1f4b16d88dfe9ffaf097d83af6a47c27dc6c9466a0d51d352baa7b39198"}}, "hash": "dab495149aabacf67bb08ffebea34b03557913f7821cbf8b8c7b982d4908bc79", "text": "We look forward to our organisations continuing to support NHRIs in this work.

Yogyakarta Principles The Principles on the Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Introduction for users | 1 Introduction for users THREE FOUNDATIONS This manual is based on three facts: 1. National human rights institutions (NHRIs) work to promote and protect the human rights of everyone, but especially the human rights of those who experience violations or are most at risk of violations. 2. Persons who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex (LGBTI) experience human rights violations or are at risk of violations because of their sexual orientation or gender identity or expression (SOGIE) or sex characteristics. 3. NHRIs should be particularly concerned to promote and protect the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex people. This manual focuses on the second and third points: the human rights experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex people and the work of NHRIs to promote and protect their human rights.1 It will not deal in detail with the role of NHRIs. The Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions (APF) has already produced a manual that discusses the nature, roles, functions, powers and activities of NHRIs.2 This manual is a response to the recommendation to NHRIs in the Principles on the Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (the Yogyakarta Principles) that: \u2026 [n]ational human rights institutions promote respect for these Principles by State and non-State actors, and integrate into their work the promotion and protection of the human rights of persons of diverse sexual orientations or gender identities.3 It responds as well to the recommendation of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in 2015 that: \u2026 national human rights institutions address violence and discrimination against LGBT and intersex persons in the context of their respective mandates to promote and monitor effective implementation of international human rights standards at the national level.4 It is also the implementation of a commitment made by the APF under the 2015 APF-UNDP Programme of Action and Support to: Engage with regional and sub-regional SOGI CSOs to seek their contributions to (i) an APF manual on the role of NHRIs in promoting and protecting the rights of LGBTI and (ii) further develop a pilot blended learning program (comprising of online and face-to-face adult learning) for its members on the role of NHRIs in promoting and protecting the rights of people of diverse SOGI. This will be undertaken in the next APF strategic cycle of 2015\u20132020.5 1 Terms used in this manual are defined in the glossary and discussed in further detail in Chapter 1. 2 APF, Manual on National Human Rights Institutions, 2015; at www.asiapacificforum.net/resources/manual-on-nhris/. 3 Yogyakarta Principles, Additional Recommendation L. 4 High Commissioner for Human Rights, Discrimination and violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity, 4 May 2015, A/HRC/29/23, para. 80; at www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/HRC/29/23&referer=/ english/&Lang=E. 5 APF and UNDP, Programme of Action and Support: The role of national human rights institutions in promoting and protecting human rights in relation to sexual orientations and gender identity including health rights in the Asia and the Pacific 2015, Action 33; at www.asiapacificforum.net/resources/programme-action-and-support-nhri-sogi-2015/. 2 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS INSTITUTIONS NHRIs are official, independent legal institutions established by the State and exercising the powers of the State to promote and protect human rights.

NHRIs AND PERSONS OF DIVERSE SEXUAL ORIENTATION, GENDER IDENTITY AND SEX CHARACTERISTICS NHRIs work for the human rights of all people. Often an NHRI will identify specific population groups within its country that are especially vulnerable to actual human rights violations or the risk of human rights violations. Many NHRIs identify lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people as being among those groups most at risk. Certainly international reports by United Nations (UN) agencies and mechanisms consistently reveal widespread patterns of human rights violations affecting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people.7 Reports of civil society organisations point consistently to the same conclusions.8 6 Commission on Human Rights resolution 1992/54 and General Assembly resolution 48/134. 7 See, for example, High Commissioner for Human Rights, Discriminatory laws and practices and acts of violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity, November 2011, A/HRC/19/41; at http://daccess-ods.un.org/ TMP/9525419.47364807.html; OHCHR, Born free and equal, 2012; at www.asiapacificforum.net/resources/born-free-and- equal/; High Commissioner for Human Rights, Discrimination and violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity, May 2015, A/HRC/29/23; at www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/HRC/29/23&referer=/ english/&Lang=E. 8 See, for example, International Commission of Jurists, Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Justice: A Comparative Law Casebook; at www.icj.org/sogi-casebook-introduction; Human Rights Watch, Together, Apart: Organizing around Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Worldwide, June 2009; at www.hrw.org/report/2009/06/11/together-apart/organizing-around- sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-worldwide; International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (now Outright Action International) Violence: Through the lens of lesbians, bisexual women and trans people in Asia, 2014; at www.outrightinternational. org/content/violence-through-lens-lbt-people-asia. Introduction for users | 3 THE ASIA PACIFIC FORUM OF NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS INSTITUTIONS The APF is a network of NHRIs in the Asia and Pacific region. It has 22 members \u2013 15 full members and seven associate members.9 It provides advisory, networking and capacity-building services to its members to support them in their efforts to comply with international standards and to promote and protect human rights.10 As part of its work the APF has produced a series of manuals to assist NHRIs and others to understand the particular roles of NHRIs on key human rights issues and functions and to promote learning among its members from their varied experiences. To date, the APF\u2019s manuals have dealt with: \u2022 Preventing Torture: An Operational Guide for National Human Rights Institutions (2010; also available in Arabic, Spanish and French), published jointly with the Association for the Prevention of Torture and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) \u2022 International Human Rights and the International Human Rights System: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions (2012) \u2022 Manual on Conducting a National Inquiry into Systemic Patterns of Human Rights Violation (2012; also available in Arabic and Indonesian), published jointly with the Raoul Wallenberg Institute of Human Rights and Humanitarian Law \u2022 Promoting and Protecting the Rights of Migrant Workers: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions (2012; also available in Arabic), published with input from the Diplomacy Training Program \u2022 Human Rights Education: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions (2013) 9 As at 31 December 2015. 10 APF, Strategic Plan 2015-2020; at www.asiapacificforum.net/resources/apf-strategic-plan-2015-2020/.

All these manuals are available on the APF website.11 This manual is part of that series. UN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME AND BEING LGBTI IN ASIA In producing this manual the APF has been assisted by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), in particular through Phase 2 of its project Being LGBTI in Asia. Being LGBT in Asia Phase 1 was undertaken as a partnership between Asian lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender organisations and community leaders in the period 2012\u20132015.12 The purpose of the partnership was to conduct a participatory review and analysis of the legal and social environment for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons in Asia. National reports were published in eight countries that included recommendations based on contributions to the dialogues and additional research and analysis.13 An Asia-wide literature review was also conducted and further data, resources and experiences were drawn from civil society organisations, academic institutions and private sector partners. In February 2015, a Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific was convened by UNDP, with support from the Embassy of Sweden in Bangkok, USAID and other partners. The Regional Dialogue gathered over 200 participants from the Asia Pacific region, including community representatives, government experts, representatives of NHRIs and development partners. Inclusion of intersex people in the Regional Dialogue enabled discussion of specific issues relating to sex characteristics. A regional meeting of NHRIs was convened by APF and UNDP to coincide with the Regional Dialogue. Through these various activities, Being LGBT in Asia Phase 1 established an evidence base on issues of sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics in the Asia Pacific region and produced the following reports: \u2022 Being LGBT in Asia country reports for Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Mongolia, Nepal, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam \u2022 Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 11 At www.asiapacificforum.net/support/professional-resources/. 12 Supported by UNDP and USAID. 13 Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Mongolia, Nepal, the Philippines, Thailand, Viet Nam.

Others are longer descriptions of comprehensive programs. The case studies provide information on past and present activities of individual NHRIs and offer inspiration to all NHRIs for future projects. They assist NHRIs to learn from each other. The final chapter of the manual offers possible actions for NHRIs \u2013 50 of them. These are actions NHRIs can take, under each of their functions, to promote and protect the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people. The manual was prepared with the advice and assistance of a reference group drawn from APF members and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex activists and scholars. The members of the reference group are listed in Appendix 7. 7 Part I: Experiences of being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex in the Asia Pacific Chapter 1: Understanding sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics Chapter 2: Being lesbian, gay and bisexual in the Asia Pacific Chapter 3: Being transgender in Asia and the Pacific Chapter 4: Being intersex in Asia and the Pacific 8 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions Chapter 1: Understanding sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics 1.1. INTRODUCTION This chapter provides background information about three distinct but related concepts: sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics. Each describes important and fundamental parts of a person\u2019s life. Sexual orientation and gender identity are both integral parts of each person\u2019s personality or identity. Human rights experts have described them as some of the most basic aspects of self-determination, dignity and freedom.15 Whether someone is intersex is equally intrinsic to who a person is but for different reasons. As the definition later in this chapter describes, sex characteristics refer to physical, bodily diversity. Intersex traits are common and encompass a wide spectrum of physical sex characteristics. UN treaty monitoring bodies have spoken out many times against violations of intersex people\u2019s right to physical and bodily integrity, self-determination and autonomy.16 Most of the discussion to date about human rights issues for intersex people uses the term \u2018intersex people\u2019 or \u2018intersex persons\u2019, rather than a prohibited ground of discrimination. In very recent times, a consensus has started to emerge on using the term \u2018sex characteristics\u2019 as the prohibited ground of unlawful discrimination. This manual uses both approaches as appropriate to the context. 15 Yogyakarta Principles, Principle 3. 16 Committee on the Rights of the Child, Concluding Observations: Switzerland, 26 February 2015, CRC/C/CHE/CO/2-4, para. 43b; Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Concluding Observations: Germany, 12 July 2011, E/C.12/DEU/CO/5, para. 26; Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Concluding Observations: Germany, 13 May 2015, CRPD/C/DEU/ CO/1, paras. 37-38.

In many societies, a person\u2019s physical sex characteristics are assumed to dictate that individual\u2019s gender identity, gender expression and sexual orientation. Specifically, there is an assumption people are born either male or female and are then attracted to someone of \u2018the opposite\u2019 sex. Someone born with what is considered to be a \u2018male body\u2019 is expected to grow up and identify as a man, have a masculine gender expression and be solely attracted to women. Someone born with a \u2018female body\u2019 is expected to identify as a woman, be feminine and only be attracted to men. This fails to reflect the lived realities of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people or to uphold their human rights to dignity, equality and freedom. These norms also create rigid stereotypes about how women and men should behave. They perpetuate gender inequalities. When these distinctions define heterosexuality as superior (heteronormativity), they contribute to the marginalisation of lesbian, gay and bisexual people. Similarly, transgender people are vulnerable to stigmatisation when social norms dictate that someone\u2019s gender identity should match their sex assigned at birth (cisnormativity). Stereotypes, including medical norms, about what constitutes a female or a male body are also used to justify medically unnecessary surgeries and other interventions on intersex people.18 1.2. CONCEPTS AND TERMINOLOGY 1.2.1. The importance of terminology19 Terminology that describes such intrinsic parts of a person\u2019s identity or characteristics carries a heavy weight and significance. This is particularly so for groups that have been stigmatised and whose existence has been denied. In those circumstances, terms validate who someone is and may help them to feel connected to others who share that identity or those characteristics. 17 UNDP, Leave no one behind: Advancing social, economic, cultural, and political inclusion of LGBTI people in Asia and the Pacific, 2016. 18 Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe, Issue Paper: Human rights and intersex people, 2015, p. 7. 19 Presentation to the Homosexual Histories Conference 2014 \u2013 Pride History Group, November 2014; at www.humanrights.gov.au/ news/speeches/homosexual-histories-conference-2014-pride-history-group-0. I want to acknowledge that terminology can have a profound impact on a person\u2019s identity, self-worth and inherent dignity. The use of inclusive and acceptable terminology empowers individuals and enables visibility of important issues. The [Australian Human Rights] Commission supports the right of people to identify their sexual orientation, sex and gender as they choose. The Commission also recognises that terminology is strongly contested. Susan Ryan, Age Discrimination Commissioner, Australian Human Rights Commission19 10 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions It can often feel daunting for people wanting to know the appropriate, respectful terms to use, especially as terminology in this area continues to evolve. This chapter provides an overview of key concepts and terms used in this region. This includes emphasising that many traditional terms combine or conflate elements of sexual orientation and gender identity and, to some extent, intersex status. Having some shared knowledge of these terms enables NHRIs and community groups to communicate more clearly about the common and distinct human rights issues that are faced by lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people in their country and across the region. This chapter closes with some practical advice for NHRIs on using umbrella terms and ways to respect people\u2019s identities, characteristics and privacy. Terminology evolves over time. What remains constant is the importance of treating each person with dignity, in a way that protects the person from discrimination and violence. 1.2.2.

For example, many lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender groups in ASEAN member states have come together to form the ASEAN Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression (SOGIE) Caucus.25 NGOs in New Zealand created a Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Intersex (SOGII) Coalition to develop a joint submission to New Zealand\u2019s second Universal Periodic Review.26 20 See Chapter 5. 21 See Chapter 6. 22 Section 26(3)(a) of the 2013 Constitution of the Republic of Fiji.

Chapter 1: Understanding sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics | 11 Part I Experiences of being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex in the Asia Pacific 1.3. DEFINITIONS Sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression are each a spectrum. They are not limited to two, binary options, such as heterosexual or homosexual, male or female, or masculine or feminine. Similarly, the umbrella term \u2018intersex\u2019 encompasses a broad range of variations in sex characteristics. Each of these concepts is distinct from the other. For example, someone\u2019s intersex trait does not disclose anything about the person\u2019s sexual orientation, sex or gender identity. Similarly, transgender people have the same range of sexual orientations as the population as a whole; they are heterosexual, homosexual and bisexual. Most lesbians, gay men and bisexual people are neither transgender nor intersex \u2013 and some are either or both. Every person has the right to choose what terms best describe them. The examples provided here form a small proportion of the very large number of terms used in the Asia Pacific. They include terms specific to particular countries, cultures and/or languages in this region.27 Sexual orientation itself has three separate components: who someone is attracted to (sexual attraction), who the person is sexual with (sexual behaviour) and how the person identifies (sexual identity).28 Each of these elements can be described as occurring on a spectrum, from heterosexual (opposite sex) at one end to homosexual (same sex) at the other. If someone is attracted solely to people of a different sex they are often described as \u2018heterosexual\u2019. A person who is attracted solely to someone of the same sex might be called \u2018homosexual\u2019 or \u2018gay\u2019 or, if female, \u2018lesbian\u2019. Someone who is attracted to another person regardless of their sex might use the term \u2018bisexual\u2019 or \u2018pansexual\u2019.29 \u2018Asexual\u2019 typically refers to a person who does not experience sexual attraction to others.

This acknowledges that people exploring their identity, including young people, may not identify with specific labels about their sexual orientation or gender identity. Sexual orientation refers to each person\u2019s capacity for profound emotional, affectional and sexual attraction to, and intimate and sexual relations with, another person. 12 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions This manual uses the umbrella term \u2018transgender\u2019 to encompass a wide range of gender diversity, including people who identify as transsexual, transgender, third gender, gender non-conforming, Female to Male (FtM) or trans men, Male to Female (MtF) or trans women, or using one of the many culturally specific terms across the Asia Pacific region that describe gender diversity. In addition, there are many transgender women in the region who simply identify as women and transgender men who identify as men. Both Asia and the Pacific have long traditions of \u2018non-binary\u2019 or \u2018third gender\u2019 identities. Non- binary English language terms such as \u2018gender non-conforming\u2019 or \u2018genderqueer\u2019 are less common in the region, except for Australia and New Zealand. These terms are used by people whose identity is not limited to being either a man or a woman and/or whose gender expression is not limited to either masculine or feminine. Cisgender is an opposite term to transgender. It describes people who are not transgender, because their assigned sex at birth matches their gender identity. Transitioning is the process that a transgender person undergoes to live in their self-defined gender identity. It may involve social, legal and/or medical steps. \u2022 Social transition steps may include changes to clothing, hairstyle, mannerisms and/or the name or pronoun someone uses in everyday interactions. \u2022 Legal transition steps involve formally changing the person\u2019s name, title, sex or gender on official identification documents. \u2022 Medical transition steps that affirm a transgender person\u2019s gender identity include, for example, hormone treatment and a range of surgeries. The great majority of transgender people in this region are unable to gain legal recognition or access to most gender affirming health services.31 Dislike of or prejudice against someone because they are, or are assumed to be, transgender is called \u2018transphobia\u2019. It is often an underlying cause of discrimination and violence against transgender people. 31 See Chapter 3. Gender identity is a person\u2019s internal sense of being a man or a woman or a third or other alternative gender, or a combination of genders. Transgender and trans are umbrella terms to describe people whose gender identity does not match the sex they were assigned at birth. Gender expression is a person\u2019s ways of communicating masculinity or femininity (or both or neither) externally. This is done through physical appearance \u2013 including clothing, hair styles and the use of cosmetics \u2013 and mannerisms, ways of speaking and behavioural patterns when interacting with others. Chapter 1: Understanding sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics | 13 Part I Experiences of being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex in the Asia Pacific When a man has a feminine gender expression he is often assumed to be gay and the word \u2018effeminate\u2019 is frequently used as a negative term. Similarly, a woman with a masculine gender expression is often assumed to be lesbian. However sexual orientation and gender expression are separate and distinct. For example, there are also many masculine gay men and feminine lesbians. 32 In a comparable way, someone\u2019s outward gender expression does not indicate whether the person is transgender or not. Many transgender women are very feminine but others may prefer more gender- neutral or masculine clothes or hairstyles. Similarly, not all transgender men want to be hyper-masculine.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a9420e6c-0f11-4220-8b89-4fdcbdd22124": {"__data__": {"id_": "a9420e6c-0f11-4220-8b89-4fdcbdd22124", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3db938fdb078d96d65da18de042c81b82d2f91d5394caeee8d9713e3f408cc0a"}, "2": {"node_id": "bab3ecd9-97f1-43b6-8c2b-480bbc217829", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eac08f555d235c89d4a7ebc5017570e4531009dbad5e7b2c76785c0a626a28b5"}}, "hash": "dbe2da9ad7c43dd6b8899d9bf3f2eeb0d35350c6f0bbc0d83c2e02b6d0cd1cb6", "text": "Similarly, not all transgender men want to be hyper-masculine.

When talking about the relevant ground of discrimination, the terms most commonly used are \u2018intersex status\u2019 or \u2018sex characteristics\u2019.33 32 Gender Identity, Gender Expression and Sex Characteristics Act 2015 (Malta); see http://justiceservices.gov.mt/Download Document.aspx?app=lp&itemid=26805&l=1. 33 Chapter 4 provides more details about recent use of the term \u2018sex characteristics\u2019. Biological sex is one of many uses of the term \u2018sex\u2019, employed when referring to a person\u2019s biological characteristics. These may be genetic, hormonal or anatomical and typically are used to categorise people into two distinct categories as either male or female. The term \u2018sex characteristics\u2019 is an alternative, more precise way of framing biological sex. Sex characteristics refers to the chromosomal, gonadal and anatomical features of a person, which include primary characteristics, such as reproductive organs and genitalia and/or in chromosomal structures and hormones, and secondary characteristics, such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breasts and/or structure.32 Intersex is an umbrella term used to describe people born with sex characteristics (including genitals, gonads and chromosome patterns) that do not fit typical binary notions of male or female bodies. 14 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions This manual primarily uses the terms \u2018intersex people\u2019 and \u2018sex characteristics\u2019, in line with shifts in the terms used by UN bodies. However, terminology is evolving. Not all intersex people may like, know or understand the term \u2018intersex\u2019 but there is no other term that has widespread support or acceptance.34 There is no commonly used term to describe dislike of or prejudice against someone because the person is intersex. However, sexist, heteronormative and/or transphobic motives are driving forces behind much of the discrimination against intersex people and the human rights breaches they face. They are used as rationales for surgeries on intersex infants and children, based on the belief that atypical sex characteristics may lead to homosexuality or gender non-conformity.35 Individual intersex people have the right to choose whatever terms they wish to describe what it means to them to have an intersex variation. When NHRIs are discussing human rights issues for intersex people it is important to use accurate terms that do not describe intersex traits in a negative way. An older term that may be more familiar to the general public is the biological term \u2018hermaphrodite\u2019. Its specific biological meaning refers to plants and creatures that possess fully functional, fertile, \u2018female\u2019 and \u2018male\u2019 sex organs. As this combination is not possible for humans, it is inaccurate and can be misleading to use the term \u2018hermaphrodite\u2019 to describe people. While some intersex people have reclaimed the word \u2018hermaphrodite\u2019, many find it stigmatising.36 The term \u2018disorders of sex development\u2019 is commonly used in medical settings but is rejected by the majority of intersex people. Intersex-led organisations have criticised the term as it implies that intersex traits are a \u2018disorder\u2019.37 The term \u2018intersexual\u2019 may create the mistaken impression that there is an automatic link between someone\u2019s intersex status and traits and their sexual orientation. Similarly, the term \u2018intersex identity\u2019 may imply that people choose to identify as having an intersex variation. This underplays the very physical element of intersex variations.38 One of the demands from the 2013 International Intersex Forum was that intersex children should be registered as females or males, with the awareness that, like all people, they may grow up to identify with a different sex or gender.39 34 Many misconceptions contribute to a lack of understanding of the term. For example, some people may associate the word with non-binary gender identities. 35 Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe, Human Rights and Intersex People: an Issue Paper, 2015. 36 M.

REGIONAL-SPECIFIC TERMS There are many specific terms used in the Asia Pacific region to describe people based on their sexual orientation and/or gender identity. These terms may be used in one country only or in a number of countries. There are few known regionally-specific terms for intersex status. Some lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities are more visible than others. Visibility can mean either relatively more acceptance or heightened vulnerability to discrimination. Less visible groups may not face as much direct discrimination in public places. However, they are at equal risk of rejection or violence from family or community members who may attempt to suppress or erase any form of diversity in sexual orientation and gender identity or intersex variation.40 1.4.1. More visible identities In all parts of the Asia Pacific region, the most visible culturally or regionally specific identities relating to sexual orientation and gender identity describe people assigned a male sex at birth who identify as a third gender or as transgender women. In South Asia, these include identities such as hijra in India and Bangladesh, thirunangai and aravani in India, khwaja sira in Pakistan and meti in Nepal. Each of these identities is frequently described as a \u2018third gender\u2019. In South East Asia, some common terms used by transgender women are kathoey in Thailand, waria in Indonesia and the reclaimed term mak nyah in Malaysia. In the Philippines, the term bakla is often used to describe people assigned a male sex at birth who identify as a third gender or are effeminate. Many transgender women prefer the hybrid term, transpinay, as it is a word created specifically by their community. In East Asia, a term used in Hong Kong is kwaa-sing-bit. The words whakawahine and Sistergirl are used by indigenous transgender women in New Zealand and Australia respectively. In the Pacific, terms used by transgender women do not exclusively describe a person\u2019s gender identity. Often the terms are used by some men who have sex with men too, particularly those whose gender expression incorporates some feminine elements. Terms include fa\u2019afafine in Samoa and Tokelau, fakaleiti or leiti in Tonga, fakafifine in Niue, akava\u2019ine in Cook Islands and palopa in Papua New Guinea. These words are not limited to a person\u2019s individual identity but also describe their gender role within their extended family. In Samoa, for example, fa\u2019afafine are known for their hard work and dedication to the family in carrying out roles and responsibilities both for men and women.41 In Asia, local terms used by men who have sex with men usually focus on a person\u2019s gender expression, including visible personality traits, that are more feminine than the norm. In this way any divergence from the majority norms is described in gender identity or gender expression terms, rather than as a person\u2019s sexual orientation.42 For example, terms such as sak klay (short hair) and pros saat (handsome man) in Cambodia describe men who are considered less masculine or to have female traits, such as gentleness.43 Some terms in Asia also link feminine gender expression with a preference for being a receptive sexual partner. One example is the distinction in South Asia between feminine kothis and their sexual partners, panthis. Most panthis, and many kothis, are married to women.44 40 Questions of visibility and invisibility, and human rights violations in public and private spheres, are discussed in Chapters 2, 3 and 4. 41 Office of the Ombudsman of Samoa, State of Human Rights Report, 2015, p. 23. 42 D.

Less visible identities or populations There is much less regional information available about the experiences of specific groups among the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex populations, especially: \u2022 people assigned a female sex at birth who do not have a female gender identity; for example, transgender men \u2022 women who are solely or sometimes attracted to women; for example, lesbians and bisexual women \u2022 women who have a masculine gender expression; for example, \u2018butch\u2019 women, who may or may not be lesbian \u2022 intersex people. Unlike the abundance of gender identity terms for transgender women, traditional local terms that refer to transgender men are unusual. Those that do exist are more likely to be of recent origin, though they may attempt to frame transgender men\u2019s identities within an historical or cultural context. Examples include thirunambi in Malaysia and India, kua xing nan in Malaysia, laki-laki trans in Indonesia, transpinoy in the Philippines, bandhu in Bangladesh, Brotherboy in Australia and tangata ira tane in New Zealand. Even where these terms exist, transgender men may find it difficult to be acknowledged as male, as frequently others refer to them using more common terms that describe butch lesbians. Many other regional terms encompass both women who are attracted to other women (a sexual orientation issue) and women who appear butch or relatively masculine (a gender expression issue). These terms may be self-chosen or imposed on someone who is perceived to not be conforming to social norms of femininity and/or heterosexuality. The words tomboi, tomboy and toms are used frequently in South East Asian countries, including Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, and also in China where the term for a butch lesbian is tomboy or T.47 Other terms used in the Philippines are tibo, tiboli, tibam and pars. In some countries, local terms may be used predominantly within one ethnic community. For example, in Malaysia pengkid and peng are heard almost exclusively within the Malay community. These terms encompass anyone born female who steps outside gender and sexuality norms.

Regional terms for people with intersex traits Culturally-specific terms to describe intersex people are rare in the Asia Pacific region. This may be because intersex variations are more likely to be described in medical terms and are frequently cloaked in stigma and secrecy. In South Asia, terms used to describe third gender people who have undergone a traditional castration process are sometimes applied to intersex people too. 51 In Nepal the term for intersex is \u0905\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0930\u0932\u093f\u0902\u0917\u0940 or arntarlingi.52 In New Zealand, the indigenous term te ruaruanga taha wahine, taha tane was developed by former Human Rights Commissioner Merimeri Penfold in 2007 as a positive description of intersex variations. It uses the imagery of intertwining male and female eels, as they move across each other in a narrow stream, as a way to convey the diverse combinations of male and female sex characteristics.53 1.4.4. Other groups There is considerable diversity within all lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex communities. Some people face additional human rights challenges or are less visible or insufficiently acknowledged in those communities; for example, those who are indigenous or live with disabilities or come from a refugee or migrant background. A 2011 Australian research report described the effects of both homophobia and racism on same-sex attracted people from Arabic-speaking backgrounds.54 Indigenous t\u0101katapui (Maori lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people) in New Zealand have published a resource on identity and well-being.

Umbrella terms make systemic human rights issues more visible, while respecting people\u2019s individual choice to define themselves.56 56 Australian Human Rights Commission, Resilient Individuals: Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Intersex Rights, 2015. GOOD PRACTICE: USING UMBRELLA TERMS Umbrella terms are shorter than listing all commonly used identity terms. They save time and, in written resources, space. They also reduce the risk of using outdated and possibly contentious terms. However, umbrella terms can still exclude people who do not see their identity reflected in the terms used. When speaking at a public or community meeting, it can be easier to start by using the concepts of sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics rather than specific identity terms. This may avoid any community debates or divisions around particular words. It also conveys an inclusive approach. One example could be welcoming everyone, acknowledging that participants represent the rich diversity of sex characteristics, sexual orientations, gender identities and gender expressions in the community. Before introducing an umbrella term in a written resource, it is useful to: \u2022 give examples of the breadth of identities and characteristics that it encompasses \u2022 acknowledge that people use a diversity of terms and have the right to identify their sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or intersex status as they choose, and then \u2022 introduce the term or terms chosen for that specific resource. Umbrella terms should be used accurately. Avoid using abbreviations, such as \u2018SOGII\u2019 or \u2018LGBTI\u2019, if the material you are presenting relates to only one of the concepts or groups of people. For example, a report focused solely on sexual orientation issues for men who have sex with men is not accurately described as a \u2018SOGII\u2019 or \u2018LGBTI\u2019 resource. Clarifying its narrower scope identifies what material it does provide, as well as information gaps that may signal a need for further research. Chapter 1: Understanding sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics | 21 Part I Experiences of being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex in the Asia Pacific This manual uses: \u2022 lesbian, gay and bisexual to describe diverse sexual orientations \u2022 transgender to describe diverse gender identities \u2022 intersex to describe people born with diverse intersex traits and sex characteristics. This manual follows the lead of recent human rights reports in making specific use of the terms \u2018sex characteristics\u2019 and \u2018intersex people\u2019. Maintaining a distinct focus on the marginalised voices of people with intersex traits is important. It signals that specific intersex concerns are not best understood within a framework focused on sexual orientation and gender identity. For example, some human rights concerns are shared with girls and women, such as in relation to female genital mutilation and cutting, or relate to prenatal screening, sterilisation or other issues that many people with disabilities experience too.57 1.6. DEFINING DIVERSE SEXUAL ORIENTATION, GENDER IDENTITY AND SEX CHARACTERISTICS AS ILLNESSES Some of the prejudice against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people arises because their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or intersex status is considered a mental or physical illness. These types of beliefs are called pathologisation. They can fuel prejudice and discrimination. Pathologising beliefs have been used to justify reparative or curative or conversion therapies that attempt to change a person\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity. These therapies have been condemned as unethical by numerous health bodies.58 In 2011, the Psychological Association of the Philippines spoke out in support of \u2018global initiatives to remove the stigma of mental illness\u2019 associated with being transgender or identifying as lesbian, gay or bisexual.59 Pathologisation of intersex variations has provided the medical rationale for medically unnecessary genital surgeries and hormone treatment, undertaken on infants or children before they are able to give informed consent.60 These practices raise significant human rights concerns.61 1.6.1. Being lesbian, gay or bisexual is not an illness Homosexuality was officially included in the first classifications of mental disorders.

Being transgender is not an illness Transgender people who medically transition have specific health needs that are related to their gender identity. However, this does not mean that gender diversity is a medical condition or that it requires medical treatment. Traditional concepts of gender diversity existed long before the introduction of medical terms. Medical terms describing transgender people only emerged in the twentieth century after the development of hormone treatment and gender-affirming surgeries that have enabled transgender people to medically transition. Specifically, some forms of gender diversity have been defined as a mental health condition in the World Health Organisation\u2019s ICD series and in the DSM series of the American Psychiatric Association. These classifications are used by public health systems around the world to code, and thus fund, health services that enable transgender people to access gender-affirming hormone treatment and surgeries. As part of its current revision of ICD-10, the World Health Organisation has proposed removing such diagnoses so they are no longer classed as mental health diagnoses. A remaining challenge is to ensure the continuation of diagnostic codes for the gender-affirming health services that are medically necessary for some transgender people. The World Professional Association for Transgender Health publishes Standards of Care on the health of transsexual, transgender and gender non-conforming people. In May 2010, its Board of Directors issued a \u2018de-psychopathologisation\u2019 statement emphasising that gender diversity is common across many cultures. It recommended that gender diversity should not be defined by a mental health diagnosis, as part of broader steps needed to eliminate stigma against transgender and gender-variant people.63 Participants from 19 countries, attending the Trans* Pre-conference at the 2015 ILGA Asia Conference in Taiwan, unanimously passed a declaration supporting this approach and opposing World Health Organisation proposals to define gender diversity in children as a disease. This declaration was endorsed by the Asia Pacific Transgender Network and the ILGA Asia conference.64 In some parts of the region, the perception that gender diversity is an illness is the only mitigating factor reducing violence and discrimination against transgender people. In these circumstances, it is understandable if transgender people argue that they should not be criminalised for a mental health condition and that being transgender is not their choice. NHRIs can play an important role by emphasising that transgender people have the right to freedom from discrimination, whether or not they have a mental health diagnosis such as gender dysphoria. 1.6.3. Being intersex is not an illness Being intersex is about body diversity. It is not inevitably about having a physical illness. Most intersex variations have no impacts on an intersex person\u2019s health, yet medical terms are used frequently to describe all intersex variations as \u2018disorders of sex development\u2019. This contributes to the level of stigma attached to intersex traits and the pressure for medical interventions to \u2018correct\u2019 such disorders.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e1e4e3a8-d05a-45da-9a6a-81978d7983e6": {"__data__": {"id_": "e1e4e3a8-d05a-45da-9a6a-81978d7983e6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1fa9bb4ca5001928d7a45068ecfa153f015d06318be6dda8154e2ed1f66fefcb"}, "2": {"node_id": "b050f00b-041f-4751-89f6-cd7fe205884b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ae9195ccf94f67a05eb657fada83679cc334b53821e59bbad80a4f28f24e117a"}}, "hash": "80dc445fc668348d853ffc6935700ff5592895a693a81c0ac60f1df790eb1f1f", "text": "There is emerging evidence that, when parents have access to information describing the lived experiences of intersex people, they are more likely to delay or refuse medical interventions.65 Parents may not realise that they are consenting to experimental treatments and later parental regret can be high.66 63 See www.wpath.org/uploaded_files/140/files/de-psychopathologisation%205-26-10%20on%20letterhead.pdf. 64 The ILGA Trans* Secretariat and the Asia Pacific Transgender Network, Statement on Gender Incongruence in Childhood, Trans* Pre-conference, 6th ILGA Asia Conference, Taipei, Taiwan, 27 October 2015. 65 G.

Chapter 1: Understanding sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics | 23 Part I Experiences of being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex in the Asia Pacific A recent report from the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe recommended that: \u2026 national and international medical classifications which pathologise variations in sex characteristics should be reviewed with a view to eliminating obstacles to the effective enjoyment, by intersex persons, of human rights, including the right to the highest attainable standard of health.67 In November 2015, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights raised similar issues and recommended policies and programs to sensitise medical practitioners about intersex people and the human rights violations they face.68 1.7. DISCLOSURE ABOUT SEXUAL ORIENTATION, GENDER IDENTITY AND INTERSEX STATUS Every person has the right to privacy in choosing whether or when to disclose their sexual orientation, gender identity or intersex status. 1.7.1. Disclosing sexual orientation A lesbian, gay, bisexual or other sexual minority person who does not disclose their sexual orientation is often described as being \u2018in the closet\u2019 or \u2018closeted\u2019. Telling someone about being lesbian, gay or bisexual is called \u2018coming out\u2019. Openness can counter myths that lesbian, gay and bisexual people do not exist and makes it possible for others to come out too. Each person has the right to decide how much or how little to disclose about their sexual orientation, gender identity and intersex status. In this region and internationally, Pride festivals are one way that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities celebrate their diversity. However, there are still many parts of this region where it is not safe to do this, raising significant concerns about freedom of expression and freedom of assembly.69 In parts of the region where coming out publically is not a safe option, \u2018disclosure\u2019 may be a more appropriate term for describing how someone makes decisions about when it is safe to tell another person about their sexual orientation. 67 Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe, 2015. 68 Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, Violencia contra personas LGBTI, 2015, p. 257; at www.oas.org/es/cidh/informes/ pdfs/ViolenciaPersonasLGBTI.pdf. 69 See Chapter 2. Thoughts and stories of being Being LGBTI by Being LGBTI in Asia. 24 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions 1.7.2. \u2018Being stealth\u2019 about transgender status Many transgender women identify as female and many transgender men identify as male. They may want to be able to live as women and men respectively, without disclosing their past. This is called \u2018being stealth\u2019.70 Sometimes it is assumed that \u2018being stealth\u2019 is the same as when a lesbian, gay or bisexual person is \u2018closeted\u2019 and that transgender people should be more open about their gender identity. However, the two concepts are very different. A transgender person who is stealth is living in their appropriate gender identity \u2013 and choosing not to disclose a previous identity because it does not reflect who they really are. Being stealth may be the only way that a transgender person\u2019s gender identity is respected. 1.7.3. Disclosure of intersex status The term \u2018coming out\u2019 is problematic for many intersex people too. Their intersex status describes their body and is often not linked to their sense of identity. Typically, a person is told the facts about their intersex variation by a doctor or a parent. This is very different from the process of self-definition linked to discovering sexual orientation or gender identity. Disclosing intersex status to others can undermine, rather than affirm, intersex people\u2019s identities as women or as men or as cisgender.71 This is particularly an issue when other people mistakenly assume that all intersex people are a third sex or are transgender. 70 When other people are not aware that a person is transgender, the transgender person is sometimes described as \u2018passing\u2019. This means that they \u2018pass\u2019 as no different from another woman or another man.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "063ea253-f85b-4e3e-9e6a-4ed6b46f8bf7": {"__data__": {"id_": "063ea253-f85b-4e3e-9e6a-4ed6b46f8bf7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "102604194380fdcc720138237930c769b19867d522e1356ba6499401c80841b3"}, "2": {"node_id": "49434483-0a10-440f-a9f5-de049f51dd5f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4020fb6b9b66caa66573a3a8b8af6567a9d5701188407f0e54a5b223549dfb8b"}}, "hash": "179b262b28a829d4dbb936b4556f158d4ce25d97c5d2dd71c89f680826fdfce8", "text": "This means that they \u2018pass\u2019 as no different from another woman or another man.

Many people will not wish to disclose these personal details in a group situation and should never be forced to do so. Some people may choose to disclose this information in a workshop or community consultation but not outside that venue. This means it is very important to remind participants that information shared in discussions is confidential. This includes taking care what name is used to greet someone in future interactions, following that person\u2019s lead. A transgender woman who uses a female name and pronoun at a community consultation may not have disclosed her gender identity to other friends, family or work colleagues. Breaching her privacy could endanger her safety or expose her to discrimination. At the same time, community consultations are a valuable way to increase the visibility of marginalised groups. In this region, many strategies have been used to promote the visibility of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex groups, without disclosing people\u2019s identities. These include photographing some participants from behind or with placards or balloons in front of their faces. During community consultations or workshops, it is often useful to start with an introductory round where each person says one or two things about who they are. This can demonstrate the wide diversity in the room, including if people share other aspects of their lives beyond their lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender identity or intersex status. It also enables people to choose how much, if anything, they wish to disclose. In parts of the region where the local language has different pronouns or terms for women and men, it can be very helpful to ask each person to share their preferred word. This demonstrates awareness that people\u2019s pronouns and gender identity are not always obvious and may change. It can reduce the chance that people will make incorrect assumptions about another participant\u2019s gender identity. This can particularly be an issue for gender non- conforming people, those who have recently started to transition or those who are less visible within a community. For example, in many parts of this region, the invisibility of transgender men is compounded when they are referred to incorrectly as lesbians or by using female terms or the pronoun \u2018she\u2019. 26 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions KEY POINTS: CHAPTER 1 \u2022 Sexual orientation and gender identity are fundamental elements of a person\u2019s identity, while sex characteristics are intrinsic parts of a person\u2019s physical make-up. \u2022 These distinct concepts help to differentiate the impact of discrimination against lesbian, gay and bisexual people because of their sexual orientation, against transgender people because of their gender identity or against intersex people because of their sex characteristics. \u2022 Increasingly, the terms \u2018sexual orientation\u2019, \u2018gender identity\u2019 and \u2018sex characteristics\u2019 are being used by human rights bodies and civil society and listed explicitly as prohibited grounds of discrimination. \u2018Gender expression\u2019 is a separate, but related, term that refers to people\u2019s outward expression of masculinity and/or femininity. \u2022 Many regional identities combine elements of sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or, to a limited extent, sex characteristics. Using these concepts acknowledges both traditional and evolving identities in this region and the common and distinct human rights issues faced by lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people. \u2022 By understanding these concepts and how they apply to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people, NHRIs can choose the most appropriate individual and umbrella terms to use in specific pieces of work. \u2022 Being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex is not a medical illness. Viewing people this way (pathologisation) has increased stigma, discrimination and violence against people, including in medical settings, because of their sexual orientation, gender identity or sex characteristics, \u2022 Every person has the right to choose whether, when and how they disclose their sexual orientation, gender identity or intersex status. By enabling lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people to choose how much they disclose, NHRIs respect people\u2019s privacy and help to create an inclusive environment.

Others may use a variety of different terms to describe their sexual orientation. These may include reclaimed terms that have previously been considered to be derogatory (such as \u2018queer\u2019) and/or culturally or linguistically specific terms. In the region, \u2018gay\u2019 is sometimes used to refer to both gay men and lesbians. This usage can make women invisible and ignore their distinctive experiences. In some countries there is no word for \u2018gay\u2019 and in other cultures being \u2018gay\u2019 or \u2018lesbian\u2019 is seen as a Western phenomenon.72 In this chapter, we use \u2018lesbian, gay and bisexual\u2019 in reference not only to those who identify as gay or lesbian or bisexual but also to those who are attracted to or have a sexual relationship with someone of the same sex. That person may also be transgender or intersex.73 There is no reliable data to indicate what proportion of the world\u2019s population or the Asia Pacific\u2019s population is lesbian, gay or bisexual. Many studies have been undertaken but the results vary widely due to different definitions, measures and research methodologies.74 There is no evidence that lesbian, gay and bisexual people constitute a greater or lesser proportion of the total population in the Asia Pacific region than in any other region and there is no reason to believe that they do. 72 Pacific Sexual Diversity Network, Diverse Voices for Action and Equality and ARC International \u201cOur Voices, our Communities, our Rights: Advancing Human Rights related to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity & Expression in the Pacific\u201d, Report of the Pacific LGBTQI Human Rights Conference, Nuku\u2019alofa, Tonga, 11-14 May 2015, p. 16; at http://arc-international.net/wp-content/ uploads/2015/09/SOGIHR-Report-final.pdf. 73 Some lesbian, gay and bisexual people, including those who are transgender or intersex, prefer to use broader sexual orientation terms that recognise there are more than two \u2018opposite\u2019 sexes or gender identities. Examples include the generic word \u2018queer\u2019 or the term \u2018pansexual\u2019. 74 In statistical research on the number or proportion of people who are lesbian, gay and bisexual, the results depend on whether the question asks about sexual attraction, sexual behaviour or sexual identity, with attraction levels being higher than those who act on that attraction and identity being the lowest figure.

KEY QUESTIONS \u2022 Who are lesbian, gay and bisexual people in the Asia Pacific? \u2022 How do people experience living and relating as lesbian, gay and bisexual? \u2022 What are the issues and concerns for lesbian, gay and bisexual people? \u2022 How does the law treat them? \u2022 Are they able to live their lives in dignity, safety and equality? \u2022 Are they able to enjoy all their human rights? 28 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions If an estimate from the lower end of the range is taken and it is assumed that lesbian, gay and bisexual people constitute about five per cent of any population, then the Asia Pacific region, with 4.4 billion people, would have about 220 million lesbian, gay and bisexual people. \u2026 variation in sexual orientation is ubiquitous, with the great majority identifying as heterosexual and a significant minority reporting other identities. \u2026 patterns of reported sexual identity and behaviour vary with sociodemographic characteristics, such as sex, age and race or ethnicity.

For example, the limited statistical information available about the lesbian population limits the health sector\u2019s ability to monitor the health risks that lesbians face. Reliable data is also often required when agencies are seeking funding to provide services to target specific needs within the community. Lack of data may therefore lead to a lack of funding for community services. No official data is collected about sexual orientation.76 The chapter looks at some of the particular experiences of lesbian, gay and bisexual people in the Asia Pacific region. Three initial comments are required. First, the region is enormous, stretching from the Pacific Island States to the Arab States of West Asia. It is diverse, containing many different political and economic systems and greatly different cultural and religious traditions. Its peoples are at very different stages of economic development, ranging from some of the richest States in the world to some of the poorest. They are also at very different stages of political development. The diversity of the region is reflected in the diversity of experiences of lesbian, gay and bisexual people. Second, the experiences of lesbian, gay and bisexual people differ. Nonetheless, in spite of the great diversity within the region, many aspects of those experiences are common to gay men, lesbians and bisexual people. They experience human rights violations on the basis of their same-sex attraction and activity. A Pacific conference reported: There was commonality across the region about the complete invisibility of lesbians, and how they experience silencing: \u201ceveryone knowing but no one talking about it\u201d. Likewise [men who have sex with men] are forced by their families to get married and have children. This experience was common across Melanesian countries. Situations might arise where a man was forced to get married, and so would get married but continue to have sex with other men secretly.77 75 S.D. Cochran, J. Drescher, E. Kism\u00f6di, A. Giami, C.

Chapter 2: Being lesbian, gay and bisexual in the Asia Pacific | 29 Part I Experiences of being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex in the Asia Pacific Third, as in many other areas of human rights violations, violations perpetrated against lesbian, gay and bisexual people are exacerbated by other factors, such as gender, race, ethnicity, class, economic status and religion.78 This is called \u2018intersectionality\u2019. The nature and severity of the violations can be different where they are based not only on sexual orientation but also on other types of identity or status. The violations can be especially severe where a gay or lesbian or bisexual person is also transgender or intersex. The APF\u2019s Advisory Council of Jurists (ACJ) noted that: \u2026 the identity of each individual is made up of a multitude of components. In addition to sexual orientation and gender identity, other factors include gender, age, nationality, profession, political opinion, religious affiliation and social origin.

For that reason, lesbians and bisexual women are confronted by treatment that is quite specific to them. Violence in particular is experienced differently by women. Lesbians and bisexual women are especially subjected to sexual violence from men because of their sexual orientation. In the Ang Ladlad case, the Chief Justice of the Philippines Supreme Court identified the violence and discrimination experienced by lesbian, gay and bisexual people in the Philippines, which included: \u2022 the murders of gay men \u2022 parents or guardians beating effeminate or gay youth to ensure gender conformity \u2022 fathers allowing lesbian daughters to be raped to cure them \u2022 the use of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6fab6c49-558a-4e4d-af8d-5f6f991ec332": {"__data__": {"id_": "6fab6c49-558a-4e4d-af8d-5f6f991ec332", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "58fea0afc67c7564c122117b530292e91964bf4f7b3582cde40a860147a59b54"}, "3": {"node_id": "6a8e52ae-e34d-4f67-a70e-8923311c2311", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d5416665bf37b981c2ed128069b048fe53ee932425e634087379d075f074a2ce"}}, "hash": "3334c91233dfc985d2849a0da7e1805b510960d4ef0a9276f7b62d37c1279cbf", "text": "an anti-kidnapping law to break up adult consensual same sex partnerships \u2022 the performance of exorcisms and other religious practices to cure lesbian, gay and bisexual persons \u2022 forced psychiatric therapy and counselling to \u2018cure\u2019 young gays and lesbians.80 78 High Commissioner for Human Rights, Discrimination and violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity, 4 May 2015, A/HRC/29/23, para. 42; International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (now OutRight Action International), Violence Through the Lens of Lesbians, Bisexual Women and Trans People in Asia, 2014, p. 2. 79 APF, ACJ Report: Human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity, 2010, pp. 22-23; at www.asiapacificforum.net/resources/ acj-report-sogi/. 80 Ang Ladlad LGBT Party vs. Commission On Elections, G.R.

DIGNITY AND CRIMINALISATION In May 2015, 75 UN member States still criminalised consensual adult same-sex activity.83 That is more than a third of the UN\u2019s membership. The number of criminalising States has been decreasing slowly over the past two or three decades.84 In the Asia Pacific region consensual adult same-sex activity is not criminalised in 25 States and the larger parts of another two States.85 In some it has never been criminalised and in others it has been part of a gradual process of decriminalisation spanning many decades, with Palau the most recent to decriminalise.86 Fiji has moved the furthest, including in its Constitution a specific prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.87 Nonetheless, 31 States and the remaining parts of the other two States in the region continue to criminalise consensual adult same-sex activity.88 Some States are enacting new, more severe legislation in this area.89 Criminalisation today can take many forms. It can be directed to punish: \u2022 certain sexual behaviour, usually same-sex activity \u2022 acting or dressing in ways that do not conform to dominant cultural expectations, including cross dressing, based on an assumption that a feminine man is gay and a masculine woman is lesbian90 \u2022 statements or publications or actions that discuss or refer to lesbian, gay and bisexual people and \u2018gay lifestyles\u2019, often described as \u2018gay propaganda\u2019.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6a8e52ae-e34d-4f67-a70e-8923311c2311": {"__data__": {"id_": "6a8e52ae-e34d-4f67-a70e-8923311c2311", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "58fea0afc67c7564c122117b530292e91964bf4f7b3582cde40a860147a59b54"}, "2": {"node_id": "6fab6c49-558a-4e4d-af8d-5f6f991ec332", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3334c91233dfc985d2849a0da7e1805b510960d4ef0a9276f7b62d37c1279cbf"}}, "hash": "d5416665bf37b981c2ed128069b048fe53ee932425e634087379d075f074a2ce", "text": "Foundational texts in Judaism, Christianity and Islam have passages that have been interpreted as absolute condemnations of consenting sexual acts between men, imposing the death penalty.91 This interpretation passed into the legal systems in European States, initially as part of religious law, then as part of regular criminal law systems.

However, members of the Church would be very against LGBTs due to Church doctrine. Despite this, some priests and nuns cooperate and work together with the LGBT community.

In 2014, a draft law was proposed in Kyrgyzstan \u2013 Law on the formation of a positive attitude toward non-traditional forms of sexual relations \u2013 but it has still not been enacted.104 In 2015, the Kazakhstan Senate passed two draft laws: On Protecting Children from Information Harmful to Their Health and Development and On Amendments and Additions to Several Legal Acts of the Republic of Kazakhstan Concerning the Protection of Children from Information Harmful to Their Health and Development. The draft laws were rejected by the Constitutional Council. These developments in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan, though unsuccessful, reflect a worrying extension to the Asia Pacific region of hostile attitudes towards lesbian, gay and bisexual people found in Russia and some States in Africa. In addition, other criminal laws can be misused to target lesbian, gay and bisexual people. The ACJ, in its report on human rights in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity in the Asia Pacific region, found that, in addition to laws directly criminalising same-sex sexual conduct between consenting adults, a range of other laws containing criminal sanctions have been used to target people of diverse sexual orientations. The ACJ highlighted laws relating to vagrancy, public nuisance, national security, public morality, obscenity, indecency and public order.

CASE STUDY: DECRIMINALISATION OF CONSENTING ADULT SAME-SEX CONDUCT Under the old Crimes Act 1961, indecency between males and sodomy were offences. However in 2009, the Crimes Act underwent its first review by the Law Reform Commission of Samoa. In the review, the Commission supported repealing all criminal penalties attaching to sodomy and related acts conducted in private between consenting adult males. The Commission was of the view that such legalisation was essential to meet a number of international human rights, including non-discrimination on the basis of gender and sexual preference, and respect for personal privacy. The review resulted in the current Crimes Act 2013. Sodomy still remains an offence, however its provision was redrafted in a way not to criminalise acts conducted in private between consenting adult males. Furthermore, the offence of indecency between males was repealed.103 34 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions According to the High Commissioner for Human Rights: States that criminalize consensual homosexual acts are in breach of international human rights law since these laws, by their mere existence, violate the rights to privacy and non-discrimination. Arrests and the detention of individuals on charges relating to sexual orientation and gender identity \u2013 including offences not directly related to sexual conduct, such as those pertaining to physical appearance or so-called \u201cpublic scandal\u201d \u2013 are discriminatory and arbitrary.106 Indirectly, these laws have a \u2018chilling\u2019 effect, even if not enforced, by oppressing lesbian, gay and bisexual people and suppressing their enjoyment of their human rights. They place lesbian, gay and bisexual people at risk of harassment, intimidation and exploitation and they expose them to violence from others. Human rights mechanisms continue to emphasize links between criminalization and homophobic \u2026 hate crimes, police abuse, torture, family and community violence and stigmatization, as well as the constraints that criminalization put on the work of human rights defenders. The Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief has noted that these laws may give a pretext to vigilante groups and other perpetrators of hatred for intimidating people and committing acts of violence.107 The laws have these effects whether or not they are enforced. The Human Rights Committee made this point in Toonen v Australia when it found in favour of Mr Toonen, even though Australia, in its defence, said that the law was not enforced.108 The ACJ reported: \u2026 even where such laws are not regularly enforced, their very existence continues to affect adversely the enjoyment of rights by people of diverse sexual orientations ... As the Delhi High Court stated: \u201cThe criminalisation of homosexuality condemns in perpetuity a sizable section of society and forces them to live their lives in the shadow of harassment, exploitation, humiliation, cruel and degrading treatment at the hand of the law enforcement machinery \u2026 Even without actual enforcement, [such] laws serve to stigmatise an entire section of society, thereby violating their dignity as citizens\u201d.109 The continued existence of the law also leads to violation of other human rights. The United Nations has frequently expressed concern about the criminalization of same-sex relationships. In addition to violating basic rights, criminalization legitimizes prejudice in society at large and exposes people to hate crimes, police abuse, torture and family violence. As the World Health Organization (WHO) and The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) have shown, criminalization also has a dire effect on public health, especially on efforts to prevent the spread of HIV. It can, for example, deter some of those most at risk of infection from coming forward for testing and treatment out of fear of being deemed a criminal.110 Criminalisation can also endanger the work of those who defend the human rights of lesbian, gay and bisexual people, by exposing them to attacks and intimidation. For that reason, the High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for States to fulfil their legal duty to protect lesbian, gay and bisexual people from violence and discrimination by repealing laws that criminalise same-sex conduct and other laws used to punish lesbian, gay and bisexual people.111 106 High Commissioner for Human Rights, Discrimination and violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity, 4 May 2015, A/HRC/29/23, para.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d933ab0f-2b51-4110-9c6d-7819aeffb423": {"__data__": {"id_": "d933ab0f-2b51-4110-9c6d-7819aeffb423", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "064410156ec7ea9b61ea7441bbcb9ee9c08970777f2a4ac5bd92e8432d77c5f8"}, "2": {"node_id": "392d3849-55e3-4752-93cb-d6d2c826c66e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ac60a0cf2dc60e57b181709969599a8d7ffbfddb0f19477e838d532e57d979c8"}}, "hash": "2554a65c17bd772d1ab6a19a292accbe27b533c7f21c915b2ac5ba7fade71b0b", "text": "43; at www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/HRC/29/23&referer=/ english/&Lang=E. 107 Ibid, para. 45. 108 Human Rights Committee, Toonen v Australia, 4 April 1994, CCPR/C/50/D/488/1992, para. 8.2. 109 APF, ACJ Report: Human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity, 2010, p. 20 at www.asiapacificforum.net/resources/acj- report-sogi/.

Chapter 2: Being lesbian, gay and bisexual in the Asia Pacific | 35 Part I Experiences of being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex in the Asia Pacific States have the legal obligation under international human rights law to safeguard the human rights of all persons, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity or intersex status. Criminalizing private sexual relationships between consenting adults, whether the relationships are same-sex or different-sex, is a violation of the right to privacy and a form of discrimination. In addition to violating basic rights, this criminalization legitimizes hostile attitudes towards LGBTI people, feeding stigma, violence and discrimination in areas such as education, employment, housing and health care.112 2.3. SAFETY AND VIOLENCE The existence of criminal laws against lesbian, gay and bisexual people increases the risk of violence but, even where there are no criminal laws, lesbian, gay and bisexual people encounter significantly greater risks of being subjected to violence than other people. Individually and as a group, lesbian, gay and bisexual people are marginalised and often targeted for violence on the basis of their sexual orientation alone. The High Commissioner for Human Rights has reported that UN human rights mechanisms continue to receive reports from all regions of homophobic violence: both physical violence, including murder, beatings, kidnapping and sexual assault; and psychological violence, including threats, coercion and the arbitrary deprivation of liberty, such as forced psychiatric incarceration. Violence can occur in public settings, including by religious extremists, paramilitary groups and extreme nationalists, or in family and community settings. The High Commissioner for Human Rights reported that homophobic violence: \u2026 is often particularly brutal, and in some instances characterized by levels of cruelty exceeding that of other hate crimes. Violent acts include deep knife cuts, anal rape and genital mutilation, as well as stoning and dismemberment.113 Well-documented studies in many countries and regions have revealed high levels of murder based on sexual orientation. The Government of Brazil, which reports annually on homophobic violence, recorded 310 murders in 2012 alone.114 The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights reported 594 hate- related killings of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons in the 25 States members of the Organization of American States between January 2013 and March 2014.115 The High Commissioner for Human Rights reported that \u2018hate-motivated killings\u2019 of lesbian, gay and bisexual people have been documented in all regions.116 He instanced the report on a visit to Mexico by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions who noted \u2018grotesque homicides\u2019 perpetrated with broad impunity, allegedly at times \u2018with the suspected complicity of investigative authorities\u2019.117 112 OHCHR, Information sheet: Frequently Asked Questions: Sexual orientation, gender identity and intersex status in the Pacific, August 2015, p. 2; at www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/UNFE_PacificCampaignInfoSheet-Aug2015.pdf. 113 High Commissioner for Human Rights, Discrimination and violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity, 4 May 2015, A/HRC/29/23, paras. 21-23; at www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/HRC/29/23&referer=/ english/&Lang=E.

Thoughts and stories of being Being LGBTI by Being LGBTI in Asia. Chapter 2: Being lesbian, gay and bisexual in the Asia Pacific | 37 Part I Experiences of being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex in the Asia Pacific The family was the primary perpetrator of violence according to LBT people in Asia. Family members carried out emotional, verbal, physical and sexual violence against LBT people. This violence occurred regularly and had greater and longer lasting impact than violence perpetrated by nonfamily members. LBT people in Asia reported an unexpectedly high occurrence of intimate partner violence, including physical and sexual violence. Perpetrators of partner violence were same-sex partners, dating partners, and heterosexual and cisgender partners of transgender individuals. There were also reports of spousal violence by heterosexual husbands of lesbians in forced marriages.125 Women in the Pacific also reported experiences of violence. \u2026 there are specific challenges faced by women, particularly silence within Pacific communities about lesbians, and violence towards lesbian women, often in the family sphere or domestic sphere. We remind Governments of Pacific Island Countries and Territories that they have responsibility to protect [lesbian, gay and bisexual] communities from human rights abuses like physical and sexual violation, and discrimination.126 Bullying of lesbian, gay and bisexual children is a form of violence. It is a particular concern because of the long-term impact it can have on them. Delegates to a Pacific conference gave accounts of serious bullying of lesbian, gay and bisexual students in secondary school. This led to young people leaving the education system before completing their qualification and included ongoing verbal, sexual and physical assault. The outcomes of this bullying range from driving young people to engage in sex work, as they lack qualifications for other employment, or worse, they commit suicide.127 Bullying of lesbian, gay and bisexual students seems to be endemic throughout the Asia Pacific region. Evidence from India and Bangladesh indicates 50 percent of homosexual men experienced harassment in school or college. In a 2012 survey conducted in China, 77 percent of [lesbian, gay and bisexual] students suffered at least one form of bullying.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3520b594-afed-4e4c-adcc-130ba203de40": {"__data__": {"id_": "3520b594-afed-4e4c-adcc-130ba203de40", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b0c9eed4e68a20490116a232fce55fbe6fc2c6684754838fee45ced6b6dd1992"}, "2": {"node_id": "31647a8f-8c5d-459e-a466-57b17f62aa60", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "89c36783fad067806007c2c9d5ced9b9cbef3ccf967e171d1eba9b6b2a95dead"}}, "hash": "1c52d0527334fe72ab31f29081ca1867884b0f95677f76a210601c83e2cb1fe5", "text": "In Thailand, a survey found one-third of [lesbian, gay and bisexual] students had been physically harassed and one-quarter sexually harassed.

The Being LGBT in Asia China and Viet Nam country reports noted that same-sex rape is not considered a specific offence in these countries.131 Similarly, sexual assault laws in India, Japan, Nepal and Pakistan only apply where the perpetrator is male and the victim is female. The Mongolia report expressed the concern that the law on domestic violence would not cover same-sex couples. It also described reports of assaults against [lesbian, gay and bisexual] people perpetrated by police authorities.132 The Thailand report described the lack of protective laws, despite a high level of violent incidents corrective rape of lesbians by female relatives and brutal murders of lesbians in the 2000s.133 State obligations under international human rights law include the obligation to protect human rights. International human rights mechanisms have said repeatedly that the State bears responsibility for human rights violations perpetrated by non-State actors where the State has failed to provide an adequate level of protection. Family and relationship violence has been signalled out repeatedly for specific mention in this respect. Lesbian, gay and bisexual people are more reluctant than most to report violence to the police because of the fear of exposure of their sexual orientation or even worse treatment on the basis of their sexual orientation. These concerns are likely to be heightened for lesbians and bisexual women, including in communities where women are blamed for violence against them. Similarly, lesbian, gay and bisexual sex workers may be very reluctant to approach police about sexual assaults, particularly if sex work is criminalised. 130 UNDP, Leave no one behind: Advancing social, economic, cultural, and political inclusion of LGBTI people in Asia and the Pacific, 2016 forthcoming. 131 UNDP and USAID, Being LGBT in Asia: China Country Report, p. 8; UNDP, Being LGBT in Asia: Viet Nam Country Report, p. 36. 132 UNDP and USAID, Being LGBT in Asia: Mongolia Country Report, pp 19 and 21. 133 UNDP and USAID, Being LGBT in Asia: Thailand Country Report, p. 43.

The China country report noted that \u201cmany mental health practitioners, often pushed by the families of [lesbian, gay and bisexual] people, recommend or impose \u2018corrective treatment\u2019 on [lesbian, gay and bisexual] people, sometimes involving involuntary committal to psychiatric hospital wards.\u201d139 The Indonesia report refers to a regulation of the Ministry of Social Affairs that authorizes welfare authorities to round up people whose sexual behaviour is considered to cause them to be unable to function socially (including \u2026 gay men and lesbians) for the purposes of \u2018rehabilitation\u2019 and integration into society.140 These practices are discriminatory on the basis of sexual orientation because a heterosexual person would not be subjected to them. Medical experts, including psychiatric experts, now accept that homosexuality or same-sex attraction is not an illness and should not be treated as an illness. Those who are subjected to so-called \u2018curative\u2019 therapies for their same-sex attraction are subjected to treatment to which people attracted to the opposite sex would not be subjected. Further, \u2018conversion\u2019 therapies are now accepted to \u2018have no scientific basis and are rejected by medical authorities\u2019.141 Being LGBT in Asia also identified the specific health care needs of lesbians and bisexual women: Lesbian and bisexual women experience health inequalities, largely related to experiences of discrimination and homophobia.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c39bf2b0-24bc-4586-9d2e-cb6013c9befe": {"__data__": {"id_": "c39bf2b0-24bc-4586-9d2e-cb6013c9befe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2101b4699baac29a736019ff22793186875aa8d653079ce0bf39002d7fee0526"}, "2": {"node_id": "b36c4053-ed7f-41a4-8b9e-ab02792ea0e8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ff19a55ca11f5601201e98a8abcca5b21eb8aba985a304ff149de5996e769109"}}, "hash": "9010bcb4edc1c3e96ed2745a3eb6651d1c82896daef948203c3c1485c44d50c6", "text": "These issues can lead to avoidance of routine healthcare and screening and reduced disclosure of sexual orientation within consultations. \u2026 It is apparent that lesbian women\u2019s health issues are systematically ignored and there is a clear need for further research to inform improved understanding of health needs and appropriate approaches to service delivery.

Lesbian, gay and bisexual people can suffer violations of their rights at the hands of their families, by being confined to the home, isolated socially and subjected to violence, or by being evicted from the family home and so deprived of housing. They then encounter discrimination in seeking and retaining housing.145 Landlords can discriminate by refusing rental accommodation and financial institutions may refuse loans to purchase housing. Discrimination based on sexual orientation can lead to poverty for lesbian, gay and bisexual people and can trap them in poverty. Different treatment in relation to relationship recognition is a more complex issue and international law is not clear on the issue.146 Domestic laws in this region take a variety of approaches, including to: \u2022 authorise marriage between two persons of the same sex on the same basis as between two persons of opposite sexes \u2022 recognise same-sex relationships civilly for certain purposes, such as property ownership, guardianship of children, next of kin status and inheritance \u2022 deny any form of recognition of or legal status to same-sex relationships. 144 Ibid, para. 66. 145 International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (now OutRight Action International), Violence on the basis of Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Gender Expression Against Non-Heteronormative Women in Asia 2012; at http://iglhrc.org/sites/ default/files/386-1_0.pdf. 146 The international legal issues are discussed in Chapter 6 in the context of the Yogyakarta Principles.

These rights are especially relevant for the work of lesbian, gay and bisexual human rights defenders and activists. Acting to promote and protect the human rights of lesbian, gay and bisexual people, these defenders often have higher visibility than other lesbian, gay and bisexual people and are therefore more vulnerable to retributive action when they exercise their rights to expression, assembly and association. The ACJ has pointed to the importance of these rights for lesbian, gay and bisexual people and to their restriction in the Asia Pacific region: Freedom of expression, assembly and association are of fundamental importance to people of diverse sexual orientation and gender identity as they facilitate participation and recognition within the body politic, as well as access to information about their rights within the community. Such rights are also crucial in supporting human rights defenders promoting the rights of [lesbian, gay and bisexual] people. They are also fundamental to the success of governmental and community programs that promote and support basic human rights such as the rights to employment, education and health. Within the Asia Pacific region, police and security forces, as well as religious and community groups have sought to limit the ability of [lesbian, gay and bisexual] people to enjoy such rights particularly through the use of laws dealing with public order, public nuisance and public morality, but also through harassment and intimidation.150 147 International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA); State Sponsored Homophobia 2015: A world survey of laws: criminalisation, protection and recognition of same-sex love, May 2015, p. 41.

In addition, lesbians and bisexual women have distinct experiences, arising from their situation as women that must be taken into account in ensuring respect for their human rights. \u2022 Criminal laws targeting lesbian, gay and bisexual people have both direct and indirect effects on their enjoyment of their human rights. Whether enforced or not, they undermine the dignity of lesbian, gay and bisexual people. \u2022 Individually and as a group, lesbian, gay and bisexual people are marginalised and often targeted for violence on the basis of their sexual orientation. The State often fails to ensure their safety. \u2022 Discrimination based on sexual orientation is evident in all countries. It denies the equality of lesbian, gay and bisexual people. \u2022 Lesbian, gay and bisexual human rights defenders are often targeted because of their advocacy.

INTRODUCTION Transgender people exist in all parts of the Asia Pacific region, though they may use culturally specific, traditional, indigenous or local terms to describe their identity.154 In some parts of the region, there is a long history of celebrating gender diversity, with transgender people given specific roles in spiritual, ceremonial or healing rituals. These roles typically recognise someone born male who embodies the spirit of a woman or of both sexes. In all parts of the region, transgender women and/or hijras, warias, metis and others who identify as a third gender remain the most visible within transgender communities. In a number of Pacific countries, there are local cultures that allow persons assigned to the male sex at birth to identify as women. Many agree that the term \u2018transgender\u2019 is often a too narrow concept to embrace the full-lived experiences in the Pacific cultures. The fa\u2019afafine of Samoa, American Samoa and Tokelau, the leiti of Tonga, the fakafifine of Niue, the pinapinaaine of Tuvalu and Kiribati, the vakasalewalewa of Fiji, the palopa of Papua New Guinea, and the akava\u2019ine of the Cook Islands are diverse gender identities that existed long before the Pacific was colonised and they are important parts of the cultural treasure of the region.155 Until relatively recently, transgender men, or those who identify on a trans masculine spectrum, were invisible in this region. However, in many countries in Asia, the number of transgender men has grown dramatically over the last five years and community groups have been established, particularly online. Yet their overall visibility remains low within both transgender organisations and in the wider community.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "56eab748-6414-4284-89c2-73cec931e44c": {"__data__": {"id_": "56eab748-6414-4284-89c2-73cec931e44c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fd316327ffdd0bed43a58a8c543b351ad76b4b6e015038ea7aa845dc20b18719"}, "2": {"node_id": "144100f8-1e6c-46a6-820f-1dd915f6ddf2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ffcf2aed95f42a24a8ee74da8225706fcd81e6f2973a6a39de11b3fe62aa01a8"}}, "hash": "298bbb71b2ce002263260e3209ef0a2f694073f370eebd3a9aadf8d943bff6ec", "text": "Yet their overall visibility remains low within both transgender organisations and in the wider community.

One 2012 estimate is that transgender people make up 0.3 percent of the adult population in the Asia Pacific.156 Using 2010 United Nations population data, this equates to at least nine million transgender people. This proportion broadly matches some community-based estimates of the number of hijras or transgender women in some parts of Asia. However, the number and proportion of young people describing themselves as transgender or gender questioning is growing at a fast rate in many parts of the region, suggesting that this estimate is increasingly conservative. For example, a 2012 nationally representative survey of 8,166 high school students in New Zealand found that 1.2 percent reported being transgender and 2.5 percent reported not being sure about their gender.157 3.2. VIOLENCE All people, including transgender people, have the right to security of the person and to protection by the State against violence. Internationally, including across this region, transgender people face high levels of violence. Gender-based violence provides a useful lens to understand violence directed against transgender people, whether they identify as female or male or as a third gender. Like other forms of gender-based violence, transphobic violence stems from gender norms and stereotypes, enforced by unequal power dynamics. In a climate of criminalisation, where law enforcement agencies themselves perpetrate violence with impunity, it is not surprising that violence against transgender people goes unreported or is inadequately investigated. In this region and globally, transgender organisations have attempted to monitor the most extreme forms of violence, when transgender people have been killed because of their gender identity. The vast majority of those murdered are transgender women. The global Trans Murder Monitoring project has identified 174 transgender people killed because of their gender identity, across 16 countries in Asia, in the seven years between January 2008 and September 2015.158 Lack of monitoring means these publically reported cases represent a fraction of such hate crimes. The highest numbers of identified deaths were in India (53), the Philippines (37), Pakistan (34) and Thailand (14). The per capita rate of reported killings is particularly high in the Philippines, where civil society groups actively monitor these murders, including the high-profile killing of transgender woman Jennifer Laude on 11 October 2014. In 2013, the Philippines Commission on Human Rights signed a Memorandum of Understanding with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community organisations that included a commitment to address these killings.159 Most studies in this region have focused on violence against transgender women, including hijras, metis and kathoey. They have documented high rates of sexual and physical violence, including in Cambodia, Bangladesh, Thailand, Mongolia, Fiji and Papua New Guinea.160 Researchers have noted atrocious levels of brutality, including mutilation of transgender women\u2019s bodies.161 156 S.

Photo by OutRight Action International. 48 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions Emerging research in this region and internationally suggests that people who are born female and grow up to identify as gender non-confirming or trans masculine face high levels of violence and abuse within the family. This abuse is directed at both masculine lesbians and transgender boys and young men and includes corrective rape and forced marriage.163 It remains invisible and unreported when States do not legislate against family and domestic violence and leave families to enforce social norms, standards of respectability and morality. There are, however, examples of courts providing legal redress for transgender people escaping violence. An October 2015 Delhi High Court decision upheld the rights of a 19 year old Indian transgender man to self-determination and dignity. Shivy Bhat had been abused by his family in California and then on a visit to India was detained by other family members who confiscated his passport and United States green card.164 A 2014 study on violence against transgender people, lesbians, and bisexual women in Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines and Sri Lanka included four specific recommendations for NHRIs. These called on NHRIs to: \u2022 investigate and document this violence \u2022 ensure that complaints mechanisms and reporting procedures are safe and do not result in recriminations, including criminalisation \u2022 report violence to UN entities \u2022 recommend preventive and reparative action to redress it.165 3.3. DISCRIMINATION 3.3.1. Direct discrimination Transphobia is the dislike of or prejudice against someone who is, or is assumed to be, transgender.166 Transphobia fuels discrimination and stigma against transgender people, based on their actual or perceived gender identity or expression. 167 Direct discrimination against transgender people is very high and often unquestioned. In many communities, it is commonplace for transgender people to be ridiculed. This is reinforced by their portrayal in the media, derogatory terms used to describe transgender people and inappropriate references made to intimate parts of their bodies. Many of these terms and references dehumanise transgender people and are an invasion of their privacy. 163 Common Language Summary Report: Domestic Violence against Lesbian and Bisexual Women in China, 2009; International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (now Outright Action International), 2014; M.

Transgender people fear discrimination if their past identity is disclosed. They are caught between two hard situations. On the one hand, they can disclose their past and not have their self-defined identity acknowledged and respected. On the other, they can choose to be \u2018stealth\u2019 and be accused of deceit if details of their past are revealed. Many transgender people do not have a choice, as they are unable to amend their name or sex details on documents, or they may not be free to change their appearance so that they are recognised in their appropriate gender identity. Transgender people are routinely rejected by their families and excluded from participating in their cultural or religious communities. Discrimination impacts severely on their rights to education, work, adequate housing and access to health and other social services. Many live in poverty on the margins of society. As a result, transgender women are much more likely than the general adult population to be living with HIV. In this region, the term social exclusion has been used to describe the cumulative impact of this marginalisation.168 School is not safe for many transgender young people. Initial attention to homophobic school bullying has helped draw attention to the specific nature of transphobic bullying directed at transgender or gender non-conforming students.169 This includes concerns about the often undocumented vulnerability of both gender non-conforming female students and transgender boys.170 In May 2012, the Philippines Department of Education issued an order to protect children from any violence, abuse or exploitation at school because of their gender identity or sexual orientation. A recent international study found that 35 of 100 transgender people surveyed in the Philippines had been sexually harassed or attacked in school. Of the approximately 200 transgender people surveyed both in West Bengal, India, and in Thailand, 48 per cent and 29 per cent respectively had experienced sexual violence from other students. Even in Tonga, where there is a wider community acceptance, 28 per cent of the 102 leiti surveyed had experienced violence and 13 per cent reported sexual violence.171 168 UNDP, Hijras / Transgender Women in India: HIV, Human Rights and Social Exclusion, 2010. 169 UNESCO, From Insult to Inclusion: Asia-Pacific report on school bullying, violence and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, 2015; at http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235414E.pdf. 170 UNESCO, Asia-Pacific Consultation on School Bullying based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity/Expression: Meeting Report, 15-17 June 2015, Bangkok, Thailand. 171 C.

NHRIs can make it clear that transgender people have the right to freedom from discrimination whether or not they disclose their past, are stealth or live openly as a transgender, third gender or gender non-conforming person. 50 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions Violence is one of the main factors forcing transgender people out of school or home at a young age, leaving them to look for ways to survive. In some parts of South Asia, there are traditional entertainment or ritualistic roles for hijras and other third sex communities. However these do not necessarily provide a livelihood. Even transgender people who complete their schooling frequently struggle to get a job, either because they are do not fit gender norms for men and women or their school qualifications, job references or identity documents disclose their gender identity. There are very high rates of unemployment, under- employment and occupational segregation among transgender people. They face barriers at all stages of the employment cycle, from initial education and training, pre-employment discrimination, limited career opportunities and advancement, and inferior employment conditions. For example, research in Thailand has found discrimination based on gender identity and expression is common for transgender people and also for masculine lesbians (toms).172 These groups are often excluded from mainstream employment, especially in the civil service. Transgender women are ghettoised in a limited number of stereotypical jobs, such as cabaret performers, makeup artists, cosmetics sales assistants and public relations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "21ab0ccd-6967-441e-9538-d1c263696992": {"__data__": {"id_": "21ab0ccd-6967-441e-9538-d1c263696992", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c1070069b6c4f81e4bfa33632b6bfa65a4e08d018eb96bbd5b91769503c36a64"}, "2": {"node_id": "a3736c53-4b26-414f-801d-e4a60b44e22a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a30aa1a522c84df992f32741eb85b4065bfb7328561d7e2aee62f6eaac6e6365"}}, "hash": "7c320d7ea9af6f6acd56286845c9aecdc6a113769b32de844a19210225c182af", "text": "This occupational segregation is reinforced when transgender people leave the formal labour market to find jobs where they can be themselves, working in NGOs or running their own small business.

There is less research on the employment experiences of transgender men. However, many will have been raised as females, which may mean less access to formal education and greater unpaid caring responsibilities within the family. This may include being forced to marry at a young age to lighten the demands on limited family resources. All these factors are likely to limit their ability to access decent work. 3.3.2. Indirect discrimination Indirect discrimination against transgender people occurs when an apparently neutral policy or practice has the effect of disadvantaging transgender people. It is a common experience for transgender people. Changing name details Many organisations have a blanket policy that documents, such as academic qualifications or citizenship certificates, will be not be reissued if someone changes their name. Often the rationale is that a requirement to do so would be prohibitively expensive because of the number of women who change 172 International Labour Organization, Gender Identity and Sexual Orientation: Promoting Rights, Diversity and Equality in the World of Work (PRIDE) Project, 2014. Thoughts and stories of being Being LGBTI by Being LGBTI in Asia.

These policies have a disproportionate negative impact on transgender people. Transgender people who are unable to update their name on their school or tertiary qualifications are forced to choose between having no academic qualifications and disclosing their gender identity. School policies and practices In this region, schools commonly require students to wear distinct school uniforms, including hairstyle, with different requirements for boys and girls. These policies can indirectly discriminate against transgender students when they are disciplined for wearing a uniform that matches their gender identity or expression. This punishment includes being excluded from school or denied the right to sit exams. Girls-only and boys-only toilets and changing rooms are often particularly unsafe spaces for transgender students. In response, anecdotal evidence includes examples of transgender students self-medicating to prevent themselves from needing to urinate during school hours. These policies and practices create significant barriers for transgender students, with implications for their future educational choices and employment options.173 Changes in some countries across the region have been forthcoming. In 2008, a secondary school in Thailand introduced a unisex toilet after a survey found 200 students at the school were kathoey or transgender.174 Education officials in India and Japan have made policy commitments to address some of the barriers faced by transgender learners and to support higher education through tertiary scholarships for transgender students.175 School anti-bullying guidelines in New Zealand emphasise the vulnerability and support needed by transgender students, including the importance of offering gender- neutral school uniforms and unisex bathrooms.176 Conscription Thailand, Singapore and South Korea require all males to be available for military service. This policy can have a disproportionate impact on transgender women\u2019s safety and dignity, both during the selection process and if they are selected for military service.177 While exemption processes exist in each country, concerns have been raised that they are applied in a discretionary way and may undermine transgender people\u2019s right to privacy. This is particularly the case when chest examinations are undertaken in public, including for transgender women who have had breast surgery. Exemption categories are typically based on psychiatric diagnoses and have been criticised as stigmatising, with implications for transgender people\u2019s future employment record. In South Korea a diagnosis of gender dysphoria on its own may not be sufficient to gain an exemption and proof of surgery may be required. Fear of military service has driven some transgender women to undergo early orchiectomies (removal of testicles) to avoid conscription. It is against human rights standards to require or coerce anyone to undergo medical procedures, including those that result in sterilisation, without their consent. In Thailand, transgender women can obtain an exemption based on having Gender Identity Disorder. The Asia Pacific Transgender Network and the Thai Transgender Alliance have developed a video and an accessible illustrated manual for transgender people and recruitment officers about military conscription, based on human rights standards.178 173 UNESCO, Asia-Pacific Consultation on School Bullying based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity/Expression: Meeting Report, 15-17 June 2015, Bangkok, Thailand.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cab9203d-297c-4de6-b819-4e844d7eb6ca": {"__data__": {"id_": "cab9203d-297c-4de6-b819-4e844d7eb6ca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2accb3459b20247d0e5449d2324fb5400721e5d633c568b5cb897d6091c376df"}, "2": {"node_id": "cb53d10e-3b49-41dc-8a3f-a7ca5f897460", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c333970fed4fb836612aae9ca389d9a5acb708467b3fd98eebf176bba2f1670d"}}, "hash": "bb5b566f0723539ce9b57fe33f712291c54d55933fc2cd45babbdbc085c14632", "text": "174 P.

Anti-discrimination laws Few countries in the Asia Pacific region explicitly prohibit discrimination on the grounds of gender identity or gender expression. This leaves transgender people vulnerable to exclusion, violence and extortion. In 2012, Tonga agreed to a recommendation of the Human Rights Council\u2019s Universal Periodic Review to \u201cexamine the possibility of strengthening measures to eliminate discriminatory treatment\u201d based on gender identity or sexual orientation. In 2013, Fiji introduced the first anti-discrimination protections for transgender people in the Pacific, with gender identity and expression included in the new Constitution.179 In 2013, Australia added gender identity as a prohibited ground of discrimination under its federal law on sex discrimination.180 In September 2015, Thailand passed the Gender Equality Act.181 Section 3 of the Act defines unfair gender discrimination to include discrimination based on a person being \u2018of a different appearance from his or her own sex by birth\u2019. While gender identity is not a separate prohibited ground of discrimination in New Zealand, the Human Rights Commission accepts complaints from transgender people under the ground of sex.182 In Mongolia, revisions to Criminal Code in December 2015 specifically include sexual orientation and gender identity as prohibited grounds of discrimination. These provisions come into effect from September 2016. In the Philippines, strong civil society efforts have resulted in a series of local ordinances, starting in Cebu City in 2012, that include gender identity and sexual orientation as prohibited grounds of discrimination. The Philippines Commission on Human Rights has expressed its support for a national anti-discrimination bill to address these issues.183 In the absence of such a law, the Commission has not been able to hold private companies accountable for discrimination against transgender employees or job applicants. In India, anti-discrimination provisions for transgender people have been proposed in both the 2014 Rights of Transgender Persons Bill and in the Government\u2019s December 2015 revised bill. In September 2015, the Nepal\u2019s new Constitution was finalised. Gender and sexual minorities are listed as disadvantaged groups recognised by the Constitution under article 18 that sets out the right to equality.184 This inclusion follows a 2007 Supreme Court ruling that called for anti-discrimination laws. Many countries in this region have no dedicated agency to tackle employment discrimination on the basis of gender identity. In countries with anti-discrimination laws, NHRIs can usefully clarify how these apply to transgender people. For example, as a result of its Transgender Inquiry, the New Zealand Human Rights Commission worked with government officials to produce a 2011 resource for employers and workers on transgender people\u2019s rights at work.185 179 Section 26(3)(a) of the 2013 Constitution of the Republic of Fiji. Sexual orientation is also listed as a prohibited ground of discrimination. 180 The Sex Discrimination Amendment (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Intersex Status) Act 2013 added gender identity, intersex status and sexual orientation as prohibited grounds of discrimination under the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. This was in addition to a range of existing provisions in states and territories prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. 181 Gender Equality Act BE 2558 (2015). An informal English language translation is available at www.hrw.org/news/2015/09/21/ thailand-gender-equality-act. 182 This is supported by a 2006 Crown Law opinion. The New Zealand Human Rights Commission\u2019s Transgender Inquiry recommended that the Human Rights Act 1993 should be amended to state clearly that \u2018sex\u2019 includes gender identity. 183 UNDP, Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia and the Pacific, 2015. 184 Unofficial translation provided by Blue Diamond Society, Nepal. Article 42 (Social Justice) also lists \u2018gender and sexual minorities\u2019 among groups that will have the right to participate in state mechanisms and public services based on the \u2018principle of inclusion\u2019. 185 Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Transgender People at Work, 2011; at http://employment.govt.nz/er/ minimumrights/transgender/Transgenderpeople.pdf.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c0e96835-9547-4ade-b975-fd017a0b0f44": {"__data__": {"id_": "c0e96835-9547-4ade-b975-fd017a0b0f44", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5bd633f0ddc7dbf3f85db96e94fe7d35cd69fae3ba09c5ab1ef454ff90a8b47f"}, "2": {"node_id": "48e31d30-f496-4b2a-89bd-6fe37c3243ee", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "55bddc9b752c6a5dfa064aa4edea91a8a33800916c611ddc65fb277509a07e26"}}, "hash": "91cab1c13143ec21c8b5efd55f2854c0ff272e05ab7959965e8ecf049e7861f5", "text": "Chapter 3: Being transgender in Asia and the Pacific | 53 Part I Experiences of being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex in the Asia Pacific 186 187 In 2015, the Government of Bangladesh unveiled a series of special measures for hijras, including jobs as traffic police officers and loans for members of the community.

CRIMINALISATION In many parts of Asia, including Thailand, Singapore, Cambodia, Nepal and the Philippines, public nuisance, vagrancy or related laws have been used to harass transgender women arbitrarily. In addition, in Indonesia and Malaysia, religious police have authority under religious laws to arrest transgender people under similar provisions.189 Further, in Malaysia, arrests can also be made under state-level shari\u2019a laws that only apply to Muslims. The Cambodia Center for Human Rights has documented police extortion of transgender people under the authority of the Village and Commune Safety Policy 2011. There is no guidance for law enforcers or the public about appropriate use of this executive edict from the Ministry of Interior.190 Transgender women who have sex with men may still be detained and prosecuted under laws criminalising homosexuality, even though they identify as women. In countries where sex work is criminalised, transgender women are frequently targeted under these provisions. Laws prohibiting cross-dressing still exist in some countries in the Asia Pacific region. Some have provisions against \u2018female impersonation\u2019 and a minority also prohibit \u2018male impersonation\u2019, including in some states in Malaysia. In other parts of the region there have been recent successes in challenging such laws. In the Pacific, Samoa repealed its cross-dressing provision in March 2013.191 In November 2014, the Court of Appeal of Malaysia declared that cross-dressing provisions in the shari\u2019a law of Negeri Sembilan state were unconstitutional.192 The civil society group Justice for Sisters had argued that the provision violated six articles of Malaysia\u2019s Constitution, relating to freedom of expression, 186 See www.nhrc.org.bd/PDF/NHRC%20Manual%20(English)%20(1).pdf. 187 See www.asia-pacific.undp.org/content/rbap/en/home/ourwork/democratic-governance-and-peacebuilding/successstories/ engaging-with-national-human-rights-institutions-key-to-advancin.html. 188 See http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/7/2/bangladesh-hijras-angry-over-gender-testing-for-government-positions. html. 189 Human Rights Watch, \u201cI\u2019m Scared to Be a Woman\u201d: Human Rights Abuses Against Transgender People in Malaysia, 2014. 190 UNDP and USAID, Being LGBT in Asia: Cambodia Country Report, 2014. 191 Crimes Ordinance Act, s. 58N. 192 Syariah Criminal (Negeri Sembilan) Enactment 1992, s. 66. CASE STUDY: RESPONDING TO DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT In 2013, the Bandhu Social Welfare Society worked closely with the National Human Rights Commission of Bangladesh (JAMAKON) to initiate a telephone legal help service. JAMAKON has developed a manual for gender and sexual minorities, explaining its role and work on sexual orientation and gender identity issues, and encouraging people to file complaints if they face discrimination.186 In January 2015, JAMAKON succeeded in securing legal redress for Sohel Rana, a transgender woman who had been terminated from her job at the Bangladesh Medical Studies and Research Institute in May 2013 because of her gender identity. Following JAMAKON\u2019s finding of unlawful dismissal, Sohel Rana was compensated for lost salary and reinstated to her former position.187 54 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions non-discrimination, freedom of movement, and the rights to live with dignity, to livelihood and work, and to equality and equal protection of the law.193 On 8 October 2015, the Federal Court reversed this ruling on procedural grounds, with the result that the shari\u2019a laws prohibiting \u2018a male person posing as a woman\u2019 remain in effect.194 In parts of Asia, such as the Philippines, families have made abduction complaints against butch lesbians and transgender men as a way to break up their relationships with women.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e480f6b9-a277-4b61-acf5-d209075b8519": {"__data__": {"id_": "e480f6b9-a277-4b61-acf5-d209075b8519", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b4b009b49e8f578bdbc473ffb37b084cbe18c32689a2638fdc51ee52e69c9ab2"}, "2": {"node_id": "435bdf24-0375-4018-8979-cdfdaae809d8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2cf9a58667cf0ea43d63e47c57538a1b0472213f05b318c56f387cbbe5354a79"}}, "hash": "bb579c18de43f36a468f3512a2cc5b522e8c3f998ca2a8a2d9c621de37c93435", "text": "These charges have been laid under laws to prevent kidnapping, illegal detention and \u2018crimes against liberty\u2019.195 196 193 See https://justiceforsisters.wordpress.com/2015/07/31/apakah-peruntukan-perlembagan-yang-dilanggar-oleh-seksyen-66- negeri-sembilan-1992-which-provisions-of-the-federal-constitution-are-violated-by-section-66-negeri-sembilan-1992/. 194 Human Rights Watch, \u2018Malaysia: Court Ruling Sets Back Transgender Rights\u2019, 8 October 2015; at www.hrw.org/news/2015/10/08/ malaysia-court-ruling-sets-back-transgender-rights; Justice for Sisters, \u2018Statement: Appeal at the Federal Court\u2019; at https:// justiceforsisters.wordpress.com/. 195 International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (now OutRight Action International), 2014. 196 Colors Rainbow, Facing 377: Discrimination and Human Rights Abuses Against Transgender, Gay and Bisexual Men in Myanmar, 2013; cited in D.

Chapter 3: Being transgender in Asia and the Pacific | 55 Part I Experiences of being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex in the Asia Pacific In many parts of the region, police and other State actors have been implicated in violence against transgender people, particularly transgender women. This is common in jurisdictions where cross- dressing or sex work is criminalised. When transgender people are detained under these laws, they are vulnerable to abuse under search and detention policies that do not recognise their gender identity. UN human rights mechanisms have highlighted concerns about violence and abuse against transgender people in detention, particularly transgender women held in male prisons. The New Zealand Human Rights Commission and the Australian Human Rights Commission have each called for detention policies within their respective countries to be reviewed to address transgender people\u2019s right to safety and their right to access rehabilitation services and medically necessary hormone therapy.197 In Hong Kong, the Equal Opportunities Commission supported a qualitative study conducted by the Transgender Resource Centre examining transgender people\u2019s experiences with security services, including the Police Force, Immigration Department and the Correctional Services Department.198 3.5. GENDER RECOGNITION 3.5.1. Importance of gender recognition The importance of legal gender recognition is often not easily understood by people who are not transgender. Most people do not have to worry about whether identification documents include sex or gender details and whether it is possible for those details to be changed. However, this issue has a significant impact on the daily lives of transgender people. Having the correct name and sex or gender identity on official documents is a basic necessity. It is required for transgender people to be recognised as a person before the law.199 Transgender people are vulnerable to human rights violations when their name and sex details on official documents, including identification documents, do not match their gender identity or expression. Violations may occur in these circumstances for a number of reasons, including: \u2022 discrimination and violence when documents disclose that someone is transgender \u2022 denial of services, with transgender people being turned away from both \u2018women-only or \u2018men only\u2019 facilities \u2022 no access to services appropriate to their gender identity; for example, transgender women being detained in male prisons. In practical terms, inappropriate identity documents can result in transgender people facing high levels of violence, being excluded from school and being unable to find work, a place to live or any economic means of survival. Identity documents take on an even greater level of significance in times of emergency, such as medical emergencies or natural disasters, or when a person\u2019s legal status is questioned, particularly when they cross borders. At times of natural disasters, transgender people have been excluded from relief camps that are segregated by sex or have not received rations because they could not show identification that matched their gender identity. Others have feared for their safety in sex-segregated washrooms or public baths. These were the experiences of transgender people following floods in Pakistan, the tsunami in India and earthquakes in Japan and Nepal.200 197 New Zealand Human Rights Commission, To Be Who I Am: Report of the Inquiry into Discrimination Experienced by Transgender People, 2008; New Zealand Human Rights Commission, Submission to the Human Rights Committee\u2019s 6th periodic review of New Zealand\u2019s compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, February 2016; Australian Human Rights Commission, Resilient Individuals: Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Intersex Rights, 2015. 198 Speech by Dr York Y.N.

In some countries, there are no laws or policies enabling transgender people to amend identity documents. No country in the Pacific allows a transgender person to change sex details on these documents and only a small number, including Fiji, Niue and Tonga, allow someone to change their name legally. In an April 2014 submission on the new Draft Fiji Constitution, and in a discussion about gender identity and the law at the Attorney-General\u2019s 2014 conference in Fiji, the Amithi Fiji Project called for legal gender recognition without any medical requirements.201 In South East Asia, Thailand, the Philippines and Malaysia have no gender recognition laws or policies. In a May 2015 report, the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to health recommended that Malaysia: Legally recognize the gender identity of transgender people and prohibit any discrimination on the basis of gender identity in all areas, including health, education, employment and access to public services.202 3.5.3. Provisions that require medical steps resulting in sterilisation In some situations, the process for amending details on official documents may lead to subsequent human rights violations. For example, transgender people may be required to undergo gender reassignment surgeries that result in sterilisation. Sterilisation without full, free and prior informed consent has been described by human rights bodies as an involuntary, coercive and/or forced practice. It violates the right to health, the right to information, the right to privacy, the right to decide on the number and spacing of children, the right to found a family and the right to be free from discrimination.203 The UN Special Rapporteur on torture has explicitly noted that \u201cin many countries transgender persons are required to undergo often unwanted sterilization surgeries as a prerequisite to enjoy legal recognition of their preferred gender\u201d.204 In 2013, the Special Rapportueur recommended that all States outlaw forced or coerced sterilisation in all circumstances and provide special protection to marginalised groups, including transgender people.205 In a January 2016 report, the Special Rapporteur called on States to \u201cadopt transparent and accessible legal gender recognition procedures and abolish requirements for sterilization and other harmful procedures as preconditions\u201d.206 Other human rights bodies have also recommended removing any compulsory sterilisation requirements from gender recognition laws.207 An April 2014 decision from the Indian Supreme Court, National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India, cited the provision in the Yogyakarta Principles that \u201cno one shall be forced to undergo medical procedures, including sex reassignment surgery, sterilisation or hormonal therapy, as a requirement for legal recognition of their gender identity\u201d.208 There is uncertainty about the extent to which the judgement 201 A Valenza, \u2018Call for Legal Recognition for Trans People in Fiji\u2019 2014 at: http://ilga.org/call-for-the-legal-recognition-of-trans- people-in-fiji/. 202 Report of the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, Addendum, Visit to Malaysia (19 November \u2013 2 December 2014), 2015, A/HRC/29/33/Add.1 para 111(r). 203 OHCHR, UN Women, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF and World Health Organization, Eliminating forced, coercive and otherwise involuntary sterilization: an interagency statement, 2014. 204 Report of the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, 2013, A/HRC/22/53. 205 Ibid, paras. 78 and 88. 206 Report of the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, 2016, A/HRC/31/57, para. 72(h). 207 Committee against Torture, General Comment No. 2: Implementation of Article 2 by states parties, 2008, CAT/C/GC/2, para. 21; Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, General Comment No. 20: Non-discrimination in economic, social and cultural rights, 2009, E/C.12/GC/20, para. 32; Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, Concluding Observations: the Netherlands, 2010, CEDAW/C/NLD/CO/5; Human Rights Commissioner of the Council of Europe, Gender Identity and Human Rights: Issue Paper, 2009.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "541fbf37-9844-4aa6-acdb-996602b587a7": {"__data__": {"id_": "541fbf37-9844-4aa6-acdb-996602b587a7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "01a20e870398014fe59ca0acedf6ca421375d30870bec3b1d723f23d5ec12e83"}, "2": {"node_id": "6449eb03-9aff-4dc1-a9d8-0eb663287745", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3ecc71e052ac080d280d5f59c1a3706b8a3099cf134ed861e158c02f930e81ff"}}, "hash": "3ff8f67044179cd69986f7e120804da17f3797cf91fb091e303cf55af6fd13fe", "text": "208 National Legal Services Authority v.

In November 2015, the Vietnamese National Assembly approved a bill to legalise \u2018sex change surgery\u2019 and introduce the right to legal gender recognition for transgender people who have undergone such surgery.211 In 2010, the Kazakhstan Commissioner for Human Rights was alerted to difficulties faced by transgender people approaching government registry offices to change their sex details on identity documents. Their requests were denied, despite a 2003 Ministry of Health directive allowing individuals to change their legally recognised gender.212 The Commissioner\u2019s investigation identified contradictory provisions and recommended changes. A 2015 Human Rights Watch report has documented the impact of the government\u2019s policy changes, including their adoption of new guidelines in 2011. It has strongly criticised the additional requirement to undergo hormonal therapy and surgeries, at a time when international human rights standards have increasingly spoken out against forced sterilisation and medical interventions as a pre-condition for legal gender recognition.213 As the Yogyakarta Principles note, a person\u2019s self-defined gender identity is an integral part of who they are and is one of the most basic aspects of self-determination, dignity and freedom. No part of the Asia Pacific region, apart from one territory in Australia, has gender recognition laws that fully respect transgender people\u2019s right to recognition before the law.214 3.5.4. Provisions that discriminate on the grounds of age, marital or family status Even where court decisions, laws or regulations enable some transgender people to obtain legal gender recognition, these provisions often explicitly exclude other transgender people. For example, provisions in Singapore, South Korea and Japan, exclude those under the age of 20, those who are married and those with children under the age of 20 from amending the sex details on their official identity documents. This means that transgender people who are already married are forced to divorce to gain legal gender recognition. The restrictions are even tighter in some countries. For example, transgender people in China are required to inform direct relatives, live and work in their affirmed gender (even if they face discrimination in doing so) and have no criminal record.

This is also the approach in passport policies in Australia and New Zealand and for birth certificates in one Australian jurisdiction.220 Three other South Asian countries \u2013 Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan \u2013 have recognised the specific status of hijras, metis, khwaja sira and other transgender people who identify as a third gender. However, implementation has typically been very slow. There are continuing issues across the region about ways to legally recognise and protect the rights of those who identify as third gender, while also providing the choice for transgender women to identify as female and transgender men to identify as male. 216 \u2018WPATH Statement on Legal Recognition of Gender Identity\u2019, 19 January 2015 at www.wpath.org/uploaded_files/140/files/ WPATH%20Statement%20on%20Legal%20Recognition%20of%20Gender%20Identity%201-19-15.pdf. 217 Re Kevin (Validity of Marriage of a Transsexual) [2001] FamCA 1074 and [2003] FamCA 94 at www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/ family_ct/2003/94.html. 218 Global Commission on HIV and the Law, \u2018High-level Roundtable on Gender Identity, Rights and the Law\u2019, 2 October 2014; at http://hivlawcommission.org/index.php/follow-up-stories/377-high-level-roundtable-on-gender-identity-rights-and-the-law.

In June 2015 the Commission met with government officials and other concerned individuals to identify and address administrative and medical issues arising from applications by transgender people to change their name and gender on official documents. During the meeting, government officials agreed to develop policy guidelines based on internationally-accepted standards related to gender certification. The Commission has made recommendations to the Sri Lankan Government to resolve the complaint and ensure respect for the rights of transgender people, including through legislative changes. Specifically, the Commission has developed a proposed gender certificate based on expert local and international guidance, including from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health. The Commission has submitted this gender certificate to the government and recommended that it be officially recognised and that psychiatrists working with transgender people are informed through an official circular. Given the primary role of birth certificates as an identity document in Sri Lanka, the Commission is planning to conduct training and awareness programs on the rights of transgender people. It is hoped that with increased awareness and improvements in laws, regulations and social perspectives, there will be significant improvements in the lives of transgender people in Sri Lanka.222 60 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions Both the Australian Human Rights Commission and the New Zealand Human Rights Commission have undertaken inquiries into legal gender recognition and recommended changes to existing provisions to better reflect international human rights standards for gender recognition. In Australia, this includes recommending that a self-identifying legal declaration, such as a statutory declaration, is sufficient proof to change a person\u2019s gender on government records and identity documents. In both countries, this work has influenced policy changes that introduced, or widened access to, third gender options on official identity documents.224 Both NHRIs have also supported or intervened in cases before the courts to clarify access to legal gender recognition for transgender people.225 224 In response to the Australian Human Rights Commission\u2019s work on legal gender recognition, the Australian Government implemented Guidelines on the Recognition of Sex and Gender which clarified evidence requirements for changing sex details to male, female or a third non-binary option: www.ag.gov.au/Publications/Pages/AustralianGovernmentGuidelinesontheRecognitionofSexandGender. aspx. In response to recommendations from the New Zealand Human Rights Commission\u2019s Inquiry into Discrimination experienced by Transgender People, New Zealand passport and driver licence policies were revised to enable people to choose between a male, female or non-binary \u2018X\u2019 option on those documents through a simple statutory declaration process. 225 In AB v Western Australia, the Australian Human Rights Commission was granted leave to intervene in High Court proceedings when two transgender men who had undergone chest reconstruction and hormone treatment, but not surgery to their reproductive organs or genitals, applied for gender recognition certificates. The Commission\u2019s submission cited the right to recognition as a person before the law under articles 16 and 17 of the ICCPR, as understood by the Yogyakarta Principles. The New Zealand Human Rights Commission supported the extension of access to gender recognition for New Zealand citizens and permanent residents born overseas. Subsequently this was enacted as an amendment to the Births, Deaths, Marriages and Relationships Registration Act 1995. Photo by Rebecca Swan.

ACCESS TO GENDER-AFFIRMING HEALTH SERVICES 3.6.1. Human rights standards The right to the highest attainable standard of health requires that health services are available, accessible, acceptable and of quality. This means that all people, including transgender people, are entitled to be treated with respect and dignity, free from discrimination, when accessing health services.226 The need for gender-affirming health services has been specifically addressed by international and regional human rights and health professional bodies. However, transgender people worldwide experience substantial health disparities and barriers in accessing appropriate health services.227 In the Asia Pacific region, these gaps have been documented in a series of reports commissioned by UN agencies.228 3.6.2.

These include, for example, counselling and peer support, hormone therapy, hair removal, chest or breast reconstruction surgeries and surgeries to modify other parts of the body, including genitals. One of the unfortunate impacts of the term \u2018sex change operation\u2019 is that it takes the focus away from the many other practical ways that mainstream health services can meet better the needs of transgender people. First and foremost, this is by listening to transgender people and understanding their health needs and then following ethical and professional standards to provide them with access to the highest attainable standard of health. 3.6.3. Medically necessary treatment International and national health professional bodies working with transgender people have consistently recognised that gender-affirming health interventions are medically necessary for many transgender people.229 The immediate priorities for many transgender people are to have medical interventions that change their outward appearance so they can get on with their lives. This typically involves reversing the masculinising or feminising impacts of naturally occurring hormones in their body by blocking these hormones and replacing them with cross-sex hormone therapy. However, hormones alone will not remove a transgender woman\u2019s facial or body hair or change her voice. 226 Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, General Comment No. 14: The right to the highest attainable standard of health (Article 12 of the Covenant), 2000, E/C.12/2000/4; Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 15: The rights of the child to the highest attainable standard of health, 2013, CRC/C/GC/15; Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, General Comment No. 20: Non-discrimination in economic, social and cultural rights (art. 2, para. 2, of the ICESCR), 2009, E/C.12/GC/20; Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, General Recommendation 28: Core obligations of States Parties under Article 2 of the CEDAW, 2010, CEDAW/C/20107477GC.2. 227 World Health Organisation, Sexual health, human rights and the law, 2015. 228 For example, S.

When transgender men do not have access to this surgery, often they tightly bind their chest to create a flatter contour. In some circumstances, this can result in breathing difficulties, back pain, skin conditions or, less commonly, rib fractures. 3.6.4. Regional situation In the Asia Pacific region, public health systems or private health insurance cover medical transition costs only in Hong Kong, mainland China, parts of India (particularly for hijras, aravani and thirunangai), to a certain extent in Australia and to a very minimal extent in New Zealand. Most transgender people in the region have to pay to access counselling, diagnosis assessment, laboratory tests, hormone treatment, hair removal, surgeries and other treatments. Self-medication of hormones is common among transgender women in the region, including in the Philippines, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, China and Nepal. This means they have no prior medical advice in relation to monitoring of doses and potential side effects. In the Pacific, there is often no access to specialist advice and the most commonly used hormones are oral contraceptive pills that are not ideal for transgender women.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0208c1c6-5a5f-4458-a455-49e6d5b417fb": {"__data__": {"id_": "0208c1c6-5a5f-4458-a455-49e6d5b417fb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dcb4d2aaf2639f06bf0befb9a91020bada659fd35e751b639720d66d025b6ab4"}, "2": {"node_id": "19a82b84-f2a7-4c9e-9896-6ef3d49d2999", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "00c5066c6a9e0d9ab78fe3cf545060d1f5c60c267b9ab240efd9a4823d87b9e0"}}, "hash": "fc0fe7459471da144e9a7476fd93fa2333ea04d652918d1b4026692bafec299a", "text": "There is no access to hormones for transgender men in the Pacific.

Until recently, it was largely performed outside the formal medical sector and resulted in deaths or serious complications. As a result, in India the hijra community is increasingly approaching health professionals to perform the nirvani surgery in private clinics and some operations take place in public healthcare settings.231 There is very limited research about the health experiences of transgender men in the region. The information that does exist suggests that many have no information about gender-affirming health services and that they may not have the same access as transgender women to peers who can help fill \u2018information gaps\u2019. Transgender people are frequently not treated with dignity and respect when they approach health services. Furthermore, health professionals do not have the necessary information and training to assess and respond to the health needs of transgender people. The Asia and Pacific Trans Health Blueprint, published in October 2015, helps to address some of these information gaps and promote good practice.232 There are no health professionals specialising in transgender health in the Pacific and limited expertise is available in some parts of Asia. Yet hormone treatment and some surgeries required by transgender people are available for other medical conditions. These means that some transgender health needs could be mainstreamed within other health services. Denying medically necessary treatment to transgender people, when it is available to other population groups, leaves health providers open to potential claims of unlawful discrimination. 230 Plucking hair with tweezers or traditional implements, such as chimta in India, only temporarily removes hair. 231 Health Policy Project et al, 2015, p. 54. 232 Health Policy Project et al 2015. Chapter 3: Being transgender in Asia and the Pacific | 63 Part I Experiences of being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex in the Asia Pacific In India, both the April 2014 Supreme Court decision and a proposed Rights of Transgender Persons Bill have prioritised access to gender-affirming health services. This reflects similar good practice in other regions, for example in Argentina and Malta, where comprehensive law reform has addressed gender recognition, protection from discrimination and the right to health.233 233 Argentina, Ley 26743: Derecho a la identidad de g\u00e9nero [Decree No. 773/12 of Law No. 26743: Right to gender identity].

This includes systemic bullying of transgender and gender diverse students at school and discrimination at all stages of the employment cycle. \u2022 Transgender women continue to be criminalised under laws that prohibit cross-dressing and are frequently targeted by laws criminalising homosexuality, even though they are not gay men. Public nuisance and vagrancy laws and criminalisation of sex work also disproportionately affect transgender women. \u2022 Transphobic violence is a form of gender-based violence directed against transgender people. The majority of transgender people killed because of their gender identity are transgender women. There is emerging evidence of high levels of sexual and physical violence against transgender men within their families or in intimate relationships. \u2022 Legal gender recognition is a fundamental civil and political right that is necessary to realise other rights. Having the correct name and sex or gender identity on official documents enables transgender people to be recognised as a person before the law and to have legal protection. \u2022 Gender-affirming health services are medically necessary for many transgender people and are a component of the right to the highest attainable standard of health.

Two of the more common examples are congenital adrenal hyperplasia and androgen insensitivity syndrome.

HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES239 At an expert meeting on ending human rights violations against intersex persons held in September 2015, the High Commissioner for Human Rights reflected a more sustained focus on intersex human rights issues within the international human rights mechanisms and UN agencies. His comments also demonstrated the evolution of terms being used to describe discrimination against intersex people. Following on from the April 2014 Malta law, the High Commissioner identified \u2018sex characteristics\u2019 as a prohibited ground of discrimination. This terminology has subsequently been used by the Committee on the Rights of the Child.240 4.2.1. Invisibility, secrecy and shame There is typically very limited knowledge and experience, including within NHRIs, of human rights violations against intersex people. In his 2015 statement, the High Commissioner for Human Rights spoke about this relative invisibility, highlighted the seriousness of the human rights issues that intersex people face and called for their bodily diversity to be protected and celebrated: When I started as High Commissioner a year ago, I knew little about intersex people. I don\u2019t think I was alone in this: it reflects a general lack of awareness. Too many people assume, without really thinking about it, that everyone can be fitted into two distinct and mutually exclusive categories: male or female. But in fact, human beings \u2013 like most living beings \u2013 are more diverse and complex than that.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "57b09aaa-3c03-4a96-8077-858c4b402b1d": {"__data__": {"id_": "57b09aaa-3c03-4a96-8077-858c4b402b1d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8ade3bbf0d547986c4cebf006e336dbb32190b64da7efae2d8dc3c5215e2c46e"}, "2": {"node_id": "cea8f78e-3b31-4267-87a2-cd155f07e16a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3146c803ea5f8afcd47cc7365427b8bf4b82608e06b37e8c15cadd30530c6701"}}, "hash": "567c4348b45c9bdeb646b6ac97f166a8d889f56569956be2cd4fc3a81feff91c", "text": "Our diversity \u2013 the differences between our experiences and perspectives, as well as the shapes of our bodies \u2013 is something that we should celebrate and protect, in all its forms.241 Intersex people\u2019s experiences of bodily diversity are commonly shrouded in secrecy and shame, due to societal norms and medical practice that treat physical diversity as an abnormality to be fixed.

All human beings are born equal in dignity and rights. Those foundational, bedrock principles of universality and equality mean that all of us, without exception, and regardless of our sex characteristics, are equally entitled to the protections of international human rights law. Unfortunately, the myth that all human beings belong to one of two distinct and separate sexes is deep-rooted, and it contributes to the stigma, and even taboo, attached to being intersex. This is linked to \u2026 very serious human rights violations \u2026 They include \u2026 infanticides of intersex babies; and widespread and life-long discrimination, including in education, employment, health, sports [and] accessing public services \u2026 Zeid Ra\u2019ad Al Hussein, High Commissioner for Human Rights239 Chapter 4: Being intersex in Asia and the Pacific | 67 Part I Experiences of being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex in the Asia Pacific [In China], information and research on intersexuality is even less available than it is for other LGBT groups. However, while the visibility of intersex people is improving, their public image remains negative. Reports about intersex infants and children in the media are still commonly linked to family shame and the need to perform gender normative surgeries. These reports often use a sensational tone . . . Moreover, as the parents retain ultimate rights on the determination of their children\u2019s sex, the voice of intersex children is rarely heard.243 However, intersex activists in the Asia Pacific region are part of a small but growing international movement that is challenging the silence. They have participated in the three International Intersex Forums held between 2011 and 2013. The December 2013 statement from the third forum in Malta sets out a comprehensive list of human rights demands \u201caiming to end discrimination against intersex people and to ensure the right of bodily integrity, physical autonomy and self-determination\u201d.244 Intersex people from Taiwan and Australia were part of the first United Nations expert meeting convened by OHCHR in Geneva in September 2015.245 A month later, intersex groups based in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand were among the inaugural recipients of grants from the Astraea Intersex Human Rights Fund.246 That same month saw the first gathering of intersex activists from across Asia at the 2015 ILGA Asia conference in Taipei.247 With the support of UNDP\u2019s Being LGBTI in Asia Programme and the Multi- Country South Asia Global Fund HIV Programme, one of the participants at that meeting hosted Nepal\u2019s first national intersex workshop in January 2016. The National Human Rights Commission of Nepal and UN agencies also attended the second day of the workshop. 4.2.2. Intersex people and human rights International human rights standards apply to all people, including intersex people. There has been slow progress from human rights bodies in articulating the specific human rights issues that intersex people face. At first these were seen as coming under a broad definition of gender identity. This has now developed more properly into recognition of either \u2018intersex status\u2019 or \u2018sex characteristics\u2019 as a prohibited ground of discrimination, distinct from gender identity. The key human rights issues now more widely understood to impact on the lives of intersex people, including in this region, are: \u2022 the right to physical integrity, and the associated rights to freedom from torture and ill-treatment and to live free from harmful practices \u2022 equality and freedom from discrimination \u2022 recognition before the law \u2022 effective remedies and redress.248 For this manual, attempts have been made to collate available information from the Asia Pacific region about intersex people and the human rights issues they face. No information was identified about experiences in Pacific Island States. To date, only a very small number of NHRIs in the region have worked on intersex human rights issues. Therefore, this chapter draws more heavily than others on the experiences of Australia and New Zealand, where intersex NGOs have a longer history and NHRIs have started to work on the issues they have raised. 243 UNDP and USAID, Being LGBT in Asia: China Country Report, 2014; pp. 28-29.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "05068283-a9f8-45bc-8a87-29898e4c2ccd": {"__data__": {"id_": "05068283-a9f8-45bc-8a87-29898e4c2ccd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dffeb3440b12492810afa8e2f5eb9c38450407d3e2bfa1b2b5af5e2e86eaa773"}, "2": {"node_id": "8e3eab1a-bc17-4e07-bcce-31a58707c165", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "511d0edc7a8c7ad18b68a3e32564cb89930c606de63995a9359d76d5da6a0dfe"}}, "hash": "cf5cee91a3f34553badbce657af0d683644b23d6e3a200c9b2d88e8fc04321af", "text": "28-29. 244 Public statement by the Third International Intersex Forum, 1 December 2013; at https://oii.org.au/24241/public-statement-by- the-third-international-intersex-forum/ (English) and at www.oii.tw/Home/3rd-is-forum-statement (Chinese). 245 The International Intersex Forums were held in Brussels in September 2011, Stockholm in December 2012 and Malta in November /December 2013.

THE RIGHT TO PHYSICAL INTEGRITY In all parts of the world, it is common to perform surgeries and other medical treatments on intersex children that aim to make their appearance conform to narrow binary sex stereotypes of male or female bodies.249 UN experts have criticised cosmetic and other medically unnecessary surgeries on children\u2019s genitals and other reproductive organs that occur without the child\u2019s views being considered.250 A 2014 statement from seven UN agencies, including OHCHR and the World Health Organization, highlighted that these so-called \u2018sex-normalising\u2019 procedures have irreversible, lifelong physical and mental health consequences.251 They can cause \u2018permanent infertility, pain, incontinence, loss of sexual sensation and ongoing mental suffering, including depression\u2019.252 In many instances, surgeries and other medical interventions are performed while an intersex person is too young to be part of the decision-making process. They may be proposed on the basis of weak evidence and parents themselves may have insufficient information or access to alternative options.253 For example, it is very uncommon for parents to have contact with intersex adults and their families or to have access to positive portrayals of bodily diversity. In a 2009 report on informed consent, the Special Rapporteur on the right to health called on health care providers to \u201cstrive to postpone non-emergency invasive and irreversible interventions until the child is sufficiently mature to provide informed consent\u201d.254 The Special Rapporteur noted that \u201c[surgery on children] is particularly problematic in the case of intersex genital surgery, which is a painful and high- risk procedure with no proven medical benefits\u201d, citing decisions from the Colombian Constitutional Court.255 In 2013 the Special Rapporteur on torture examined forms of abuse in health care settings that may cross a threshold of mistreatment that \u201cis tantamount to torture or cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment\u201d.256 He identified intersex people as a marginalised group and criticised non-consensual, medically unnecessary and irreversible surgeries performed on intersex infants and children. The Special Rapporteur called on all States to \u201crepeal any law allowing intrusive and irreversible treatments, including forced genital-normalizing surgery\u2026 when enforced or administered without the free and informed consent of the person concerned [and] to outlaw forced or coerced sterilization in all circumstances and provide special protection to individuals belonging to marginalized groups\u201d.257 249 The routine practice of performing these surgeries or medical interventions on an intersex person\u2019s body contrasts with the resistance from some clinicians to enabling any form of medical transition for transgender people. In part this demonstrates the mistaken, contrasting beliefs that intersex bodies are unhealthy or abnormal and should be \u2018fixed\u2019 but that transgender people who transition are \u2018mutilating\u2019 a healthy body. Both views have been criticised severely by ethicists, health professionals and human rights bodies. 250 OHCHR, Discriminatory laws and practices and acts of violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity, 2011, A/HRC/19/41, para. 57; OHCHR, UN Women, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF and World Health Organization, Eliminating Forced, Coercive and Otherwise Involuntary Sterilization, An Interagency Statement, 2014; Committee on the Rights of the Child, Concluding Observations: Switzerland, 2015, CRC/C/CHE/CO/2-4; Committee against Torture, Concluding Observations: Germany, CAT/C/DEU/CO/5; Report of the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, 2013, A/HRC/22/53; Report of the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, 2009, A/64/272.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "33dac4ab-cada-49b0-bc93-4453bc8340b5": {"__data__": {"id_": "33dac4ab-cada-49b0-bc93-4453bc8340b5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7031830e5a248e4f02d4d5ad085ecb914d1fe1ecce240ff24e63961a8def8090"}, "2": {"node_id": "11b1b33e-14d4-4774-97c5-df37cee7f29d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "382fc4e130d0d9deb5f6f49dd8ecd7b22b213be382230a2f51456f7dfc25010d"}}, "hash": "8a8a78cdabaa500aa37e44396947e57652b4c763782842e5ef0bf0cf3704e45c", "text": "251 OHCHR, UN Women, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF and World Health Organization, Eliminating Forced, Coercive and Otherwise Involuntary Sterilization, An Interagency Statement, 2014.

Evidence in this region There is limited information available about the human rights issues experienced by intersex people in the Asia Pacific region. Evidence of the continued use of so-called \u2018sex-normalising\u2019 surgeries and other medical interventions has been identified through reports from Indonesia, China, Viet Nam, Hong Kong, Thailand, Australia and New Zealand.260 There is no material identifying any countries in this region where the prevailing medical approach is to prohibit or discourage such practices. In 2013, an Australian Senate Committee carried out an official inquiry into the involuntary or coerced sterilisation of intersex people. It concluded that \u2018sex-assignment surgery\u2019 is still occurring in infancy and childhood and that \u201cnormalising appearance goes hand in hand with the stigmatisation of difference\u201d. The Committee stressed that any decision-making around medical treatment of intersex children must take human rights considerations into account.261 Surgeries and hormonal interventions to \u2018normalise\u2019 intersex bodies currently take place on a routine basis in Australia, such as when girls\u2019 clitorises are deemed too big, or when boys are unable to stand to urinate.262 258 Joint statement by a group of United Nations and international human rights experts on the occasion of the International Day against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia, \u2018Discriminated and made vulnerable: young LGBT and intersex people need recognition and protection of their rights\u2019, 13 May 2015; at www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews. aspx?NewsID=15941&LangID=E. 259 Report of the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, 2015, A/70/213 paras 84-85. 260 UNDP and USAID, Being LGBT in Asia: Indonesia Country Report, 2014; UNDP and USAID, Being LGBT in Asia: China Country Report, 2014; UNDP and USAID, Being LGBT in Asia: Viet Nam Country Report, 2014; Small Luk, Intersex Report from Hong Kong, produced for the Being LGBT in Asia Regional Dialogue, February 2015; New Zealand Human Rights Commission\u2019s Intersex Roundtables; Australian Senate, Community Affairs References Committee, Involuntary or Coerced Sterilisation of Intersex People in Australia, October 2013; personal communication with Nada Chaiyajit, Thailand, 15 September 2015. 261 Australian Senate, Community Affairs References Committee, Involuntary or Coerced Sterilisation of Intersex People in Australia, October 2013, paras. 3.45 and 3.128, pp. 49 and 74. 262 M.

In Indonesia, babies born with visibly ambiguous genitals at major hospitals often undergo \u2018normalising\u2019 surgeries if parents can afford the cost. Parents frequently make these decisions based on advice from religious authorities.265 There are significant gaps in knowledge about practices in other parts of the region. However, there is no evidence to suggest that intersex people\u2019s right to physical integrity is protected explicitly in domestic laws, regulations or practice guidelines in any country in Asia and the Pacific. On the contrary, laws and policies that prohibit female genital mutilation may give explicit permission for genital surgeries to \u2018normalise\u2019 the bodies of intersex infants and children.266 In Viet Nam, a 2008 decree on sex reassignment provides an insight into how intersex", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "26b36dce-1086-4de2-9c49-71d597c06219": {"__data__": {"id_": "26b36dce-1086-4de2-9c49-71d597c06219", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e1ce0bf0cfe907d94f4f5c11dd923fcad34e537fb9ada5bd71fa9b42b6ac79df"}, "3": {"node_id": "1b87e965-6633-424b-a1ab-337e9465aa45", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fcd3d698312add94182636694b4e93728e26801fbb8bf3e1ed886c26d68f4e6f"}}, "hash": "aa287d3279cf1fe42d166f1ee6ef4033797253c30cc17d027ccca2afa55105ad", "text": "people and their bodies are perceived.

Psycho-social rationales Psycho-social rationales are frequently used to inappropriately justify surgeries and other medical interventions on intersex children. These rationales equate intersex traits and other people\u2019s negative reactions to those traits as a psycho-social risk.272 Examples of these psycho-social risks include: \u2022 the risk of social or cultural disadvantage to the child; for example, reduced opportunities for marriage or intimate relationships or reduced opportunity for meaningful employment and capacity to earn an income \u2022 the risk of social isolation, restrictions or difficulties; for example, caused by embarrassment or social stigma associated with having genitalia that does not match the gender in which the person lives.273 Other clinicians have critiqued such an approach, noting that the central challenge is \u201cfinding a way to help families (and healthcare professionals) overcome the shame and anxious secrecy that may shape minds and force hands in ways that ultimately harm all involved\u201d.274 Pressure to perform medical interventions based on a fear of social stigma, including rejection from parents, raises significant human rights concerns and is not in the best interests of the child. An intersex child may grow up and reject their assigned sex. The implications of such a decision are much greater if the child has undergone medically unnecessary surgeries or hormone treatment. Examples from intersex people in this region demonstrate the power of psycho-social rationales in justifying so-called \u2018sex-normalising\u2019 procedures.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b87e965-6633-424b-a1ab-337e9465aa45": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b87e965-6633-424b-a1ab-337e9465aa45", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e1ce0bf0cfe907d94f4f5c11dd923fcad34e537fb9ada5bd71fa9b42b6ac79df"}, "2": {"node_id": "26b36dce-1086-4de2-9c49-71d597c06219", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aa287d3279cf1fe42d166f1ee6ef4033797253c30cc17d027ccca2afa55105ad"}}, "hash": "fcd3d698312add94182636694b4e93728e26801fbb8bf3e1ed886c26d68f4e6f", "text": "275 In Malaysia, research has shown that decisions about the sex assignments of infants with the same intersex variation differed depending on their parent\u2019s culture and attitudes towards dowries.276 In countries where male children are more highly valued than female children, this can influence decisions about the sex assigned to an intersex infant or child.

The limiting factor in the consideration of family/cultural circumstances will be the physical and psychological integrity of the child. An irreversible sex assignment intervention involving harmful physical and psychological consequences cannot be justified on the grounds that the family, school or social environment has difficulty in accepting the child\u2019s natural physical characteristics. \u2026 If such interventions are performed solely with a view to integration of the child into its family and social environment, then they run counter to the child\u2019s welfare. In addition, there is no guarantee that the intended purpose (integration) will be achieved.279 In its February 2015 concluding observations on Switzerland, the Committee on the Rights of the Child cited the recommendations of the National Advisory Commission on Biomedical Ethics in its discussion of harmful practices.

Female genital mutilation NGOs in both Australia and New Zealand have made submissions to government agencies, NHRIs and UN treaty monitoring bodies criticising laws that, while rightly prohibiting female genital mutilation, allow similar surgical interventions on intersex girls.288 In both countries, relevant laws exempt so-called \u2018sex- normalising\u2019 surgeries on intersex people because they are regarded as being medically beneficial or therapeutic.289 This is despite explicit provisions stating that a procedure cannot be justified as necessary, desirable or therapeutic simply because it is part of a social, cultural or religious custom or practice. The NGOs OII Australia and the Intersex Trust Aotearoa New Zealand have argued that surgical alterations to make intersex children\u2019s genitals \u2018normal\u2019 or \u2018socially acceptable\u2019 amount to genital mutilation and should be legally prohibited.290 Human rights concerns about genital surgeries on intersex infants and children, performed for non- medical reasons, are noted in the 2015 report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on female genital mutilation.

Cabral and M. Carpenter, 2015. Chapter 4: Being intersex in Asia and the Pacific | 75 Part I Experiences of being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex in the Asia Pacific Where health systems recommend surgeries on infants and children with intersex variations, these costs are often publically funded. However, intersex adults frequently cannot access any public funding to reduce the physical or emotional impacts of such treatment. A preliminary survey of intersex advocates in eight countries \u2013 including Taiwan, New Zealand and Australia \u2013 identified concerns about the lack of research on the long-term impact of surgeries.296 Institutions do not typically engage in long-term follow-up and have no responsibility to keep historical medical records. Many parents were discouraged from sharing information with their children as they grew up about medical interventions performed when the child was younger. In addition, the fragmentation of health provision into paediatric, adolescent and adult services results in intersex people\u2019s health needs falling through the gaps. More qualitative research is needed to give intersex adults the opportunity to describe the long-term consequences of having, or not having, medical and surgical intervention. Interviews with intersex adults have also informed the development of resources for parents raising intersex infants and children today.297 Recent intersex community-led research from Australia provides invaluable insights into these impacts. Sixty per cent of the 272 people who completed the survey reported having had medical treatment interventions related to their intersex variation. Intersex people\u2019s experience of medicalisation was often negative, with poor information, many poor outcomes and \u201cstrong evidence\u201d suggesting a pattern of institutionalised shaming and coercive treatment. Over half of the reported treatments occurred when the participants were under 18 years old. The most common treatments were genital surgeries, many of which occurred in infancy, and hormone treatments. Most participants were given no information on the option of declining or deferring treatments; a fifth were given no information at all about any of the treatments they received. The majority of participants listed at least one negative impact from their treatments; for some, these were life-threatening.298 296 D.C.

DISCRIMINATION 4.4.1. Intersex people experience discrimination Intersex people frequently experience discrimination when their intersex status or sex characteristics become known or if they are perceived not to conform to gender norms.310 Discrimination against intersex people may involve harassment, abuse or exclusion from activities or facilities because of their bodily diversity or sex characteristics. People with intersex traits are particularly vulnerable to discrimination in circumstances when their bodies are examined or searched. In the Asia Pacific region, a major Australian research study has documented how negative perceptions of intersex traits impact on dignity and equality for intersex people in education and employment, and in their intimate lives.311 In 2015, the Committee on the Rights of the Child noted its concern about \u201ccontinuing negative attitudes and discrimination faced by \u2026 intersex children\u201d in its concluding observations to Chile.

Anti-discrimination laws Intersex people have the same right to freedom from discrimination as other people. However, it is rare for anti-discrimination laws in this or any other region to explicitly prohibit discrimination against intersex people or to clarify that intersex people are covered under other grounds. This leaves intersex people vulnerable to discriminatory practices in a range of settings, including access to health services, education, public services, employment and sports.313 Australia is one of only two countries in the world that provides explicit legal protection for intersex people. In 2013, it added \u2018intersex status\u2019 as a prohibited ground of discrimination under the federal Sex Discrimination Act 1984.314 This visibility helps draw attention to the specific human rights issues faced by intersex people. Some other NHRIs in the Asia Pacific region have accepted discrimination complaints against intersex people under the ground of sex.315 Viet Nam is one of the many countries in the region that has no explicit anti-discrimination provisions dealing with sexual orientation, gender identity or sex characteristics, despite accepting a 2014 recommendation of the Universal Periodic Review to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Viet Nam\u2019s only anti-discrimination protection is for intersex people who have undergone \u2018sex reassignment\u2019.316 Intersex activists in other parts of the region have advocated for anti- discrimination protections for intersex people.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "33c1724a-0177-42e5-9d44-d3c6830778c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "33c1724a-0177-42e5-9d44-d3c6830778c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cc94d5cd645660718f7d6ad7895fad7fe9dfb59bb25913f383d77e5997b09016"}, "2": {"node_id": "baa572e1-505d-4945-a786-06f0ff35a077", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "83dfcd1719373a53b7b60931e850bae19c5024ac3c81bedbe22f6ae74a9f0f5d"}}, "hash": "20213abbf09b9ad817f71b6c5fd52c93cb746249fd7aa9c24edb4544b577a58e", "text": "This includes approaches to the Equal Opportunities Commission in Hong Kong.317 OHCHR has identified two priority actions to address discrimination experienced by intersex people: \u2022 prohibit discrimination on the basis of intersex traits, characteristics or status, including in education, health care, employment, sports and access to public services, and address such discrimination through relevant anti-discrimination initiatives \u2022 ensure that members of the judiciary, immigration officers, law enforcement, healthcare, education and other officials and personnel are trained to respect and provide equal treatment to intersex persons.318 313 OHCHR, Fact Sheet: Intersex, 2015. 314 The Sex Discrimination Amendment (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Intersex Status) Act 2013 added intersex status, gender identity and sexual orientation as prohibited grounds of discrimination.

CASE STUDY: DISCRIMINATION IN SPORT Intersex athletes face a specific set of obstacles, with female intersex athletes disqualified from sports competitions and stripped of medals on the basis of their sex characteristics. Intersex traits do not automatically lead to better performance, yet they often result in greater scrutiny and restrictions. This contrasts with other physical variations among female athletes, such as height and muscle development, that do affect performance and are not regulated. Indian middle distance runner Santhi Soundarajan was stripped of her silver medal won at the 2006 Asian Games after failing a sex verification test. The Indian Olympic Association banned her from competing domestically or internationally. Soundarajan returned to her village where she was shunned, experienced serious depression and attempted suicide. \u201cI am treated as a social outcast, even in my own local place \u2026 People don\u2019t look upon me as an Asian Games medallist, but only speak about when I failed a gender test.\u201d319 In 2012, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) released a new blanket regulation, the Hyperandrogenism Rule.320 It was designed to regulate individual female athletes\u2019 levels of androgens, the hormones that are present in higher levels in men. The IOC and the IAAF regulation deemed it unfair for a female athlete to compete against other women if her androgen levels were above the lower normal male range.321 This new regulation has been criticised as arbitrary, unscientific, unrelated to competitive performance or fairness, and for reinforcing western views of femininity.322 Four South Asian athletes, aged between 18 and 21, were subsequently persuaded by the IAAF to agree to treatment, based on the regulation. They had genital surgeries, including partial clitoridectomy (a form of female genital mutilation) and sterilisation, in order to compete in sport. These surgeries were said not to be medically necessary and would not reduce any real or perceived athletic advantage caused by the athletes\u2019 high androgen levels.323 Athlete Dutee Chand\u2019s public removal from India\u2019s 2014 Commonwealth Games team, based on the same IOC/IAAF regulation, was condemned as violating her privacy and human rights.324 Chand appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, \u201cquestioning why she should be forced to have surgery if her condition was natural and she was not ill\u201d.325 80 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions 326 327 328 329 330 4.5.

This survey also looks at the experiences of transgender and gender diverse people. 331 For example, Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act 1995 NSW (Australia), s. 45. 332 For example, Gender Recognition Act 2004 (United Kingdom), s. 2(1)(a) requires that an applicant \u201chas or has had gender dysphoria\u201d. This excludes many intersex people (and also many transgender people). 333 Unfortunately, this type of misunderstanding is common in both gender recognition advocacy campaigns and media reports. In July 2015, the Court found that insufficient evidence had been produced to indicate any link between enhanced androgen levels and improved athletic performance. It suspended the hyperandrogenism regulation for female track and field sports for two years, enabling Chand and other intersex athletes to compete.326 The Court noted that \u201cthere is no single determinant of sex\u201d and ruled it was inappropriate to subject athletes to sex verification, external genitalia examinations or chromosome testing. Any basis used to divide athletes into male and female categories \u201cshould be necessary, reasonable and proportionate to the legitimate objective being pursued\u201d.327 In a brief consensus statement in November 2015, the IOC noted its intention to go back to the Court of Arbitration for Sport seeking to reinstate its hyperandrogenism rules.328 This decision has been criticised by intersex activists.329 NHRIs can play a role in investigating intersex people\u2019s experiences in trying to participate in sport, whether socially or competitively. In August 2015, the Australian Human Rights Commission announced a national online survey on the participation of intersex people in sport to ensure their rights are protected in the policies and practices of sporting codes.330 Chapter 4: Being intersex in Asia and the Pacific | 81 Part I Experiences of being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex in the Asia Pacific The third International Intersex Forum advocated that intersex infants should be registered as either female or male with the awareness that, like all people, they may grow up to identify with a different sex or gender.334 At that future point, they should be able to choose from the full range of sex and/or gender options on official documents, including those outside binary, male and female classifications. Like the population as a whole, most intersex people will choose to identify simply as male or as female. For many, that may be a hard fought choice, as either they have been assigned an incorrect sex at birth or they are assumed to be a third sex. The decision to have one\u2019s sex listed as a non-binary or third sex must be entirely voluntary for any individual.335 In some parts of Asia, intersex people have been allowed to amend sex details on birth certificates or other official documents.

CASE STUDY: CHANGING AN INTERSEX PERSON\u2019S TITLE The National Human Rights Commission of Thailand has recently examined government regulations related to changing an intersex person\u2019s title in the civil registration records. Following a request from the Commission, the Department of Public Administration has enabled intersex people to \u2018correct\u2019 their honorific titles if they have undergone surgery. This has set a precedent and resulted in guidelines for officials in handling these matters. The Commission has subsequently organised several public fora to promote understanding of how intersex people can change their title in accordance with the operating procedures manual developed by the Department.340 Thai intersex activist Nada Chaiyajit has stressed the importance of the Commission\u2019s role in raising awareness about intersex people, as distinct from transgender people, and both groups\u2019 right to legal recognition. This creates a starting point to push for all intersex people to enjoy these rights, not only those who meet the current restrictive medical requirements.341 82 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions In 2008, the Philippines Supreme Court confirmed the right of an intersex person to change the sex marked on his birth certificate from female to male. This was based on naturally occurring physical changes as this intersex person\u2019s body matured.342 The Court acknowledged a role for self-identification, stating that \u201cwhere the person is biologically or naturally intersex\u201d it was reasonable to allow them to determine their own gender as their body matured.343 The Court considered that the intersex man had allowed \u201cnature to take its course\u201d and had not interfered with what \u201che was born with\u201d.344 The April 2014 Indian Supreme Court decision affirming the right to gender recognition for hijras and transgender people may have relevance to intersex people, at least to the extent that some intersex people in India identify as, or are perceived to be, hijras.345 Even when identity details are corrected or updated in official documents, laws may place limitations on the circumstances in which those sex or gender details are recognised. The International Intersex Forum has highlighted the need to \u201cto ensure the provision of all human rights and citizenship rights to intersex people, including the right to marry and form a family\u201d.346 In this region, prevailing societal attitudes or other laws may limit the extent to which an intersex person\u2019s sex is recognised, including whether they can marry as that sex. 347 The 2013 amendments to New Zealand\u2019s Marriage Act clarified that a marriage is between two people regardless of their sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity.348 An intersex person is free to marry someone of any sex and the legality of the marriage cannot be questioned because of either partner\u2019s intersex status. 342 Republic of Philippines v. Jennifer Cagandahan 2008; see International Commission of Jurists, Sexual orientation, gender identity and justice: A comparative law casebook, 2011, Chapter 6. 343 Gender, not sex, is the term used in this case. In this region, and internationally, the terms \u2018sex\u2019 and \u2018gender\u2019 are used interchangeably in many jurisdictions. 344 This contrasts with a 2007 Supreme Court decision in Silverio v.

It recommended that intersex adults should have the right to choose to amend sex details on official documents, based solely on self-identification, without any requirements for medical treatment and without the need to resort to a court process. For intersex children, the only additional requirement was that the child should have the support of their parent or legal guardian, taking into account the evolving capacities and best interests of the child.349 The Australian intersex organization, OII Australia, has recommended that: \u2022 third classifications should not include the term \u2018intersex\u2019, to prevent the involuntary assignment of intersex people to a third sex or gender classification \u2022 \u2018non-binary\u2019 is a preferred third sex or gender classification, rather than \u2018unspecified\u2019 or \u2018indeterminate\u2019 \u2022 the policy goal should be that sex or gender, like race and religion, will no longer appear on birth certificates \u2022 in the meantime, people who are able to give voluntary and informed consent should be free to choose a gender marker through a simple administrative procedure.350 349 Intersex Trust Aotearoa New Zealand, Submission to the New Zealand\u2019s second Universal Periodic Review, June 2013. 350 OII Australia, Submission to the Australian Human Rights Commission: Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Intersex Rights Snapshot Report, February 2015; The Sex and Gender Advisory Group, Submission to the Commonwealth Attorney-General\u2019s Department Review of the Australian Government Guidelines on the Recognition of Sex and Gender, 24 September 2015.

CASE STUDY: RECOGNISING INTERSEX PEOPLE\u2019S RIGHTS AND NEEDS In January 2008, the New Zealand Human Rights Commission published the report of its Transgender Inquiry. The Inquiry did not intend to encompass the human rights experiences of intersex people but submissions from intersex people raised significant human rights issues. These highlighted the need for greater education and more dialogue about the human rights of intersex people. As a result, the Commission worked in partnership with the Intersex Trust Aotearoa New Zealand (ITANZ) to run workshops with Commission staff and externally as part of its human rights community development program.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dfe2fb87-b767-45d8-9a4b-363333b2391a": {"__data__": {"id_": "dfe2fb87-b767-45d8-9a4b-363333b2391a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6e1ff5f03d71f878f4f4d2dd8d0474634e42b13c0e2e0c22f0b923b309c77c37"}, "2": {"node_id": "102c9508-3ba0-42ef-822a-073422869a5f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3c76b20c2e32c4bfd0996ab07fc8a41d8540e24ea3b240861d8b69292df0089f"}}, "hash": "6b0e6deb7c34c86f35dc505b325e84f3e6b41a04444cda882f9de1ec1f0583b8", "text": "Other workshops were held with counsellors, as part of a leadership program for senior school students, and as community sessions in provincial cities and rural communities.

EFFECTIVE REMEDIES AND REDRESS In a climate of secrecy and shame, human rights violations are seldom discussed and even more rarely investigated or prosecuted. \u201cThe result is impunity for the perpetrators; lack of remedy for victims; and a perpetuating cycle of ignorance and abuse.\u201d354 Invisibility is reinforced in situations where historical records have been destroyed.355 Accountability for human rights violations includes access to complaints mechanisms. To be effective in protecting the human rights of all people, NHRIs and other agencies that receive complaints need to demonstrate an understanding of the issues that intersex people face and how they are distinct from discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation. Confidentiality is very important, particularly if agencies are seeking to collect and report on complaints received from intersex people.356 Accountability includes access to remedies and redress. In 2011, the Committee against Torture urged Germany to investigate incidents of surgical and other medical treatment of intersex people without their consent and to adopt legal provisions to provide redress, including adequate compensation.357 Intersex NGOs have called for \u201cadequate acknowledgement of the suffering and injustice caused to intersex people in the past, adequate redress, reparation, access to justice and the right to truth\u201d.358 Similarly, a 2014 UN interagency statement identified a series of suggested actions to address forced or coerced sterilisation, including against intersex people. One such action is to: Recognise past or present policies, patterns or practices of coercive sterilization, and issue statements of regret or apology to victims, as components of the right to remedy for these practices.359 Accountability also requires effective monitoring and evaluation of human rights situations, particularly for marginalised groups. In September 2015, OHCHR, in its first fact sheet on the human rights issues faced by intersex people, included action points, one of which called on NHRIs to \u201cresearch and monitor the human rights situation of intersex people\u201d.360 NHRIs internationally have already committed to building an evidence base on some of these issues, in the context of their work to promote and protect the human rights of women and girls. At their international conference in 2012, NHRIs committed themselves to the Amman Declaration and Programme of Action, which sets out broad principles and action points to be implemented over the following decade. One of these activities was to encourage and support the compilation of an evidence base on the right to sexual and reproductive health. This would include gathering data, conducting inquiries and undertaking research on \u201cforced sterilization \u2026 female genital mutilation/cutting, biased sex selection and other harmful practices.\u201d361 This would provide an invaluable opportunity to include the specific experiences of intersex people, whose sterilisation and genital mutilation is impacted by binary sex stereotypes. At a broader level, accountability also requires participation by intersex people and their organisations in all decision-making processes that affect their human rights. NHRIs are well placed to facilitate dialogue between intersex organisations and state actors. 354 Opening remarks by High Commissioner for Human Rights, Expert meeting on ending human rights violations against intersex persons, 16 September 2015, Geneva. 355 New Zealand Human Rights Commission, \u2018Intersex People\u2019 in To Be Who I Am: Report of the Inquiry into Discrimination Experienced by Intersex People, 2008, Chapter 7.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3dfa43ad-fc4f-406c-94be-6edcc86a90b8": {"__data__": {"id_": "3dfa43ad-fc4f-406c-94be-6edcc86a90b8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a6e62628cb2492077498d1280c2d56520b59b5683bd5510c17e73d29a1de6bb8"}, "2": {"node_id": "f14d5f54-4e23-43fe-b839-c777db91b6c9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d9776e2b7f87144a4f32f318f7f4bb8554cb6f2c07c0c52b249b164b30b4e03b"}}, "hash": "7a6f233020a61b62b4861a388a5be2fb2f4d1fc421d2957e92398c66cb2b1ae2", "text": "356 M.

KEY POINTS: CHAPTER 4 \u2022 Intersex traits are relatively common and intersex people exist in all parts of the Asia Pacific region. Stigma has created an environment where their existence and the human rights violations against them have been largely ignored. \u2022 Intersex people often experience human rights violations because their bodies are different. These include so-called \u2018sex-normalising\u2019 surgeries or hormone treatment on infants and children, that are medically unnecessary and typically performed when a child is too young to be involved in the decision-making process. These practices violate the right to physical integrity and have been described by human rights bodies as forms of torture or ill-treatment and as harmful practices. \u2022 Fear and discrimination can never justify human rights abuses, including forced medical treatment. States have a duty to combat harmful stereotypes and discrimination against intersex people. \u2022 Typically, female genital mutilation laws do not apply to surgical interventions on intersex girls. Intersex NGOs have called for so-called \u2018sex-normalising\u2019 surgeries on intersex children to be recognised as genital mutilation. \u2022 Intersex people have the same rights as others to freedom from discrimination. There are very few countries in this region that have anti- discrimination laws that specifically prohibit discrimination against intersex people or that clearly state their rights protection under other prohibited grounds. This leaves intersex people vulnerable to discrimination. \u2022 It is good practice for intersex infants to be registered as either female or male at birth with the understanding that, like all people, they may grow up to identify with a different sex or gender. However, in this region, intersex people who have been issued a male or a female birth certificate do not always enjoy the same legal rights as others. \u2022 Some intersex people seek to amend their sex or gender details on official documents because those details were either inaccurate at birth and/or no longer reflect their sex or gender identity. Many face barriers trying to amend these details, which also undermines their right to recognition before the law. Some laws in this region only allow intersex people to change their sex details on official documents if they have had so-called \u2018sex- normalising\u2019 surgeries. This erases bodily diversity and undermines intersex people\u2019s human rights. \u2022 Violations of intersex people\u2019s rights should be investigated and alleged perpetrators prosecuted. Intersex people should have access to effective remedies, including redress and compensation. They should be consulted in the development of laws and policies that impact on their rights. Many other human rights agencies and LGBT groups talk about intersex in their reports, but they lack our voices. There are many misunderstandings that need to be corrected.

Chapter 5: International and regional developments in human rights law | 89 Part II International human rights law The UDHR repeatedly uses this universal language. \u2018Everyone\u2019 is entitled to rights; \u2018no one\u2019 is to be subjected to a violation of a right. From the very beginning, universality has been a fundamental principle of international human rights law. Universality was challenged in the early 1990s in debates about cultural relativism. Some governments argued that rights varied from culture to culture, either regionally (\u2018Asian values\u2019, \u2018African customs\u2019, \u2018European individualism\u2019) or nationally (\u2018Chinese characteristics\u2019, \u2018American exceptionalism\u2019). In June 1993, the Second World Conference on Human Rights brought together the largest assembly of States to discuss human rights. It re-affirmed unambiguously and without dissent that human rights are \u201cthe birthright of all human beings\u201d364 and that \u201c[a]ll human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent and interrelated\u201d.365 The World Conference recognised that there are historical, cultural and religious differences (\u2018particularities\u2019) that affect the application of human rights but it proclaimed that human rights are nonetheless universal: While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical, cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind, it is the duty of States, regardless of their political, economic and cultural systems, to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms.366 All people are entitled to all human rights. Human rights are not \u2018gay rights\u2019 or \u2018lesbian rights\u2019 or \u2018straight rights\u2019 or \u2018transgender rights\u2019 or \u2018intersex rights\u2019 but human rights. They are rights to which everyone is entitled, whatever their sexual orientation or gender identity or sex characteristics, because they are human beings. 5.2. LEGAL RECOGNITION OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL, TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE 5.2.1. Inclusion in the law Although from the beginning human rights were recognised as universal, their application to people of diverse sexual orientations, gender identities and sex characteristics was not in the minds of the drafters of the key international human rights instruments. Many other specific categories (or dimensions) of humanity were, however, in their minds and so, when declaring and protecting the right to equality and the right not to be discriminated against, they referred specifically to some of these categories. Therefore, the UDHR provides that: Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.367 There are similar provisions in the two human rights covenants, the foundational human rights treaties. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) provides: Each State Party to the present Covenant undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the present Covenant, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.368 364 Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action 1993, Part I, para. 1. 365 Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action 1993, Part I, para. 5.

There is a slight difference in wording, however. The UDHR and ICCPR prohibit \u2018distinction of any kind, such as \u2026\u2019 and \u2018discrimination on any ground such as \u2026\u2019 and then list the categories.371 The ICESCR prohibits \u2018discrimination of any kind as to \u2026\u2019. The words \u2018such as\u2019 indicate that the categories that follow are examples of categories of prohibited distinction and that the lists are not intended to be exclusive and closed; that is, the listed categories are not intended to be the only grounds on which distinction is prohibited. The inclusion of \u2018or other status\u2019 in all the instruments ensures that all are to be interpreted inclusively; that is, as not limiting the areas of prohibited distinction by excluding categories that are not listed. This understanding has been explicitly stated by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights: The inclusion of \u201cother status\u201d indicates that this list is not exhaustive and other grounds may be incorporated in this category.372 The failure to include specific reference to the categories of sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics in the instruments does not mean that these categories are not included or that the rights in the instruments do not extend to persons of diverse sexual orientations, gender identities and sex characteristics. On the contrary, the fundamental principle of universality ensures that all human beings are entitled to all human rights. In December 2008, the then High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, summarised the legal position well in a statement to the UN General Assembly: The UDHR is not just aspirational \u2013 most of the rights are customary law, with universal applicability. Whilst there is clarity in its terms, there has been resistance to its implementation and sadly, 60 years later we are still having to face the contention that whilst it applies to everyone it does not do so equally: the ageless clich\u00e9 that everyone is equal but some are more equal than others is not acceptable. \u2026 There has been considerable progress in terms of legal recognition, including the interpretations by treaty bodies, in particular the Human Rights Committee and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. There is now a considerable body of decisions affirming that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is contrary to international human rights law. The position of the human rights courts is becoming similarly homogenous \u2026 \u2026 there are those who argue that because sexual orientation or gender identity are not explicitly mentioned in any of the conventions and covenants, there would be no protection. My response is that such a position is untenable in legal terms, which is confirmed by the evolving jurisprudence. The principle of universality admits no exception. Human rights truly are the birthright of all human beings.373 369 ICCPR, article 26. 370 ICESCR, article 2.2. 371 Here and elsewhere in this paragraph, the emphasis has been added to words in the original texts. 372 Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, General Comment 20: Non-discrimination in economic, social and cultural rights, E/C.12/GC/20, para. 15. 373 See http://arc-international.net/global-advocacy/sogi-statements/hc-ga-200.

It is the product of an evolving understanding of the law that has developed as serious violations of human rights have been brought to the attention of international human rights bodies and mechanisms. As the distinct experiences of different groups of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people have been identified, the application of universal human rights law to their experiences has been recognised and affirmed, where it was not previously seen or accepted. This process has been uneven and sometimes it has occurred at unexpected times or in unexpected forums and even now it is incomplete. This uneven process is seen in the issues that have been addressed. Human rights issues concerning sexual orientation were first raised in the 1990s and started to be recognised then.374 Gender identity was at first not recognised as raising distinct issues and was not regularly recognised until the mid 2000s. The distinct issues relating to sex characteristics have only been acknowledged in the past few years. The Human Rights Council resolutions of 2011 and 2014 refer only to sexual orientation and gender identity and request studies of human rights issues only in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity.375 Yet when the High Commissioner for Human Rights produced the second report in 2015 it dealt not only with sexual orientation and gender identity but also violations of the rights of intersex people.376 The High Commissioner later said: While our recent report to the Human Rights Council focused \u2013 as mandated \u2013 on violations based on sexual orientation and gender identity, it also highlighted specific violations faced by intersex people, and made a number of specific recommendations to States.377 The unevenness is also reflected in the various international human rights mechanisms. Certainly more and more mechanisms raise human rights issues concerning sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics more frequently. However, some are better at identifying issues associated with one particular category \u2013 generally sexual orientation \u2013 than the others. For example, the Committee against Torture, the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Committee on the Rights of the Child have been significant in identifying human rights issues associated with sex characteristics when other mechanisms still do not see these issues.378 374 Human Rights Committee, Toonen v. Australia, 4 April 1994, CCPR/C/50/D/488/1992. 375 Resolution 17/19, A/HRC/17/L.9/Rev.1, adopted 17 June 2011; and Resolution 27/32, A/HRC/27/L.27/Rev.1, adopted 26 September 2014.

The same unevenness is also seen in the results of the Human Rights Council\u2019s Universal Periodic Review (UPR). While human rights issues in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity are now being raised, there has still not been specific recognition of the rights of intersex people in any UPR recommendation. Further, unevenness is seen in the evolving understandings of the diversity in sexual orientations, gender identities and sex characteristics. Distinct issues arise in each category. Distinct issues also arise in relation to overlapping or multiple categorisation. The international mechanisms are slowly coming to appreciate the diversity of these issues. This chapter discusses the approaches of international legal mechanisms and political forums. The unevenness is apparent in the record to date.

Their insights are now likely to influence the work of the other committees. The mixed record of the treaty monitoring bodies, evident from the statistics, indicates the need for closer exchange and collaboration among them to ensure that fundamental human rights in relation to sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics are promoted and protected fully. 5.3.2. Concluding observations Every State party to a human rights treaty must submit periodic reports to the treaty monitoring body on its implementation of the treaty, which is then examined by the members of the treaty monitoring body. The treaty monitoring body issues its concluding observations, with findings and recommendations, after the examination of the State. Issues of sexual orientation and gender identity, and more recently of sex characteristics, are now raised during this process and feature in a number of the concluding observations.383 The Human Rights Committee was the first to raise these issues and has been the most active in doing so. The Human Rights Committee first raised sexual orientation in a concluding observation in 1993, the year before the Toonen decision, when it welcomed Norway\u2019s legislative steps towards registration of same-sex partnerships.384 In 2013, it made comments in concluding observations on 12 State reports and, in 2014, in concluding observations on 14 State reports.385 The practice of other treaty monitoring bodies has been uneven but in most cases similar. The exception among the six older committees is the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. That Committee referred to sexual orientation in concluding observations on five State reports between 2006 and 2009 but not since. Those five occasions all consisted of referring to domestic legislation that prohibited discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation, among other grounds.386 The Committee has provided no views of its own on the issue. The very recent attention to issues associated with sex characteristics has been significant. A number of treaty monitoring bodies have made specific reference to intersex issues, beginning in 2009.387 The first observation was relatively minor, concerning dialogue with \u2018non-governmental organizations of intersexual and transsexual people\u2019.388 Since then, comments have been stronger and focused on serious human rights issues, including: \u2022 abuse of intersex women389 \u2022 the right to health of intersex persons390 382 These recent decisions are discussed below in this chapter. 383 See Table 2, above. 384 Human Rights Committee, Concluding Observations: Norway, 4

more than any other. At its 56th session in December 2015, it made comments in respect of four States: Austria, China, China (Hong Kong) and Denmark.398 Other committees have followed the approach of the Committee Against Torture; for example, the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Committee on the Rights of the Child.399 Early in 2016, the Committee on the Rights of the Child raised the issue of surgical procedures on intersex children again in the concluding observations on Ireland and France.400 There has only been one treaty body reference to gender expression. That was in the context of the concluding observations on Finland, where the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women said: The Committee welcomes the proposed amendment to the Act on Equality between Women and Men, which expands the definition of sex and gender-based discrimination to include discrimination based on gender identity and gender expression.401 5.3.3. Individual communications Although the first reference to sexual orientation by a treaty monitoring body was a positive comment in a concluding observation in 1993, the inclusion of violations of the rights of lesbian and gay persons in international human rights jurisprudence first occurred in response to individual communications (complaints). Complainants raised issues of violation that forced the committees to consider the scope of international human rights law and led to the first decisions that recognised the application of the law to violations based on sexual orientation. The Human Rights Committee has the oldest and largest body of jurisprudence arising from individual communications.

Chapter 5: International and regional developments in human rights law | 97 Part II International human rights law international human rights law in relation to sexual orientation.402 It did so in an individual communication by Nicholas Toonen, a gay man, objecting to laws in the Australian state of Tasmania that criminalised homosexual conduct.403 In its conclusions on that communication, the Committee considered a number of legal and factual issues. First, it considered the right to privacy under article 17 of the ICCPR and concluded: In so far as article 17 is concerned, it is undisputed that adult consensual sexual activity in private is covered by the concept of \u201cprivacy\u201d, and that Mr. Toonen is actually and currently affected by the continued existence of the Tasmanian laws.404 Second, it considered the anti-discrimination provision in article 2 and the equality provision in article 26 of the ICCPR: The State party has sought the Committee\u2019s guidance as to whether sexual orientation may be considered an \u201cother status\u201d for the purposes of article 26. The same issue could arise under article 2, paragraph 1, of the Covenant. The Committee confines itself to noting, however, that in its view, the reference to \u201csex\u201d in articles 2, paragraph 1, and 26 is to be taken as including sexual orientation.405 This position perhaps reflects the limited understanding at the time of the nature of sexual orientation.

However, the Committee decided to consider \u2018sex\u2019 as including sexual orientation.406 The Human Rights Committee has considered these issues further in several other communications since the Toonen case. In these later cases it has not repeated its approach in Toonen in defining \u2018sex\u2019 to include sexual orientation. On the contrary, it has identified sexual orientation as a ground of prohibited discrimination in itself and it has relied on the broad equality provision in article 26 of the ICCPR in doing so. In Young v Australia, the Committee considered a situation in which a same-sex partner was denied a benefit that would have been payable to a different sex partner in the same position. It said in its decision that: The Committee recalls its constant jurisprudence that not every distinction amounts to prohibited discrimination under the Covenant, as long as it is based on reasonable and objective criteria. The State party provides no arguments on how this distinction between same-sex partners, who are excluded from pension benefits under law, and unmarried heterosexual partners, who are granted such benefits, is reasonable and objective, and no evidence which would point to the existence of factors justifying such a distinction has been advanced.407 The Committee subsequently applied this approach in relation to sexual orientation to other rights under the ICCPR: \u2022 freedom from torture; article 7408 \u2022 freedom of expression; article 19409 \u2022 freedom of peaceful assembly; article 21.410 402 The facts of the communication did not include gender identity or sex characteristics and so the Committee\u2019s conclusions do not extend directly beyond sexual orientation. However, because of its statements on the universality of human rights and the inclusiveness of the treaty\u2019s scope, the decision has clear implications for the international human rights law\u2019s coverage of gender identity and sex characteristics. 403 Human Rights Committee, Toonen v Australia, 4 April 1994, CCPR/C/50/D/488/1992. 404 Ibid, para. 8.2. 405 Ibid, para. 8.7. 406 The Human Rights Committee did not discuss gender identity or sex characteristics. Sex characteristics could be appropriately considered as included within the definition of \u2018sex\u2019. The interpretation of \u2018sex\u2019 in some domestic laws in the Asia Pacific region is now taken to include sex characteristics. 407 Human Rights Committee, Young v Australia, 18 September 2003, CCPR/C/78/D/941/2000, para. 10.4. 408 Human Rights Committee, M.

In Mondal v Sweden, it found that the deportation of the complainant to Bangladesh would violate the treaty because of the risk of torture on the basis, among other things, of his sexual orientation.412 There is no communications jurisprudence on gender identity or intersex status. 5.3.4. General comments The greater awareness of these issues in the treaty monitoring bodies is also reflected in the inclusion of references to sexual orientation, gender identity and, on two occasions only, sex characteristics in 18 general comments and recommendations. The Human Rights Committee has issued 35 general comments. It has made reference to sexual orientation and gender identity in only one, its most recent one, in 2014: General Comment 35 on liberty and security of the person under article 9 of the ICCPR.

Chapter 5: International and regional developments in human rights law | 99 Part II International human rights law The nature of discrimination varies according to context and evolves over time. A flexible approach to the ground of \u201cother status\u201d is thus needed to capture other forms of differential treatment that cannot be reasonably and objectively justified and are of a comparable nature to the expressly recognised grounds in article 2(2). These additional grounds are commonly recognised when they reflect the experience of social groups that are vulnerable and have suffered and continue to suffer marginalisation. The Committee\u2019s General Comments and Concluding Observations have recognised various other grounds and these are described in more detail below. However, this list is not intended to be exhaustive.418 Then it discussed \u2018sexual orientation and gender identity\u2019 specifically:419 \u201cOther status\u201d as recognized in article 2, paragraph 2, includes sexual orientation. States parties should ensure that a person\u2019s sexual orientation is not a barrier to realizing Covenant rights, for example, in accessing survivor\u2019s pension rights. In addition, gender identity is recognized as among the prohibited grounds of discrimination; for example, persons who are transgender, transsexual or intersex often face serious human rights violations, such as harassment in schools or in the workplace.420 Significantly, the Committee gives specific recognition to \u2018sexual orientation\u2019, \u2018gender identity\u2019 and \u2018intersex\u2019. It distinguishes between sexual orientation and gender identity, discussing gender identity \u2018in addition\u2019 to sexual orientation. However, intersex status has no separate reference in the heading of the paragraph and \u2018persons who are transgender, transsexual or intersex\u2019 are all discussed as an example of gender identity. Intersex status, now increasingly referred to as \u2018sex characteristics\u2019, was originally framed in this way in discussions in international human rights bodies. It is now more appropriately seen as another and distinct \u2018status\u2019 in its own right and so a distinct ground of prohibited discrimination.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7af14ca9-a035-4e76-b379-83d641725bbc": {"__data__": {"id_": "7af14ca9-a035-4e76-b379-83d641725bbc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "acc8f000e4206a5af8c5092fefcf04203cdb5eff5993242572bf171a7f5813b1"}, "2": {"node_id": "a63e83e6-2097-44d7-b2ad-be32cae1dfe8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ffa383002ec9b0c1bf0f119e5b352507495110a8b2dfeb19cac94b0ec59bae06"}}, "hash": "b8a2e09438cdd7403d2b4e4a086046a01a2168d089b5b7350927e09b7799cf0f", "text": "The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has issued 33 general recommendations, of which one makes specific reference to sexual orientation, gender identity and intersex status, three refer to sexual orientation and gender identity, and one refers to sexual orientation alone.421 In two general recommendations issued on the same day in 2010, the Committee referred for the first time in a general recommendation to sexual orientation and gender identity, doing so in the context of \u2018intersectionality\u2019; that is, the interaction of two or more factors affecting women\u2019s enjoyment of human rights.422 Intersectionality is also raised in a later general recommendation relating to refugee status.423 Discussion of intersectionality incorporated the first reference to \u2018intersex person\u2019 in the recent General Recommendation 33 in 2015: \u2026 discrimination against women is compounded by intersecting factors that affect some", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "53a86811-c7a5-4b22-8515-8445338cc105": {"__data__": {"id_": "53a86811-c7a5-4b22-8515-8445338cc105", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "80a2780e65994ec83b26f3556bcbb0ac6a9a530559a681ed1167da913933948b"}, "3": {"node_id": "0e3fa49e-cc32-49db-a1b8-b2e41dd3fa36", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a4ae8a80d34a2103cea26915de634037b203c7e1779bfd12aae3f6032ab4fc1c"}}, "hash": "2ff986053609a0ecdeb259f66f86f9f1b37ea03195e83131556b688018d48ca6", "text": "women to degrees or in ways that differ from those affecting men or other women.

However, where they are recognized, whether as a de facto union, registered partnership or marriage, the State party should ensure protection of economic rights of the women in these relationships.426 In 2014, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women issued a joint general recommendation \u2013 general comment with the Committee on the Rights of the Child in which the two committees discuss human rights violations arising from \u201cstereotyped sex- and gender-based roles\u201d.

In addition to this general recommendation \u2013 general comment, the Committee on the Rights of the Child has referred to sexual orientation or gender identity in five other general comments: two refer to sexual orientation and gender identity and three refer to sexual orientation alone. It first expressed concern about discrimination based on sexual orientation in its general comment on HIV/AIDS and the rights of children.428 Soon afterwards it defined the right to non-discrimination as including a prohibition of discrimination based on \u201cadolescents\u2019 sexual orientation\u201d.429 In a later general comment in 2013, gender identity was specifically included as well as

Here the Committee makes clear that the diversity of children must be taken into account in determining the child\u2019s best interests. Respect for the child\u2019s identity is itself a basic human right. Sexual orientation is included specifically as part of a child\u2019s identity. Although there is no specific reference to gender identity, it must by definition be a critical aspect of identity. Children are not a homogeneous group and therefore diversity must be taken into account when assessing their best interests. The identity of the child includes characteristics such as sex, sexual orientation, national origin, religion and beliefs, cultural identity, personality. Although children and young people share basic universal needs, the expression of those needs depends on a wide range of personal, physical, social and cultural aspects, including their evolving capacities. The right of the child to preserve his or her identity is guaranteed by the Convention (art. 8) and must be respected and taken into consideration in the assessment of the child\u2019s best interests.432 The Committee against Torture has issued only three general comments. In two of the three it has raised issues of both sexual orientation and gender identity. In General Comment 2 in 2008 it said: The protection of certain minority or marginalized individuals or populations especially at risk of torture is a part of the obligation to prevent torture or ill-treatment. States parties must ensure that, insofar as the obligations arising under the Convention are concerned, their laws are in practice applied to all persons, regardless of \u2026 sexual orientation, transgender identity ... States parties should, therefore, ensure the protection of members of groups especially at risk of being tortured, by fully prosecuting and punishing all acts of violence and abuse against these

be subject to violations of the Convention on the basis of their actual or perceived non-conformity with socially determined gender roles ...434 In General Comment 3 in 2012, the Committee reiterated its inclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people as a group especially vulnerable to torture: States parties shall ensure that access to justice and to mechanisms for seeking and obtaining redress are readily available and that positive measures ensure that redress is equally accessible to all persons regardless of \u2026 sexual orientation, gender identity, \u2026435 States parties shall ensure due attention to gender in providing all the elements cited above in the process of ensuring that everybody, in particular members of groups made vulnerable, including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people, must be treated fairly and equally and obtain fair and adequate compensation, rehabilitation and other reparative measures which respond to their specific needs.436 Through their work in issuing general comments on the interpretation of treaties, concluding observations on State reports of treaty implementation and views on individual communications, treaty monitoring bodies have made it very clear that: \u2022 all the rights contained in human rights treaties apply equally to everyone, including people of diverse sexual orientations and gender

THE VIEWS AND APPROACHES OF THE SPECIAL PROCEDURES OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL The Human Rights Council is the UN\u2019s highest body with specialist responsibility for human rights. It has a very broad mandate for the promotion and protection of human rights. One of the functions of the Human Rights Council is the establishment of special procedures, independent human rights experts appointed to: \u2022 study and increase understanding of a particular human rights matter or situation \u2022 receive information and report on particular human rights violations.437 Their mandates can relate to a specific human rights issue or theme (\u2018thematic mandates\u2019) or to the human rights situation in a specific country (\u2018country mandates\u2019). At the end of March 2015, there were 55 special procedures: 41 with thematic mandates and 14 with country mandates.438 Each can deal with issues within the scope of the mandate that relate to the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people. Many special procedure mandate holders have taken up human rights issues affecting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and, more recently, intersex people, showing both the range of human rights whose enjoyment is affected by sexual orientation, gender identity or sex characteristics and the breadth of concern among special procedures about the ability of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people to enjoy their human rights fully. The special procedures who have addressed these issues include those on: \u2022 torture \u2022 extra-judicial, summary or arbitrary executions \u2022 arbitrary detention \u2022 human rights defenders \u2022 minorities \u2022 violence against women \u2022 discrimination against women in law and in practice \u2022 freedom of assembly and association \u2022 freedom of expression \u2022 terrorism \u2022 the right to the highest attainable standard of health \u2022 housing \u2022 cultural rights.439 437 For more extensive discussions of the special procedures, see APF, International Human Rights and the International Human Rights System: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions, 2012, Chapter 7; at www.asiapacificforum.net/resources/ manual-on-international-human-rights-system/. 438 For further information on the special procedures, see www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/SP/Pages/Welcomepage.aspx.

Both contain links to websites for individual mandates and to reports of the mandate holders. 439 The International Commission of Jurists database summarises and provides links to special procedures\u2019 reports that refer to issues of sexual orientation and gender identity; see www.icj.org/sogi-un-database/. Chapter 5: International and regional developments in human rights law | 103 Part II International human rights law In 2015, a special procedure on the right to privacy was established and the first Special Rapporteur appointed.440 Without doubt, many human rights issues affecting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people will be raised with this new special procedure. Persons are generally appointed to special procedures mandates for two terms of three years. The turnover of mandate holders has, however, not affected the level of concern for the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and, more recently, intersex people. On the contrary, there has been remarkable consistency in the concern and increasing focus on violations based on sexual orientation, gender identity or sex characteristics. The special procedures have addressed these issues in international forums and succeeded in compelling these forums to discuss them, even if reluctant to do so or hostile.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4fddc2fd-0c59-4af5-a1cf-4260bb34992a": {"__data__": {"id_": "4fddc2fd-0c59-4af5-a1cf-4260bb34992a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "42d5d75815d37f5d63169c6ef622665559a5af7bf7c8b9e0d8e45bcabbee2cd1"}, "2": {"node_id": "fd7e95be-4b5e-4c20-931a-849d71615d1c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "215c40c74af65884f127ad28bb5c8d0c2e61a7d21079d13b42a5cc40a4dd9bba"}}, "hash": "e8a20914ca727725f7168386d09c74286ccec7a143e5b1e26c850e4dac58e6f9", "text": "Three mandates can provide examples of how the special procedures pursue issues of sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics: the first relating to extra-judicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the second relating to human rights defenders and the third relating to the right to health.

More recently, they have also referred to gender identity. The most recent resolution of the General Assembly, in 2014, urges States to: \u2026 ensure the effective protection of the right to life of all persons, to conduct, when required by obligations under international law, prompt, exhaustive and impartial investigations into all killings, including those targeted at specific groups of persons, such as \u2026 because of their sexual orientation or gender identity \u2026443 The work of this Special Rapporteur has included significant reference to the human rights of gay and lesbian people since 1995, when the Special Rapporteur made a joint visit to Colombia with the Special Rapporteur on torture. The two rapporteurs reported: In addition to criminals, persons from other sectors of the population whose presence was considered undesirable became the targets of such killings: prostitutes, homosexuals, beggars, drug consumers and street children. The killings are often preceded by torture, allegedly with the purpose of making it impossible to identify the victim (and therefore to carry out an investigation) and sending an intimidatory message to the above sectors. Several sources expressed their concern to the Special Rapporteurs that, over the years, \u201csocial cleansing\u201d had become more and more accepted and acceptable, as a solution to the question of how to deal with marginalized sectors of the population. The qualification \u201cdesechables\u201d (disposable) for those regarded as undesirable has gained legitimacy.444 The annual report of the Special Rapporteur in 1999 discussed, for the first time, executions based on sexual orientation and gender identity generally as a widespread problem in many States. It also commented on the imposition of the death penalty for same-sex conduct under national criminal laws: The Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned by numerous and continuing reports of persons having been killed or sentenced to death because of their sexual orientation. She is particularly disturbed by reports from Brazil, Colombia and Mexico, where so-called \u201cdeath-squads\u201d have over the last years reportedly murdered a large of number of persons belonging to sexual minorities. The Special Rapporteur has been informed that in the period from 1991 to 1994, 12 homosexual men were killed by armed groups in the city of Tuxtla Guti\u00e9rrez, Mexico. It appears that the perpetrators of these killings were never identified, and it is alleged that the authorities failed to carry out thorough and complete investigations into these crimes. The Special Rapporteur has also received reports that in the last several years hundreds of so- called \u201csocial undesirables\u201d, including many homosexuals and transvestites, have been killed by armed groups in Colombia. In Brazil it is reported that hundreds of persons belonging to sexual minorities have been murdered in the last 10 years. It is alleged that the Brazilian and Colombian authorities have not taken adequate action to find and prosecute the persons responsible for these crimes. The Special Rapporteur regrets that in some States homosexual relationships are still punishable by death. In this regard she wishes to recall that under article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, death sentences may only be imposed for the most serious crimes. As discussed above in chapter V, section A (3), this restriction clearly excludes matters of sexual orientation. The Special Rapporteur further believes that criminalizing matters of sexual orientation increases the social stigmatization of members of sexual minorities, which in turn makes them more vulnerable to violence and human rights abuses, including violations of the right to life. Because of this stigmatization, violent acts directed against persons belonging to sexual minorities are also more likely to be committed in a climate of impunity.445 The Special Rapporteur has dealt with executions based on sexual orientation and gender identity in annual reports to the Human Rights Council, in country visits and in communications on individual cases.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "386735df-39fa-464d-9709-f370cee6a095": {"__data__": {"id_": "386735df-39fa-464d-9709-f370cee6a095", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "43c877e2ae5760979456860fc6b38707b95564475c18356856e92c1df8c341a4"}, "2": {"node_id": "fc14c0a7-0f05-4559-b2b8-4df95ba0de88", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5243f5f13eac8e6909c1398c382066be8235b656858cebf4a8871724c0c9652f"}}, "hash": "c32c8bbd0d5b0a002a3b7f0b861195eff05828c19896c5328b21be57b10d8a5b", "text": "443 General Assembly resolution 69/182, A/RES/69/182, para. 6(b). 444 Joint report of the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions: Colombia, 16 January 1995, E/CN.4/1995/111. 445 Report", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "50b9cac8-429b-4e0a-96af-18f08183b77e": {"__data__": {"id_": "50b9cac8-429b-4e0a-96af-18f08183b77e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "45e5a3be849ede6e34cdb12cb06dbc612e2b2a2fb9a60896b047812eea301575"}, "3": {"node_id": "e4e07c36-34ce-4378-a3b5-0cc9918908b5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "154a1a46d8e2191fd4b88077af6d9bb631672478557cf7465e7ad3f31ce15776"}}, "hash": "263de8130ccca9ba9a29bb31fef03c53595788e02ecd962f51ecaedf170b18f5", "text": "of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, 6 January 1999, E/CN.4/1999/39, paras. 76-77. Chapter 5: International and regional developments in human rights law | 105 Part II International human rights law The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders was established in 2000 and last renewed in 2014.446 The special procedure has shown a special regard for the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex defenders. This mandate has referred most often in public reports to issues of sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics (\u2018intersex\u2019).447 Most references are in reports of individual cases taken up by the Special Rapporteur or reports of visits by the Special Rapporteur to specific countries. In both cases the reports relate to those specific countries. Since the establishment of the mandate, the Special Rapporteur has reported on cases or situations of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex defenders in over 50 countries. The first mandate holder, Hina Jilani, raised issues associated with sexual orientation in her first annual report, saying that they required \u201cspecial attention\u201d: Greater risks are faced by defenders of the rights of certain groups as their work challenges social structures, traditional practices and interpretations of religious precepts that may have been used over long periods of time to condone and justify violation of the human rights of members of such groups. Of special importance will be women\u2019s human rights groups and those who are active on issues of sexuality, especially sexual orientation and reproductive rights. These groups are often very vulnerable to prejudice, to marginalization and to public repudiation, not only by State forces but by other social actors. The Special Representative will undertake or encourage studies of any such phenomena with a view to drawing up a compendium of possible measures to enhance the protection of such human rights defenders.448 She frequently discussed issues relating to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender defenders in subsequent annual reports.449 From the beginning of her mandate, she was investigating individual cases of extra-judicial killings of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.450 In July 2006, she attended and spoke at the First International Conference on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Human Rights, held in Montreal, Canada.451 The second mandate holder, Margaret Sekaggya, also referred to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender defenders in her first annual reports to the General Assembly and to the Human Rights Council.452 She reported that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender defenders \u201ccontinue to be at particular risk of attacks and violations\u201d.453 She also included in her reports specific reference to intersex people and groups.454 446 Respectively, Commission on Human Rights resolution 2000/61, E/CN.4/RES/2000/61; and Human Rights Council resolution 25/18, A/HRC/RES/25/18. The special procedure was originally called \u2018Special Representative of the Secretary General\u2019. It became \u2018Special Rapporteur\u2019 in 2008 by Human Rights Council resolution 7/8, A/HRC/RES/7/8.
