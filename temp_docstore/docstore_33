The aim of the strategy is to help realize the vision of productive and biologically diverse Mediterranean islands that can meet the long term needs of people and nature, stop further loss of biodiversity and assist in the recovery of threatened Mediterranean island biota by 2030. Addressed to public authorities, conser- vation bodies and relevant actors working throughout the Mediterranean region, it is hoped that the present strategy brings biodiversity to the forefront and highlights its importance as a key pillar for support- ing continued socioeconomic develop- ment and resilience of Mediterranean is- lands that will ensure a brighter tomorrow. The Mediterranean Islands Collective (MIC), financed by the MAVA foundation, has developed this strategy through ex- tensive collaboration with project part- ners, pilot projects, and in-depth consul- tations at national and regional level. The implementation and progression of the strategy will continue to be led by MIC partners, in a coordination role. However, it is strongly recognized that the respon- sibility for its delivery is shared across rel- evant regional and EU organisations, lo- cal and national governments, business, environmental and community groups and private individuals throughout the Mediterranean region. The strategy and action plan presented below is beneficial as it builds off proj- ects, work and initiatives that are already underway or have been trialled through- out the region, working to protect and care for coastal, marine and island en- vironments. Rather than re-inventing the wheel it is hoped that this strategy is seen to bring all this existing work together, adding leadership, greater coordination of efforts, and a fresh momentum at a much larger Mediterranean scale. Shaped by results of pilot projects and consultations, the Mediterranean islands strategy and action plan seeks to min- imise the threats facing the region\u2019s is- lands and maximise opportunities. The strategy sets out six strategic pillars and a range of actions and measures to help its delivery: Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean ix Actions will be aimed at: \u2022 Advancing inventories and map- ping of biodiversity hotspots at local level (species, habitats, ecosystem services) particularly on lesser re- searched islands, endangered spe- cies and taxa, and degraded sites; \u2022 Developing an integrated regional in- sular biodiversity database with the mapping of Key Island Biodiversity Areas; \u2022 Supporting local-based research ini- tiatives on biodiversity; \u2022 Helping local communities under- stand biodiversity conservation on the islands; \u2022 Sharing knowledge (data, best prac- tices, etc) using up-to-date commu- nication means at local, national and regional levels. Strengthen knowledge and raise awareness on Mediterranean islands 1 Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean x Actions will be aimed at: \u2022 Developing and implementing capac- ity-building programmes addressing specific needs on biodiversity conser- vation at local, national and regional levels; \u2022 Promoting initiatives engaging the so- cioeconomic sector on conserva- tion and sustainable use of biodiversity (e.g., sustainable nature-based tourism, fisheries, agriculture); \u2022 Training protected area managers and technicians on the fundamentals of a co-management approach. Embed capacity for biodiversity conservation and sustainable management at the island level 2 Actions will be aimed at: \u2022 Developing restoration initiatives on degraded sites and important habi- tats, species and ecosystems; \u2022 Enhancing marine invasive alien species control measures and pro- grammes; \u2022 Promoting co-management ap- proaches at the level of island based protected areas. Pilot the development and implementation of island- level joint initiatives in conservation and restoration of biodiversity and its ecosystems 3 Promote sustainable use of biodiversity and ecosystem services for living islands 4 Actions will be aimed at: \u2022 Supporting the inclusion of biodiver- sity conservation in all public, nation- al, and local policies, strategies and plans; \u2022 Facilitating stakeholders\u2019 participation and engagement in biodiversity con- servation actions; \u2022 Promoting citizen-science initiatives related to island biodiversity conser- vation; \u2022 Engaging with relevant sectors and developing environmentally sound, and economically viable, activities in the fields of tourism, agriculture and fishing at the local level (e.g., develop- ing circular economy dynamics, en- hancing local value chains, integrated water resource management).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2cf1eef4-422f-415d-aaff-8291fb6e2e64": {"__data__": {"id_": "2cf1eef4-422f-415d-aaff-8291fb6e2e64", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/living-islands-sustainable-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/living-islands-sustainable-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ba86193ce92a92c35ee517a334542dc6b8dd5c2725b053a08b9cbe375446c638"}, "2": {"node_id": "c824e26b-ef2a-4e6d-aa4a-9abcfd4f3929", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/living-islands-sustainable-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1a7df160c3dd6a807b9d4ef3788776e1f1b8ab6301a2d0ba6a635b7a01b81e81"}}, "hash": "70766a1f17a6b04ec0c9201b96932f4252286dc92418df55c70dbfefa1df63b8", "text": "Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean xi Actions will be aimed at: \u2022 Developing and implementing an in- tegrated regional communication pro- gramme for island biodiversity con- servation (e.g., create a user friendly and attractive design for the strategy and promote its dissemination) \u2022 Implementing a regional capacity building and transfer knowledge pro- gramme on island biodiversity man- agement and conservation; \u2022 Ensuring a Mediterranean participa- tion/voice", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d9ab1320-2ff6-46a3-8467-ce739b4ecc6e": {"__data__": {"id_": "d9ab1320-2ff6-46a3-8467-ce739b4ecc6e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/living-islands-sustainable-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/living-islands-sustainable-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "40e25c0874107dd489dc8b51f47ad28d8afc804b772368d21d37be2cbe47f96b"}, "3": {"node_id": "5d1fdb4e-6754-4ca7-8007-6ca2aafd1212", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/living-islands-sustainable-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cdb83e643e16e45ab5ee88a82f3c50d40f7817aebfa566537e31cf67b6b3366e"}}, "hash": "e90f05c9d6d63ae5c401a5c07e6efda45d5e5b01717fd6b6b25f636761e76643", "text": "in relevant international bio- diversity fora.

MIC part- ners will be responsible for monitoring the progress of its implementation and deliv- ery. As a long-term strategy the objec- tives and actions that underpin the strate- gy will be achieved in the short, medium, and long term, depending on the objec- tives and complexity and collaboration required. Annual progress reports will be produced at island level, enabling an in- tegrated analysis and evaluation, and fa- cilitating the exchange of experience be- tween Mediterranean islands. A mid-term review will be carried out at the end of the fourth year, allowing for adjustments, and again at the end of the ten years, ensur- ing a positive difference is being achieved through this work. In addition, MIC partners aim to create a representative observatory for the differ- ent relevant sectors that will be respon- sible for analysing developments in the different strategic guidelines and specific actions. Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean Introduction Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 1. Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 2 Islands represent about 6% of the Earth\u2019s terrestrial areas, hosting the greatest con- centration of biodiversity and sadly the highest number of species extinctions. They are home to 20% of all known ani- mal and plant species, and therefore play an enormously important role in preserv- ing global biodiversity, from ecologically and economically1. Biodiversity refers to the variety of life on Earth in all its forms, levels and combinations: genetic diversity, spe- cies diversity, and ecosystem diver- sity. In addition to the intrinsic value of life, biodiversity provides essential ecosystem services. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and De- velopment (OCDE) and the World Eco- nomic Forum indicate that ecosystem services of world biodiversity are esti- mated to be worth USD 125-140 trillion per year, representing more than half of the global gross domestic product2. Islands represent key refuges for biodi- versity, particularly where rare and threat- ened species are struggling to survive on the continental coasts, but are themselves being more and more threatened3. Island species are often evolutionarily distinctive and highly vulnerable to novel disturbanc- es, particularly invasive species4. The degradation of natural systems due to human activity and the consequent loss of biodiversity is a global prob- lem that requires urgent worldwide intervention. Unprecedented increases in consumption associated with demo- graphic growth and the extractive nature and intensity of production systems are exerting a constant and ever-increasing pressure on biodiversity. This pressure is resulting in profound changes to natural habitats, loss of species, contamination and a consequent loss in ecosystems\u2019 ability to regenerate and continue to pro- vide essential ecosystem services that are fundamental to mankind\u2019s survival. It is widely acknowledged by scientists and international organisations that islands are an outstanding source of biodiversi- ty as they host a significant proportion of endangered species5. However, their evolutionary distinctive- ness and high vulnerability make islands extinction epicentres. Island species have increased vulnerability as they have di- minished dispersal capability, smaller restricted habitats and tend to evolve in competition with relatively few other spe- cies. As a result, they develop survival strategies based on interdependency, co-evolution, and mutualism rather than defence mechanisms against a broad range of predators, competitors and other external threats. For this reason, many is- land species have become rare or threat- ened, and islands have a disproportionate number of recorded species extinctions when compared to continental systems6,7. To date, approximately 75% of reptile, bird, amphibian and mammal extinctions combined have occurred on islands5.

Small islands of less than 10 km2 represent more than 85% of the Mediterranean\u2019s island units. The Mediterranean islands and their biodiversity 1.1. Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 3 The Mediterranean basin has a com- plex geological history which means some islands have much higher prox- imity to continental coasts than others and some have been isolated for much longer. This combined with the high topographical and ecological variation of this region and the reduced severity of Quaternary climatic oscillations have produced a flora and fauna of excep- tional diversity3,10. Isolation resulting from insularity has led certain species to evolve genetically, particularly on the islands, creating high levels of ende- mism9. As a result of this unique sit- uation the Mediterranean represents the second most important hotspot on Earth. Thanks to speciation occurring on is- lands, endemism is higher, a fact that mechanically increases genetic diversi- ty and means that species can be found on only one or a group of islands. Small islands provide natural and undisturbed habitats for specific flora and fauna as well as unique biodiversity assemblag- es. Islands also represent the only ref- uges left for species that have disap- peared from continental areas and act as a refuge for endangered species, such as populations of seabirds that are found almost exclusively on small islands. Species occasionally behave differently on islands due to food re- source scarcity and absence of pre- dation \u2013 showing changes in their diet and island tameness6,7. These specific behaviours make them more vulnerable but also represent a behavioural diver- sity that deserves to be protected. All this rich biodiversity and life in the Mediterranean has attracted and sus- tained mankind since antiquity. Span- ning 22 countries, the Mediterranean\u2019s coastline exceeds 46,000 km. The coastline and islands are the most pro- ductive areas and therefore the most attractive for economic activities and development. Indeed, of the 529 million inhabitants in the Mediterranean, ap- proximately one third are located along the coasts and 55% live in coastal hy- drological basins11. This means a con- siderable amount of the total population is concentrated in a very small area and that Mediterranean ecosystems have been altered in many ways12. Develop- ment, urbanisation and continual ex- ploitation and use of natural resources is putting incredible strain on the Med- iterranean\u2019s biodiversity, particularly on its islands. The impact from human ac- tivities is proportionally stronger in the Mediterranean than in any other sea of the world 11,13 (and see Louis Brigand et al., UNEP - BP/RAC, 1991 cited in 14). These 529 million inhabitants are reli- ant upon the Mediterranean\u2019s natural resources and the ecosystem services it provides; however, its unique ecosys- tems are significantly degraded by a growing number of drivers of change. Habitat degradation and loss are being accentuated in the Mediterranean (and on its islands) by human activities that are transforming the coast, the land and the sea in response to the needs for agriculture, pastures, ports and oth- er infrastructures, settlements, tourist resorts and leisure activities, etc. In ad- dition, we are now seeing the impacts from climate change at rates beyond experts\u2019 expectations, and increasingly worrying trends in disturbances caused by invasive species. As some charac- teristics of islands worsen the environ- mental and climate change challenges these threats are increasing the vulner- ability of native and endemic species found throughout the basin, but espe- cially on islands. Islands\u2019 limited space and isolation highly restrict the mobility of some species and therefore increase the consequences of events such as heat waves or droughts and explain why the arrival of invasive species can have severe consequences for native species and island assemblages on islands and in other settings with high proportions of endemic species15. Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 4 Small islands are of special interest for sustainable development because of the aforementioned unique character- istics and vulnerabilities. They are eco- logically fragile, have limited resourc- es, are susceptible to natural disasters and increasingly vulnerable to climate change and invasive species. At the same time, island ecosystems provide valuable provisioning, regulating and cultural ecosystem services to island communities and visitors. Ecosystem services are the direct and indirect contributions of ecosystems to hu- man well-being16.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7349b2de-7fbb-4a4a-8b4c-90f2ccf27e67": {"__data__": {"id_": "7349b2de-7fbb-4a4a-8b4c-90f2ccf27e67", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/living-islands-sustainable-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/living-islands-sustainable-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3be6ce4337b93578950f7c675bfc561e2ef1f81818c16c02a8d221161dc66fd8"}, "2": {"node_id": "f82d886e-28f4-4f91-8c29-ea600343187a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/living-islands-sustainable-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "83eb7c4d5734e77855ef16833e73c4423d29165e0b2f856d8f22acd60912d27a"}}, "hash": "8339783e0b1bfc80334673858416776ee88c04205698d2f9690f3569019a0d48", "text": "This definition im- plies a dependence of human societies on well-functioning ecosystems, and therefore sustainable management and conservation is critical.

Freshwater is an import- ant and scarce resource on many small islands, making water provisioning and water quality regulation of high priority. Islands\u2019 cultural ecosystem services in the form of recreation and eco-tourism are highly valued by tourists and locals alike and contribute directly to island economies and play an important role in structuring islands\u2019 landscapes17. There is increasing recognition of the wealth of human health benefits that stem from experiencing nature and bio- diversity18. In the Mediterranean cultural traditions run strong, one such example can be found in how closely tied native plants are with traditional human activ- ities that act in a way to maintain this species richness9. Erosion control and pollination regulation play important roles in the delivery of food provision- ing. Island ecosystems also contribute to the maintenance of ecosystem func- tions: they provide defence against nat- ural disasters, support nutrient cycling, and soil and sand formation; and they contribute to the regulation of climate and diseases19. Conserving biodiversity and therefore strengthening as- sociated ecosystem ser- vices, is of utmost impor- tance and fundamental to the socio-economic develop- ment of human communi- ties particularly in island geo- graphic contexts. There is a pressing need to reverse the trend of biodiversity loss. Action needs to be taken \u2013 at the Mediterranean ba- sin level to ensure that the ecosystem services upon which we rely can con- tinue to serve us. A Mediterranean wide strategy is urgently needed that will help the region and individual countries to strengthen and improve management efficiency in protected areas and other natural spaces, along with an integrat- ed approach to significantly change production and consumption models. To this end, we are witnessing the in- troduction of global, regional, local or thematic strategic visions and initiatives that intend to contribute to the conser- vation and sustainable use of biodiver- sity in islands. Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 5 At the international level, there are the CBD Island diversity Programme of work (https://www.cbd.int/island/pow.shtml) and Global Island Partnership (GLISPA https://www.cbd.int/island/glispa.sht- ml) that \u201cassists islands in addressing one of the world\u2019s greatest challenges: to conserve and utilise the invaluable island natural resources that support people, cultures, and livelihoods in their island homes around the world.\u201d The Small Islands Organisation (SMILO), a partner to MIC and this current project, is creating a network of small islands with a shared vision to foster innova- tions on islands that benefit the local population and their environment. They are helping small islands curb the im- pacts caused by human development and activities and are focusing on sus- tainable solutions in the fields of water & sanitation, waste, energy, biodiversi- ty, landscape and heritage. In 2021, the Virtual Islands Summit and the Island Space at CBD COP26 brought together influential changemakers, experts, and entrepreneurs to devise strategic vi- sions and discuss the innovation taking place on global islands. In addition to these visions and strategies, interesting initiatives to find workable sustainable solutions for the future are being pio- neered e.g., the adoption of emissions trading schemes and clean solar en- ergy schemes that aim to improve the sustainability of island communities. The Mediterranean islands are unique hotspots of biodiversity, within the greater Mediterranean hotspot, thanks to their rich and endemic flora20. Yet they do not exist independently. It is not just one island, or one island next to an- other that contributes to this wealth, it is the combined existence of them all that gives the Mediterranean such ex- traordinary variety. Thus, an integrated and targeted sustainable development/ conservation approach for the Mediter- ranean islands, promoting cooperation under a common regional vision offers a key contribution to preserving the ex- traordinary and unique biodiversity of the Mediterranean islands and to secur- ing the ecosystem services fundamen- tal to socio-economic development and preservation of its rich cultural heritage. \u00a9 Gratisography Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 6 Why a strategy for the preservation of biodiversity on Mediterranean islands? 1.2. \"The Mediterranean constitutes a very rich field of investigation for the study and understanding of island facts, and a field of specific actions for strat- egies for the protection and develop- ment of islands\" (Louis Brigand et al., UNEP - BP/RAC, 1991 cited in 14).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5939134d-a95d-4d09-a41e-de22ec0fa60f": {"__data__": {"id_": "5939134d-a95d-4d09-a41e-de22ec0fa60f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/living-islands-sustainable-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/living-islands-sustainable-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4d0f2159e98cda54ff84f7ac1db29ad07b345f4c60abc9817e28d338974086fd"}, "2": {"node_id": "99c952bb-3edf-4297-8965-d92a4905be16", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/living-islands-sustainable-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e4952d185661f8769d4c54f19e8a8433babda85945256d5d34139cedf33da516"}}, "hash": "970f0c45f340f00ac2e50bb38eb9432e2ba8b6ff8d39f2673b13295c8b2bdf8f", "text": "This observation, drawn up in 1991, is even more relevant today, particularly con- cerning the development agenda in small islands, where many local, na- tional and international stakeholders are looking to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of the natural and cultural heritage of these exceptional territories.

To date several initiatives and proj- ects have aimed to improve the con- servation of Mediterranean islands biodiversity, yet such efforts have of- ten been localised, small-scale and/ or lacked the regional coordination necessary to bring about significant change. A common vision and strate- gy for the Mediterranean islands bio- diversity is therefore needed to boost and enhance conservation and sus- tainable use of these territories. The aim of this document is to outline a shared vision and strategy that will al- low for coherence and alignment with the principles of different international treaties such as the aforementioned CBD Islands Programme of Work and Glispa, Resolution XII.14/2015 of the Ramsar Convention (the only legal text that treats Mediterranean islands as a group), the Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) Protocol (Art. 12 which grants \u201cspecial protection to is- lands, including small islands\u201d), Article 174 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union which requires members to \u201cpay particular attention to island regions\u201d, the CPMR Islands Commission which urges \u201cEuropean Institutions and Member States to pay special attention to the islands, to ac- knowledge the permanent handicaps resulting from their insularity, and to implement policies that are best suit- ed to their condition\u201d and the Charter on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biological Diversity on Europe- an Islands of the Council of Europe. In fact, the latter indicates \u201cthe situation and characteristics of islands require the development and application of specially-adapted approaches and tools for problems analyses and re- sponse measures21.\u201d The Mediterranean region is data de- ficient and the lack of scientific knowl- edge continues to hamper conser- vation efforts. Information specific to islands is even less available, hence it is only possible to portray a regional level overview, whilst at the same time highlighting the need for improved data collection and monitoring of is- lands. For example, within the last 60 years the Mediterranean has lost 41% of its top predators, over 20% of Med- iterranean species are threatened with extinction and estimates suggest 30 endemic species will become extinct by the end of the 21st century22. Soil erosion is estimated to be twice as Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 7 high in the European Mediterranean than in the rest of Europe23. In Italy alone soil erosion is causing an annual loss of EUR 619 million with 33% of its total agricultur- al area affected by severe erosion24. Over 1000 non-indigenous species have been recorded in the Mediterranean Sea and are estimated to generate costs of EUR 26.8 billion25. And with temperatures going up 20% faster in the Mediterranean than the global average, there has never been a more critical or urgent time for action26. The outline of a common Biodiversity Strategy on Mediterranean islands, pre- sented here, can constitute a valuable entry point for action to address many of the challenges facing the region including habitat degradation, pollution and eutro- phication, over exploitation, bioinvasions, and impacts of climate change, as well as putting forward opportunities for growth of the blue economy, nature-based tourism, ecological restoration, and an increase in natural and socio-economic wellbeing for island communities. Addressed to conservation bodies and relevant actors working throughout the Mediterranean region, the present doc- ument aims to contribute to the effort of bringing biodiversity to the forefront. It highlights the importance of biodiversi- ty as a key pillar for supporting contin- ued socioeconomic development and resilience of Mediterranean islands that will ensure a brighter tomorrow. \u00a9 Pexels - Fayson Merege Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 2.

Tourism, urban development and artificial- isation of natural habitats (particularly in coastal areas), overfishing, extensive farm- ing and other types of land use changes are some of the most pressing threats impact- ing Mediterranean islands biodiversity and ecosystems, combined with a significant transformation of lifestyle, culture and heri- tage. The table below summarises the main threats leading to environmental degrada- tion on Mediterranean islands and increased climate challenges. Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 10 Impacts from climate change including drier conditions due to less rainfall and variations in land and sea temperature are increasingly more evident in the Mediterranean than in other regional seas27. Its semi-enclosed nature pre- vents rapid water exchange and there- fore makes it more sensitive to tempera- ture and pH variations28. Together with high human pressure from densely pop- ulated coastal areas, climate change is making the Mediterranean Sea an es- pecially vulnerable place29. Worryingly, its islands are the areas most impacted by these changes. Climate change is occurring faster than expected by the scientific community and rapidly altering temperature and precipitation patterns. As a result, spe- cies are being forced to migrate to other habitats if possible or to adapt to their new climate. The changes are occurring at such speed that they are potential- ly exceeding the adaptive capacity and resilience of island ecosystems30. Some small low-lying islands face the increas- ing threat of water shortages and sea level rise, leading to habitat loss be- cause of this encroachment. Of in- creasing concern is that climate change along with (associated) natural risks such as fire and heavy rains are also contributing to the destruction of natu- ral habitats. Climate change favours the introduction of invasive exotic species, which often outcompete local popula- tions and can cause major changes to population and ecosystem dynamics. In combination with invasive species climate change and these natural risks are exacerbating the degradation of is- land ecosystems. Climate change and bio invasions are happening in already degraded sys- tems which means their impacts are much more detrimental and together all the threats facing the Mediterranean Sea are acting together to push marine biodiversity into decline28,31. Figure 1: Level of conservation of ecosystems at sea Source: EEA, 202132 Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 11 Main socioeconomic trends on Mediterranean islands 2.1. As stated previously the 22 countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea are home to a total of 529 million inhabi- tants: 205 million live on the northern shore and 324 on the southern and eastern shore33. Based on current trends, in the next 30 years (2020- 2050), the population of the Mediterra- nean region will increase by 90 million inhabitants, reaching 611 million. In 2050, one third of the Mediterranean population will live on the northern shore, and two thirds on the southern and eastern shores34. The increasing population combined with changes in lifestyle and demand patterns result in growing demands for water, ener- gy and food from the Mediterranean Basin. The overexploitation of exist- ing water reservoirs and groundwater aquifers and the enhanced utilisation of ecosystem services adds increased stress to islands. Urbanisation - Demography A leading tourism destination, both for domestic and international travel- lers, the Mediterranean receives more than 300 million international tourists a year which accounts for 30% of to- tal world tourism35. This figure is ex- pected to reach 500 million by 203035. The tourism industry is one of the major economic sectors of the region and therefore an extremely important source of income for the Mediterra- nean and its islands, especially the smaller ones. Most island economies are dependent on tourism. Annually coastal tourism in the Mediterranean generates \u20ac300 billion and marine tourism \u20ac11036. Tourism represents around 9,5% of the EU GDP, for insu- lar regions, with this share increasing between 15-30% of GDP, and even 50% for several islands37. For exam- ple, the Greek Islands represent 60% of Hellenic tourism, an activity that contributed 20.8% to GDP in 2019. In recent years, the consequences of COVID-19 on tourism have had signifi- cant impacts in insular regions, which in part has led to the development of the CPMR Islands Commission draft action plan 2022-2023 (see 38).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "97bfdd25-bf53-4da4-b031-65b9edbd22e3": {"__data__": {"id_": "97bfdd25-bf53-4da4-b031-65b9edbd22e3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/living-islands-sustainable-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/living-islands-sustainable-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b0293660fcedf147cde39abbd4d13ed885e62753df559a02e20f62fb1500398a"}, "2": {"node_id": "c47b6b3a-4a74-45fd-86ac-3fcf6a74d61a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/living-islands-sustainable-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "beffc336aa5fedf88db9e6ea7564d2d38d17ac831f44855e3f106bc52a800d4d"}}, "hash": "3a89c03eab858147ca5be2574de7c2ac5963781e5441a753f3f283feaf73bf8d", "text": "Tourism \u00a9 NounProject WEBTECHOPS LLP \u00a9 NounProject Nithinan Tatah Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 12 Transport The Mediterranean represents only 1% of the surface of the seas and oceans, but it accommodates 15% of global shipping39.

The \u201cMediterranean Corridor\u201d is a large- scale EU transport project that has financed 54 rail projects and 33 mari- time ones, connecting the coastal ar- eas of the basin. These projects mean to support passengers and freight traf- fic, which is expected to double be- tween 2010-203039. This growth will come at a significant cost to the envi- ronment with increasing impacts from chemical pollution (hydrocarbons), noise pollution and collisions with ma- rine mammals40. These environmen- tal impacts are an issue for the whole Mediterranean basin, but they are of critical importance for the region's Marine Protected Areas, which are mostly concentrated around islands.

The overall annual economic value of fisheries in the region is estimated at \u20ac9.4 billion and contrib- utes livelihoods to a total of 785,000 people, 57% of which are linked to small-scale fishing41,42. Worryingly, the Mediterranean and Black Sea have the highest percentage (62.5%) of stocks being fished at unsustainable levels41. Island communities specialised in fish- ing have existed since antiquity. These communities hold a wealth of cultural heritage with incredible local ecologi- cal knowledge and traditional practices, some of which favour sustainable fish- ing. However, over the last few decades, in the context of a global fishing economy, the relationship fishers have with their activity has been changing. The impor- tance of these islands for the fishing in- dustry therefore goes far beyond their limited territories because fishery prod- ucts are no longer intended for local consumption only. In this context, the Mediterranean islands bear an unequal challenge. Despite a specific regulatory framework, small islands compete with the global market, which demands a continued increase in production. The Kerkennah Islands in Tunisia pro- vide a fair illustration of the dilemma between tradition and competitiveness. The traditional fishing activity included the use of palm leaves to create fixed fisheries in the low waters that surround the islands. This method requires time consuming preparation of the palm leaves. Pressured to produce more to capture larger quantities of fish, the use of palm leaves was replaced by plastic. Therefore, palm trees declined as fishermen no longer had a need to conserve them43,44. The change in pro- duction scale and methods has caused a significant environmental imbalance that has rendered the fishing practices unsustainable43. These fishing islands are not endowed with any specific legal measure that would allow the environmental and social balance to be restored. \u00a9 Pexels - Peter Simmons \u00a9 NounProject Eucalyp Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 14 Biodiversity policies and laws within the Mediterranean islands contexts 2.2. Islands are addressed by international, regional and national laws and policies for three different reasons. First of all, their biodiversity needs special attention. Sec- ondly, islands are significant for maritime boundaries. Finally, islands create living conditions that are hard for humans, and laws are used to ease them. Policy frameworks to protect island biodiversity At global level, the need to conserve island biodiversity is widely recognized, increas- ingly so in response to climate change. However, this recognition has been trans- lated into legal and political texts as an intention for action rather than to pro- vide specific measures and/or tools. The aforementioned CBD Island Biodiversity Programme of Work provides one such example. As does, Agenda 21, adopted in 1992 at the Earth Summit by 178 States, proposed for the first time, in Chapter 17, that small islands are territories that re- quire priority protection, since they are particularly vulnerable to climate change. Being a declarative and non-binding doc- ument, it aimed to inspire States to adapt their national laws accordingly. Similarly, at the eighth CBD meeting (Brazil, March 2006), the Conference of the Parties ad- opted the first-ever programme of work dedicated solely to the uniqueness and fragility of island biodiversity (decision VIII/1).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "64b865a6-d344-4a02-b086-74f42752cb16": {"__data__": {"id_": "64b865a6-d344-4a02-b086-74f42752cb16", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/living-islands-sustainable-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/living-islands-sustainable-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2513e87b0ebbba55f76b703fe86ccc9ffc9766e868d967070edc797d7eaf6929"}, "2": {"node_id": "5c8ba41d-9bbd-4cbf-9dee-86b1052d7d64", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/living-islands-sustainable-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "caf5bf5ceb1f3065cace075ffbb87b9d9c1bdc0495c43e77e0325761cb60a552"}}, "hash": "214e97dd4be9fbd95a425a47358a4fe94aea6824f89f6f123d8593dfb4f8c348", "text": "\u201cIts aim was to significantly reduce the rate of island biodiversity loss by 2010 and beyond as a contribution to poverty alleviation and the sustainable develop- ment of islands, particularly small island developing States45.\u201d Being specific to wetlands conservation at the international level, the Ramsar Con- vention on Wetlands addresses several aspects of island wetlands.

This Res- olution gave impetus to a Mediterranean dynamic to compile an inventory of island wetlands whose existence was not regis- tered and to adopt legal instruments for their protection. Transboundary policy processes have continued to highlight the importance of addressing biodiversity challenges in Mediterranean islands. The EU Biodi- versity Strategy, which is applicable to islands, sets up ambitious goals to be achieved by 2030 to protect and restore nature, as biodiversity and well-function- ing ecosystems are the \u201ckey to boost our resilience\u201d.

The Mediterranean islands\u2019 biodiversity issues are taken into consideration by the Convention for the Protection of the Ma- rine Environment and the Coastal Region of the Mediterranean, also known as the Barcelona Convention. It contains region- al plans with binding targets as well as some specific provisions for islands, such as those referenced at the Protocol on In- tegrated Coastal Zone Management. Its article 12 states that the contracting Par- ties \u201cundertake to accord special protec- tion to islands, including small islands\u201d, protection that can be reflected in nation- al coastal plans and programs. The Barcelona Convention has estab- lished a list of Specially Protected Areas of Mediterranean Importance (SPAMIs), with the goal of promoting international cooperation for the conservation of nat- ural heritage by choosing flagship sites of Mediterranean biodiversity. Although there is no explicit reference to the need to protect islands, half of the SPAMI sites are on islands which reflects their signifi- cance for biodiversity protection (21 out of 39 sites). In addition, since the end of the 20th cen- tury, there has been a favourable trend towards the designation of protected ar- eas which are insular or include islands, on both shores of the Mediterranean, with variable protection and conserva- tion status, such as the Habibas Islands UNESCO Nature Reserve in Algeria (also a SPAMI) or the Palm Islands in Leba- non (National nature reserve, SPAMI and Ramsar Wetland), Zembra-Zembretta National Park in Tunisia (also UNESCO Biosphere Reserve under the Man and Biosphere Programme and a SPAMI) or Port-Cros in France (National parc and SPAMI) or the Marine Protected Area of Tavolara in Sardinia. \u00a9 Pexels - Yi\u011fit Can Etyemez Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 16 Policy frameworks to regulate island maritime delimitation Islands play an important role in maritime boundary delimitation. Negotiated for 20 years, the Convention on the Law of the Sea, regulates the regime of islands by stating that the inhabited islands or those having an economic life can have their own maritime zones (art. 121). Uninhab- ited islands (\u2018rocks\u2019) have only a territorial sea and a contiguous zone. This ambig- uous provision leaves the possibility of changing the regime applied depending on the status of the island as inhabited or not. This ambiguity has created several disputes, especially in southern China. In the Mediterranean, maritime delimitations still create conflicts between States and islands are at the heart of the claims.

Table 1: Summary of the provisions specific to the islands. Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 17 Policy frameworks to ease island living conditions Island living conditions lead to the adop- tion of regulations of socio-economic activities, whose goal is to ease human difficulties. These matters are mostly reg- ulated at a national or EU level. For exam- ple, the legal framework for the tourism sector is mainly a decision of national and regional authorities. At the international level, there are only declaratory provi- sions. For example, the Charter of Lan- zarote, which applies to all islands, states that tourism must \"contribute to sustain- able development\" and \"respect the frag- ile balances which characterise many tourist destinations, in particular small islands\"1. The European Union has a sup- porting competence in this matter, so it can only intervene to complete the action of the Member States. The financial stake both for the State and for the inhabitants is gigantic and can compromise the es tablishment of regulatory tourism policies adapted to the challenges of nature con- servation and island biodiversity. As mentioned previously, within the EU, member States are required to \u201cpay par- ticular attention to island regions\u201d under Article 174 of the Treaty on the Function- ing of the European Union. This attention can be translated into different types of legal measures adapted to island partic- ularities. However, the main goal of the article is to trigger measures that serve to reduce the gap between the level of de- velopment of island and mainland regions and not to protect island biodiversity. In- deed, the EU Parliament report on a strat- egy for sustainable tourism, repeats the importance of considering insularity37. 1 UNESCO / UNWTO / UNEP, Charter of Lanzarote, art. 2, 1995.

For example, the CPMR InterMediterranean Commission task force on culture and sustainable tourism47. The DestiMedPlus project which aimed to improve levels of integration between tourism and conser- vation policies through the creation of ec- otourism itineraries. This project also led to the development of a Mediterranean Ecotourism Consortium and a Mediterra- nean ecotourism policy roadmap which provides policy makers at regional and local level with context and key policy orientations for the development of eco- tourism governance and the integration of tourism and conservation policies in the Mediterranean48. The BEST MED project is another ex- ample. It is creating a Network of Sus- tainable Tourism Observatories for the Mediterranean (NSTO), gathering bod- ies / entities / organisations dealing with tourism data monitoring / management around the Mediterranean basin, to share ideas, techniques, and tools, and to build multi-level cooperation to seek the best solutions and work in a common direc- tion towards sustainable tourism49. The Glasgow Declaration is another major step towards international commitments for improved tourism. The declaration aims to lead and align climate action across tourism stakeholders, including government and institutional agencies; donors and financial institutions; interna- tional organisations; civil society; the pri- vate sector; and academia50.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1746ab36-15bc-45e4-bfd8-0fdc4999762d": {"__data__": {"id_": "1746ab36-15bc-45e4-bfd8-0fdc4999762d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/living-islands-sustainable-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/living-islands-sustainable-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "242475fe0d212368f319cff2a33051f0044fe91d7f6fcc366d9469f0e419209d"}, "2": {"node_id": "2eb126b8-7279-4d31-bf77-42e15215cccf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/living-islands-sustainable-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "60c0945a34b432df065b96a92d5352a67b0546267cb524a9d3aa09192aeeb4cf"}}, "hash": "0397b1eeb57d2a0863f68d84f2781c48ed78e0773b7553d32ba3c71a8ea1ad02", "text": "\u00a9 Gratisography Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean Priority themes for island biodiversity conservation Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 3.

The Mediterranean Islands Collective (MIC), financed by the MAVA Foundation, has developed the present strategy and associated action plan which aims to bet- ter preserve the biodiversity of the Med- iterranean islands to have coherent and collaborative action between the actors already working in the region. The strat- egy has been developed through exten- sive collaboration between PIM and MIC partners and in-depth consultations at national and regional level and is outlined below. The goal of the strategic plan is to stop further loss of biodiversity and to assist in the recovery of threatened Med- iterranean island biota by 2030. Six operational priority pillars provide a guide for achieving the specific objec- tives. For each pillar, a set of actions pave the way for diverse stakeholders that, in cooperation, at local, national and re- gional levels will ensure the Strategy can be delivered and implemented on the ground. The specific objectives within each pil- lar and suggested actions are not an ex- haustive list and should be treated as a guide. There are many more interventions that can be applied in favour of conserva- tion and sustainable use of biodiversity in the Mediterranean islands. It should also be noted that the 6 pillars of the Strate- gy should be considered in an integrated manner, whereby any proposed action may constitute a contribution to more than one pillar. In structural and functional terms, it is as- sumed that without knowledge, it is not possible to conserve and manage biodi- versity. Knowledge is the basis for pro- moting greater awareness and empower- ment, whether at the level of biodiversity managers, socio-economic agents or the population in general. Therefore, knowl- edge is also the basis for sustaining a comprehensive communication, that can be transmitted through different support channels and be directed at multiple-lev- els and varied target audiences. The successful implementation of the Strategy rests on carefully weighting the constraints resulting from climate change and what it implies in terms of adaptation. Understanding Mediterranean islands as a whole is key, and the Strategy has to be implemented in a spirit of solidarity be- tween island communities, therefore with the ambition of reducing economic and capacity gaps between EU and non-EU Mediterranean countries. Taking action in the Mediterranean, for living islands! Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 21 Based on the principle that it is only pos- sible to preserve what is known, and even though significant gaps remain in the existing knowledge on the Mediterra- nean and its biodiversity, one of the most problematic issues that exists is that the information that is available, such as, in- ventories, knowledge of ecosystems ser- vices and biodiversity maps, are not al- ways accessible and available for use by all relevant stakeholders. Updated knowledge, organised and made available in formats suitable and ac- cessible to different users, is fundamen- tal and can play a key role in supporting communication and awareness-raising actions on the importance of conserving island biodiversity in the Mediterranean. Knowledge also plays a central role in partnership building and awareness of biodiversity and climate change in the Mediterranean islands. Mediterranean islands\u2019 biodiversity in- cludes a high number of endemic and indigenous species, many of them with very small distribution areas. Most of these species are poorly understood in terms of conservation status and vulner- ability to human pressures and climate change. Under this pillar, the Action Plan will include activities aimed at: \u2022 Advancing inventories and map- ping of biodiversity hotspots at lo- cal level (species, habitats, ecosys- tem services) particularly on lesser researched islands, endangered species and taxa, and degraded sites; \u2022 Developing an integrated regional insular biodiversity database with the mapping of Key Island Biodi- versity Areas; \u2022 Supporting local-based research initiatives on biodiversity; \u2022 Helping local communities under- stand biodiversity conservation on the islands; \u2022 Sharing knowledge (data, best practices, etc) using up-to-date communication means at local, na- tional and regional levels.

Biodiversity and nature conservation be- ing the pillars of sustainable development is still not well understood or widely ac- cepted. Mainstreaming the need to con- sider biodiversity and nature within other sectoral and cross cutting policies and programmes requires awareness and sensitization. Additionally, it requires con- crete demonstrations of how biodiversity and nature-based solutions can contrib- ute to addressing socioeconomic chal- lenges and provide opportunities e.g., job and benefit creation.

Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean Governance and partnership for implementation Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 4. Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 42 This strategy is intended to serve as a functional collaborative platform involving all relevant actors for biodiversity conser- vation in the Mediterranean islands. The conservation and sustainable use of bio- diversity in the Mediterranean islands re- quires a broad commitment and partic- ipation from all sectors and is not only about nature conservation. Development on each Mediterranean island depends on the ability to ensure that species and ecosystems continue to provide key ser- vices to nature and society. The scientific community, those respon- sible for the management of protected areas or land planning and management, urban planning, agriculture, fisheries, tourism, shipping, energy, water sec- tors, education, local and national gov- ernments are the recipients and those responsible for ensuring the implemen- tation of specific actions that, on each is- land, give life to the vision and guidelines agreed in this strategy. Not intending to replace or overlap with other strategies and action plans already adopted in the Mediterranean island space, this strate- gy aims to facilitate collaborative involve- ment and participation, interdisciplinarity and dialogue between parties. \u00a9 Pexels - Anthony Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean Timeline, monitoring, evaluation, revision Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 5.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a4014617-e1f3-4cd6-8cc6-b4ede9ba3ff9": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4014617-e1f3-4cd6-8cc6-b4ede9ba3ff9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/living-islands-sustainable-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/living-islands-sustainable-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d6f4f432127eac1d7862b58d40fe4491b60d03406f920d1338f0b258064a4f4e"}, "2": {"node_id": "ea81929f-8d40-4a7c-8f49-3575beb2a6ef", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/living-islands-sustainable-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9b35d8b6decfb3d5ab76958a65bd3118484a093b9147fbc39495e8c20915ba0f"}}, "hash": "4f6139162b2e8bd1963443a8596ba28013edb4a6626c5f8da790166ca1f7cb76", "text": "Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 44 The Strategy proposes ten years for its implementation, considering the general objectives and the nature and diversity of interventions included in the Action Plan.

MIC partners will establish a follow-up committee responsible for collecting all the relevant information for supporting the monitoring and evaluation of the Strategy, within the observatory. Monitoring and evaluation will use indicators and targets assigned to each action and the selection of indicators and targets should be es- tablished through a participatory process involving all relevant stakeholders.

As a final outcome, as promoters of the strategy, the MIC partners aim to create a representative observatory for the differ- ent relevant sectors that will be respon- sible for analysing developments in the different strategic guidelines and specif- ic actions. This planned observatory will act as the monitoring and follow-up tool, depending on the targets and indicators associated with each action, and will also be responsible for the integration and har- monisation of the diversity of data from the different levels of intervention (local, national, regional) under the Strategy.

The aim of the strategy is to help realize the vision of productive and biologically diverse Mediterranean islands that can meet the long term needs of people and nature, stop further loss of biodiversity and assist in the recovery of threatened Mediterranean island biota by 2030. Addressed to public authorities, conser- vation bodies and relevant actors working throughout the Mediterranean region, it is hoped that the present strategy brings biodiversity to the forefront and highlights its importance as a key pillar for support- ing continued socioeconomic develop- ment and resilience of Mediterranean is- lands that will ensure a brighter tomorrow. The Mediterranean Islands Collective (MIC), financed by the MAVA foundation, has developed this strategy through ex- tensive collaboration with project part- ners, pilot projects, and in-depth consul- tations at national and regional level. The implementation and progression of the strategy will continue to be led by MIC partners, in a coordination role. However, it is strongly recognized that the respon- sibility for its delivery is shared across rel- evant regional and EU organisations, lo- cal and national governments, business, environmental and community groups and private individuals throughout the Mediterranean region. The strategy and action plan presented below is beneficial as it builds off proj- ects, work and initiatives that are already underway or have been trialled through- out the region, working to protect and care for coastal, marine and island en- vironments. Rather than re-inventing the wheel it is hoped that this strategy is seen to bring all this existing work together, adding leadership, greater coordination of efforts, and a fresh momentum at a much larger Mediterranean scale. Shaped by results of pilot projects and consultations, the Mediterranean islands strategy and action plan seeks to min- imise the threats facing the region\u2019s is- lands and maximise opportunities. The strategy sets out six strategic pillars and a range of actions and measures to help its delivery: Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean ix Actions will be aimed at: \u2022 Advancing inventories and map- ping of biodiversity hotspots at local level (species, habitats, ecosystem services) particularly on lesser re- searched islands, endangered spe- cies and taxa, and degraded sites; \u2022 Developing an integrated regional in- sular biodiversity database with the mapping of Key Island Biodiversity Areas; \u2022 Supporting local-based research ini- tiatives on biodiversity; \u2022 Helping local communities under- stand biodiversity conservation on the islands; \u2022 Sharing knowledge (data, best prac- tices, etc) using up-to-date commu- nication means at local, national and regional levels. Strengthen knowledge and raise awareness on Mediterranean islands 1 Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean x Actions will be aimed at: \u2022 Developing and implementing capac- ity-building programmes addressing specific needs on biodiversity conser- vation at local, national and regional levels; \u2022 Promoting initiatives engaging the so- cioeconomic sector on conserva- tion and sustainable use of biodiversity (e.g., sustainable nature-based tourism, fisheries, agriculture); \u2022 Training protected area managers and technicians on the fundamentals of a co-management approach. Embed capacity for biodiversity conservation and sustainable management at the island level 2 Actions will be aimed at: \u2022 Developing restoration initiatives on degraded sites and important habi- tats, species and ecosystems; \u2022 Enhancing marine invasive alien species control measures and pro- grammes; \u2022 Promoting co-management ap- proaches at the level of island based protected areas.

MIC part- ners will be responsible for monitoring the progress of its implementation and deliv- ery. As a long-term strategy the objec- tives and actions that underpin the strate- gy will be achieved in the short, medium, and long term, depending on the objec- tives and complexity and collaboration required. Annual progress reports will be produced at island level, enabling an in- tegrated analysis and evaluation, and fa- cilitating the exchange of experience be- tween Mediterranean islands. A mid-term review will be carried out at the end of the fourth year, allowing for adjustments, and again at the end of the ten years, ensur- ing a positive difference is being achieved through this work. In addition, MIC partners aim to create a representative observatory for the differ- ent relevant sectors that will be respon- sible for analysing developments in the different strategic guidelines and specific actions. Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean Introduction Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 1. Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 2 Islands represent about 6% of the Earth\u2019s terrestrial areas, hosting the greatest con- centration of biodiversity and sadly the highest number of species extinctions. They are home to 20% of all known ani- mal and plant species, and therefore play an enormously important role in preserv- ing global biodiversity, from ecologically and economically1. Biodiversity refers to the variety of life on Earth in all its forms, levels and combinations: genetic diversity, spe- cies diversity, and ecosystem diver- sity. In addition to the intrinsic value of life, biodiversity provides essential ecosystem services. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and De- velopment (OCDE) and the World Eco- nomic Forum indicate that ecosystem services of world biodiversity are esti- mated to be worth USD 125-140 trillion per year, representing more than half of the global gross domestic product2. Islands represent key refuges for biodi- versity, particularly where rare and threat- ened species are struggling to survive on the continental coasts, but are themselves being more and more threatened3. Island species are often evolutionarily distinctive and highly vulnerable to novel disturbanc- es, particularly invasive species4. The degradation of natural systems due to human activity and the consequent loss of biodiversity is a global prob- lem that requires urgent worldwide intervention. Unprecedented increases in consumption associated with demo- graphic growth and the extractive nature and intensity of production systems are exerting a constant and ever-increasing pressure on biodiversity. This pressure is resulting in profound changes to natural habitats, loss of species, contamination and a consequent loss in ecosystems\u2019 ability to regenerate and continue to pro- vide essential ecosystem services that are fundamental to mankind\u2019s survival. It is widely acknowledged by scientists and international organisations that islands are an outstanding source of biodiversi- ty as they host a significant proportion of endangered species5. However, their evolutionary distinctive- ness and high vulnerability make islands extinction epicentres. Island species have increased vulnerability as they have di- minished dispersal capability, smaller restricted habitats and tend to evolve in competition with relatively few other spe- cies. As a result, they develop survival strategies based on interdependency, co-evolution, and mutualism rather than defence mechanisms against a broad range of predators, competitors and other external threats. For this reason, many is- land species have become rare or threat- ened, and islands have a disproportionate number of recorded species extinctions when compared to continental systems6,7. To date, approximately 75% of reptile, bird, amphibian and mammal extinctions combined have occurred on islands5. With almost 5,000 islands and islets (fig- ures differ a little from one authority to the other), the Mediterranean basin has one of the largest groups of islands in the world.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "283af07c-9598-448f-bd7f-920c3ac0c173": {"__data__": {"id_": "283af07c-9598-448f-bd7f-920c3ac0c173", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-3", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy Matters: Volume 3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-3", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bbcc21f3ce0d1faa3f59d57e8b2036b6926792563e5685e5f9583fb7ea21059a"}, "2": {"node_id": "cc53b7a5-342c-4dc4-b051-2ed86493d679", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-3", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "53f46dcca2c1d55df7145560a7b0f8a45dd0f95d158b5d58ec2456cd13d04338"}}, "hash": "e469edb066fbe3c1fecbbab5796e4abd79d17bd8c64ac402cc909f536c1fcfb3", "text": "The region is of great importance to global biodiversity thanks to its wealth of species, relatively high rate of ende- mism, long species history, as well as its role as a natural laboratory for evolution- ary studies3.

Small islands of less than 10 km2 represent more than 85% of the Mediterranean\u2019s island units. The Mediterranean islands and their biodiversity 1.1. Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 3 The Mediterranean basin has a com- plex geological history which means some islands have much higher prox- imity to continental coasts than others and some have been isolated for much longer. This combined with the high topographical and ecological variation of this region and the reduced severity of Quaternary climatic oscillations have produced a flora and fauna of excep- tional diversity3,10. Isolation resulting from insularity has led certain species to evolve genetically, particularly on the islands, creating high levels of ende- mism9. As a result of this unique sit- uation the Mediterranean represents the second most important hotspot on Earth. Thanks to speciation occurring on is- lands, endemism is higher, a fact that mechanically increases genetic diversi- ty and means that species can be found on only one or a group of islands. Small islands provide natural and undisturbed habitats for specific flora and fauna as well as unique biodiversity assemblag- es. Islands also represent the only ref- uges left for species that have disap- peared from continental areas and act as a refuge for endangered species, such as populations of seabirds that are found almost exclusively on small islands. Species occasionally behave differently on islands due to food re- source scarcity and absence of pre- dation \u2013 showing changes in their diet and island tameness6,7. These specific behaviours make them more vulnerable but also represent a behavioural diver- sity that deserves to be protected. All this rich biodiversity and life in the Mediterranean has attracted and sus- tained mankind since antiquity. Span- ning 22 countries, the Mediterranean\u2019s coastline exceeds 46,000 km. The coastline and islands are the most pro- ductive areas and therefore the most attractive for economic activities and development. Indeed, of the 529 million inhabitants in the Mediterranean, ap- proximately one third are located along the coasts and 55% live in coastal hy- drological basins11. This means a con- siderable amount of the total population is concentrated in a very small area and that Mediterranean ecosystems have been altered in many ways12. Develop- ment, urbanisation and continual ex- ploitation and use of natural resources is putting incredible strain on the Med- iterranean\u2019s biodiversity, particularly on its islands. The impact from human ac- tivities is proportionally stronger in the Mediterranean than in any other sea of the world 11,13 (and see Louis Brigand et al., UNEP - BP/RAC, 1991 cited in 14). These 529 million inhabitants are reli- ant upon the Mediterranean\u2019s natural resources and the ecosystem services it provides; however, its unique ecosys- tems are significantly degraded by a growing number of drivers of change. Habitat degradation and loss are being accentuated in the Mediterranean (and on its islands) by human activities that are transforming the coast, the land and the sea in response to the needs for agriculture, pastures, ports and oth- er infrastructures, settlements, tourist resorts and leisure activities, etc. In ad- dition, we are now seeing the impacts from climate change at rates beyond experts\u2019 expectations, and increasingly worrying trends in disturbances caused by invasive species. As some charac- teristics of islands worsen the environ- mental and climate change challenges these threats are increasing the vulner- ability of native and endemic species found throughout the basin, but espe- cially on islands. Islands\u2019 limited space and isolation highly restrict the mobility of some species and therefore increase the consequences of events such as heat waves or droughts and explain why the arrival of invasive species can have severe consequences for native species and island assemblages on islands and in other settings with high proportions of endemic species15. Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 4 Small islands are of special interest for sustainable development because of the aforementioned unique character- istics and vulnerabilities.

Freshwater is an import- ant and scarce resource on many small islands, making water provisioning and water quality regulation of high priority. Islands\u2019 cultural ecosystem services in the form of recreation and eco-tourism are highly valued by tourists and locals alike and contribute directly to island economies and play an important role in structuring islands\u2019 landscapes17. There is increasing recognition of the wealth of human health benefits that stem from experiencing nature and bio- diversity18. In the Mediterranean cultural traditions run strong, one such example can be found in how closely tied native plants are with traditional human activ- ities that act in a way to maintain this species richness9. Erosion control and pollination regulation play important roles in the delivery of food provision- ing. Island ecosystems also contribute to the maintenance of ecosystem func- tions: they provide defence against nat- ural disasters, support nutrient cycling, and soil and sand formation; and they contribute to the regulation of climate and diseases19. Conserving biodiversity and therefore strengthening as- sociated ecosystem ser- vices, is of utmost impor- tance and fundamental to the socio-economic develop- ment of human communi- ties particularly in island geo- graphic contexts. There is a pressing need to reverse the trend of biodiversity loss. Action needs to be taken \u2013 at the Mediterranean ba- sin level to ensure that the ecosystem services upon which we rely can con- tinue to serve us. A Mediterranean wide strategy is urgently needed that will help the region and individual countries to strengthen and improve management efficiency in protected areas and other natural spaces, along with an integrat- ed approach to significantly change production and consumption models. To this end, we are witnessing the in- troduction of global, regional, local or thematic strategic visions and initiatives that intend to contribute to the conser- vation and sustainable use of biodiver- sity in islands. Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 5 At the international level, there are the CBD Island diversity Programme of work (https://www.cbd.int/island/pow.shtml) and Global Island Partnership (GLISPA https://www.cbd.int/island/glispa.sht- ml) that \u201cassists islands in addressing one of the world\u2019s greatest challenges: to conserve and utilise the invaluable island natural resources that support people, cultures, and livelihoods in their island homes around the world.\u201d The Small Islands Organisation (SMILO), a partner to MIC and this current project, is creating a network of small islands with a shared vision to foster innova- tions on islands that benefit the local population and their environment. They are helping small islands curb the im- pacts caused by human development and activities and are focusing on sus- tainable solutions in the fields of water & sanitation, waste, energy, biodiversi- ty, landscape and heritage. In 2021, the Virtual Islands Summit and the Island Space at CBD COP26 brought together influential changemakers, experts, and entrepreneurs to devise strategic vi- sions and discuss the innovation taking place on global islands. In addition to these visions and strategies, interesting initiatives to find workable sustainable solutions for the future are being pio- neered e.g., the adoption of emissions trading schemes and clean solar en- ergy schemes that aim to improve the sustainability of island communities. The Mediterranean islands are unique hotspots of biodiversity, within the greater Mediterranean hotspot, thanks to their rich and endemic flora20. Yet they do not exist independently. It is not just one island, or one island next to an- other that contributes to this wealth, it is the combined existence of them all that gives the Mediterranean such ex- traordinary variety. Thus, an integrated and targeted sustainable development/ conservation approach for the Mediter- ranean islands, promoting cooperation under a common regional vision offers a key contribution to preserving the ex- traordinary and unique biodiversity of the Mediterranean islands and to secur- ing the ecosystem services fundamen- tal to socio-economic development and preservation of its rich cultural heritage. \u00a9 Gratisography Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 6 Why a strategy for the preservation of biodiversity on Mediterranean islands? 1.2. \"The Mediterranean constitutes a very rich field of investigation for the study and understanding of island facts, and a field of specific actions for strat- egies for the protection and develop- ment of islands\" (Louis Brigand et al., UNEP - BP/RAC, 1991 cited in 14).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ce8817f6-2dde-4065-a253-552bc11b5664": {"__data__": {"id_": "ce8817f6-2dde-4065-a253-552bc11b5664", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-3", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy Matters: Volume 3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-3", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "74da25d56af2dd0bff1be0c7a6571a4355357b4e49d19fbfeac4d04cebce4c01"}, "2": {"node_id": "b49d456e-0d68-4941-97cd-50ca35d32578", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-3", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "af3d5b023586b61ae74ab35040d55f53cbce58d423605ce0c67ffc4dc75c9403"}}, "hash": "29b738db064714655e95d5c2771e58d74282faafba17129a632cc9a1024bf24a", "text": "This observation, drawn up in 1991, is even more relevant today, particularly con- cerning the development agenda in small islands, where many local, na- tional and international stakeholders are looking to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of the natural and cultural heritage of these exceptional territories.

To date several initiatives and proj- ects have aimed to improve the con- servation of Mediterranean islands biodiversity, yet such efforts have of- ten been localised, small-scale and/ or lacked the regional coordination necessary to bring about significant change. A common vision and strate- gy for the Mediterranean islands bio- diversity is therefore needed to boost and enhance conservation and sus- tainable use of these territories. The aim of this document is to outline a shared vision and strategy that will al- low for coherence and alignment with the principles of different international treaties such as the aforementioned CBD Islands Programme of Work and Glispa, Resolution XII.14/2015 of the Ramsar Convention (the only legal text that treats Mediterranean islands as a group), the Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) Protocol (Art. 12 which grants \u201cspecial protection to is- lands, including small islands\u201d), Article 174 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union which requires members to \u201cpay particular attention to island regions\u201d, the CPMR Islands Commission which urges \u201cEuropean Institutions and Member States to pay special attention to the islands, to ac- knowledge the permanent handicaps resulting from their insularity, and to implement policies that are best suit- ed to their condition\u201d and the Charter on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biological Diversity on Europe- an Islands of the Council of Europe. In fact, the latter indicates \u201cthe situation and characteristics of islands require the development and application of specially-adapted approaches and tools for problems analyses and re- sponse measures21.\u201d The Mediterranean region is data de- ficient and the lack of scientific knowl- edge continues to hamper conser- vation efforts. Information specific to islands is even less available, hence it is only possible to portray a regional level overview, whilst at the same time highlighting the need for improved data collection and monitoring of is- lands. For example, within the last 60 years the Mediterranean has lost 41% of its top predators, over 20% of Med- iterranean species are threatened with extinction and estimates suggest 30 endemic species will become extinct by the end of the 21st century22. Soil erosion is estimated to be twice as Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 7 high in the European Mediterranean than in the rest of Europe23. In Italy alone soil erosion is causing an annual loss of EUR 619 million with 33% of its total agricultur- al area affected by severe erosion24. Over 1000 non-indigenous species have been recorded in the Mediterranean Sea and are estimated to generate costs of EUR 26.8 billion25. And with temperatures going up 20% faster in the Mediterranean than the global average, there has never been a more critical or urgent time for action26. The outline of a common Biodiversity Strategy on Mediterranean islands, pre- sented here, can constitute a valuable entry point for action to address many of the challenges facing the region including habitat degradation, pollution and eutro- phication, over exploitation, bioinvasions, and impacts of climate change, as well as putting forward opportunities for growth of the blue economy, nature-based tourism, ecological restoration, and an increase in natural and socio-economic wellbeing for island communities. Addressed to conservation bodies and relevant actors working throughout the Mediterranean region, the present doc- ument aims to contribute to the effort of bringing biodiversity to the forefront. It highlights the importance of biodiversi- ty as a key pillar for supporting contin- ued socioeconomic development and resilience of Mediterranean islands that will ensure a brighter tomorrow. \u00a9 Pexels - Fayson Merege Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 2.

For the most part Mediterranean islands and continental coastlines are faced with the same, numerous and interrelated, threats, but often the challenges facing biodiversity on, and surrounding islands, are more se- vere.

Tourism, urban development and artificial- isation of natural habitats (particularly in coastal areas), overfishing, extensive farm- ing and other types of land use changes are some of the most pressing threats impact- ing Mediterranean islands biodiversity and ecosystems, combined with a significant transformation of lifestyle, culture and heri- tage. The table below summarises the main threats leading to environmental degrada- tion on Mediterranean islands and increased climate challenges. Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 10 Impacts from climate change including drier conditions due to less rainfall and variations in land and sea temperature are increasingly more evident in the Mediterranean than in other regional seas27. Its semi-enclosed nature pre- vents rapid water exchange and there- fore makes it more sensitive to tempera- ture and pH variations28. Together with high human pressure from densely pop- ulated coastal areas, climate change is making the Mediterranean Sea an es- pecially vulnerable place29. Worryingly, its islands are the areas most impacted by these changes. Climate change is occurring faster than expected by the scientific community and rapidly altering temperature and precipitation patterns. As a result, spe- cies are being forced to migrate to other habitats if possible or to adapt to their new climate. The changes are occurring at such speed that they are potential- ly exceeding the adaptive capacity and resilience of island ecosystems30. Some small low-lying islands face the increas- ing threat of water shortages and sea level rise, leading to habitat loss be- cause of this encroachment. Of in- creasing concern is that climate change along with (associated) natural risks such as fire and heavy rains are also contributing to the destruction of natu- ral habitats. Climate change favours the introduction of invasive exotic species, which often outcompete local popula- tions and can cause major changes to population and ecosystem dynamics. In combination with invasive species climate change and these natural risks are exacerbating the degradation of is- land ecosystems. Climate change and bio invasions are happening in already degraded sys- tems which means their impacts are much more detrimental and together all the threats facing the Mediterranean Sea are acting together to push marine biodiversity into decline28,31. Figure 1: Level of conservation of ecosystems at sea Source: EEA, 202132 Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 11 Main socioeconomic trends on Mediterranean islands 2.1. As stated previously the 22 countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea are home to a total of 529 million inhabi- tants: 205 million live on the northern shore and 324 on the southern and eastern shore33. Based on current trends, in the next 30 years (2020- 2050), the population of the Mediterra- nean region will increase by 90 million inhabitants, reaching 611 million. In 2050, one third of the Mediterranean population will live on the northern shore, and two thirds on the southern and eastern shores34. The increasing population combined with changes in lifestyle and demand patterns result in growing demands for water, ener- gy and food from the Mediterranean Basin. The overexploitation of exist- ing water reservoirs and groundwater aquifers and the enhanced utilisation of ecosystem services adds increased stress to islands. Urbanisation - Demography A leading tourism destination, both for domestic and international travel- lers, the Mediterranean receives more than 300 million international tourists a year which accounts for 30% of to- tal world tourism35. This figure is ex- pected to reach 500 million by 203035. The tourism industry is one of the major economic sectors of the region and therefore an extremely important source of income for the Mediterra- nean and its islands, especially the smaller ones. Most island economies are dependent on tourism. Annually coastal tourism in the Mediterranean generates \u20ac300 billion and marine tourism \u20ac11036. Tourism represents around 9,5% of the EU GDP, for insu- lar regions, with this share increasing between 15-30% of GDP, and even 50% for several islands37. For exam- ple, the Greek Islands represent 60% of Hellenic tourism, an activity that contributed 20.8% to GDP in 2019.

The \u201cMediterranean Corridor\u201d is a large- scale EU transport project that has financed 54 rail projects and 33 mari- time ones, connecting the coastal ar- eas of the basin. These projects mean to support passengers and freight traf- fic, which is expected to double be- tween 2010-203039. This growth will come at a significant cost to the envi- ronment with increasing impacts from chemical pollution (hydrocarbons), noise pollution and collisions with ma- rine mammals40. These environmen- tal impacts are an issue for the whole Mediterranean basin, but they are of critical importance for the region's Marine Protected Areas, which are mostly concentrated around islands.

The overall annual economic value of fisheries in the region is estimated at \u20ac9.4 billion and contrib- utes livelihoods to a total of 785,000 people, 57% of which are linked to small-scale fishing41,42. Worryingly, the Mediterranean and Black Sea have the highest percentage (62.5%) of stocks being fished at unsustainable levels41. Island communities specialised in fish- ing have existed since antiquity. These communities hold a wealth of cultural heritage with incredible local ecologi- cal knowledge and traditional practices, some of which favour sustainable fish- ing. However, over the last few decades, in the context of a global fishing economy, the relationship fishers have with their activity has been changing. The impor- tance of these islands for the fishing in- dustry therefore goes far beyond their limited territories because fishery prod- ucts are no longer intended for local consumption only. In this context, the Mediterranean islands bear an unequal challenge. Despite a specific regulatory framework, small islands compete with the global market, which demands a continued increase in production. The Kerkennah Islands in Tunisia pro- vide a fair illustration of the dilemma between tradition and competitiveness. The traditional fishing activity included the use of palm leaves to create fixed fisheries in the low waters that surround the islands. This method requires time consuming preparation of the palm leaves. Pressured to produce more to capture larger quantities of fish, the use of palm leaves was replaced by plastic. Therefore, palm trees declined as fishermen no longer had a need to conserve them43,44. The change in pro- duction scale and methods has caused a significant environmental imbalance that has rendered the fishing practices unsustainable43. These fishing islands are not endowed with any specific legal measure that would allow the environmental and social balance to be restored. \u00a9 Pexels - Peter Simmons \u00a9 NounProject Eucalyp Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 14 Biodiversity policies and laws within the Mediterranean islands contexts 2.2. Islands are addressed by international, regional and national laws and policies for three different reasons. First of all, their biodiversity needs special attention. Sec- ondly, islands are significant for maritime boundaries. Finally, islands create living conditions that are hard for humans, and laws are used to ease them. Policy frameworks to protect island biodiversity At global level, the need to conserve island biodiversity is widely recognized, increas- ingly so in response to climate change. However, this recognition has been trans- lated into legal and political texts as an intention for action rather than to pro- vide specific measures and/or tools. The aforementioned CBD Island Biodiversity Programme of Work provides one such example. As does, Agenda 21, adopted in 1992 at the Earth Summit by 178 States, proposed for the first time, in Chapter 17, that small islands are territories that re- quire priority protection, since they are particularly vulnerable to climate change. Being a declarative and non-binding doc- ument, it aimed to inspire States to adapt their national laws accordingly. Similarly, at the eighth CBD meeting (Brazil, March 2006), the Conference of the Parties ad- opted the first-ever programme of work dedicated solely to the uniqueness and fragility of island biodiversity (decision VIII/1).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3dcf6139-df50-45ab-a7e9-78d92e6a6b7a": {"__data__": {"id_": "3dcf6139-df50-45ab-a7e9-78d92e6a6b7a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-3", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy Matters: Volume 3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-3", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1dc787e2f9e94c2052cdc9ef0b5909a8eab451b6d2da95080b95c4efe9701ff5"}, "2": {"node_id": "a08c8804-ff22-4a59-a317-688a0e4a3aa5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-3", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e609c68333412d415c476a6d3931b15b126969bbc9c157de045d4eb40140016c"}}, "hash": "76b78f8cfcebc13ea5a2de69a73e9e74c450a91eee4af481a4128ea1d7279b74", "text": "\u201cIts aim was to significantly reduce the rate of island biodiversity loss by 2010 and beyond as a contribution to poverty alleviation and the sustainable develop- ment of islands, particularly small island developing States45.\u201d Being specific to wetlands conservation at the international level, the Ramsar Con- vention on Wetlands addresses several aspects of island wetlands.

This Res- olution gave impetus to a Mediterranean dynamic to compile an inventory of island wetlands whose existence was not regis- tered and to adopt legal instruments for their protection. Transboundary policy processes have continued to highlight the importance of addressing biodiversity challenges in Mediterranean islands. The EU Biodi- versity Strategy, which is applicable to islands, sets up ambitious goals to be achieved by 2030 to protect and restore nature, as biodiversity and well-function- ing ecosystems are the \u201ckey to boost our resilience\u201d. A more island-centred exam- ple comes from the Council of Europe, whose \u201cCharter on the conservation and sustainable use of the biodiversity of the islands of Europe\u201d recognises the need Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 15 management to allow the conservation of island biodiversity46. The Mediterranean islands\u2019 biodiversity issues are taken into consideration by the Convention for the Protection of the Ma- rine Environment and the Coastal Region of the Mediterranean, also known as the Barcelona Convention. It contains region- al plans with binding targets as well as some specific provisions for islands, such as those referenced at the Protocol on In- tegrated Coastal Zone Management. Its article 12 states that the contracting Par- ties \u201cundertake to accord special protec- tion to islands, including small islands\u201d, protection that can be reflected in nation- al coastal plans and programs. The Barcelona Convention has estab- lished a list of Specially Protected Areas of Mediterranean Importance (SPAMIs), with the goal of promoting international cooperation for the conservation of nat- ural heritage by choosing flagship sites of Mediterranean biodiversity. Although there is no explicit reference to the need to protect islands, half of the SPAMI sites are on islands which reflects their signifi- cance for biodiversity protection (21 out of 39 sites). In addition, since the end of the 20th cen- tury, there has been a favourable trend towards the designation of protected ar- eas which are insular or include islands, on both shores of the Mediterranean, with variable protection and conserva- tion status, such as the Habibas Islands UNESCO Nature Reserve in Algeria (also a SPAMI) or the Palm Islands in Leba- non (National nature reserve, SPAMI and Ramsar Wetland), Zembra-Zembretta National Park in Tunisia (also UNESCO Biosphere Reserve under the Man and Biosphere Programme and a SPAMI) or Port-Cros in France (National parc and SPAMI) or the Marine Protected Area of Tavolara in Sardinia. \u00a9 Pexels - Yi\u011fit Can Etyemez Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 16 Policy frameworks to regulate island maritime delimitation Islands play an important role in maritime boundary delimitation. Negotiated for 20 years, the Convention on the Law of the Sea, regulates the regime of islands by stating that the inhabited islands or those having an economic life can have their own maritime zones (art. 121). Uninhab- ited islands (\u2018rocks\u2019) have only a territorial sea and a contiguous zone. This ambig- uous provision leaves the possibility of changing the regime applied depending on the status of the island as inhabited or not. This ambiguity has created several disputes, especially in southern China. In the Mediterranean, maritime delimitations still create conflicts between States and islands are at the heart of the claims. For example, there are delicate delimitations between Cyprus, Lebanon, and Israel, between Greece and Turkey and between France and Spain. The conflicts on the delimitation of the marine space have an economic and an ecological stake since the coastal States have the responsibili- ty to also protect the environment in their maritime zones.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e266d079-f9e1-482e-a401-58d3552336e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "e266d079-f9e1-482e-a401-58d3552336e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-3", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy Matters: Volume 3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-3", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b08a585160733b9f24df04c6b5826e31e12ec67f748fb889a2fe753964d83cd2"}, "2": {"node_id": "a3f255ba-59f5-41bc-bd0a-c4e1c7a7d44a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-3", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3e74fd96c00d5297b295783abd2485c7a37ca132bc480152ec5d8545d2797609"}}, "hash": "132a0a077126bd604c53ab1f7dd4df520caac01802859180a296129a12ef3bf5", "text": "Global Geography Legal text Provision concerning islands Law of the Sea Convention UNCLOS, (1982) \u2013 binding agreement Agenda 21 \u2013 Chapter 17 (1992): non-binding text Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) \u2013 binding text Convention on the Protec- tion of Wetlands (Ramsar, 1972) \u2013 binding text Art. 121: defines islands and clarifies maritime zones around them. \u201cRocks\u201d, meaning islands which can- not sustain human habitation or eco- nomic life, can only have a territorial sea and a contiguous zone.

Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 17 Policy frameworks to ease island living conditions Island living conditions lead to the adop- tion of regulations of socio-economic activities, whose goal is to ease human difficulties. These matters are mostly reg- ulated at a national or EU level. For exam- ple, the legal framework for the tourism sector is mainly a decision of national and regional authorities. At the international level, there are only declaratory provi- sions. For example, the Charter of Lan- zarote, which applies to all islands, states that tourism must \"contribute to sustain- able development\" and \"respect the frag- ile balances which characterise many tourist destinations, in particular small islands\"1. The European Union has a sup- porting competence in this matter, so it can only intervene to complete the action of the Member States. The financial stake both for the State and for the inhabitants is gigantic and can compromise the es tablishment of regulatory tourism policies adapted to the challenges of nature con- servation and island biodiversity. As mentioned previously, within the EU, member States are required to \u201cpay par- ticular attention to island regions\u201d under Article 174 of the Treaty on the Function- ing of the European Union. This attention can be translated into different types of legal measures adapted to island partic- ularities. However, the main goal of the article is to trigger measures that serve to reduce the gap between the level of de- velopment of island and mainland regions and not to protect island biodiversity. In- deed, the EU Parliament report on a strat- egy for sustainable tourism, repeats the importance of considering insularity37. 1 UNESCO / UNWTO / UNEP, Charter of Lanzarote, art. 2, 1995.

For example, the CPMR InterMediterranean Commission task force on culture and sustainable tourism47. The DestiMedPlus project which aimed to improve levels of integration between tourism and conser- vation policies through the creation of ec- otourism itineraries. This project also led to the development of a Mediterranean Ecotourism Consortium and a Mediterra- nean ecotourism policy roadmap which provides policy makers at regional and local level with context and key policy orientations for the development of eco- tourism governance and the integration of tourism and conservation policies in the Mediterranean48. The BEST MED project is another ex- ample. It is creating a Network of Sus- tainable Tourism Observatories for the Mediterranean (NSTO), gathering bod- ies / entities / organisations dealing with tourism data monitoring / management around the Mediterranean basin, to share ideas, techniques, and tools, and to build multi-level cooperation to seek the best solutions and work in a common direc- tion towards sustainable tourism49. The Glasgow Declaration is another major step towards international commitments for improved tourism.

The Mediterranean Islands Collective (MIC), financed by the MAVA Foundation, has developed the present strategy and associated action plan which aims to bet- ter preserve the biodiversity of the Med- iterranean islands to have coherent and collaborative action between the actors already working in the region. The strat- egy has been developed through exten- sive collaboration between PIM and MIC partners and in-depth consultations at national and regional level and is outlined below. The goal of the strategic plan is to stop further loss of biodiversity and to assist in the recovery of threatened Med- iterranean island biota by 2030. Six operational priority pillars provide a guide for achieving the specific objec- tives. For each pillar, a set of actions pave the way for diverse stakeholders that, in cooperation, at local, national and re- gional levels will ensure the Strategy can be delivered and implemented on the ground. The specific objectives within each pil- lar and suggested actions are not an ex- haustive list and should be treated as a guide. There are many more interventions that can be applied in favour of conserva- tion and sustainable use of biodiversity in the Mediterranean islands. It should also be noted that the 6 pillars of the Strate- gy should be considered in an integrated manner, whereby any proposed action may constitute a contribution to more than one pillar. In structural and functional terms, it is as- sumed that without knowledge, it is not possible to conserve and manage biodi- versity. Knowledge is the basis for pro- moting greater awareness and empower- ment, whether at the level of biodiversity managers, socio-economic agents or the population in general. Therefore, knowl- edge is also the basis for sustaining a comprehensive communication, that can be transmitted through different support channels and be directed at multiple-lev- els and varied target audiences. The successful implementation of the Strategy rests on carefully weighting the constraints resulting from climate change and what it implies in terms of adaptation. Understanding Mediterranean islands as a whole is key, and the Strategy has to be implemented in a spirit of solidarity be- tween island communities, therefore with the ambition of reducing economic and capacity gaps between EU and non-EU Mediterranean countries. Taking action in the Mediterranean, for living islands! Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 21 Based on the principle that it is only pos- sible to preserve what is known, and even though significant gaps remain in the existing knowledge on the Mediterra- nean and its biodiversity, one of the most problematic issues that exists is that the information that is available, such as, in- ventories, knowledge of ecosystems ser- vices and biodiversity maps, are not al- ways accessible and available for use by all relevant stakeholders. Updated knowledge, organised and made available in formats suitable and ac- cessible to different users, is fundamen- tal and can play a key role in supporting communication and awareness-raising actions on the importance of conserving island biodiversity in the Mediterranean. Knowledge also plays a central role in partnership building and awareness of biodiversity and climate change in the Mediterranean islands. Mediterranean islands\u2019 biodiversity in- cludes a high number of endemic and indigenous species, many of them with very small distribution areas. Most of these species are poorly understood in terms of conservation status and vulner- ability to human pressures and climate change. Under this pillar, the Action Plan will include activities aimed at: \u2022 Advancing inventories and map- ping of biodiversity hotspots at lo- cal level (species, habitats, ecosys- tem services) particularly on lesser researched islands, endangered species and taxa, and degraded sites; \u2022 Developing an integrated regional insular biodiversity database with the mapping of Key Island Biodi- versity Areas; \u2022 Supporting local-based research initiatives on biodiversity; \u2022 Helping local communities under- stand biodiversity conservation on the islands; \u2022 Sharing knowledge (data, best practices, etc) using up-to-date communication means at local, na- tional and regional levels.

Biodiversity and nature conservation be- ing the pillars of sustainable development is still not well understood or widely ac- cepted. Mainstreaming the need to con- sider biodiversity and nature within other sectoral and cross cutting policies and programmes requires awareness and sensitization. Additionally, it requires con- crete demonstrations of how biodiversity and nature-based solutions can contrib- ute to addressing socioeconomic chal- lenges and provide opportunities e.g., job and benefit creation. Strategies to achieve this should support the inclusion of biodiversity in sustainable develop- ment and policy agendas. Key activities to drive the implementation of concrete actions should be aimed at: \u2022 Supporting the inclusion of biodi- versity conservation in all public, national, and local policies, strate- gies and plans; \u2022 Facilitating stakeholders\u2019 partic- ipation and engagement in biodi- versity conservation actions; \u2022 Promoting citizen-science initia- tives related to island biodiversity conservation; \u2022 Engaging with relevant sectors and developing environmentally sound, and economically viable, activities in the fields of tourism, agricul- ture and fishing at the local level (e.g., developing circular economy dynamics, enhancing local value chains, integrated water resource management). \u00a9 Pexels - Jonas Von Werne Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 33 Facilitate stakeholder participation and engagement in biodiversity conservation actions Critical review of the main development strategies at the level of each island and identification of proposals for consideration and integration of biodiversity and nature conservation in dialogue with the responsible entities 4.1.

Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 42 This strategy is intended to serve as a functional collaborative platform involving all relevant actors for biodiversity conser- vation in the Mediterranean islands. The conservation and sustainable use of bio- diversity in the Mediterranean islands re- quires a broad commitment and partic- ipation from all sectors and is not only about nature conservation. Development on each Mediterranean island depends on the ability to ensure that species and ecosystems continue to provide key ser- vices to nature and society. The scientific community, those respon- sible for the management of protected areas or land planning and management, urban planning, agriculture, fisheries, tourism, shipping, energy, water sec- tors, education, local and national gov- ernments are the recipients and those responsible for ensuring the implemen- tation of specific actions that, on each is- land, give life to the vision and guidelines agreed in this strategy. Not intending to replace or overlap with other strategies and action plans already adopted in the Mediterranean island space, this strate- gy aims to facilitate collaborative involve- ment and participation, interdisciplinarity and dialogue between parties. \u00a9 Pexels - Anthony Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean Timeline, monitoring, evaluation, revision Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 5.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a3904974-04e5-4ed3-b4a0-a0e7b1029a4e": {"__data__": {"id_": "a3904974-04e5-4ed3-b4a0-a0e7b1029a4e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-3", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy Matters: Volume 3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-3", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1c695e306485f0a6616bf098c0bf6847fb17f059c32d0b1eb463b6e5496db7dc"}, "2": {"node_id": "7b3f0257-6a4f-4e2f-8f16-33f5e8cf0153", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-3", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2b319b85ff8f319f161f511a9fac0e434bc5e188610d217f961c480b74558b7a"}}, "hash": "6dfdaa9f6d7961a2dfbee127074c17dc2dcc910f3721ea00f6b1fb2cfc7878d8", "text": "Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 44 The Strategy proposes ten years for its implementation, considering the general objectives and the nature and diversity of interventions included in the Action Plan.

A final evaluation, including a proposal for re- vision of the Strategy, should be carried out during the last year of the Strategy's duration. MIC partners will establish a follow-up committee responsible for collecting all the relevant information for supporting the monitoring and evaluation of the Strategy, within the observatory. Monitoring and evaluation will use indicators and targets assigned to each action and the selection of indicators and targets should be es- tablished through a participatory process involving all relevant stakeholders. When appropriate, the evaluation and re- sults should consider the alignment with national (national biodiversity strategies) and international (Barcelona Convention, EU, IPBES, CBD) processes associated with nature conservation and biodiversity, underlining Mediterranean islands' con- tribution in global conservation efforts. As a final outcome, as promoters of the strategy, the MIC partners aim to create a representative observatory for the differ- ent relevant sectors that will be respon- sible for analysing developments in the different strategic guidelines and specif- ic actions. This planned observatory will act as the monitoring and follow-up tool, depending on the targets and indicators associated with each action, and will also be responsible for the integration and har- monisation of the diversity of data from the different levels of intervention (local, national, regional) under the Strategy.

The aim of the strategy is to help realize the vision of productive and biologically diverse Mediterranean islands that can meet the long term needs of people and nature, stop further loss of biodiversity and assist in the recovery of threatened Mediterranean island biota by 2030. Addressed to public authorities, conser- vation bodies and relevant actors working throughout the Mediterranean region, it is hoped that the present strategy brings biodiversity to the forefront and highlights its importance as a key pillar for support- ing continued socioeconomic develop- ment and resilience of Mediterranean is- lands that will ensure a brighter tomorrow. The Mediterranean Islands Collective (MIC), financed by the MAVA foundation, has developed this strategy through ex- tensive collaboration with project part- ners, pilot projects, and in-depth consul- tations at national and regional level. The implementation and progression of the strategy will continue to be led by MIC partners, in a coordination role. However, it is strongly recognized that the respon- sibility for its delivery is shared across rel- evant regional and EU organisations, lo- cal and national governments, business, environmental and community groups and private individuals throughout the Mediterranean region. The strategy and action plan presented below is beneficial as it builds off proj- ects, work and initiatives that are already underway or have been trialled through- out the region, working to protect and care for coastal, marine and island en- vironments. Rather than re-inventing the wheel it is hoped that this strategy is seen to bring all this existing work together, adding leadership, greater coordination of efforts, and a fresh momentum at a much larger Mediterranean scale. Shaped by results of pilot projects and consultations, the Mediterranean islands strategy and action plan seeks to min- imise the threats facing the region\u2019s is- lands and maximise opportunities. The strategy sets out six strategic pillars and a range of actions and measures to help its delivery: Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean ix Actions will be aimed at: \u2022 Advancing inventories and map- ping of biodiversity hotspots at local level (species, habitats, ecosystem services) particularly on lesser re- searched islands, endangered spe- cies and taxa, and degraded sites; \u2022 Developing an integrated regional in- sular biodiversity database with the mapping of Key Island Biodiversity Areas; \u2022 Supporting local-based research ini- tiatives on biodiversity; \u2022 Helping local communities under- stand biodiversity conservation on the islands; \u2022 Sharing knowledge (data, best prac- tices, etc) using up-to-date commu- nication means at local, national and regional levels.

Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean Introduction Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 1. Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 2 Islands represent about 6% of the Earth\u2019s terrestrial areas, hosting the greatest con- centration of biodiversity and sadly the highest number of species extinctions. They are home to 20% of all known ani- mal and plant species, and therefore play an enormously important role in preserv- ing global biodiversity, from ecologically and economically1. Biodiversity refers to the variety of life on Earth in all its forms, levels and combinations: genetic diversity, spe- cies diversity, and ecosystem diver- sity. In addition to the intrinsic value of life, biodiversity provides essential ecosystem services. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and De- velopment (OCDE) and the World Eco- nomic Forum indicate that ecosystem services of world biodiversity are esti- mated to be worth USD 125-140 trillion per year, representing more than half of the global gross domestic product2. Islands represent key refuges for biodi- versity, particularly where rare and threat- ened species are struggling to survive on the continental coasts, but are themselves being more and more threatened3. Island species are often evolutionarily distinctive and highly vulnerable to novel disturbanc- es, particularly invasive species4. The degradation of natural systems due to human activity and the consequent loss of biodiversity is a global prob- lem that requires urgent worldwide intervention. Unprecedented increases in consumption associated with demo- graphic growth and the extractive nature and intensity of production systems are exerting a constant and ever-increasing pressure on biodiversity. This pressure is resulting in profound changes to natural habitats, loss of species, contamination and a consequent loss in ecosystems\u2019 ability to regenerate and continue to pro- vide essential ecosystem services that are fundamental to mankind\u2019s survival. It is widely acknowledged by scientists and international organisations that islands are an outstanding source of biodiversi- ty as they host a significant proportion of endangered species5. However, their evolutionary distinctive- ness and high vulnerability make islands extinction epicentres. Island species have increased vulnerability as they have di- minished dispersal capability, smaller restricted habitats and tend to evolve in competition with relatively few other spe- cies. As a result, they develop survival strategies based on interdependency, co-evolution, and mutualism rather than defence mechanisms against a broad range of predators, competitors and other external threats. For this reason, many is- land species have become rare or threat- ened, and islands have a disproportionate number of recorded species extinctions when compared to continental systems6,7. To date, approximately 75% of reptile, bird, amphibian and mammal extinctions combined have occurred on islands5. With almost 5,000 islands and islets (fig- ures differ a little from one authority to the other), the Mediterranean basin has one of the largest groups of islands in the world.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b5d50ba5-70a8-4923-a998-411d7bfc5b2e": {"__data__": {"id_": "b5d50ba5-70a8-4923-a998-411d7bfc5b2e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy Matters: Volume 2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "666c27e15536a060f4044266fdc3d7d39edd9d25b266155ea6518650bb1e39de"}, "2": {"node_id": "23612c62-15d5-4315-988c-20b7f4878849", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d28a6c1b1505fc81c9f7c117da30bc9c328c755b2ebe056b6d31ffa70fa3aa62"}}, "hash": "ea385d63d3a9ba065465dbcbbbe498c8c60ba2a71321e7ae11b6dc04c4383488", "text": "The region is of great importance to global biodiversity thanks to its wealth of species, relatively high rate of ende- mism, long species history, as well as its role as a natural laboratory for evolution- ary studies3.

Small islands of less than 10 km2 represent more than 85% of the Mediterranean\u2019s island units. The Mediterranean islands and their biodiversity 1.1. Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 3 The Mediterranean basin has a com- plex geological history which means some islands have much higher prox- imity to continental coasts than others and some have been isolated for much longer. This combined with the high topographical and ecological variation of this region and the reduced severity of Quaternary climatic oscillations have produced a flora and fauna of excep- tional diversity3,10. Isolation resulting from insularity has led certain species to evolve genetically, particularly on the islands, creating high levels of ende- mism9. As a result of this unique sit- uation the Mediterranean represents the second most important hotspot on Earth. Thanks to speciation occurring on is- lands, endemism is higher, a fact that mechanically increases genetic diversi- ty and means that species can be found on only one or a group of islands. Small islands provide natural and undisturbed habitats for specific flora and fauna as well as unique biodiversity assemblag- es. Islands also represent the only ref- uges left for species that have disap- peared from continental areas and act as a refuge for endangered species, such as populations of seabirds that are found almost exclusively on small islands. Species occasionally behave differently on islands due to food re- source scarcity and absence of pre- dation \u2013 showing changes in their diet and island tameness6,7. These specific behaviours make them more vulnerable but also represent a behavioural diver- sity that deserves to be protected. All this rich biodiversity and life in the Mediterranean has attracted and sus- tained mankind since antiquity. Span- ning 22 countries, the Mediterranean\u2019s coastline exceeds 46,000 km. The coastline and islands are the most pro- ductive areas and therefore the most attractive for economic activities and development. Indeed, of the 529 million inhabitants in the Mediterranean, ap- proximately one third are located along the coasts and 55% live in coastal hy- drological basins11. This means a con- siderable amount of the total population is concentrated in a very small area and that Mediterranean ecosystems have been altered in many ways12. Develop- ment, urbanisation and continual ex- ploitation and use of natural resources is putting incredible strain on the Med- iterranean\u2019s biodiversity, particularly on its islands. The impact from human ac- tivities is proportionally stronger in the Mediterranean than in any other sea of the world 11,13 (and see Louis Brigand et al., UNEP - BP/RAC, 1991 cited in 14). These 529 million inhabitants are reli- ant upon the Mediterranean\u2019s natural resources and the ecosystem services it provides; however, its unique ecosys- tems are significantly degraded by a growing number of drivers of change. Habitat degradation and loss are being accentuated in the Mediterranean (and on its islands) by human activities that are transforming the coast, the land and the sea in response to the needs for agriculture, pastures, ports and oth- er infrastructures, settlements, tourist resorts and leisure activities, etc. In ad- dition, we are now seeing the impacts from climate change at rates beyond experts\u2019 expectations, and increasingly worrying trends in disturbances caused by invasive species. As some charac- teristics of islands worsen the environ- mental and climate change challenges these threats are increasing the vulner- ability of native and endemic species found throughout the basin, but espe- cially on islands. Islands\u2019 limited space and isolation highly restrict the mobility of some species and therefore increase the consequences of events such as heat waves or droughts and explain why the arrival of invasive species can have severe consequences for native species and island assemblages on islands and in other settings with high proportions of endemic species15. Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 4 Small islands are of special interest for sustainable development because of the aforementioned unique character- istics and vulnerabilities. They are eco- logically fragile, have limited resourc- es, are susceptible to natural disasters and increasingly vulnerable to climate change and invasive species. At the same time, island ecosystems provide valuable provisioning, regulating and cultural ecosystem services to island communities and visitors. Ecosystem services are the direct and indirect contributions of ecosystems to hu- man well-being16.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5a2c0b5b-a6da-4334-b0d7-e1d4746a421a": {"__data__": {"id_": "5a2c0b5b-a6da-4334-b0d7-e1d4746a421a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy Matters: Volume 2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "64d67e99a419a0a24f1b31734aa32ca0cad2174ac8f426c07da423bc0b2c2af0"}, "2": {"node_id": "5f06f008-d10b-44be-a50f-894019767e05", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "83195841ecfacd3d387b1bcfddea10806c4ddca4d7cc374b145675e348f841a8"}}, "hash": "49f58c08540d48f5450cdca1ec92509b919b7844aa4cd4c60a2317445a95f6b3", "text": "This definition im- plies a dependence of human societies on well-functioning ecosystems, and therefore sustainable management and conservation is critical.

Freshwater is an import- ant and scarce resource on many small islands, making water provisioning and water quality regulation of high priority. Islands\u2019 cultural ecosystem services in the form of recreation and eco-tourism are highly valued by tourists and locals alike and contribute directly to island economies and play an important role in structuring islands\u2019 landscapes17. There is increasing recognition of the wealth of human health benefits that stem from experiencing nature and bio- diversity18. In the Mediterranean cultural traditions run strong, one such example can be found in how closely tied native plants are with traditional human activ- ities that act in a way to maintain this species richness9. Erosion control and pollination regulation play important roles in the delivery of food provision- ing. Island ecosystems also contribute to the maintenance of ecosystem func- tions: they provide defence against nat- ural disasters, support nutrient cycling, and soil and sand formation; and they contribute to the regulation of climate and diseases19. Conserving biodiversity and therefore strengthening as- sociated ecosystem ser- vices, is of utmost impor- tance and fundamental to the socio-economic develop- ment of human communi- ties particularly in island geo- graphic contexts. There is a pressing need to reverse the trend of biodiversity loss. Action needs to be taken \u2013 at the Mediterranean ba- sin level to ensure that the ecosystem services upon which we rely can con- tinue to serve us. A Mediterranean wide strategy is urgently needed that will help the region and individual countries to strengthen and improve management efficiency in protected areas and other natural spaces, along with an integrat- ed approach to significantly change production and consumption models. To this end, we are witnessing the in- troduction of global, regional, local or thematic strategic visions and initiatives that intend to contribute to the conser- vation and sustainable use of biodiver- sity in islands. Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 5 At the international level, there are the CBD Island diversity Programme of work (https://www.cbd.int/island/pow.shtml) and Global Island Partnership (GLISPA https://www.cbd.int/island/glispa.sht- ml) that \u201cassists islands in addressing one of the world\u2019s greatest challenges: to conserve and utilise the invaluable island natural resources that support people, cultures, and livelihoods in their island homes around the world.\u201d The Small Islands Organisation (SMILO), a partner to MIC and this current project, is creating a network of small islands with a shared vision to foster innova- tions on islands that benefit the local population and their environment. They are helping small islands curb the im- pacts caused by human development and activities and are focusing on sus- tainable solutions in the fields of water & sanitation, waste, energy, biodiversi- ty, landscape and heritage. In 2021, the Virtual Islands Summit and the Island Space at CBD COP26 brought together influential changemakers, experts, and entrepreneurs to devise strategic vi- sions and discuss the innovation taking place on global islands. In addition to these visions and strategies, interesting initiatives to find workable sustainable solutions for the future are being pio- neered e.g., the adoption of emissions trading schemes and clean solar en- ergy schemes that aim to improve the sustainability of island communities. The Mediterranean islands are unique hotspots of biodiversity, within the greater Mediterranean hotspot, thanks to their rich and endemic flora20. Yet they do not exist independently. It is not just one island, or one island next to an- other that contributes to this wealth, it is the combined existence of them all that gives the Mediterranean such ex- traordinary variety. Thus, an integrated and targeted sustainable development/ conservation approach for the Mediter- ranean islands, promoting cooperation under a common regional vision offers a key contribution to preserving the ex- traordinary and unique biodiversity of the Mediterranean islands and to secur- ing the ecosystem services fundamen- tal to socio-economic development and preservation of its rich cultural heritage. \u00a9 Gratisography Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 6 Why a strategy for the preservation of biodiversity on Mediterranean islands? 1.2. \"The Mediterranean constitutes a very rich field of investigation for the study and understanding of island facts, and a field of specific actions for strat- egies for the protection and develop- ment of islands\" (Louis Brigand et al., UNEP - BP/RAC, 1991 cited in 14).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "36aa597b-32dc-4b8d-b68c-14a431856d15": {"__data__": {"id_": "36aa597b-32dc-4b8d-b68c-14a431856d15", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy Matters: Volume 2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0873b00b7a542ed36cd145bde73ab4c87db8cc21a175900a3832e11b78f8be55"}, "2": {"node_id": "24cad295-3307-4292-abae-3c6c0b5d3cb4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1db4a3f7bc3fe9c70cb731c5ef7b8afd8dd24eebf6ddd48a69e44c6d4447200c"}}, "hash": "20c304e3c02632612a4e881049ba59e89a2feff9dbc54186ea4a83384706a91d", "text": "This observation, drawn up in 1991, is even more relevant today, particularly con- cerning the development agenda in small islands, where many local, na- tional and international stakeholders are looking to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of the natural and cultural heritage of these exceptional territories.

To date several initiatives and proj- ects have aimed to improve the con- servation of Mediterranean islands biodiversity, yet such efforts have of- ten been localised, small-scale and/ or lacked the regional coordination necessary to bring about significant change. A common vision and strate- gy for the Mediterranean islands bio- diversity is therefore needed to boost and enhance conservation and sus- tainable use of these territories. The aim of this document is to outline a shared vision and strategy that will al- low for coherence and alignment with the principles of different international treaties such as the aforementioned CBD Islands Programme of Work and Glispa, Resolution XII.14/2015 of the Ramsar Convention (the only legal text that treats Mediterranean islands as a group), the Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) Protocol (Art. 12 which grants \u201cspecial protection to is- lands, including small islands\u201d), Article 174 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union which requires members to \u201cpay particular attention to island regions\u201d, the CPMR Islands Commission which urges \u201cEuropean Institutions and Member States to pay special attention to the islands, to ac- knowledge the permanent handicaps resulting from their insularity, and to implement policies that are best suit- ed to their condition\u201d and the Charter on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biological Diversity on Europe- an Islands of the Council of Europe. In fact, the latter indicates \u201cthe situation and characteristics of islands require the development and application of specially-adapted approaches and tools for problems analyses and re- sponse measures21.\u201d The Mediterranean region is data de- ficient and the lack of scientific knowl- edge continues to hamper conser- vation efforts. Information specific to islands is even less available, hence it is only possible to portray a regional level overview, whilst at the same time highlighting the need for improved data collection and monitoring of is- lands. For example, within the last 60 years the Mediterranean has lost 41% of its top predators, over 20% of Med- iterranean species are threatened with extinction and estimates suggest 30 endemic species will become extinct by the end of the 21st century22. Soil erosion is estimated to be twice as Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 7 high in the European Mediterranean than in the rest of Europe23. In Italy alone soil erosion is causing an annual loss of EUR 619 million with 33% of its total agricultur- al area affected by severe erosion24. Over 1000 non-indigenous species have been recorded in the Mediterranean Sea and are estimated to generate costs of EUR 26.8 billion25. And with temperatures going up 20% faster in the Mediterranean than the global average, there has never been a more critical or urgent time for action26. The outline of a common Biodiversity Strategy on Mediterranean islands, pre- sented here, can constitute a valuable entry point for action to address many of the challenges facing the region including habitat degradation, pollution and eutro- phication, over exploitation, bioinvasions, and impacts of climate change, as well as putting forward opportunities for growth of the blue economy, nature-based tourism, ecological restoration, and an increase in natural and socio-economic wellbeing for island communities. Addressed to conservation bodies and relevant actors working throughout the Mediterranean region, the present doc- ument aims to contribute to the effort of bringing biodiversity to the forefront. It highlights the importance of biodiversi- ty as a key pillar for supporting contin- ued socioeconomic development and resilience of Mediterranean islands that will ensure a brighter tomorrow. \u00a9 Pexels - Fayson Merege Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 2.

For the most part Mediterranean islands and continental coastlines are faced with the same, numerous and interrelated, threats, but often the challenges facing biodiversity on, and surrounding islands, are more se- vere.

Tourism, urban development and artificial- isation of natural habitats (particularly in coastal areas), overfishing, extensive farm- ing and other types of land use changes are some of the most pressing threats impact- ing Mediterranean islands biodiversity and ecosystems, combined with a significant transformation of lifestyle, culture and heri- tage. The table below summarises the main threats leading to environmental degrada- tion on Mediterranean islands and increased climate challenges. Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 10 Impacts from climate change including drier conditions due to less rainfall and variations in land and sea temperature are increasingly more evident in the Mediterranean than in other regional seas27. Its semi-enclosed nature pre- vents rapid water exchange and there- fore makes it more sensitive to tempera- ture and pH variations28. Together with high human pressure from densely pop- ulated coastal areas, climate change is making the Mediterranean Sea an es- pecially vulnerable place29. Worryingly, its islands are the areas most impacted by these changes. Climate change is occurring faster than expected by the scientific community and rapidly altering temperature and precipitation patterns. As a result, spe- cies are being forced to migrate to other habitats if possible or to adapt to their new climate. The changes are occurring at such speed that they are potential- ly exceeding the adaptive capacity and resilience of island ecosystems30. Some small low-lying islands face the increas- ing threat of water shortages and sea level rise, leading to habitat loss be- cause of this encroachment. Of in- creasing concern is that climate change along with (associated) natural risks such as fire and heavy rains are also contributing to the destruction of natu- ral habitats. Climate change favours the introduction of invasive exotic species, which often outcompete local popula- tions and can cause major changes to population and ecosystem dynamics. In combination with invasive species climate change and these natural risks are exacerbating the degradation of is- land ecosystems. Climate change and bio invasions are happening in already degraded sys- tems which means their impacts are much more detrimental and together all the threats facing the Mediterranean Sea are acting together to push marine biodiversity into decline28,31. Figure 1: Level of conservation of ecosystems at sea Source: EEA, 202132 Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 11 Main socioeconomic trends on Mediterranean islands 2.1. As stated previously the 22 countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea are home to a total of 529 million inhabi- tants: 205 million live on the northern shore and 324 on the southern and eastern shore33. Based on current trends, in the next 30 years (2020- 2050), the population of the Mediterra- nean region will increase by 90 million inhabitants, reaching 611 million. In 2050, one third of the Mediterranean population will live on the northern shore, and two thirds on the southern and eastern shores34. The increasing population combined with changes in lifestyle and demand patterns result in growing demands for water, ener- gy and food from the Mediterranean Basin. The overexploitation of exist- ing water reservoirs and groundwater aquifers and the enhanced utilisation of ecosystem services adds increased stress to islands. Urbanisation - Demography A leading tourism destination, both for domestic and international travel- lers, the Mediterranean receives more than 300 million international tourists a year which accounts for 30% of to- tal world tourism35. This figure is ex- pected to reach 500 million by 203035. The tourism industry is one of the major economic sectors of the region and therefore an extremely important source of income for the Mediterra- nean and its islands, especially the smaller ones. Most island economies are dependent on tourism. Annually coastal tourism in the Mediterranean generates \u20ac300 billion and marine tourism \u20ac11036. Tourism represents around 9,5% of the EU GDP, for insu- lar regions, with this share increasing between 15-30% of GDP, and even 50% for several islands37. For exam- ple, the Greek Islands represent 60% of Hellenic tourism, an activity that contributed 20.8% to GDP in 2019. In recent years, the consequences of COVID-19 on tourism have had signifi- cant impacts in insular regions, which in part has led to the development of the CPMR Islands Commission draft action plan 2022-2023 (see 38).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b6100adc-0568-455f-b987-6788ca70daf2": {"__data__": {"id_": "b6100adc-0568-455f-b987-6788ca70daf2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy Matters: Volume 2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "73c63436a9b62ef0e1ccf73085daab94bf76949dc6bdefb30671358285b3f380"}, "2": {"node_id": "176c9e56-89a1-4b61-a383-6193e31e97e4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "46603e4f5ad3095f7b3024cec3118dc44ddae1af198ed8001c3083cc5d1e7169"}}, "hash": "a2828f892b11af76dc1a627af3497d9650b1463df16f3ec62d711d2cf4a4f839", "text": "Tourism \u00a9 NounProject WEBTECHOPS LLP \u00a9 NounProject Nithinan Tatah Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 12 Transport The Mediterranean represents only 1% of the surface of the seas and oceans, but it accommodates 15% of global shipping39.

These projects mean to support passengers and freight traf- fic, which is expected to double be- tween 2010-203039. This growth will come at a significant cost to the envi- ronment with increasing impacts from chemical pollution (hydrocarbons), noise pollution and collisions with ma- rine mammals40. These environmen- tal impacts are an issue for the whole Mediterranean basin, but they are of critical importance for the region's Marine Protected Areas, which are mostly concentrated around islands.

The overall annual economic value of fisheries in the region is estimated at \u20ac9.4 billion and contrib- utes livelihoods to a total of 785,000 people, 57% of which are linked to small-scale fishing41,42. Worryingly, the Mediterranean and Black Sea have the highest percentage (62.5%) of stocks being fished at unsustainable levels41. Island communities specialised in fish- ing have existed since antiquity. These communities hold a wealth of cultural heritage with incredible local ecologi- cal knowledge and traditional practices, some of which favour sustainable fish- ing. However, over the last few decades, in the context of a global fishing economy, the relationship fishers have with their activity has been changing. The impor- tance of these islands for the fishing in- dustry therefore goes far beyond their limited territories because fishery prod- ucts are no longer intended for local consumption only. In this context, the Mediterranean islands bear an unequal challenge. Despite a specific regulatory framework, small islands compete with the global market, which demands a continued increase in production. The Kerkennah Islands in Tunisia pro- vide a fair illustration of the dilemma between tradition and competitiveness. The traditional fishing activity included the use of palm leaves to create fixed fisheries in the low waters that surround the islands. This method requires time consuming preparation of the palm leaves. Pressured to produce more to capture larger quantities of fish, the use of palm leaves was replaced by plastic. Therefore, palm trees declined as fishermen no longer had a need to conserve them43,44. The change in pro- duction scale and methods has caused a significant environmental imbalance that has rendered the fishing practices unsustainable43. These fishing islands are not endowed with any specific legal measure that would allow the environmental and social balance to be restored. \u00a9 Pexels - Peter Simmons \u00a9 NounProject Eucalyp Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 14 Biodiversity policies and laws within the Mediterranean islands contexts 2.2. Islands are addressed by international, regional and national laws and policies for three different reasons. First of all, their biodiversity needs special attention. Sec- ondly, islands are significant for maritime boundaries. Finally, islands create living conditions that are hard for humans, and laws are used to ease them. Policy frameworks to protect island biodiversity At global level, the need to conserve island biodiversity is widely recognized, increas- ingly so in response to climate change. However, this recognition has been trans- lated into legal and political texts as an intention for action rather than to pro- vide specific measures and/or tools. The aforementioned CBD Island Biodiversity Programme of Work provides one such example. As does, Agenda 21, adopted in 1992 at the Earth Summit by 178 States, proposed for the first time, in Chapter 17, that small islands are territories that re- quire priority protection, since they are particularly vulnerable to climate change.

This Res- olution gave impetus to a Mediterranean dynamic to compile an inventory of island wetlands whose existence was not regis- tered and to adopt legal instruments for their protection. Transboundary policy processes have continued to highlight the importance of addressing biodiversity challenges in Mediterranean islands. The EU Biodi- versity Strategy, which is applicable to islands, sets up ambitious goals to be achieved by 2030 to protect and restore nature, as biodiversity and well-function- ing ecosystems are the \u201ckey to boost our resilience\u201d. A more island-centred exam- ple comes from the Council of Europe, whose \u201cCharter on the conservation and sustainable use of the biodiversity of the islands of Europe\u201d recognises the need Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 15 management to allow the conservation of island biodiversity46. The Mediterranean islands\u2019 biodiversity issues are taken into consideration by the Convention for the Protection of the Ma- rine Environment and the Coastal Region of the Mediterranean, also known as the Barcelona Convention. It contains region- al plans with binding targets as well as some specific provisions for islands, such as those referenced at the Protocol on In- tegrated Coastal Zone Management. Its article 12 states that the contracting Par- ties \u201cundertake to accord special protec- tion to islands, including small islands\u201d, protection that can be reflected in nation- al coastal plans and programs. The Barcelona Convention has estab- lished a list of Specially Protected Areas of Mediterranean Importance (SPAMIs), with the goal of promoting international cooperation for the conservation of nat- ural heritage by choosing flagship sites of Mediterranean biodiversity. Although there is no explicit reference to the need to protect islands, half of the SPAMI sites are on islands which reflects their signifi- cance for biodiversity protection (21 out of 39 sites). In addition, since the end of the 20th cen- tury, there has been a favourable trend towards the designation of protected ar- eas which are insular or include islands, on both shores of the Mediterranean, with variable protection and conserva- tion status, such as the Habibas Islands UNESCO Nature Reserve in Algeria (also a SPAMI) or the Palm Islands in Leba- non (National nature reserve, SPAMI and Ramsar Wetland), Zembra-Zembretta National Park in Tunisia (also UNESCO Biosphere Reserve under the Man and Biosphere Programme and a SPAMI) or Port-Cros in France (National parc and SPAMI) or the Marine Protected Area of Tavolara in Sardinia. \u00a9 Pexels - Yi\u011fit Can Etyemez Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 16 Policy frameworks to regulate island maritime delimitation Islands play an important role in maritime boundary delimitation. Negotiated for 20 years, the Convention on the Law of the Sea, regulates the regime of islands by stating that the inhabited islands or those having an economic life can have their own maritime zones (art. 121). Uninhab- ited islands (\u2018rocks\u2019) have only a territorial sea and a contiguous zone. This ambig- uous provision leaves the possibility of changing the regime applied depending on the status of the island as inhabited or not. This ambiguity has created several disputes, especially in southern China. In the Mediterranean, maritime delimitations still create conflicts between States and islands are at the heart of the claims. For example, there are delicate delimitations between Cyprus, Lebanon, and Israel, between Greece and Turkey and between France and Spain. The conflicts on the delimitation of the marine space have an economic and an ecological stake since the coastal States have the responsibili- ty to also protect the environment in their maritime zones.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8262b297-ba7d-40ed-8afd-6ed7b9eebedc": {"__data__": {"id_": "8262b297-ba7d-40ed-8afd-6ed7b9eebedc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy Matters: Volume 2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1407dc75d4bc6c2d1d654a18fb7e4015ddacc692080c97c13c0ddf17df76ce38"}, "2": {"node_id": "91cf4acf-c9f6-4141-9623-0150eca46f2f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a1cbf992299a07f506c17c253fb9ee3bda666b76df8607bb81ff157cdd3722c7"}}, "hash": "1ce92b2c044e59fbeb82144137f0dc83b5df8def78c33bbe7782fbfe16be8be9", "text": "Global Geography Legal text Provision concerning islands Law of the Sea Convention UNCLOS, (1982) \u2013 binding agreement Agenda 21 \u2013 Chapter 17 (1992): non-binding text Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) \u2013 binding text Convention on the Protec- tion of Wetlands (Ramsar, 1972) \u2013 binding text Art. 121: defines islands and clarifies maritime zones around them. \u201cRocks\u201d, meaning islands which can- not sustain human habitation or eco- nomic life, can only have a territorial sea and a contiguous zone.

Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 17 Policy frameworks to ease island living conditions Island living conditions lead to the adop- tion of regulations of socio-economic activities, whose goal is to ease human difficulties. These matters are mostly reg- ulated at a national or EU level. For exam- ple, the legal framework for the tourism sector is mainly a decision of national and regional authorities. At the international level, there are only declaratory provi- sions. For example, the Charter of Lan- zarote, which applies to all islands, states that tourism must \"contribute to sustain- able development\" and \"respect the frag- ile balances which characterise many tourist destinations, in particular small islands\"1. The European Union has a sup- porting competence in this matter, so it can only intervene to complete the action of the Member States. The financial stake both for the State and for the inhabitants is gigantic and can compromise the es tablishment of regulatory tourism policies adapted to the challenges of nature con- servation and island biodiversity. As mentioned previously, within the EU, member States are required to \u201cpay par- ticular attention to island regions\u201d under Article 174 of the Treaty on the Function- ing of the European Union. This attention can be translated into different types of legal measures adapted to island partic- ularities. However, the main goal of the article is to trigger measures that serve to reduce the gap between the level of de- velopment of island and mainland regions and not to protect island biodiversity. In- deed, the EU Parliament report on a strat- egy for sustainable tourism, repeats the importance of considering insularity37. 1 UNESCO / UNWTO / UNEP, Charter of Lanzarote, art. 2, 1995.

For example, the CPMR InterMediterranean Commission task force on culture and sustainable tourism47. The DestiMedPlus project which aimed to improve levels of integration between tourism and conser- vation policies through the creation of ec- otourism itineraries. This project also led to the development of a Mediterranean Ecotourism Consortium and a Mediterra- nean ecotourism policy roadmap which provides policy makers at regional and local level with context and key policy orientations for the development of eco- tourism governance and the integration of tourism and conservation policies in the Mediterranean48. The BEST MED project is another ex- ample. It is creating a Network of Sus- tainable Tourism Observatories for the Mediterranean (NSTO), gathering bod- ies / entities / organisations dealing with tourism data monitoring / management around the Mediterranean basin, to share ideas, techniques, and tools, and to build multi-level cooperation to seek the best solutions and work in a common direc- tion towards sustainable tourism49. The Glasgow Declaration is another major step towards international commitments for improved tourism.

The Mediterranean Islands Collective (MIC), financed by the MAVA Foundation, has developed the present strategy and associated action plan which aims to bet- ter preserve the biodiversity of the Med- iterranean islands to have coherent and collaborative action between the actors already working in the region. The strat- egy has been developed through exten- sive collaboration between PIM and MIC partners and in-depth consultations at national and regional level and is outlined below. The goal of the strategic plan is to stop further loss of biodiversity and to assist in the recovery of threatened Med- iterranean island biota by 2030. Six operational priority pillars provide a guide for achieving the specific objec- tives. For each pillar, a set of actions pave the way for diverse stakeholders that, in cooperation, at local, national and re- gional levels will ensure the Strategy can be delivered and implemented on the ground. The specific objectives within each pil- lar and suggested actions are not an ex- haustive list and should be treated as a guide. There are many more interventions that can be applied in favour of conserva- tion and sustainable use of biodiversity in the Mediterranean islands. It should also be noted that the 6 pillars of the Strate- gy should be considered in an integrated manner, whereby any proposed action may constitute a contribution to more than one pillar. In structural and functional terms, it is as- sumed that without knowledge, it is not possible to conserve and manage biodi- versity. Knowledge is the basis for pro- moting greater awareness and empower- ment, whether at the level of biodiversity managers, socio-economic agents or the population in general. Therefore, knowl- edge is also the basis for sustaining a comprehensive communication, that can be transmitted through different support channels and be directed at multiple-lev- els and varied target audiences. The successful implementation of the Strategy rests on carefully weighting the constraints resulting from climate change and what it implies in terms of adaptation. Understanding Mediterranean islands as a whole is key, and the Strategy has to be implemented in a spirit of solidarity be- tween island communities, therefore with the ambition of reducing economic and capacity gaps between EU and non-EU Mediterranean countries. Taking action in the Mediterranean, for living islands! Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 21 Based on the principle that it is only pos- sible to preserve what is known, and even though significant gaps remain in the existing knowledge on the Mediterra- nean and its biodiversity, one of the most problematic issues that exists is that the information that is available, such as, in- ventories, knowledge of ecosystems ser- vices and biodiversity maps, are not al- ways accessible and available for use by all relevant stakeholders. Updated knowledge, organised and made available in formats suitable and ac- cessible to different users, is fundamen- tal and can play a key role in supporting communication and awareness-raising actions on the importance of conserving island biodiversity in the Mediterranean. Knowledge also plays a central role in partnership building and awareness of biodiversity and climate change in the Mediterranean islands. Mediterranean islands\u2019 biodiversity in- cludes a high number of endemic and indigenous species, many of them with very small distribution areas. Most of these species are poorly understood in terms of conservation status and vulner- ability to human pressures and climate change. Under this pillar, the Action Plan will include activities aimed at: \u2022 Advancing inventories and map- ping of biodiversity hotspots at lo- cal level (species, habitats, ecosys- tem services) particularly on lesser researched islands, endangered species and taxa, and degraded sites; \u2022 Developing an integrated regional insular biodiversity database with the mapping of Key Island Biodi- versity Areas; \u2022 Supporting local-based research initiatives on biodiversity; \u2022 Helping local communities under- stand biodiversity conservation on the islands; \u2022 Sharing knowledge (data, best practices, etc) using up-to-date communication means at local, na- tional and regional levels.

Biodiversity and nature conservation be- ing the pillars of sustainable development is still not well understood or widely ac- cepted. Mainstreaming the need to con- sider biodiversity and nature within other sectoral and cross cutting policies and programmes requires awareness and sensitization. Additionally, it requires con- crete demonstrations of how biodiversity and nature-based solutions can contrib- ute to addressing socioeconomic chal- lenges and provide opportunities e.g., job and benefit creation. Strategies to achieve this should support the inclusion of biodiversity in sustainable develop- ment and policy agendas.

Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 42 This strategy is intended to serve as a functional collaborative platform involving all relevant actors for biodiversity conser- vation in the Mediterranean islands. The conservation and sustainable use of bio- diversity in the Mediterranean islands re- quires a broad commitment and partic- ipation from all sectors and is not only about nature conservation. Development on each Mediterranean island depends on the ability to ensure that species and ecosystems continue to provide key ser- vices to nature and society. The scientific community, those respon- sible for the management of protected areas or land planning and management, urban planning, agriculture, fisheries, tourism, shipping, energy, water sec- tors, education, local and national gov- ernments are the recipients and those responsible for ensuring the implemen- tation of specific actions that, on each is- land, give life to the vision and guidelines agreed in this strategy. Not intending to replace or overlap with other strategies and action plans already adopted in the Mediterranean island space, this strate- gy aims to facilitate collaborative involve- ment and participation, interdisciplinarity and dialogue between parties. \u00a9 Pexels - Anthony Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean Timeline, monitoring, evaluation, revision Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 5.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "be063943-dbf7-4c8e-b280-834260f4154a": {"__data__": {"id_": "be063943-dbf7-4c8e-b280-834260f4154a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy Matters: Volume 2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9ade1ee7cf723bc62eaca671caa78e2ca5ad2e9c8ecf434c655af4b0357a6ec8"}, "2": {"node_id": "bcf1a459-8200-45d7-96d7-f60b43985b2c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d0a1b46cf48f7cb9c6ac69fb2b6490e190477e2d908e01911fcc3c227b4560bd"}}, "hash": "c54810963a46b9528ccffeeac9b12fe9c91b8f48a607f1324f8faf024a95bdf3", "text": "Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 44 The Strategy proposes ten years for its implementation, considering the general objectives and the nature and diversity of interventions included in the Action Plan.

A final evaluation, including a proposal for re- vision of the Strategy, should be carried out during the last year of the Strategy's duration. MIC partners will establish a follow-up committee responsible for collecting all the relevant information for supporting the monitoring and evaluation of the Strategy, within the observatory. Monitoring and evaluation will use indicators and targets assigned to each action and the selection of indicators and targets should be es- tablished through a participatory process involving all relevant stakeholders. When appropriate, the evaluation and re- sults should consider the alignment with national (national biodiversity strategies) and international (Barcelona Convention, EU, IPBES, CBD) processes associated with nature conservation and biodiversity, underlining Mediterranean islands' con- tribution in global conservation efforts. As a final outcome, as promoters of the strategy, the MIC partners aim to create a representative observatory for the differ- ent relevant sectors that will be respon- sible for analysing developments in the different strategic guidelines and specif- ic actions. This planned observatory will act as the monitoring and follow-up tool, depending on the targets and indicators associated with each action, and will also be responsible for the integration and har- monisation of the diversity of data from the different levels of intervention (local, national, regional) under the Strategy.

The aim of the strategy is to help realize the vision of productive and biologically diverse Mediterranean islands that can meet the long term needs of people and nature, stop further loss of biodiversity and assist in the recovery of threatened Mediterranean island biota by 2030. Addressed to public authorities, conser- vation bodies and relevant actors working throughout the Mediterranean region, it is hoped that the present strategy brings biodiversity to the forefront and highlights its importance as a key pillar for support- ing continued socioeconomic develop- ment and resilience of Mediterranean is- lands that will ensure a brighter tomorrow. The Mediterranean Islands Collective (MIC), financed by the MAVA foundation, has developed this strategy through ex- tensive collaboration with project part- ners, pilot projects, and in-depth consul- tations at national and regional level. The implementation and progression of the strategy will continue to be led by MIC partners, in a coordination role. However, it is strongly recognized that the respon- sibility for its delivery is shared across rel- evant regional and EU organisations, lo- cal and national governments, business, environmental and community groups and private individuals throughout the Mediterranean region. The strategy and action plan presented below is beneficial as it builds off proj- ects, work and initiatives that are already underway or have been trialled through- out the region, working to protect and care for coastal, marine and island en- vironments. Rather than re-inventing the wheel it is hoped that this strategy is seen to bring all this existing work together, adding leadership, greater coordination of efforts, and a fresh momentum at a much larger Mediterranean scale. Shaped by results of pilot projects and consultations, the Mediterranean islands strategy and action plan seeks to min- imise the threats facing the region\u2019s is- lands and maximise opportunities. The strategy sets out six strategic pillars and a range of actions and measures to help its delivery: Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean ix Actions will be aimed at: \u2022 Advancing inventories and map- ping of biodiversity hotspots at local level (species, habitats, ecosystem services) particularly on lesser re- searched islands, endangered spe- cies and taxa, and degraded sites; \u2022 Developing an integrated regional in- sular biodiversity database with the mapping of Key Island Biodiversity Areas; \u2022 Supporting local-based research ini- tiatives on biodiversity; \u2022 Helping local communities under- stand biodiversity conservation on the islands; \u2022 Sharing knowledge (data, best prac- tices, etc) using up-to-date commu- nication means at local, national and regional levels. Strengthen knowledge and raise awareness on Mediterranean islands 1 Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean x Actions will be aimed at: \u2022 Developing and implementing capac- ity-building programmes addressing specific needs on biodiversity conser- vation at local, national and regional levels; \u2022 Promoting initiatives engaging the so- cioeconomic sector on conserva- tion and sustainable use of biodiversity (e.g., sustainable nature-based tourism, fisheries, agriculture); \u2022 Training protected area managers and technicians on the fundamentals of a co-management approach. Embed capacity for biodiversity conservation and sustainable management at the island level 2 Actions will be aimed at: \u2022 Developing restoration initiatives on degraded sites and important habi- tats, species and ecosystems; \u2022 Enhancing marine invasive alien species control measures and pro- grammes; \u2022 Promoting co-management ap- proaches at the level of island based protected areas. Pilot the development and implementation of island- level joint initiatives in conservation and restoration of biodiversity and its ecosystems 3 Promote sustainable use of biodiversity and ecosystem services for living islands 4 Actions will be aimed at: \u2022 Supporting the inclusion of biodiver- sity conservation in all public, nation- al, and local policies, strategies and plans; \u2022 Facilitating stakeholders\u2019 participation and engagement in biodiversity con- servation actions; \u2022 Promoting citizen-science initiatives related to island biodiversity conser- vation; \u2022 Engaging with relevant sectors and developing environmentally sound, and economically viable, activities in the fields of tourism, agriculture and fishing at the local level (e.g., develop- ing circular economy dynamics, en- hancing local value chains, integrated water resource management).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5f08384a-9a67-448d-98cd-9aad53d20651": {"__data__": {"id_": "5f08384a-9a67-448d-98cd-9aad53d20651", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-1", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy Matters: Volume 1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-1", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "253579e8c33540ee4bc6a6ef109777781601089543d92b0ccffaef0c84c25575"}, "2": {"node_id": "e223574b-d6a1-43a4-bdb3-c550b0739d32", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-1", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a456e045318ba0f438736a04d89c0898c99eccc27b7cb5edb552ace9f1dee251"}}, "hash": "d91b55329241a8165bc387aa680fc11afeeab54feab63862e1921bd4403ea764", "text": "Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean xi Actions will be aimed at: \u2022 Developing and implementing an in- tegrated regional communication pro- gramme for island biodiversity con- servation (e.g., create a user friendly and attractive design for the strategy and promote its dissemination) \u2022 Implementing a regional capacity building and transfer knowledge pro- gramme on island biodiversity man- agement and conservation; \u2022 Ensuring a Mediterranean participa- tion/voice", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3fa7e1f5-817a-49b4-8d33-7b50c2084f79": {"__data__": {"id_": "3fa7e1f5-817a-49b4-8d33-7b50c2084f79", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-1", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy Matters: Volume 1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-1", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bbbd3a3f3a74d0623a2fd473d25bfc520fb7cbccbdaaa0e70434149e0c693ef2"}, "3": {"node_id": "11d9ee33-f2f1-44e2-82fe-1db7e7befdfd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-1", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bcb79e6f9cee54d6ad59274e4dbb80dbd1dce497b5996d16ad99ebc7d4d24904"}}, "hash": "04289ccead58bc262ee40127782f68963974eddeb20e6554fd204680fb7ee12e", "text": "in relevant international bio- diversity fora.

MIC part- ners will be responsible for monitoring the progress of its implementation and deliv- ery. As a long-term strategy the objec- tives and actions that underpin the strate- gy will be achieved in the short, medium, and long term, depending on the objec- tives and complexity and collaboration required. Annual progress reports will be produced at island level, enabling an in- tegrated analysis and evaluation, and fa- cilitating the exchange of experience be- tween Mediterranean islands. A mid-term review will be carried out at the end of the fourth year, allowing for adjustments, and again at the end of the ten years, ensur- ing a positive difference is being achieved through this work. In addition, MIC partners aim to create a representative observatory for the differ- ent relevant sectors that will be respon- sible for analysing developments in the different strategic guidelines and specific actions. Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean Introduction Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 1. Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 2 Islands represent about 6% of the Earth\u2019s terrestrial areas, hosting the greatest con- centration of biodiversity and sadly the highest number of species extinctions. They are home to 20% of all known ani- mal and plant species, and therefore play an enormously important role in preserv- ing global biodiversity, from ecologically and economically1. Biodiversity refers to the variety of life on Earth in all its forms, levels and combinations: genetic diversity, spe- cies diversity, and ecosystem diver- sity. In addition to the intrinsic value of life, biodiversity provides essential ecosystem services. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and De- velopment (OCDE) and the World Eco- nomic Forum indicate that ecosystem services of world biodiversity are esti- mated to be worth USD 125-140 trillion per year, representing more than half of the global gross domestic product2. Islands represent key refuges for biodi- versity, particularly where rare and threat- ened species are struggling to survive on the continental coasts, but are themselves being more and more threatened3. Island species are often evolutionarily distinctive and highly vulnerable to novel disturbanc- es, particularly invasive species4. The degradation of natural systems due to human activity and the consequent loss of biodiversity is a global prob- lem that requires urgent worldwide intervention. Unprecedented increases in consumption associated with demo- graphic growth and the extractive nature and intensity of production systems are exerting a constant and ever-increasing pressure on biodiversity. This pressure is resulting in profound changes to natural habitats, loss of species, contamination and a consequent loss in ecosystems\u2019 ability to regenerate and continue to pro- vide essential ecosystem services that are fundamental to mankind\u2019s survival. It is widely acknowledged by scientists and international organisations that islands are an outstanding source of biodiversi- ty as they host a significant proportion of endangered species5. However, their evolutionary distinctive- ness and high vulnerability make islands extinction epicentres. Island species have increased vulnerability as they have di- minished dispersal capability, smaller restricted habitats and tend to evolve in competition with relatively few other spe- cies. As a result, they develop survival strategies based on interdependency, co-evolution, and mutualism rather than defence mechanisms against a broad range of predators, competitors and other external threats. For this reason, many is- land species have become rare or threat- ened, and islands have a disproportionate number of recorded species extinctions when compared to continental systems6,7. To date, approximately 75% of reptile, bird, amphibian and mammal extinctions combined have occurred on islands5. With almost 5,000 islands and islets (fig- ures differ a little from one authority to the other), the Mediterranean basin has one of the largest groups of islands in the world.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "11d9ee33-f2f1-44e2-82fe-1db7e7befdfd": {"__data__": {"id_": "11d9ee33-f2f1-44e2-82fe-1db7e7befdfd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-1", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy Matters: Volume 1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-1", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bbbd3a3f3a74d0623a2fd473d25bfc520fb7cbccbdaaa0e70434149e0c693ef2"}, "2": {"node_id": "3fa7e1f5-817a-49b4-8d33-7b50c2084f79", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-1", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "04289ccead58bc262ee40127782f68963974eddeb20e6554fd204680fb7ee12e"}}, "hash": "bcb79e6f9cee54d6ad59274e4dbb80dbd1dce497b5996d16ad99ebc7d4d24904", "text": "The region is of great importance to global biodiversity thanks to its wealth of species, relatively high rate of ende- mism, long species history, as well as its role as a natural laboratory for evolution- ary studies3.

Small islands of less than 10 km2 represent more than 85% of the Mediterranean\u2019s island units. The Mediterranean islands and their biodiversity 1.1. Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 3 The Mediterranean basin has a com- plex geological history which means some islands have much higher prox- imity to continental coasts than others and some have been isolated for much longer. This combined with the high topographical and ecological variation of this region and the reduced severity of Quaternary climatic oscillations have produced a flora and fauna of excep- tional diversity3,10. Isolation resulting from insularity has led certain species to evolve genetically, particularly on the islands, creating high levels of ende- mism9. As a result of this unique sit- uation the Mediterranean represents the second most important hotspot on Earth. Thanks to speciation occurring on is- lands, endemism is higher, a fact that mechanically increases genetic diversi- ty and means that species can be found on only one or a group of islands. Small islands provide natural and undisturbed habitats for specific flora and fauna as well as unique biodiversity assemblag- es. Islands also represent the only ref- uges left for species that have disap- peared from continental areas and act as a refuge for endangered species, such as populations of seabirds that are found almost exclusively on small islands. Species occasionally behave differently on islands due to food re- source scarcity and absence of pre- dation \u2013 showing changes in their diet and island tameness6,7. These specific behaviours make them more vulnerable but also represent a behavioural diver- sity that deserves to be protected. All this rich biodiversity and life in the Mediterranean has attracted and sus- tained mankind since antiquity. Span- ning 22 countries, the Mediterranean\u2019s coastline exceeds 46,000 km. The coastline and islands are the most pro- ductive areas and therefore the most attractive for economic activities and development. Indeed, of the 529 million inhabitants in the Mediterranean, ap- proximately one third are located along the coasts and 55% live in coastal hy- drological basins11. This means a con- siderable amount of the total population is concentrated in a very small area and that Mediterranean ecosystems have been altered in many ways12. Develop- ment, urbanisation and continual ex- ploitation and use of natural resources is putting incredible strain on the Med- iterranean\u2019s biodiversity, particularly on its islands. The impact from human ac- tivities is proportionally stronger in the Mediterranean than in any other sea of the world 11,13 (and see Louis Brigand et al., UNEP - BP/RAC, 1991 cited in 14). These 529 million inhabitants are reli- ant upon the Mediterranean\u2019s natural resources and the ecosystem services it provides; however, its unique ecosys- tems are significantly degraded by a growing number of drivers of change. Habitat degradation and loss are being accentuated in the Mediterranean (and on its islands) by human activities that are transforming the coast, the land and the sea in response to the needs for agriculture, pastures, ports and oth- er infrastructures, settlements, tourist resorts and leisure activities, etc. In ad- dition, we are now seeing the impacts from climate change at rates beyond experts\u2019 expectations, and increasingly worrying trends in disturbances caused by invasive species. As some charac- teristics of islands worsen the environ- mental and climate change challenges these threats are increasing the vulner- ability of native and endemic species found throughout the basin, but espe- cially on islands. Islands\u2019 limited space and isolation highly restrict the mobility of some species and therefore increase the consequences of events such as heat waves or droughts and explain why the arrival of invasive species can have severe consequences for native species and island assemblages on islands and in other settings with high proportions of endemic species15. Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 4 Small islands are of special interest for sustainable development because of the aforementioned unique character- istics and vulnerabilities. They are eco- logically fragile, have limited resourc- es, are susceptible to natural disasters and increasingly vulnerable to climate change and invasive species. At the same time, island ecosystems provide valuable provisioning, regulating and cultural ecosystem services to island communities and visitors.

Freshwater is an import- ant and scarce resource on many small islands, making water provisioning and water quality regulation of high priority. Islands\u2019 cultural ecosystem services in the form of recreation and eco-tourism are highly valued by tourists and locals alike and contribute directly to island economies and play an important role in structuring islands\u2019 landscapes17. There is increasing recognition of the wealth of human health benefits that stem from experiencing nature and bio- diversity18. In the Mediterranean cultural traditions run strong, one such example can be found in how closely tied native plants are with traditional human activ- ities that act in a way to maintain this species richness9. Erosion control and pollination regulation play important roles in the delivery of food provision- ing. Island ecosystems also contribute to the maintenance of ecosystem func- tions: they provide defence against nat- ural disasters, support nutrient cycling, and soil and sand formation; and they contribute to the regulation of climate and diseases19. Conserving biodiversity and therefore strengthening as- sociated ecosystem ser- vices, is of utmost impor- tance and fundamental to the socio-economic develop- ment of human communi- ties particularly in island geo- graphic contexts. There is a pressing need to reverse the trend of biodiversity loss. Action needs to be taken \u2013 at the Mediterranean ba- sin level to ensure that the ecosystem services upon which we rely can con- tinue to serve us. A Mediterranean wide strategy is urgently needed that will help the region and individual countries to strengthen and improve management efficiency in protected areas and other natural spaces, along with an integrat- ed approach to significantly change production and consumption models. To this end, we are witnessing the in- troduction of global, regional, local or thematic strategic visions and initiatives that intend to contribute to the conser- vation and sustainable use of biodiver- sity in islands. Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 5 At the international level, there are the CBD Island diversity Programme of work (https://www.cbd.int/island/pow.shtml) and Global Island Partnership (GLISPA https://www.cbd.int/island/glispa.sht- ml) that \u201cassists islands in addressing one of the world\u2019s greatest challenges: to conserve and utilise the invaluable island natural resources that support people, cultures, and livelihoods in their island homes around the world.\u201d The Small Islands Organisation (SMILO), a partner to MIC and this current project, is creating a network of small islands with a shared vision to foster innova- tions on islands that benefit the local population and their environment. They are helping small islands curb the im- pacts caused by human development and activities and are focusing on sus- tainable solutions in the fields of water & sanitation, waste, energy, biodiversi- ty, landscape and heritage. In 2021, the Virtual Islands Summit and the Island Space at CBD COP26 brought together influential changemakers, experts, and entrepreneurs to devise strategic vi- sions and discuss the innovation taking place on global islands. In addition to these visions and strategies, interesting initiatives to find workable sustainable solutions for the future are being pio- neered e.g., the adoption of emissions trading schemes and clean solar en- ergy schemes that aim to improve the sustainability of island communities. The Mediterranean islands are unique hotspots of biodiversity, within the greater Mediterranean hotspot, thanks to their rich and endemic flora20. Yet they do not exist independently. It is not just one island, or one island next to an- other that contributes to this wealth, it is the combined existence of them all that gives the Mediterranean such ex- traordinary variety. Thus, an integrated and targeted sustainable development/ conservation approach for the Mediter- ranean islands, promoting cooperation under a common regional vision offers a key contribution to preserving the ex- traordinary and unique biodiversity of the Mediterranean islands and to secur- ing the ecosystem services fundamen- tal to socio-economic development and preservation of its rich cultural heritage. \u00a9 Gratisography Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 6 Why a strategy for the preservation of biodiversity on Mediterranean islands? 1.2. \"The Mediterranean constitutes a very rich field of investigation for the study and understanding of island facts, and a field of specific actions for strat- egies for the protection and develop- ment of islands\" (Louis Brigand et al., UNEP - BP/RAC, 1991 cited in 14).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f2348867-3d93-4b01-b5c4-2a6460d410e3": {"__data__": {"id_": "f2348867-3d93-4b01-b5c4-2a6460d410e3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-1", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy Matters: Volume 1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-1", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b5ad7f0c9d996d4bbcbfe1599f117c14c2d024c8db7ef5d2aa98b7916b2571c8"}, "2": {"node_id": "99d95715-0ce5-4340-9f9b-423a75603cbe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-1", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7b94d8ae91f9f5e669aba9cdcff1b82a8bf44c4967eede57fce27a7d71d51c30"}}, "hash": "77745b9537a7d2db7c5b158041951ca9063e602cfb22dfd5cf4bd6dc3bdb8b4d", "text": "This observation, drawn up in 1991, is even more relevant today, particularly con- cerning the development agenda in small islands, where many local, na- tional and international stakeholders are looking to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of the natural and cultural heritage of these exceptional territories.

To date several initiatives and proj- ects have aimed to improve the con- servation of Mediterranean islands biodiversity, yet such efforts have of- ten been localised, small-scale and/ or lacked the regional coordination necessary to bring about significant change. A common vision and strate- gy for the Mediterranean islands bio- diversity is therefore needed to boost and enhance conservation and sus- tainable use of these territories. The aim of this document is to outline a shared vision and strategy that will al- low for coherence and alignment with the principles of different international treaties such as the aforementioned CBD Islands Programme of Work and Glispa, Resolution XII.14/2015 of the Ramsar Convention (the only legal text that treats Mediterranean islands as a group), the Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) Protocol (Art. 12 which grants \u201cspecial protection to is- lands, including small islands\u201d), Article 174 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union which requires members to \u201cpay particular attention to island regions\u201d, the CPMR Islands Commission which urges \u201cEuropean Institutions and Member States to pay special attention to the islands, to ac- knowledge the permanent handicaps resulting from their insularity, and to implement policies that are best suit- ed to their condition\u201d and the Charter on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biological Diversity on Europe- an Islands of the Council of Europe. In fact, the latter indicates \u201cthe situation and characteristics of islands require the development and application of specially-adapted approaches and tools for problems analyses and re- sponse measures21.\u201d The Mediterranean region is data de- ficient and the lack of scientific knowl- edge continues to hamper conser- vation efforts. Information specific to islands is even less available, hence it is only possible to portray a regional level overview, whilst at the same time highlighting the need for improved data collection and monitoring of is- lands. For example, within the last 60 years the Mediterranean has lost 41% of its top predators, over 20% of Med- iterranean species are threatened with extinction and estimates suggest 30 endemic species will become extinct by the end of the 21st century22. Soil erosion is estimated to be twice as Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 7 high in the European Mediterranean than in the rest of Europe23. In Italy alone soil erosion is causing an annual loss of EUR 619 million with 33% of its total agricultur- al area affected by severe erosion24. Over 1000 non-indigenous species have been recorded in the Mediterranean Sea and are estimated to generate costs of EUR 26.8 billion25. And with temperatures going up 20% faster in the Mediterranean than the global average, there has never been a more critical or urgent time for action26. The outline of a common Biodiversity Strategy on Mediterranean islands, pre- sented here, can constitute a valuable entry point for action to address many of the challenges facing the region including habitat degradation, pollution and eutro- phication, over exploitation, bioinvasions, and impacts of climate change, as well as putting forward opportunities for growth of the blue economy, nature-based tourism, ecological restoration, and an increase in natural and socio-economic wellbeing for island communities. Addressed to conservation bodies and relevant actors working throughout the Mediterranean region, the present doc- ument aims to contribute to the effort of bringing biodiversity to the forefront. It highlights the importance of biodiversi- ty as a key pillar for supporting contin- ued socioeconomic development and resilience of Mediterranean islands that will ensure a brighter tomorrow. \u00a9 Pexels - Fayson Merege Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 2.

For the most part Mediterranean islands and continental coastlines are faced with the same, numerous and interrelated, threats, but often the challenges facing biodiversity on, and surrounding islands, are more se- vere. Their isolation, smaller size, the density of human populations and concentration of economic activities and the fact that islands are often simpler systems make them more sensitive to threats (Louis Brigand et al., UNEP - BP/RAC, 1991 cited", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2593a513-186d-4469-9b75-e88e8db1e8f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "2593a513-186d-4469-9b75-e88e8db1e8f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-1", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy Matters: Volume 1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-1", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b033855de22c33141d762f7b7b3870cc19bdaa09946fd402274e1e381dd89408"}, "3": {"node_id": "e9e352a7-89ab-4284-b864-43bbaf27e5aa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-1", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "45817b85bae9aa3a147e978fb033712cbce18a566f50571304dbc8e89aa38bf7"}}, "hash": "2bbf0be022235f6cd7a2008c4cceacef2746b3192bc1f8f54b09149b7765e0b0", "text": "in 14). Tourism, urban development and artificial- isation of natural habitats (particularly in coastal areas), overfishing, extensive farm- ing and other types of land use changes are some of the most pressing threats impact- ing Mediterranean islands biodiversity and ecosystems, combined with a significant transformation of lifestyle, culture and heri- tage. The table below summarises the main threats leading to environmental degrada- tion on Mediterranean islands and increased climate challenges. Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 10 Impacts from climate change including drier conditions due to less rainfall and variations in land and sea temperature are increasingly more evident in the Mediterranean than in other regional seas27. Its semi-enclosed nature pre- vents rapid water exchange and there- fore makes it more sensitive to tempera- ture and pH variations28. Together with high human pressure from densely pop- ulated coastal areas, climate change is making the Mediterranean Sea an es- pecially vulnerable place29. Worryingly, its islands are the areas most impacted by these changes. Climate change is occurring faster than expected by the scientific community and rapidly altering temperature and precipitation patterns. As a result, spe- cies are being forced to migrate to other habitats if possible or to adapt to their new climate. The changes are occurring at such speed that they are potential- ly exceeding the adaptive capacity and resilience of island ecosystems30. Some small low-lying islands face the increas- ing threat of water shortages and sea level rise, leading to habitat loss be- cause of this encroachment. Of in- creasing concern is that climate change along with (associated) natural risks such as fire and heavy rains are also contributing to the destruction of natu- ral habitats. Climate change favours the introduction of invasive exotic species, which often outcompete local popula- tions and can cause major changes to population and ecosystem dynamics. In combination with invasive species climate change and these natural risks are exacerbating the degradation of is- land ecosystems. Climate change and bio invasions are happening in already degraded sys- tems which means their impacts are much more detrimental and together all the threats facing the Mediterranean Sea are acting together to push marine biodiversity into decline28,31. Figure 1: Level of conservation of ecosystems at sea Source: EEA, 202132 Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 11 Main socioeconomic trends on Mediterranean islands 2.1. As stated previously the 22 countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea are home to a total of 529 million inhabi- tants: 205 million live on the northern shore and 324 on the southern and eastern shore33. Based on current trends, in the next 30 years (2020- 2050), the population of the Mediterra- nean region will increase by 90 million inhabitants, reaching 611 million. In 2050, one third of the Mediterranean population will live on the northern shore, and two thirds on the southern and eastern shores34. The increasing population combined with changes in lifestyle and demand patterns result in growing demands for water, ener- gy and food from the Mediterranean Basin. The overexploitation of exist- ing water reservoirs and groundwater aquifers and the enhanced utilisation of ecosystem services adds increased stress to islands. Urbanisation - Demography A leading tourism destination, both for domestic and international travel- lers, the Mediterranean receives more than 300 million international tourists a year which accounts for 30% of to- tal world tourism35. This figure is ex- pected to reach 500 million by 203035. The tourism industry is one of the major economic sectors of the region and therefore an extremely important source of income for the Mediterra- nean and its islands, especially the smaller ones. Most island economies are dependent on tourism. Annually coastal tourism in the Mediterranean generates \u20ac300 billion and marine tourism \u20ac11036. Tourism represents around 9,5% of the EU GDP, for insu- lar regions, with this share increasing between 15-30% of GDP, and even 50% for several islands37. For exam- ple, the Greek Islands represent 60% of Hellenic tourism, an activity that contributed 20.8% to GDP in 2019. In recent years, the consequences of COVID-19 on tourism have had signifi- cant impacts in insular regions, which in part has led to the development of the CPMR Islands Commission draft action plan 2022-2023 (see 38).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e9e352a7-89ab-4284-b864-43bbaf27e5aa": {"__data__": {"id_": "e9e352a7-89ab-4284-b864-43bbaf27e5aa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-1", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy Matters: Volume 1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-1", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b033855de22c33141d762f7b7b3870cc19bdaa09946fd402274e1e381dd89408"}, "2": {"node_id": "2593a513-186d-4469-9b75-e88e8db1e8f3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-1", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2bbf0be022235f6cd7a2008c4cceacef2746b3192bc1f8f54b09149b7765e0b0"}}, "hash": "45817b85bae9aa3a147e978fb033712cbce18a566f50571304dbc8e89aa38bf7", "text": "Tourism \u00a9 NounProject WEBTECHOPS LLP \u00a9 NounProject Nithinan Tatah Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 12 Transport The Mediterranean represents only 1% of the surface of the seas and oceans, but it accommodates 15% of global shipping39.

The \u201cMediterranean Corridor\u201d is a large- scale EU transport project that has financed 54 rail projects and 33 mari- time ones, connecting the coastal ar- eas of the basin. These projects mean to support passengers and freight traf- fic, which is expected to double be- tween 2010-203039. This growth will come at a significant cost to the envi- ronment with increasing impacts from chemical pollution (hydrocarbons), noise pollution and collisions with ma- rine mammals40. These environmen- tal impacts are an issue for the whole Mediterranean basin, but they are of critical importance for the region's Marine Protected Areas, which are mostly concentrated around islands.

The overall annual economic value of fisheries in the region is estimated at \u20ac9.4 billion and contrib- utes livelihoods to a total of 785,000 people, 57% of which are linked to small-scale fishing41,42. Worryingly, the Mediterranean and Black Sea have the highest percentage (62.5%) of stocks being fished at unsustainable levels41. Island communities specialised in fish- ing have existed since antiquity. These communities hold a wealth of cultural heritage with incredible local ecologi- cal knowledge and traditional practices, some of which favour sustainable fish- ing. However, over the last few decades, in the context of a global fishing economy, the relationship fishers have with their activity has been changing. The impor- tance of these islands for the fishing in- dustry therefore goes far beyond their limited territories because fishery prod- ucts are no longer intended for local consumption only. In this context, the Mediterranean islands bear an unequal challenge. Despite a specific regulatory framework, small islands compete with the global market, which demands a continued increase in production. The Kerkennah Islands in Tunisia pro- vide a fair illustration of the dilemma between tradition and competitiveness. The traditional fishing activity included the use of palm leaves to create fixed fisheries in the low waters that surround the islands. This method requires time consuming preparation of the palm leaves. Pressured to produce more to capture larger quantities of fish, the use of palm leaves was replaced by plastic. Therefore, palm trees declined as fishermen no longer had a need to conserve them43,44. The change in pro- duction scale and methods has caused a significant environmental imbalance that has rendered the fishing practices unsustainable43. These fishing islands are not endowed with any specific legal measure that would allow the environmental and social balance to be restored. \u00a9 Pexels - Peter Simmons \u00a9 NounProject Eucalyp Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 14 Biodiversity policies and laws within the Mediterranean islands contexts 2.2. Islands are addressed by international, regional and national laws and policies for three different reasons. First of all, their biodiversity needs special attention. Sec- ondly, islands are significant for maritime boundaries. Finally, islands create living conditions that are hard for humans, and laws are used to ease them. Policy frameworks to protect island biodiversity At global level, the need to conserve island biodiversity is widely recognized, increas- ingly so in response to climate change. However, this recognition has been trans- lated into legal and political texts as an intention for action rather than to pro- vide specific measures and/or tools. The aforementioned CBD Island Biodiversity Programme of Work provides one such example. As does, Agenda 21, adopted in 1992 at the Earth Summit by 178 States, proposed for the first time, in Chapter 17, that small islands are territories that re- quire priority protection, since they are particularly vulnerable to climate change. Being a declarative and non-binding doc- ument, it aimed to inspire States to adapt their national laws accordingly. Similarly, at the eighth CBD meeting (Brazil, March 2006), the Conference of the Parties ad- opted the first-ever programme of work dedicated solely to the uniqueness and fragility of island biodiversity (decision VIII/1).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e912185-2c59-4ffe-b63e-bacbc0573721": {"__data__": {"id_": "2e912185-2c59-4ffe-b63e-bacbc0573721", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-1", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy Matters: Volume 1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-1", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "debfc9f758df6dcbf2769679f675a5c7a24e415b0fe9c0cbb348e35a0546da28"}, "2": {"node_id": "ec6441a3-80ac-4060-bf7e-98e75004b769", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-1", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b87fd7449e89d3f66fc582d8fd504a06d69871abb04cc039a463b484fb110eb3"}}, "hash": "3411c2c9a029cc4ce5b293cf93749b6d458393612331c37a94faff9a5ac92ba4", "text": "\u201cIts aim was to significantly reduce the rate of island biodiversity loss by 2010 and beyond as a contribution to poverty alleviation and the sustainable develop- ment of islands, particularly small island developing States45.\u201d Being specific to wetlands conservation at the international level, the Ramsar Con- vention on Wetlands addresses several aspects of island wetlands.

This Res- olution gave impetus to a Mediterranean dynamic to compile an inventory of island wetlands whose existence was not regis- tered and to adopt legal instruments for their protection. Transboundary policy processes have continued to highlight the importance of addressing biodiversity challenges in Mediterranean islands. The EU Biodi- versity Strategy, which is applicable to islands, sets up ambitious goals to be achieved by 2030 to protect and restore nature, as biodiversity and well-function- ing ecosystems are the \u201ckey to boost our resilience\u201d. A more island-centred exam- ple comes from the Council of Europe, whose \u201cCharter on the conservation and sustainable use of the biodiversity of the islands of Europe\u201d recognises the need Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 15 management to allow the conservation of island biodiversity46. The Mediterranean islands\u2019 biodiversity issues are taken into consideration by the Convention for the Protection of the Ma- rine Environment and the Coastal Region of the Mediterranean, also known as the Barcelona Convention. It contains region- al plans with binding targets as well as some specific provisions for islands, such as those referenced at the Protocol on In- tegrated Coastal Zone Management. Its article 12 states that the contracting Par- ties \u201cundertake to accord special protec- tion to islands, including small islands\u201d, protection that can be reflected in nation- al coastal plans and programs. The Barcelona Convention has estab- lished a list of Specially Protected Areas of Mediterranean Importance (SPAMIs), with the goal of promoting international cooperation for the conservation of nat- ural heritage by choosing flagship sites of Mediterranean biodiversity. Although there is no explicit reference to the need to protect islands, half of the SPAMI sites are on islands which reflects their signifi- cance for biodiversity protection (21 out of 39 sites). In addition, since the end of the 20th cen- tury, there has been a favourable trend towards the designation of protected ar- eas which are insular or include islands, on both shores of the Mediterranean, with variable protection and conserva- tion status, such as the Habibas Islands UNESCO Nature Reserve in Algeria (also a SPAMI) or the Palm Islands in Leba- non (National nature reserve, SPAMI and Ramsar Wetland), Zembra-Zembretta National Park in Tunisia (also UNESCO Biosphere Reserve under the Man and Biosphere Programme and a SPAMI) or Port-Cros in France (National parc and SPAMI) or the Marine Protected Area of Tavolara in Sardinia. \u00a9 Pexels - Yi\u011fit Can Etyemez Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 16 Policy frameworks to regulate island maritime delimitation Islands play an important role in maritime boundary delimitation. Negotiated for 20 years, the Convention on the Law of the Sea, regulates the regime of islands by stating that the inhabited islands or those having an economic life can have their own maritime zones (art. 121). Uninhab- ited islands (\u2018rocks\u2019) have only a territorial sea and a contiguous zone. This ambig- uous provision leaves the possibility of changing the regime applied depending on the status of the island as inhabited or not. This ambiguity has created several disputes, especially in southern China. In the Mediterranean, maritime delimitations still create conflicts between States and islands are at the heart of the claims.

Table 1: Summary of the provisions specific to the islands. Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 17 Policy frameworks to ease island living conditions Island living conditions lead to the adop- tion of regulations of socio-economic activities, whose goal is to ease human difficulties. These matters are mostly reg- ulated at a national or EU level. For exam- ple, the legal framework for the tourism sector is mainly a decision of national and regional authorities. At the international level, there are only declaratory provi- sions. For example, the Charter of Lan- zarote, which applies to all islands, states that tourism must \"contribute to sustain- able development\" and \"respect the frag- ile balances which characterise many tourist destinations, in particular small islands\"1. The European Union has a sup- porting competence in this matter, so it can only intervene to complete the action of the Member States. The financial stake both for the State and for the inhabitants is gigantic and can compromise the es tablishment of regulatory tourism policies adapted to the challenges of nature con- servation and island biodiversity. As mentioned previously, within the EU, member States are required to \u201cpay par- ticular attention to island regions\u201d under Article 174 of the Treaty on the Function- ing of the European Union. This attention can be translated into different types of legal measures adapted to island partic- ularities. However, the main goal of the article is to trigger measures that serve to reduce the gap between the level of de- velopment of island and mainland regions and not to protect island biodiversity. In- deed, the EU Parliament report on a strat- egy for sustainable tourism, repeats the importance of considering insularity37. 1 UNESCO / UNWTO / UNEP, Charter of Lanzarote, art. 2, 1995.

For example, the CPMR InterMediterranean Commission task force on culture and sustainable tourism47. The DestiMedPlus project which aimed to improve levels of integration between tourism and conser- vation policies through the creation of ec- otourism itineraries. This project also led to the development of a Mediterranean Ecotourism Consortium and a Mediterra- nean ecotourism policy roadmap which provides policy makers at regional and local level with context and key policy orientations for the development of eco- tourism governance and the integration of tourism and conservation policies in the Mediterranean48. The BEST MED project is another ex- ample. It is creating a Network of Sus- tainable Tourism Observatories for the Mediterranean (NSTO), gathering bod- ies / entities / organisations dealing with tourism data monitoring / management around the Mediterranean basin, to share ideas, techniques, and tools, and to build multi-level cooperation to seek the best solutions and work in a common direc- tion towards sustainable tourism49. The Glasgow Declaration is another major step towards international commitments for improved tourism. The declaration aims to lead and align climate action across tourism stakeholders, including government and institutional agencies; donors and financial institutions; interna- tional organisations; civil society; the pri- vate sector; and academia50.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "677594fd-283e-4c46-b2b8-d254ff68ffae": {"__data__": {"id_": "677594fd-283e-4c46-b2b8-d254ff68ffae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-1", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy Matters: Volume 1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-1", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c112212341f259346cb42e878788fb87003bd743998502624081244c645cb2e8"}, "2": {"node_id": "3d055148-ad3a-4397-9c0b-d379723f96dc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-1", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "726a201cef0056439cb6adafe8753c6c087b46346fde9eddc597216e08440135"}}, "hash": "f249f6e75b7c9787e917b666f721697b15d7cb923279ed7a05e68725a91fe390", "text": "\u00a9 Gratisography Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean Priority themes for island biodiversity conservation Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 3.

The Mediterranean Islands Collective (MIC), financed by the MAVA Foundation, has developed the present strategy and associated action plan which aims to bet- ter preserve the biodiversity of the Med- iterranean islands to have coherent and collaborative action between the actors already working in the region. The strat- egy has been developed through exten- sive collaboration between PIM and MIC partners and in-depth consultations at national and regional level and is outlined below. The goal of the strategic plan is to stop further loss of biodiversity and to assist in the recovery of threatened Med- iterranean island biota by 2030. Six operational priority pillars provide a guide for achieving the specific objec- tives. For each pillar, a set of actions pave the way for diverse stakeholders that, in cooperation, at local, national and re- gional levels will ensure the Strategy can be delivered and implemented on the ground. The specific objectives within each pil- lar and suggested actions are not an ex- haustive list and should be treated as a guide. There are many more interventions that can be applied in favour of conserva- tion and sustainable use of biodiversity in the Mediterranean islands. It should also be noted that the 6 pillars of the Strate- gy should be considered in an integrated manner, whereby any proposed action may constitute a contribution to more than one pillar. In structural and functional terms, it is as- sumed that without knowledge, it is not possible to conserve and manage biodi- versity. Knowledge is the basis for pro- moting greater awareness and empower- ment, whether at the level of biodiversity managers, socio-economic agents or the population in general. Therefore, knowl- edge is also the basis for sustaining a comprehensive communication, that can be transmitted through different support channels and be directed at multiple-lev- els and varied target audiences. The successful implementation of the Strategy rests on carefully weighting the constraints resulting from climate change and what it implies in terms of adaptation. Understanding Mediterranean islands as a whole is key, and the Strategy has to be implemented in a spirit of solidarity be- tween island communities, therefore with the ambition of reducing economic and capacity gaps between EU and non-EU Mediterranean countries. Taking action in the Mediterranean, for living islands! Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 21 Based on the principle that it is only pos- sible to preserve what is known, and even though significant gaps remain in the existing knowledge on the Mediterra- nean and its biodiversity, one of the most problematic issues that exists is that the information that is available, such as, in- ventories, knowledge of ecosystems ser- vices and biodiversity maps, are not al- ways accessible and available for use by all relevant stakeholders. Updated knowledge, organised and made available in formats suitable and ac- cessible to different users, is fundamen- tal and can play a key role in supporting communication and awareness-raising actions on the importance of conserving island biodiversity in the Mediterranean. Knowledge also plays a central role in partnership building and awareness of biodiversity and climate change in the Mediterranean islands. Mediterranean islands\u2019 biodiversity in- cludes a high number of endemic and indigenous species, many of them with very small distribution areas. Most of these species are poorly understood in terms of conservation status and vulner- ability to human pressures and climate change. Under this pillar, the Action Plan will include activities aimed at: \u2022 Advancing inventories and map- ping of biodiversity hotspots at lo- cal level (species, habitats, ecosys- tem services) particularly on lesser researched islands, endangered species and taxa, and degraded sites; \u2022 Developing an integrated regional insular biodiversity database with the mapping of Key Island Biodi- versity Areas; \u2022 Supporting local-based research initiatives on biodiversity; \u2022 Helping local communities under- stand biodiversity conservation on the islands; \u2022 Sharing knowledge (data, best practices, etc) using up-to-date communication means at local, na- tional and regional levels.

Biodiversity and nature conservation be- ing the pillars of sustainable development is still not well understood or widely ac- cepted. Mainstreaming the need to con- sider biodiversity and nature within other sectoral and cross cutting policies and programmes requires awareness and sensitization. Additionally, it requires con- crete demonstrations of how biodiversity and nature-based solutions can contrib- ute to addressing socioeconomic chal- lenges and provide opportunities e.g., job and benefit creation. Strategies to achieve this should support the inclusion of biodiversity in sustainable develop- ment and policy agendas.

Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean Governance and partnership for implementation Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 4. Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 42 This strategy is intended to serve as a functional collaborative platform involving all relevant actors for biodiversity conser- vation in the Mediterranean islands. The conservation and sustainable use of bio- diversity in the Mediterranean islands re- quires a broad commitment and partic- ipation from all sectors and is not only about nature conservation. Development on each Mediterranean island depends on the ability to ensure that species and ecosystems continue to provide key ser- vices to nature and society. The scientific community, those respon- sible for the management of protected areas or land planning and management, urban planning, agriculture, fisheries, tourism, shipping, energy, water sec- tors, education, local and national gov- ernments are the recipients and those responsible for ensuring the implemen- tation of specific actions that, on each is- land, give life to the vision and guidelines agreed in this strategy. Not intending to replace or overlap with other strategies and action plans already adopted in the Mediterranean island space, this strate- gy aims to facilitate collaborative involve- ment and participation, interdisciplinarity and dialogue between parties. \u00a9 Pexels - Anthony Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean Timeline, monitoring, evaluation, revision Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 5.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "47d682af-53a6-4e57-a950-be1914d9c4be": {"__data__": {"id_": "47d682af-53a6-4e57-a950-be1914d9c4be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-1", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy Matters: Volume 1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-1", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f0b1564c0d9b3409e5cee494b24138c08846f57d2f2d3b15f7d91cee04988f3"}, "2": {"node_id": "0eae48f9-8283-47b9-9ca5-28e421acf1f3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-matters-volume-1", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5cf70513d6a8bd5e58cb10d6cf0dd6ce26e50b499eb2c92800a98550aef1fa8a"}}, "hash": "523bd87787802c9ada4c27046cc1228e21c0755e267366eabc8be764753a25a0", "text": "Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 44 The Strategy proposes ten years for its implementation, considering the general objectives and the nature and diversity of interventions included in the Action Plan.

MIC partners will establish a follow-up committee responsible for collecting all the relevant information for supporting the monitoring and evaluation of the Strategy, within the observatory. Monitoring and evaluation will use indicators and targets assigned to each action and the selection of indicators and targets should be es- tablished through a participatory process involving all relevant stakeholders.

As a final outcome, as promoters of the strategy, the MIC partners aim to create a representative observatory for the differ- ent relevant sectors that will be respon- sible for analysing developments in the different strategic guidelines and specif- ic actions. This planned observatory will act as the monitoring and follow-up tool, depending on the targets and indicators associated with each action, and will also be responsible for the integration and har- monisation of the diversity of data from the different levels of intervention (local, national, regional) under the Strategy.

The aim of the strategy is to help realize the vision of productive and biologically diverse Mediterranean islands that can meet the long term needs of people and nature, stop further loss of biodiversity and assist in the recovery of threatened Mediterranean island biota by 2030. Addressed to public authorities, conser- vation bodies and relevant actors working throughout the Mediterranean region, it is hoped that the present strategy brings biodiversity to the forefront and highlights its importance as a key pillar for support- ing continued socioeconomic develop- ment and resilience of Mediterranean is- lands that will ensure a brighter tomorrow. The Mediterranean Islands Collective (MIC), financed by the MAVA foundation, has developed this strategy through ex- tensive collaboration with project part- ners, pilot projects, and in-depth consul- tations at national and regional level. The implementation and progression of the strategy will continue to be led by MIC partners, in a coordination role. However, it is strongly recognized that the respon- sibility for its delivery is shared across rel- evant regional and EU organisations, lo- cal and national governments, business, environmental and community groups and private individuals throughout the Mediterranean region. The strategy and action plan presented below is beneficial as it builds off proj- ects, work and initiatives that are already underway or have been trialled through- out the region, working to protect and care for coastal, marine and island en- vironments. Rather than re-inventing the wheel it is hoped that this strategy is seen to bring all this existing work together, adding leadership, greater coordination of efforts, and a fresh momentum at a much larger Mediterranean scale. Shaped by results of pilot projects and consultations, the Mediterranean islands strategy and action plan seeks to min- imise the threats facing the region\u2019s is- lands and maximise opportunities. The strategy sets out six strategic pillars and a range of actions and measures to help its delivery: Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean ix Actions will be aimed at: \u2022 Advancing inventories and map- ping of biodiversity hotspots at local level (species, habitats, ecosystem services) particularly on lesser re- searched islands, endangered spe- cies and taxa, and degraded sites; \u2022 Developing an integrated regional in- sular biodiversity database with the mapping of Key Island Biodiversity Areas; \u2022 Supporting local-based research ini- tiatives on biodiversity; \u2022 Helping local communities under- stand biodiversity conservation on the islands; \u2022 Sharing knowledge (data, best prac- tices, etc) using up-to-date commu- nication means at local, national and regional levels. Strengthen knowledge and raise awareness on Mediterranean islands 1 Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean x Actions will be aimed at: \u2022 Developing and implementing capac- ity-building programmes addressing specific needs on biodiversity conser- vation at local, national and regional levels; \u2022 Promoting initiatives engaging the so- cioeconomic sector on conserva- tion and sustainable use of biodiversity (e.g., sustainable nature-based tourism, fisheries, agriculture); \u2022 Training protected area managers and technicians on the fundamentals of a co-management approach. Embed capacity for biodiversity conservation and sustainable management at the island level 2 Actions will be aimed at: \u2022 Developing restoration initiatives on degraded sites and important habi- tats, species and ecosystems; \u2022 Enhancing marine invasive alien species control measures and pro- grammes; \u2022 Promoting co-management ap- proaches at the level of island based protected areas.

As a long-term strategy the objec- tives and actions that underpin the strate- gy will be achieved in the short, medium, and long term, depending on the objec- tives and complexity and collaboration required. Annual progress reports will be produced at island level, enabling an in- tegrated analysis and evaluation, and fa- cilitating the exchange of experience be- tween Mediterranean islands. A mid-term review will be carried out at the end of the fourth year, allowing for adjustments, and again at the end of the ten years, ensur- ing a positive difference is being achieved through this work. In addition, MIC partners aim to create a representative observatory for the differ- ent relevant sectors that will be respon- sible for analysing developments in the different strategic guidelines and specific actions. Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean Introduction Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 1. Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 2 Islands represent about 6% of the Earth\u2019s terrestrial areas, hosting the greatest con- centration of biodiversity and sadly the highest number of species extinctions. They are home to 20% of all known ani- mal and plant species, and therefore play an enormously important role in preserv- ing global biodiversity, from ecologically and economically1. Biodiversity refers to the variety of life on Earth in all its forms, levels and combinations: genetic diversity, spe- cies diversity, and ecosystem diver- sity. In addition to the intrinsic value of life, biodiversity provides essential ecosystem services. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and De- velopment (OCDE) and the World Eco- nomic Forum indicate that ecosystem services of world biodiversity are esti- mated to be worth USD 125-140 trillion per year, representing more than half of the global gross domestic product2. Islands represent key refuges for biodi- versity, particularly where rare and threat- ened species are struggling to survive on the continental coasts, but are themselves being more and more threatened3. Island species are often evolutionarily distinctive and highly vulnerable to novel disturbanc- es, particularly invasive species4. The degradation of natural systems due to human activity and the consequent loss of biodiversity is a global prob- lem that requires urgent worldwide intervention. Unprecedented increases in consumption associated with demo- graphic growth and the extractive nature and intensity of production systems are exerting a constant and ever-increasing pressure on biodiversity. This pressure is resulting in profound changes to natural habitats, loss of species, contamination and a consequent loss in ecosystems\u2019 ability to regenerate and continue to pro- vide essential ecosystem services that are fundamental to mankind\u2019s survival. It is widely acknowledged by scientists and international organisations that islands are an outstanding source of biodiversi- ty as they host a significant proportion of endangered species5. However, their evolutionary distinctive- ness and high vulnerability make islands extinction epicentres. Island species have increased vulnerability as they have di- minished dispersal capability, smaller restricted habitats and tend to evolve in competition with relatively few other spe- cies. As a result, they develop survival strategies based on interdependency, co-evolution, and mutualism rather than defence mechanisms against a broad range of predators, competitors and other external threats. For this reason, many is- land species have become rare or threat- ened, and islands have a disproportionate number of recorded species extinctions when compared to continental systems6,7. To date, approximately 75% of reptile, bird, amphibian and mammal extinctions combined have occurred on islands5. With almost 5,000 islands and islets (fig- ures differ a little from one authority to the other), the Mediterranean basin has one of the largest groups of islands in the world.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "765ab779-2e51-4e9d-82fe-edb5a2700ae9": {"__data__": {"id_": "765ab779-2e51-4e9d-82fe-edb5a2700ae9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/compilation-wcpa-30x30-resources", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Compilation of WCPA 30x30 Resources", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/compilation-wcpa-30x30-resources", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ea74afe7221e6304ef6c03243dd56853dec3894e42c0391e1bb7a3407a3eb905"}, "2": {"node_id": "a8cb5fd4-7410-4952-89c1-46d901e75b12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/compilation-wcpa-30x30-resources", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2dfed36c345792333274ea16b7587b7498ad6c146abb90a13484d8b84e8137ea"}}, "hash": "3e4f61e36fbbe82b4ced35e297a51cb64364aa03b99e6da98dedc86c43a550f0", "text": "The region is of great importance to global biodiversity thanks to its wealth of species, relatively high rate of ende- mism, long species history, as well as its role as a natural laboratory for evolution- ary studies3.

Small islands of less than 10 km2 represent more than 85% of the Mediterranean\u2019s island units. The Mediterranean islands and their biodiversity 1.1. Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 3 The Mediterranean basin has a com- plex geological history which means some islands have much higher prox- imity to continental coasts than others and some have been isolated for much longer. This combined with the high topographical and ecological variation of this region and the reduced severity of Quaternary climatic oscillations have produced a flora and fauna of excep- tional diversity3,10. Isolation resulting from insularity has led certain species to evolve genetically, particularly on the islands, creating high levels of ende- mism9. As a result of this unique sit- uation the Mediterranean represents the second most important hotspot on Earth. Thanks to speciation occurring on is- lands, endemism is higher, a fact that mechanically increases genetic diversi- ty and means that species can be found on only one or a group of islands. Small islands provide natural and undisturbed habitats for specific flora and fauna as well as unique biodiversity assemblag- es. Islands also represent the only ref- uges left for species that have disap- peared from continental areas and act as a refuge for endangered species, such as populations of seabirds that are found almost exclusively on small islands. Species occasionally behave differently on islands due to food re- source scarcity and absence of pre- dation \u2013 showing changes in their diet and island tameness6,7. These specific behaviours make them more vulnerable but also represent a behavioural diver- sity that deserves to be protected. All this rich biodiversity and life in the Mediterranean has attracted and sus- tained mankind since antiquity. Span- ning 22 countries, the Mediterranean\u2019s coastline exceeds 46,000 km. The coastline and islands are the most pro- ductive areas and therefore the most attractive for economic activities and development. Indeed, of the 529 million inhabitants in the Mediterranean, ap- proximately one third are located along the coasts and 55% live in coastal hy- drological basins11. This means a con- siderable amount of the total population is concentrated in a very small area and that Mediterranean ecosystems have been altered in many ways12. Develop- ment, urbanisation and continual ex- ploitation and use of natural resources is putting incredible strain on the Med- iterranean\u2019s biodiversity, particularly on its islands. The impact from human ac- tivities is proportionally stronger in the Mediterranean than in any other sea of the world 11,13 (and see Louis Brigand et al., UNEP - BP/RAC, 1991 cited in 14). These 529 million inhabitants are reli- ant upon the Mediterranean\u2019s natural resources and the ecosystem services it provides; however, its unique ecosys- tems are significantly degraded by a growing number of drivers of change. Habitat degradation and loss are being accentuated in the Mediterranean (and on its islands) by human activities that are transforming the coast, the land and the sea in response to the needs for agriculture, pastures, ports and oth- er infrastructures, settlements, tourist resorts and leisure activities, etc. In ad- dition, we are now seeing the impacts from climate change at rates beyond experts\u2019 expectations, and increasingly worrying trends in disturbances caused by invasive species. As some charac- teristics of islands worsen the environ- mental and climate change challenges these threats are increasing the vulner- ability of native and endemic species found throughout the basin, but espe- cially on islands. Islands\u2019 limited space and isolation highly restrict the mobility of some species and therefore increase the consequences of events such as heat waves or droughts and explain why the arrival of invasive species can have severe consequences for native species and island assemblages on islands and in other settings with high proportions of endemic species15. Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 4 Small islands are of special interest for sustainable development because of the aforementioned unique character- istics and vulnerabilities.

Freshwater is an import- ant and scarce resource on many small islands, making water provisioning and water quality regulation of high priority. Islands\u2019 cultural ecosystem services in the form of recreation and eco-tourism are highly valued by tourists and locals alike and contribute directly to island economies and play an important role in structuring islands\u2019 landscapes17. There is increasing recognition of the wealth of human health benefits that stem from experiencing nature and bio- diversity18. In the Mediterranean cultural traditions run strong, one such example can be found in how closely tied native plants are with traditional human activ- ities that act in a way to maintain this species richness9. Erosion control and pollination regulation play important roles in the delivery of food provision- ing. Island ecosystems also contribute to the maintenance of ecosystem func- tions: they provide defence against nat- ural disasters, support nutrient cycling, and soil and sand formation; and they contribute to the regulation of climate and diseases19. Conserving biodiversity and therefore strengthening as- sociated ecosystem ser- vices, is of utmost impor- tance and fundamental to the socio-economic develop- ment of human communi- ties particularly in island geo- graphic contexts. There is a pressing need to reverse the trend of biodiversity loss. Action needs to be taken \u2013 at the Mediterranean ba- sin level to ensure that the ecosystem services upon which we rely can con- tinue to serve us. A Mediterranean wide strategy is urgently needed that will help the region and individual countries to strengthen and improve management efficiency in protected areas and other natural spaces, along with an integrat- ed approach to significantly change production and consumption models. To this end, we are witnessing the in- troduction of global, regional, local or thematic strategic visions and initiatives that intend to contribute to the conser- vation and sustainable use of biodiver- sity in islands. Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 5 At the international level, there are the CBD Island diversity Programme of work (https://www.cbd.int/island/pow.shtml) and Global Island Partnership (GLISPA https://www.cbd.int/island/glispa.sht- ml) that \u201cassists islands in addressing one of the world\u2019s greatest challenges: to conserve and utilise the invaluable island natural resources that support people, cultures, and livelihoods in their island homes around the world.\u201d The Small Islands Organisation (SMILO), a partner to MIC and this current project, is creating a network of small islands with a shared vision to foster innova- tions on islands that benefit the local population and their environment. They are helping small islands curb the im- pacts caused by human development and activities and are focusing on sus- tainable solutions in the fields of water & sanitation, waste, energy, biodiversi- ty, landscape and heritage. In 2021, the Virtual Islands Summit and the Island Space at CBD COP26 brought together influential changemakers, experts, and entrepreneurs to devise strategic vi- sions and discuss the innovation taking place on global islands. In addition to these visions and strategies, interesting initiatives to find workable sustainable solutions for the future are being pio- neered e.g., the adoption of emissions trading schemes and clean solar en- ergy schemes that aim to improve the sustainability of island communities. The Mediterranean islands are unique hotspots of biodiversity, within the greater Mediterranean hotspot, thanks to their rich and endemic flora20. Yet they do not exist independently. It is not just one island, or one island next to an- other that contributes to this wealth, it is the combined existence of them all that gives the Mediterranean such ex- traordinary variety. Thus, an integrated and targeted sustainable development/ conservation approach for the Mediter- ranean islands, promoting cooperation under a common regional vision offers a key contribution to preserving the ex- traordinary and unique biodiversity of the Mediterranean islands and to secur- ing the ecosystem services fundamen- tal to socio-economic development and preservation of its rich cultural heritage. \u00a9 Gratisography Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 6 Why a strategy for the preservation of biodiversity on Mediterranean islands? 1.2.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2fb93d06-5da8-4be6-9ad5-226c9ce6a028": {"__data__": {"id_": "2fb93d06-5da8-4be6-9ad5-226c9ce6a028", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/compilation-wcpa-30x30-resources", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Compilation of WCPA 30x30 Resources", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/compilation-wcpa-30x30-resources", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "72f289d7d5f80dc4c5d619a3a3896ac98f7db742dc67b987f963debc98ab304d"}, "2": {"node_id": "3b63946b-5df9-4c18-a11c-b2a27c7ad50e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/compilation-wcpa-30x30-resources", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b86d1213e495ec1384c0cac44f5682deea30c22f3d01217a824f7554a50c71ac"}}, "hash": "d0d6fe763becc1e39da7c64685bc15ad2fef5170c3a07f86ae88572889f07486", "text": "1.2. \"The Mediterranean constitutes a very rich field of investigation for the study and understanding of island facts, and a field of specific actions for strat- egies for the protection and develop- ment of islands\" (Louis Brigand et al., UNEP - BP/RAC, 1991 cited in 14).

To date several initiatives and proj- ects have aimed to improve the con- servation of Mediterranean islands biodiversity, yet such efforts have of- ten been localised, small-scale and/ or lacked the regional coordination necessary to bring about significant change. A common vision and strate- gy for the Mediterranean islands bio- diversity is therefore needed to boost and enhance conservation and sus- tainable use of these territories. The aim of this document is to outline a shared vision and strategy that will al- low for coherence and alignment with the principles of different international treaties such as the aforementioned CBD Islands Programme of Work and Glispa, Resolution XII.14/2015 of the Ramsar Convention (the only legal text that treats Mediterranean islands as a group), the Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) Protocol (Art. 12 which grants \u201cspecial protection to is- lands, including small islands\u201d), Article 174 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union which requires members to \u201cpay particular attention to island regions\u201d, the CPMR Islands Commission which urges \u201cEuropean Institutions and Member States to pay special attention to the islands, to ac- knowledge the permanent handicaps resulting from their insularity, and to implement policies that are best suit- ed to their condition\u201d and the Charter on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biological Diversity on Europe- an Islands of the Council of Europe. In fact, the latter indicates \u201cthe situation and characteristics of islands require the development and application of specially-adapted approaches and tools for problems analyses and re- sponse measures21.\u201d The Mediterranean region is data de- ficient and the lack of scientific knowl- edge continues to hamper conser- vation efforts. Information specific to islands is even less available, hence it is only possible to portray a regional level overview, whilst at the same time highlighting the need for improved data collection and monitoring of is- lands. For example, within the last 60 years the Mediterranean has lost 41% of its top predators, over 20% of Med- iterranean species are threatened with extinction and estimates suggest 30 endemic species will become extinct by the end of the 21st century22. Soil erosion is estimated to be twice as Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 7 high in the European Mediterranean than in the rest of Europe23. In Italy alone soil erosion is causing an annual loss of EUR 619 million with 33% of its total agricultur- al area affected by severe erosion24. Over 1000 non-indigenous species have been recorded in the Mediterranean Sea and are estimated to generate costs of EUR 26.8 billion25. And with temperatures going up 20% faster in the Mediterranean than the global average, there has never been a more critical or urgent time for action26. The outline of a common Biodiversity Strategy on Mediterranean islands, pre- sented here, can constitute a valuable entry point for action to address many of the challenges facing the region including habitat degradation, pollution and eutro- phication, over exploitation, bioinvasions, and impacts of climate change, as well as putting forward opportunities for growth of the blue economy, nature-based tourism, ecological restoration, and an increase in natural and socio-economic wellbeing for island communities. Addressed to conservation bodies and relevant actors working throughout the Mediterranean region, the present doc- ument aims to contribute to the effort of bringing biodiversity to the forefront. It highlights the importance of biodiversi- ty as a key pillar for supporting contin- ued socioeconomic development and resilience of Mediterranean islands that will ensure a brighter tomorrow. \u00a9 Pexels - Fayson Merege Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 2.

For the most part Mediterranean islands and continental coastlines are faced with the same, numerous and interrelated, threats, but often the challenges facing biodiversity on, and surrounding islands, are more se- vere.

Tourism, urban development and artificial- isation of natural habitats (particularly in coastal areas), overfishing, extensive farm- ing and other types of land use changes are some of the most pressing threats impact- ing Mediterranean islands biodiversity and ecosystems, combined with a significant transformation of lifestyle, culture and heri- tage. The table below summarises the main threats leading to environmental degrada- tion on Mediterranean islands and increased climate challenges. Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 10 Impacts from climate change including drier conditions due to less rainfall and variations in land and sea temperature are increasingly more evident in the Mediterranean than in other regional seas27. Its semi-enclosed nature pre- vents rapid water exchange and there- fore makes it more sensitive to tempera- ture and pH variations28. Together with high human pressure from densely pop- ulated coastal areas, climate change is making the Mediterranean Sea an es- pecially vulnerable place29. Worryingly, its islands are the areas most impacted by these changes. Climate change is occurring faster than expected by the scientific community and rapidly altering temperature and precipitation patterns. As a result, spe- cies are being forced to migrate to other habitats if possible or to adapt to their new climate. The changes are occurring at such speed that they are potential- ly exceeding the adaptive capacity and resilience of island ecosystems30. Some small low-lying islands face the increas- ing threat of water shortages and sea level rise, leading to habitat loss be- cause of this encroachment. Of in- creasing concern is that climate change along with (associated) natural risks such as fire and heavy rains are also contributing to the destruction of natu- ral habitats. Climate change favours the introduction of invasive exotic species, which often outcompete local popula- tions and can cause major changes to population and ecosystem dynamics. In combination with invasive species climate change and these natural risks are exacerbating the degradation of is- land ecosystems. Climate change and bio invasions are happening in already degraded sys- tems which means their impacts are much more detrimental and together all the threats facing the Mediterranean Sea are acting together to push marine biodiversity into decline28,31. Figure 1: Level of conservation of ecosystems at sea Source: EEA, 202132 Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 11 Main socioeconomic trends on Mediterranean islands 2.1. As stated previously the 22 countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea are home to a total of 529 million inhabi- tants: 205 million live on the northern shore and 324 on the southern and eastern shore33. Based on current trends, in the next 30 years (2020- 2050), the population of the Mediterra- nean region will increase by 90 million inhabitants, reaching 611 million. In 2050, one third of the Mediterranean population will live on the northern shore, and two thirds on the southern and eastern shores34. The increasing population combined with changes in lifestyle and demand patterns result in growing demands for water, ener- gy and food from the Mediterranean Basin. The overexploitation of exist- ing water reservoirs and groundwater aquifers and the enhanced utilisation of ecosystem services adds increased stress to islands. Urbanisation - Demography A leading tourism destination, both for domestic and international travel- lers, the Mediterranean receives more than 300 million international tourists a year which accounts for 30% of to- tal world tourism35. This figure is ex- pected to reach 500 million by 203035. The tourism industry is one of the major economic sectors of the region and therefore an extremely important source of income for the Mediterra- nean and its islands, especially the smaller ones. Most island economies are dependent on tourism. Annually coastal tourism in the Mediterranean generates \u20ac300 billion and marine tourism \u20ac11036. Tourism represents around 9,5% of the EU GDP, for insu- lar regions, with this share increasing between 15-30% of GDP, and even 50% for several islands37. For exam- ple, the Greek Islands represent 60% of Hellenic tourism, an activity that contributed 20.8% to GDP in 2019.

The \u201cMediterranean Corridor\u201d is a large- scale EU transport project that has financed 54 rail projects and 33 mari- time ones, connecting the coastal ar- eas of the basin. These projects mean to support passengers and freight traf- fic, which is expected to double be- tween 2010-203039. This growth will come at a significant cost to the envi- ronment with increasing impacts from chemical pollution (hydrocarbons), noise pollution and collisions with ma- rine mammals40. These environmen- tal impacts are an issue for the whole Mediterranean basin, but they are of critical importance for the region's Marine Protected Areas, which are mostly concentrated around islands.

The overall annual economic value of fisheries in the region is estimated at \u20ac9.4 billion and contrib- utes livelihoods to a total of 785,000 people, 57% of which are linked to small-scale fishing41,42. Worryingly, the Mediterranean and Black Sea have the highest percentage (62.5%) of stocks being fished at unsustainable levels41. Island communities specialised in fish- ing have existed since antiquity. These communities hold a wealth of cultural heritage with incredible local ecologi- cal knowledge and traditional practices, some of which favour sustainable fish- ing. However, over the last few decades, in the context of a global fishing economy, the relationship fishers have with their activity has been changing. The impor- tance of these islands for the fishing in- dustry therefore goes far beyond their limited territories because fishery prod- ucts are no longer intended for local consumption only. In this context, the Mediterranean islands bear an unequal challenge. Despite a specific regulatory framework, small islands compete with the global market, which demands a continued increase in production. The Kerkennah Islands in Tunisia pro- vide a fair illustration of the dilemma between tradition and competitiveness. The traditional fishing activity included the use of palm leaves to create fixed fisheries in the low waters that surround the islands. This method requires time consuming preparation of the palm leaves. Pressured to produce more to capture larger quantities of fish, the use of palm leaves was replaced by plastic. Therefore, palm trees declined as fishermen no longer had a need to conserve them43,44. The change in pro- duction scale and methods has caused a significant environmental imbalance that has rendered the fishing practices unsustainable43. These fishing islands are not endowed with any specific legal measure that would allow the environmental and social balance to be restored. \u00a9 Pexels - Peter Simmons \u00a9 NounProject Eucalyp Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 14 Biodiversity policies and laws within the Mediterranean islands contexts 2.2. Islands are addressed by international, regional and national laws and policies for three different reasons. First of all, their biodiversity needs special attention. Sec- ondly, islands are significant for maritime boundaries. Finally, islands create living conditions that are hard for humans, and laws are used to ease them. Policy frameworks to protect island biodiversity At global level, the need to conserve island biodiversity is widely recognized, increas- ingly so in response to climate change. However, this recognition has been trans- lated into legal and political texts as an intention for action rather than to pro- vide specific measures and/or tools. The aforementioned CBD Island Biodiversity Programme of Work provides one such example. As does, Agenda 21, adopted in 1992 at the Earth Summit by 178 States, proposed for the first time, in Chapter 17, that small islands are territories that re- quire priority protection, since they are particularly vulnerable to climate change. Being a declarative and non-binding doc- ument, it aimed to inspire States to adapt their national laws accordingly. Similarly, at the eighth CBD meeting (Brazil, March 2006), the Conference of the Parties ad- opted the first-ever programme of work dedicated solely to the uniqueness and fragility of island biodiversity (decision VIII/1).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ccfe3753-7cee-4a74-9abd-6951f4f00046": {"__data__": {"id_": "ccfe3753-7cee-4a74-9abd-6951f4f00046", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/compilation-wcpa-30x30-resources", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Compilation of WCPA 30x30 Resources", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/compilation-wcpa-30x30-resources", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "72b17400d454ddf83d87daf3aea67dcb430e8c2f37e0f4dd2ea25b8547ecbe57"}, "2": {"node_id": "35a80ca7-d11e-4357-a2c6-c173b892abf4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/compilation-wcpa-30x30-resources", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f9e8c3e11c15f4e1cbbccb3a68e5ab67588f27c448fe63db9f042c86fd22485c"}}, "hash": "e5e028901ed61c95d1b4f218c34914f670d6385458cfe86043bda787c2564f6f", "text": "\u201cIts aim was to significantly reduce the rate of island biodiversity loss by 2010 and beyond as a contribution to poverty alleviation and the sustainable develop- ment of islands, particularly small island developing States45.\u201d Being specific to wetlands conservation at the international level, the Ramsar Con- vention on Wetlands addresses several aspects of island wetlands.

This Res- olution gave impetus to a Mediterranean dynamic to compile an inventory of island wetlands whose existence was not regis- tered and to adopt legal instruments for their protection. Transboundary policy processes have continued to highlight the importance of addressing biodiversity challenges in Mediterranean islands. The EU Biodi- versity Strategy, which is applicable to islands, sets up ambitious goals to be achieved by 2030 to protect and restore nature, as biodiversity and well-function- ing ecosystems are the \u201ckey to boost our resilience\u201d. A more island-centred exam- ple comes from the Council of Europe, whose \u201cCharter on the conservation and sustainable use of the biodiversity of the islands of Europe\u201d recognises the need Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 15 management to allow the conservation of island biodiversity46. The Mediterranean islands\u2019 biodiversity issues are taken into consideration by the Convention for the Protection of the Ma- rine Environment and the Coastal Region of the Mediterranean, also known as the Barcelona Convention. It contains region- al plans with binding targets as well as some specific provisions for islands, such as those referenced at the Protocol on In- tegrated Coastal Zone Management. Its article 12 states that the contracting Par- ties \u201cundertake to accord special protec- tion to islands, including small islands\u201d, protection that can be reflected in nation- al coastal plans and programs. The Barcelona Convention has estab- lished a list of Specially Protected Areas of Mediterranean Importance (SPAMIs), with the goal of promoting international cooperation for the conservation of nat- ural heritage by choosing flagship sites of Mediterranean biodiversity. Although there is no explicit reference to the need to protect islands, half of the SPAMI sites are on islands which reflects their signifi- cance for biodiversity protection (21 out of 39 sites). In addition, since the end of the 20th cen- tury, there has been a favourable trend towards the designation of protected ar- eas which are insular or include islands, on both shores of the Mediterranean, with variable protection and conserva- tion status, such as the Habibas Islands UNESCO Nature Reserve in Algeria (also a SPAMI) or the Palm Islands in Leba- non (National nature reserve, SPAMI and Ramsar Wetland), Zembra-Zembretta National Park in Tunisia (also UNESCO Biosphere Reserve under the Man and Biosphere Programme and a SPAMI) or Port-Cros in France (National parc and SPAMI) or the Marine Protected Area of Tavolara in Sardinia. \u00a9 Pexels - Yi\u011fit Can Etyemez Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 16 Policy frameworks to regulate island maritime delimitation Islands play an important role in maritime boundary delimitation. Negotiated for 20 years, the Convention on the Law of the Sea, regulates the regime of islands by stating that the inhabited islands or those having an economic life can have their own maritime zones (art. 121). Uninhab- ited islands (\u2018rocks\u2019) have only a territorial sea and a contiguous zone. This ambig- uous provision leaves the possibility of changing the regime applied depending on the status of the island as inhabited or not. This ambiguity has created several disputes, especially in southern China. In the Mediterranean, maritime delimitations still create conflicts between States and islands are at the heart of the claims. For example, there are delicate delimitations between Cyprus, Lebanon, and Israel, between Greece and Turkey and between France and Spain. The conflicts on the delimitation of the marine space have an economic and an ecological stake since the coastal States have the responsibili- ty to also protect the environment in their maritime zones.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "10efdee5-9f9f-499b-8a30-1126a438034f": {"__data__": {"id_": "10efdee5-9f9f-499b-8a30-1126a438034f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/compilation-wcpa-30x30-resources", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Compilation of WCPA 30x30 Resources", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/compilation-wcpa-30x30-resources", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e66fd32be8dcca3f663f34de474fb22cea3f9cfec3f563769edd86ffd57990d2"}, "2": {"node_id": "d0fd62f1-3cac-4269-9c6b-1010810da2f1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/compilation-wcpa-30x30-resources", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3d9667a6703f3a098d5da3598872f185019459990384c491674124d3613087cd"}}, "hash": "6b3f9d08e17115930d74bc23f8bbcc330a735072c3b8841c4c2aef41e14a4fcf", "text": "Global Geography Legal text Provision concerning islands Law of the Sea Convention UNCLOS, (1982) \u2013 binding agreement Agenda 21 \u2013 Chapter 17 (1992): non-binding text Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) \u2013 binding text Convention on the Protec- tion of Wetlands (Ramsar, 1972) \u2013 binding text Art. 121: defines islands and clarifies maritime zones around them. \u201cRocks\u201d, meaning islands which can- not sustain human habitation or eco- nomic life, can only have a territorial sea and a contiguous zone.

Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 17 Policy frameworks to ease island living conditions Island living conditions lead to the adop- tion of regulations of socio-economic activities, whose goal is to ease human difficulties. These matters are mostly reg- ulated at a national or EU level. For exam- ple, the legal framework for the tourism sector is mainly a decision of national and regional authorities. At the international level, there are only declaratory provi- sions. For example, the Charter of Lan- zarote, which applies to all islands, states that tourism must \"contribute to sustain- able development\" and \"respect the frag- ile balances which characterise many tourist destinations, in particular small islands\"1. The European Union has a sup- porting competence in this matter, so it can only intervene to complete the action of the Member States. The financial stake both for the State and for the inhabitants is gigantic and can compromise the es tablishment of regulatory tourism policies adapted to the challenges of nature con- servation and island biodiversity. As mentioned previously, within the EU, member States are required to \u201cpay par- ticular attention to island regions\u201d under Article 174 of the Treaty on the Function- ing of the European Union. This attention can be translated into different types of legal measures adapted to island partic- ularities. However, the main goal of the article is to trigger measures that serve to reduce the gap between the level of de- velopment of island and mainland regions and not to protect island biodiversity. In- deed, the EU Parliament report on a strat- egy for sustainable tourism, repeats the importance of considering insularity37. 1 UNESCO / UNWTO / UNEP, Charter of Lanzarote, art. 2, 1995.

Hogg, 2022 Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 18 However, there are several international and Mediterranean wide declarations and initiatives that have been designed to in- fluence policy and be adopted by nation- al and regional authorities with the goal to make tourism more sustainable. For example, the CPMR InterMediterranean Commission task force on culture and sustainable tourism47. The DestiMedPlus project which aimed to improve levels of integration between tourism and conser- vation policies through the creation of ec- otourism itineraries. This project also led to the development of a Mediterranean Ecotourism Consortium and a Mediterra- nean ecotourism policy roadmap which provides policy makers at regional and local level with context and key policy orientations for the development of eco- tourism governance and the integration of tourism and conservation policies in the Mediterranean48. The BEST MED project is another ex- ample. It is creating a Network of Sus- tainable Tourism Observatories for the Mediterranean (NSTO), gathering bod- ies / entities / organisations dealing with tourism data monitoring / management around the Mediterranean basin, to share ideas, techniques, and tools, and to build multi-level cooperation to seek the best solutions and work in a common direc- tion towards sustainable tourism49. The Glasgow Declaration is another major step towards international commitments for improved tourism.

The Mediterranean Islands Collective (MIC), financed by the MAVA Foundation, has developed the present strategy and associated action plan which aims to bet- ter preserve the biodiversity of the Med- iterranean islands to have coherent and collaborative action between the actors already working in the region. The strat- egy has been developed through exten- sive collaboration between PIM and MIC partners and in-depth consultations at national and regional level and is outlined below. The goal of the strategic plan is to stop further loss of biodiversity and to assist in the recovery of threatened Med- iterranean island biota by 2030. Six operational priority pillars provide a guide for achieving the specific objec- tives. For each pillar, a set of actions pave the way for diverse stakeholders that, in cooperation, at local, national and re- gional levels will ensure the Strategy can be delivered and implemented on the ground. The specific objectives within each pil- lar and suggested actions are not an ex- haustive list and should be treated as a guide. There are many more interventions that can be applied in favour of conserva- tion and sustainable use of biodiversity in the Mediterranean islands. It should also be noted that the 6 pillars of the Strate- gy should be considered in an integrated manner, whereby any proposed action may constitute a contribution to more than one pillar. In structural and functional terms, it is as- sumed that without knowledge, it is not possible to conserve and manage biodi- versity. Knowledge is the basis for pro- moting greater awareness and empower- ment, whether at the level of biodiversity managers, socio-economic agents or the population in general. Therefore, knowl- edge is also the basis for sustaining a comprehensive communication, that can be transmitted through different support channels and be directed at multiple-lev- els and varied target audiences. The successful implementation of the Strategy rests on carefully weighting the constraints resulting from climate change and what it implies in terms of adaptation. Understanding Mediterranean islands as a whole is key, and the Strategy has to be implemented in a spirit of solidarity be- tween island communities, therefore with the ambition of reducing economic and capacity gaps between EU and non-EU Mediterranean countries. Taking action in the Mediterranean, for living islands! Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 21 Based on the principle that it is only pos- sible to preserve what is known, and even though significant gaps remain in the existing knowledge on the Mediterra- nean and its biodiversity, one of the most problematic issues that exists is that the information that is available, such as, in- ventories, knowledge of ecosystems ser- vices and biodiversity maps, are not al- ways accessible and available for use by all relevant stakeholders. Updated knowledge, organised and made available in formats suitable and ac- cessible to different users, is fundamen- tal and can play a key role in supporting communication and awareness-raising actions on the importance of conserving island biodiversity in the Mediterranean. Knowledge also plays a central role in partnership building and awareness of biodiversity and climate change in the Mediterranean islands. Mediterranean islands\u2019 biodiversity in- cludes a high number of endemic and indigenous species, many of them with very small distribution areas. Most of these species are poorly understood in terms of conservation status and vulner- ability to human pressures and climate change. Under this pillar, the Action Plan will include activities aimed at: \u2022 Advancing inventories and map- ping of biodiversity hotspots at lo- cal level (species, habitats, ecosys- tem services) particularly on lesser researched islands, endangered species and taxa, and degraded sites; \u2022 Developing an integrated regional insular biodiversity database with the mapping of Key Island Biodi- versity Areas; \u2022 Supporting local-based research initiatives on biodiversity; \u2022 Helping local communities under- stand biodiversity conservation on the islands; \u2022 Sharing knowledge (data, best practices, etc) using up-to-date communication means at local, na- tional and regional levels.

Biodiversity and nature conservation be- ing the pillars of sustainable development is still not well understood or widely ac- cepted. Mainstreaming the need to con- sider biodiversity and nature within other sectoral and cross cutting policies and programmes requires awareness and sensitization. Additionally, it requires con- crete demonstrations of how biodiversity and nature-based solutions can contrib- ute to addressing socioeconomic chal- lenges and provide opportunities e.g., job and benefit creation. Strategies to achieve this should support the inclusion of biodiversity in sustainable develop- ment and policy agendas.

Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean Governance and partnership for implementation Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 4. Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 42 This strategy is intended to serve as a functional collaborative platform involving all relevant actors for biodiversity conser- vation in the Mediterranean islands. The conservation and sustainable use of bio- diversity in the Mediterranean islands re- quires a broad commitment and partic- ipation from all sectors and is not only about nature conservation. Development on each Mediterranean island depends on the ability to ensure that species and ecosystems continue to provide key ser- vices to nature and society. The scientific community, those respon- sible for the management of protected areas or land planning and management, urban planning, agriculture, fisheries, tourism, shipping, energy, water sec- tors, education, local and national gov- ernments are the recipients and those responsible for ensuring the implemen- tation of specific actions that, on each is- land, give life to the vision and guidelines agreed in this strategy. Not intending to replace or overlap with other strategies and action plans already adopted in the Mediterranean island space, this strate- gy aims to facilitate collaborative involve- ment and participation, interdisciplinarity and dialogue between parties. \u00a9 Pexels - Anthony Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean Timeline, monitoring, evaluation, revision Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 5.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da1714e9-6e01-45b2-aa7e-e4261a78f291": {"__data__": {"id_": "da1714e9-6e01-45b2-aa7e-e4261a78f291", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/compilation-wcpa-30x30-resources", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Compilation of WCPA 30x30 Resources", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/compilation-wcpa-30x30-resources", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f30da6943c48531b87eb85b45004b67735baa0f4796bb1fda05c8519f6b30d0e"}, "2": {"node_id": "aa949d7c-d9f3-4512-afd2-ce45d05466fc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/compilation-wcpa-30x30-resources", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ee5f778b1ad18cb9a8a24cdbb29de5e2f5d2cc672b93ba6aaed81ee2d0da98ac"}}, "hash": "1028ec0632d4e78239c90bb974f756afbb9295c27bf728225272b6dfd816ee12", "text": "Living islands, for a sustainable Mediterranean 44 The Strategy proposes ten years for its implementation, considering the general objectives and the nature and diversity of interventions included in the Action Plan.

A final evaluation, including a proposal for re- vision of the Strategy, should be carried out during the last year of the Strategy's duration. MIC partners will establish a follow-up committee responsible for collecting all the relevant information for supporting the monitoring and evaluation of the Strategy, within the observatory. Monitoring and evaluation will use indicators and targets assigned to each action and the selection of indicators and targets should be es- tablished through a participatory process involving all relevant stakeholders. When appropriate, the evaluation and re- sults should consider the alignment with national (national biodiversity strategies) and international (Barcelona Convention, EU, IPBES, CBD) processes associated with nature conservation and biodiversity, underlining Mediterranean islands' con- tribution in global conservation efforts. As a final outcome, as promoters of the strategy, the MIC partners aim to create a representative observatory for the differ- ent relevant sectors that will be respon- sible for analysing developments in the different strategic guidelines and specif- ic actions. This planned observatory will act as the monitoring and follow-up tool, depending on the targets and indicators associated with each action, and will also be responsible for the integration and har- monisation of the diversity of data from the different levels of intervention (local, national, regional) under the Strategy.

It provides public, private and non-governmental organisations with the knowledge and tools that enable human progress, economic development and nature conservation to take place together. Created in 1948, IUCN is now the world\u2019s largest and most diverse environmental network, harnessing the knowledge, resources and reach of 1,400 Member organisations and some 15,000 experts. It is a leading provider of conservation data, assessments and analysis. Its broad membership enables IUCN to fill the role of incubator and trusted repository of best practices, tools and international standards. IUCN provides a neutral space in which diverse stakeholders including governments, NGOs, scientists, businesses, local communities, indigenous peoples\u2019 organisations and others can work together to forge and implement solutions to environmental challenges and achieve sustainable development. Working with many partners and supporters, IUCN implements a large and diverse portfolio of conservation projects worldwide. Combining the latest science with the traditional knowledge of local communities, these projects work to reverse habitat loss, restore ecosystems and improve people\u2019s well-being. www.iucn.org https://twitter.com/IUCN/ IUCN Species Survival Commission With over 10,500 Members, the Species Survival Commission (SSC) is the largest of the six expert Commissions of IUCN and enables IUCN to influence, encourage and assist societies to conserve biodiversity by building knowledge on the status and threats to species, providing advice, developing policies and guidelines, facilitating conservation planning, and catalysing conservation action. Members of SSC belong to one or more of the 160+ Specialist Groups, Red List Authorities, Task Forces and Conservation Committees, each focusing on a taxonomic group (plants, fungi, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fishes and invertebrates), or a disciplinary issue, such as sustainable use and livelihoods, reintroduction of species, wildlife health, climate change and conservation planning. https://www.iucn.org/our-union/commissions/species-survival-commission https://twitter.com/iucnssc IUCN Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation The IUCN Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation (IUCN-Med) opened in Malaga (Spain) in October 2001 with the core support of the Spanish Ministry of Environment and the regional Government of Junta de Andaluc\u00eda. The Centre\u2019s mission is to influence, encourage and assist Mediterranean societies to conserve and use sustainably the natural resources of the region and work with IUCN Members and cooperate with all other agencies that share the objectives of IUCN. www.iucn.org/mediterranean The conservation status of freshwater species and habitats in Key Biodiversity Areas at the Douro river basin The designation of geographical entities in this report, and the presentation of the material do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of IUCN or other participating organisations concerning the legal status of any country, territory, or area, or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries.

These sites, either identified as Key Biodiversity Areas1 (KBA) or potential KBA (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017) were assessed on their effectiveness in containing important populations of KBA trigger species2 and threatened species. For this, biodiversity surveys of the taxa used to identify freshwater KBA sites (fishes, molluscs, odonates, and aquatic plants) were undertaken in selected sampling sites. A total of 122 species were recorded in 43 sampling sites, including 82 aquatic plant species, 15 fish species, 12 dragonflies and damselflies species, 2 crayfish species, 5 bivalve species, and 6 gastropod species. Eleven of these species (8 fish, 1 bivalve, 1 odonate and 1 aquatic plant) are classified as threatened with extinction on the IUCN Red List of Threatened SpeciesTM. A total of 7 non-native species were also recorded. Among the 14 investigated sites, the KBA sites Malcata and Montesinho e Nogueira were the sites with the highest total species richness (45 and 42 species, respectively). Taking out the aquatic plant species richness (observed only in a few KBA sites) the highest total species richness was still found in KBA sites Malcata and Serras de Montesinho e Nogueira, but also in the potential KBA R\u00edo Yeltes and the KBA Sierra de Gredos y Candelario. Five investigated sites sheltered the highest number of threatened species: potential KBA R\u00edo Yeltes and the 4 KBA sites Malcata, El Rebollar, Sierra de Gredos y Candelario and Sierra de la Cabrera. The highest number of non-native species were found in the KBA sites Fuentes Carrionas and Sierras de Pe\u00f1a Labra", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b9bdc639-1f91-433f-891c-1fc4793485eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "b9bdc639-1f91-433f-891c-1fc4793485eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-freshwater-species-and-habitats-key-biodiversity-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The conservation status of freshwater species and habitats in Key Biodiversity Areas at the Douro river basin", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-freshwater-species-and-habitats-key-biodiversity-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f41982e488d46a6b378f632d6d99c15bc86f74f0cab434952f08cc05d69aee52"}, "3": {"node_id": "559eb516-a9af-49bc-85be-29c5c45738bb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-freshwater-species-and-habitats-key-biodiversity-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "daae824bb6848a8a12d7536a4d5bdf42fddd63571451575a567bcb29d8f30cc0"}}, "hash": "a074d813f6ec82bdd3cacf44044b6a90d727aef3aacce7511510d1a82dcaa127", "text": "y del Cordel, with KBA Fuentes Carrionas having a higher number of non-native than native species. Concerning Habitat Quality (HQA) from the River Habitat Survey (RHS), the KBA El Rebollar and the potential KBA R\u00edo Yeltes recorded the highest habitat quality. However, these investigated sites (El Rebollar and R\u00edo Yeltes) did also show high scores of Habitat Modification (HMI), only being outnumbered by the KBAs Malcata and Sierras de Pe\u00f1a Labra y del Cordel. Lowest Habitat Modification scores (HMI) were found in KBAs Sierras de Urbi\u00f3n, Cebollera y Neila and Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del R\u00edo Lobos. The study shows worrying results on the status of freshwater biodiversity. No trigger species was found in 43% of all investigated sites surveyed in the Douro river basin. Recognizing that freshwater KBAs have high conservation importance, we identify the shortcomings, which mainly relate to either flawed or lack of distribution data for the trigger species. Trigger species were found in all four investigated sites that were considered as potential KBA (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017), but that are not included as such in the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas. The results of this study support the need for the incorporation of these sites as KBA to help focus conservation efforts and promote management actions that allow the persistence of the biodiversity elements present. On the other hand, no trigger species were detected in several KBA sites, particularly in the northern part of the Douro river basin. In two KBAs (Sierra de Gredos y Candelario and Malcata), the trigger species were not recorded because the habitat where the species normally occurs was not sampled. In 5 KBA sites (Babia-Somiedo, Fuentes Carrionas, Sierras de Pe\u00f1a Labra y del Cordel, Sierras de Urbi\u00f3n, Cebollera y Neila and Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del R\u00edo Lobos) no trigger species was found even after intensive sampling.

V | V | V | other threatened species were detected, which should be added as biodiversity elements in the KBA profiles. A total of 11 threatened species were found in the investigated sites, including 8 fish species: Achondrostoma arcasii (VU), Achondrostoma salmantinum (EN), Anguilla anguilla (CR), Cobitis calderoni (EN), Cobitis paludica (VU), Cobitis vettonica (EN), Pseudochondrostoma duriense (VU), Squalius alburnoides (VU), 1 bivalve species Margaritifera Margaritifera (EN), 1 odonate species Macromia splendens (VU) and 1 aquatic plant species Eryngium viviparum (EN). Besides the ones that were already identified as trigger species for the freshwater KBA sites, including the gastropod species Iberhoratia aurorae (DD), there were 3 threatened species that could qualify as trigger species: 2 fish species Anguilla anguilla (CR), Squalius alburnoides (VU) and 1 odonate species Macromia splendens (VU). The presence of the Critically Endangered european eel (Anguilla anguilla) is however puzzling since two specimens were detected in one of the KBA sites (Serras de Montesinho e Nogueira). Possible explanations are that it is either specimens introduced by man or some eels were able to pass all the dams in the Douro river basin and travel until the Sanabria lake. Further investigation is needed to better understand the current distribution of the european eel in the Douro river basin.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "559eb516-a9af-49bc-85be-29c5c45738bb": {"__data__": {"id_": "559eb516-a9af-49bc-85be-29c5c45738bb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-freshwater-species-and-habitats-key-biodiversity-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The conservation status of freshwater species and habitats in Key Biodiversity Areas at the Douro river basin", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-freshwater-species-and-habitats-key-biodiversity-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f41982e488d46a6b378f632d6d99c15bc86f74f0cab434952f08cc05d69aee52"}, "2": {"node_id": "b9bdc639-1f91-433f-891c-1fc4793485eb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-freshwater-species-and-habitats-key-biodiversity-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a074d813f6ec82bdd3cacf44044b6a90d727aef3aacce7511510d1a82dcaa127"}}, "hash": "daae824bb6848a8a12d7536a4d5bdf42fddd63571451575a567bcb29d8f30cc0", "text": "The highest number of threatened species was found in the southwestern part of the Douro river basin, including in one potential KBA (R\u00edo Yeltes).

Non-native species were identified as an important threat for the native freshwater biodiversity. A total of 7 non-native species were found during this study in the Douro river basin: 2 crayfish species (Pacifastacus leniusculus and Procambarus clarkii), 1 bivalve species (Corbicula fluminea) and 4 fish species (Barbatula barbatula, Gambusia holbrooki, Gobio lozanoi and Phoxinus bigerri).

These findings suggest that some of the endemic species remaining in sub-basins are being replaced by non-native species.

The rivers and streams of the southern and eastern part of the Douro river basin suffer mostly from water shortage. In potential KBA R\u00edo Adaja, where a high number of the 2 trigger species was found, the rivers are completely dry in the summer. Since these potential KBAs form no part of other protective zones, incentives are necessary to safeguard the survival of the freshwater biodiversity that is crucial for the rest of the Douro river basin. On the other side, the western part of the Douro river basin suffers greatly from the large dams along the border between Spain and Portugal. Many of the populations of fish are isolated from the middle and lower sections of the Douro river basin, with an especially large impact on potamodromous migratory fish (species whose entire migration takes place in freshwater). KBA sites have high conservation importance but additional measures are necessary in order to preserve the freshwater biodiversity. Steps should be taken for the inclusion of KBA trigger species in the management plans of existing protected areas (Ramsar Sites, Natura 2000 sites, other national or regional protection figures) and the inclusion of KBA sites in river basin management plans. This will ensure more appropriate planning and correct allocation of funds for nature conservation. Furthermore, management plans to control or even eradicate non-native species should be designed promplty and implemented. Finally, obsolete dams and barriers should be selected for decommissioning, and building fish passages on barriers impermeable to fish should be promoted.

Finally, 64 Key Biodiversity Areas have been delineated in the Douro river basin, 9 are located in Portugal and 55 in Spain. Of these sites, only 2 have been identified as freshwater KBA with a focus on the conservation of freshwater biodiversity (BirdLife International, 2021). During the years 2018 and 2019, a team of experts on freshwater biodiversity surveyed several sampling sites in the entire Douro river basin to assess the status of freshwater biodiversity (Figure 1). The aim was to understand the current situation of the freshwater biodiversity in 10 Key Biodiversity Areas and 4 sites identified as potential KBAs (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017). These experts assessed the presence of freshwater trigger species, recorded the occurrence of fish, odonates, bivalves, crayfish and aquatic plants and determined the potential threats for these species (Table 1). Finally, they assessed the status of each site and gave recommendations on possible measures to better conserve freshwater biodiversity.

The microclimate allow for the cultivation of olives, almonds and grapes, the latter being used for the production of the famous Ribera del Duero and port wines (Louren\u00e7o-Gomes et al., 2015). The river also forms the natural border line between Spain and Portugal for 112 kilometers, and many important cities have been built along its river banks, including Valladolid, Zamora, Vila Nova de Gaia and Porto (Bordalo et al., 2006). Once a wild river bursting with wildlife, the Douro has been undergoing quite a change due to human intervention. Fifteen hydrodams have been built to regulate the water flow, generate hydroelectric power, and allow navigation through locks. Consequently, river connectivity was highly impaired (Cortes et al., 2019). The lower part of the Portuguese drainage is influenced by the Atlantic climate. The upper-middle part of the Portuguese and Spanish section is used for agriculture (mainly vineyards) with some tributaries subject to a semi-arid (Mediterranean climate) while others in mountain areas have more water availability (Andresen et al., 2004). The main threats are posed by big urban areas and severe pollution. 1 Introduction \u00a9 Manuel Lopes-Lima BIOPOLIS-CIBIO/InBIO 2 | Figure 1.

As for the disappearance of the trigger species, the many dams and barriers that are hindering their migratory seasonal patterns and the many stresses on the middle and lower sections of the R\u00edo Pisuerga should be the main impacts. Sedimentation caused by agriculture activities is probably also one of the main threats to the freshwater diversity. Conservation guidance This KBA site needs to be revaluated and surveyed in more detail seasonally for the presence of P. duriense. Trigger species should include A. arcasii, another threatened fish detected here. The management of non-native species, such as the fish Phoxinus bigerri and Gobio lozanoi, and the crayfish P. leniusculus; as well as the increase of the riparian buffer to avoid sedimentation in streams should be pursued as the main conservation measures.

Most of the fish communities of the remaining river sub-basins are declining fast and being replaced by non-native species. Here, we did not find any non-native species, but prevention measures should be developed given the presence of non-native species in the lower section of the river Tormes and the Douro watershed. Conservation guidance Although the site with the trigger species population was not visited, we contacted the authors that had described the species in 2007 and got confirmation about the population status. Therefore, the KBA site seems to be well evaluated but should include other fish trigger species such as Pseudochondrostoma duriense and Squalius alburnoides, both rarely found in other Douro KBA sites in Spain. Management plans for non- native crayfish and fish species should be implemented.

These dams might be disruptive for potamodromous migratory fish such as P. duriense or L. bocagei. The recent introduction of the signal crayfish might also have an important impact on the future of aquatic species in these basins. Conservation guidance The site is already protected. However a recent study mentions that the park should be extended downstream to include areas richer in diversity and abundance of threatened fish species. Therefore, ideally the KBA site should be extended 10-15 km downstream. The KBA should also include the Iberian Nase P. duriense as a trigger species, which has dramatically declined in the whole basin.

However, barriers in the lower Tera and Esla basin are now isolating freshwater species populations, making them more prone to genetic erosion and exposure to local extinction. Additionally, non-native species such as the signal crayfish P. leniusculus and the fish species P. bigerri and B. barbatula are already in other upper catchments of the Douro river basin and should arrive to this area shortly. Conservation guidance Management plans for potential non-native crayfish and fish should be implemented. An effort should be made to increase the connectivity of the River Tera to the River Douro, by selecting obsolete dams and barriers for decommissioning and building fish passages on barriers impermeable to fish.

T here is quite a difference in the freshwater biodiversity found in the distinct investigated sites. Consequently, the necessary measures to conserve the threatened biodiversity can be quite different between regions. An overview of identified threats can be found here: \u2022 Agricultural and forestry effluents: Eutrophication happening as a consequence of agricultural activities. \u2022 Droughts: mainly occurring in the tributaries in the middle part of the drainages (upper part in Portugal). \u2022 Dams and water management/use: several dams have been built to regulate the water flow, generate hydroelectric power, and allow navigation through locks. \u2022 Non-native species: several non-native fishes have invaded this river basin (Lepomis gibbosus, Gambusia holbrooki, Ameiurus melas, Sander lucioperca, Alburnus alburnus, Phoxinus bigerri and Barbatula barbatula). \u2022 Housing and urban areas. \u2022 Annual and perennial non-timber crops: the Spanish River Douro valley has great relevance from the point of view of agriculture with important cereal crops (wheat and barley), legumes, vineyards, sugar beets and alfalfa. \u2022 Livestock farming and ranching: in the Spanish River Douro valley, livestock is an important resource. It includes the exploitation of extensive sheep, pigs and cows. \u2022 Shipping lanes: the main Douro River in the Portuguese part, has a series of navigable locks, that impairs the river connectivity and has a severe impact on the migratory species populations (Petromyzon marinus, Alosa sp., Anguilla anguilla, Salmo trutta). \u2022 Hunting terrestrial animals: Hunting is an important activity in the region of Castilla. 5 Threats 37 | Finally, the southern KBA site Sierra de Gredos y Candelario and the southern potential KBA sites of R\u00edo Yeltes, R\u00edo Adaja, R\u00edo Corneja and R\u00edo Eresma exhibited high numbers of threatened species, with a relatively lower number of non-native species, except for some invertebrate species. Trigger species were found in all of the potential KBA sites. This part of the Douro river basin regions seem to be more affected by water shortage and sediment inputs from agriculture activities. Special attention should be given to the potential KBA site R\u00edo Adaja, that is mostly dry during the summer months, but the few permanent pools that remain, concentrate large abundances of fish. The pool numbers seem to be decreasing and the river will possibly dry completely over the course of the following years. The eastern part of the Douro river basin is equally alarming, not solely for the presence of non-native species but particularly for the high occurrence of freshwater threatened species. The northeastern KBA sites Serras de Montesinho e Nogueira and Sierra de la Cabrera are mostly threatened by the physical barriers that were built along the Spanish-Portuguese border, isolating freshwater species populations and making them more prone to genetic erosion and exposure to local extinction. In the southeastern KBA sites El Rebollar and Malcata, increased water usage and climate change have caused water shortage and droughts, and sedimentation caused by summer fires is negatively affecting the freshwater diversity in these sites. \u00a9 Manuel Lopes-Lima BIOPOLIS-CIBIO/InBIO 38 | of Salamanca.

A water management plan is needed to avoid part of river Ulcero within the KBA site Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del R\u00edo Lobos to dry out in the summer. This study provided an overview of the status of freshwater biodiversity in the Douro river basin, and on the effectiveness of KBA sites in conserving the trigger species and other threatened freshwater species. In the majority of sampling sites the freshwater trigger species were not recorded, and in half of the KBA sites the freshwater trigger species were not detected at all. In contrast, trigger species were detected in all four potential KBA sites (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017). A more detailed and comprehensive survey on trigger species is needed to detect and assess the abundance of these species for each KBA site. An update of the status of the KBA sites is necessary if the results show an absence or low abundance of the trigger species or any other threatened species. Furthermore, the investigated sites that were delineated as potential KBA (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017) should be nominated as KBA sites to conserve the high number of threatened freshwater species present. Other threatened species found in the KBA sites should be added as additional trigger species during the updating. Additionally, the area for some KBA sites (Babia-Somiedo, Malcata, Serras de Motesinho e Nogueira) has to be extended to include locations where trigger species occur. Further recognition of the high conservation importance of freshwater KBA sites is needed to strengthen the measures to preserve the freshwater biodiversity in the KBA sites. An intial step should be to include the KBA trigger species in the management plans of existing protected areas (Ramsar Sites, Natura 2000 sites, other national or regional protection schemes). It would be good to analyse the feasibility and convenience of including their monitoring as an indicator of conservation status of the site. KBA sites should also be included in the River Basin Management Plans, either as water bodies or as protected areas, to ensure that an appropriate planning of the basin is done and to ensure that enough water is allocated for the conservation of these sites and that no other measures in the plan harm these sites. One project in the Douro river basin already started with the protection and the recovery of native endemic fish populations: the Project Cipriver in the southwest 6 Conservation guidance 39 | No trigger species were found in 43% of all investigated sites. Especially, the situation of the KBA sites in the northwestern part of the Douro river basin is alarming and a further investigation is needed to assess trigger species abundance and to re-evaluate their status as KBA site. The southwestern part of the Douro basin is characterized by a high number of trigger and threatened species, and several investigated regions in this part of the Douro basin should be recognized as KBA site to protect the existing freshwater biodiversity. Freshwater KBA sites have a high conservation importance, but clear distribution data for the trigger species is necessary and active monitoring and coordination are needed to better conserve the present biodiversity. This study assessed the status of freshwater biodiversity in ten Key Biodiverisity Areas of the Douro river basin and four potential Key Biodiversity Areas (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017). The findings paint a somber picture of the situation in the Douro river basin. The native and endemic species are being outcompeted by non-native species, and suffering from habitat eutrophication and sedimentation due to agricultural and forestry activities. High water consumption and climate change have caused water shortage and droughts, leaving several streams and pools dry during the summer months. Physical barriers and dams are blocking the migration of many endemic species, isolating freshwater species populations and making them more prone to genetic erosion and local extinction. 7 Conclusions Sampling along the Douro river \u00a9 Ronaldo Sousa 40 | References Instituto da \u00c1gua (INAG), I.P.

It provides public, private and non-governmental organisations with the knowledge and tools that enable human progress, economic development and nature conservation to take place together. Created in 1948, IUCN is now the world\u2019s largest and most diverse environmental network, harnessing the knowledge, resources and reach of 1,400 Member organisations and some 15,000 experts. It is a leading provider of conservation data, assessments and analysis. Its broad membership enables IUCN to fill the role of incubator and trusted repository of best practices, tools and international standards. IUCN provides a neutral space in which diverse stakeholders including governments, NGOs, scientists, businesses, local communities, indigenous peoples\u2019 organisations and others can work together to forge and implement solutions to environmental challenges and achieve sustainable development. Working with many partners and supporters, IUCN implements a large and diverse portfolio of conservation projects worldwide. Combining the latest science with the traditional knowledge of local communities, these projects work to reverse habitat loss, restore ecosystems and improve people\u2019s well-being. www.iucn.org https://twitter.com/IUCN/ IUCN Species Survival Commission With over 10,500 Members, the Species Survival Commission (SSC) is the largest of the six expert Commissions of IUCN and enables IUCN to influence, encourage and assist societies to conserve biodiversity by building knowledge on the status and threats to species, providing advice, developing policies and guidelines, facilitating conservation planning, and catalysing conservation action. Members of SSC belong to one or more of the 160+ Specialist Groups, Red List Authorities, Task Forces and Conservation Committees, each focusing on a taxonomic group (plants, fungi, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fishes and invertebrates), or a disciplinary issue, such as sustainable use and livelihoods, reintroduction of species, wildlife health, climate change and conservation planning. https://www.iucn.org/our-union/commissions/species-survival-commission https://twitter.com/iucnssc IUCN Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation The IUCN Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation (IUCN-Med) opened in Malaga (Spain) in October 2001 with the core support of the Spanish Ministry of Environment and the regional Government of Junta de Andaluc\u00eda. The Centre\u2019s mission is to influence, encourage and assist Mediterranean societies to conserve and use sustainably the natural resources of the region and work with IUCN Members and cooperate with all other agencies that share the objectives of IUCN. www.iucn.org/mediterranean The conservation status of freshwater species and habitats in Key Biodiversity Areas at the Douro river basin The designation of geographical entities in this report, and the presentation of the material do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of IUCN or other participating organisations concerning the legal status of any country, territory, or area, or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries.

These sites, either identified as Key Biodiversity Areas1 (KBA) or potential KBA (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017) were assessed on their effectiveness in containing important populations of KBA trigger species2 and threatened species. For this, biodiversity surveys of the taxa used to identify freshwater KBA sites (fishes, molluscs, odonates, and aquatic plants) were undertaken in selected sampling sites. A total of 122 species were recorded in 43 sampling sites, including 82 aquatic plant species, 15 fish species, 12 dragonflies and damselflies species, 2 crayfish species, 5 bivalve species, and 6 gastropod species. Eleven of these species (8 fish, 1 bivalve, 1 odonate and 1 aquatic plant) are classified as threatened with extinction on the IUCN Red List of Threatened SpeciesTM. A total of 7 non-native species were also recorded. Among the 14 investigated sites, the KBA sites Malcata and Montesinho e Nogueira were the sites with the highest total species richness (45 and 42 species, respectively). Taking out the aquatic plant species richness (observed only in a few KBA sites) the highest total species richness was still found in KBA sites Malcata and Serras de Montesinho e Nogueira, but also in the potential KBA R\u00edo Yeltes and the KBA Sierra de Gredos y Candelario. Five investigated sites sheltered the highest number of threatened species: potential KBA R\u00edo Yeltes and the 4 KBA sites Malcata, El Rebollar, Sierra de Gredos y Candelario and Sierra de la Cabrera. The highest number of non-native species were found in the KBA sites Fuentes Carrionas and Sierras de Pe\u00f1a Labra", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7f950aaa-51df-4bc5-afeb-c4b77d2b945b": {"__data__": {"id_": "7f950aaa-51df-4bc5-afeb-c4b77d2b945b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/international-marine-protected-areas-congress-edition-4-impac4-executive", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "International Marine Protected Areas Congress Edition 4 (IMPAC4) Executive summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/international-marine-protected-areas-congress-edition-4-impac4-executive", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1c984bcece5689717ef01c616118852c127dbcf839afc44a52a0d1642dd0c965"}, "3": {"node_id": "f3cf99d8-9d6d-427e-9f79-08de8b383992", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/international-marine-protected-areas-congress-edition-4-impac4-executive", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e2059d971d9785383f0e485b20b1d00c1c0fd5235161e008bae12ad157c547a0"}}, "hash": "6a41217007eb1da7ed1f8c5a0a8cedd05f7e0706097e31ba6f1013c317b80c3a", "text": "y del Cordel, with KBA Fuentes Carrionas having a higher number of non-native than native species.
