Samarco\u2018s parent companies \u2013 Vale and BHP \u2013 would finance Renova, while an Inter-Federative Committee (CIF) would oversee the restoration process. The CIF included representatives from federal and state government agencies as well as municipal governments, representatives of affected populations and the civil society organisations that provide them with technical assistance. Together, Renova and the CIF were made formally responsible for the restoration, in consultation with affected communities. The idea of installing a specialist panel to provide independent technical advice on the restoration process took shape in the two years following the disaster. The objective proposed by the leadership of Renova and Samarco\u2019s parent companies was to identify global corporate best practices and science- based perspectives on the restoration. In December 2015, BHP staff members consulted with various international organisations that were concerned about the environmental and social impacts of the Fund\u00e3o Dam collapse. IUCN was among the organisations visited by the BHP staff members tasked with managing the restoration efforts. Although IUCN was unable to provide technical support to address the immediate short-term mitigation and restoration activities, the organisation had experience with the creation of ISTAPs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c60b710c-221d-444f-b2a5-db951d67cdf6": {"__data__": {"id_": "c60b710c-221d-444f-b2a5-db951d67cdf6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-meat-production-smallholder-farms-dehesas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ecological Footprint: meat production in smallholder farms, dehesas, Extremadura, Spain", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-meat-production-smallholder-farms-dehesas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bb2870ee6592381ffa7ab7db12a6c19c02b3114d870e62652238dbc555195328"}, "2": {"node_id": "bd44ba6f-79e8-488b-a7ce-f297ad31b8ee", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-meat-production-smallholder-farms-dehesas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6da3088a36bed4fca7d35f4b6c74298e6f8800209b003f102b364c0d4b721db5"}}, "hash": "056c6f8b23a925b9ee72c6d9c7b37b5bc05704bb1532461fa9f248c135b11290", "text": "This initial consultation led to a dialogue between IUCN and BHP, that eventually led to the decision to create an independent panel.

They can help multiple stakeholders understand situations characterised by complexity, uncertainty, and cost and can contribute to effective and efficient decision- making. Organisations which have recently created such groups include the Global Environment Facility\u2019s Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP), the World Health Organization\u2019s Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee (STAC), and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change\u2019s Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP). Such panels are typically convened under conditions of uncertainty. The number of unforeseen environmental disasters has been growing, for example, linked to climate change, extinctions, ozone depletion, mine- tailing dam collapses, and more. Advisory panels are also a regular feature of complex infrastructure projects. Other IUCN panels have been set up to address the impacts of major oil and gas investments in Nigeria (IUCN Niger Delta Panel) and in Russia (IUCN Western Gray Whale Advisory Panel).3 Although some IUCN Members saw partnership with mining enterprises as contrary to the reputational 2 IUCN (2014), Procedures for establishing and managing IUCN-supported Independent Scientific & Technical Advisory Panels, https://iucn.org/sites/default/files/2022-11/iucn_istap_procedures_2014.pdf 3 See: https://www.iucn.org/western-gray-whale-advisory-panel and https://www.iucn.org/theme/business-and-biodiversity/our-work/business- partnerships-projects/shell/iucn-niger-delta-panel 4 The Brumadinho disaster led to 270 deaths, mostly employees of Vale who were in the company cafeteria located immediately below the dam when it collapsed upon them. 5 Global Tailings Review (2020) \u2013 Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management - https://globaltailingsreview.org/global-industry-standard/ - IUCN was part of the Tailings Review Advisory Group interests of the organisation, there was widespread support for \u2013 and acceptance of \u2013 the effort to achieve better results from the restoration. The reputational risk became more obvious after the occurrence of a second major dam collapse at Brumadinho in January of 2019, which caused many more deaths than the Fund\u00e3o disaster.4 IUCN followed the response to this new crisis closely: Why had the same mining enterprise (Vale) not learned enough in the three years following the Fund\u00e3o Dam failure to prevent further disasters? An international inquiry sparked by Brumadinho led to the adoption of new standards for the management of tailings dams and for restoration efforts after future ruptures (Oberle 2020).5 The effectiveness of ISTAPs is strongly associated with their credibility as arbiters or scientific/technical specialists, whose salience or recognised prominence in the fields is perceived as relevant to the issues at hand as well as their legitimacy in the eyes of principal stakeholders to offer advice on these complex matters (Cash et al., 2003). Furthermore, based upon its experience with other such Panels, IUCN recognises that \u2013 to be effective \u2014 an ISTAP should operate according to four general principles: independence, transparency, accountability, and engagement. These principles apply to all IUCN-supported ISTAPs (IUCN, 2014). While the generic principles for advisory panels (Cash et al., 2003) address criteria similar to those adopted by IUCN, the latter put greater emphasis on the need for independence from external influences while maintaining accountability to affected groups.

In the past two decades, IUCN has refined its ISTAP model to provide companies and other stakeholders with credible, relevant, and legitimate technical advice. According to IUCN (2021): \u201cISTAPs are established with the formal designation of a group of experts, who engage in provision of scientific and/or technical advice on a specific biodiversity conservation or natural resource management issue. Typically, the recipient of the advice is one or more business entities or public authorities.

This process took nearly a full year to complete and involved regular consultation with the leadership of the Renova Foundation. Given IUCN\u2019s principal conservation mission, the Panel focused on environmental remediation and the restoration of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. It also considered impact assessment and monitoring, and the relation between ecosystems and livelihoods, as well as human and ecosystem health in the affected communities. 7 Terms of Reference for the Rio Doce Panel are available at https://www.iucn.org/sites/default/files/2022-10/rio-doce-istap-terms-of-reference_updated_2020jan.pdf 6 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL These themes were compatible with the Panel\u2019s objectives, as defined by its TOR and FAQ,8 of making recommendations at a long-term, landscape scale and calling attention to NbS. The Panel\u2019s specific focus was to examine the impacts of the disaster on the environment and natural resources. The Panel\u2019s remit did not cover issues that had been referred to the courts, such as indemnification payments and relocation, or the management and disposal of the tailings and other engineering issues. Detailed discussion of the generic safety of tailings dams was also excluded since this was seen as an issue for the technical specialists engaged in the international review of dam safety. Central issues included biodiversity, basin management, water resources, fisheries and NbS, since IUCN is widely recognised for its global leadership and expertise in these areas. 8 Frequently Asked Questions regarding the Rio Doce Panel are available at www.iucn.org/riodocepanel. Above: Panel visits the area of Fund\u00e3o. October 2018. Photo: IUCN/Rio Doce Panel archive 7 Independence is central to the Panel\u2019s operating principles, but some stakeholders had questions. To what extent could the Panel avoid manipulation and co-optation given its institutional proximity and financial dependence on Renova? Any ISTAP created in the context of disaster reparation is liable to face this question. The answer is that the Rio Doce Panel \u2013 following the lead of previous IUCN ISTAPs \u2013 has engaged in a way that is independent, transparent and accountable to all the stakeholders involved. Although its role is advisory, the Panel is not beholden to Renova or to Samarco\u2019s shareholders and parent companies. Any real or potential conflict of interest is addressed through IUCN procedures and best practice. A thorough conflict of interest verification is conducted on a regular basis, for example, to ensure that Panel members do not personally benefit from their work. These principles have been explicit during Panel consultations in the Rio Doce Basin. 8 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL The aim of the Panel therefore was to provide independent expert advice and guidance to Renova and other entities involved in the long-term governance of the Rio Doce Basin.

The Panel needed to navigate these shifts while retaining its independence. The Panel initially assumed that it would respond primarily to Renova\u2019s needs, but this assumption was tested as policies changed and as relations shifted between Renova and other parties. Many \u2013 if not most \u2013 of the Panel\u2019s recommendations were then developed to include other governmental stakeholders such as the two state governments and the Rio Doce Watershed Committee (CBH-Doce). Over time, the Panel gradually put more effort into communicating its work and stimulating debate among the emerging primary stakeholders. This was essential, because these stakeholders would be responsible for maintenance of the socio-environmental health and revival of the basin\u2019s economy once Renova\u2019s work was finished.

Such issues had to be openly discussed among stakeholders. Panel members found the interdisciplinary composition and diversity of their professional backgrounds to be an asset. However, for a multidisciplinary panel of this kind to function effectively, it was essential that key decisions be reached through consensus. This required Panel members to listen carefully, respect the opinions of others, follow formal protocols, and make an effort to comprehend the technical issues from the perspective of other disciplines. This was particularly important in the finalisation of the analyses and recommendations set out in the thematic reports and issues papers, which IUCN published under the co-authorship of the Chair and all the Panel members, even though each report had its respective lead author. The need for consensus meant fewer documents were published, since publication required a time-consuming process of internal and external peer review, comment, and re-editing. However, the need for consensus also meant that arguments were more balanced, and the writing more carefully crafted. Although changes in the composition of the Panel occurred during the five-year period of activities for varied reasons, this did not affect the methodology adopted for tripartite teamwork on each paper, though it did cause some delay in delivery timelines. However, it may have influenced the selection of topics and the focus of some of the papers without interrupting the overall programme. The Panel made an early decision to differentiate its products into two types of reports. The first were issue papers (IP), which were relatively short, produced more rapidly, and focused on specific concerns facing the restoration. The second were thematic reports (TRs), which went into greater depth, were longer, and had a broader scope. The Panel Chair guided the process of deciding themes and asking Panel members whether they would participate in the core groups responsible for the initial drafts of technical reports and issue papers. All Panel members played an active role in discussing the relevance of possible topics, which were subsequently selected based on specific criteria such as the knowledge and experience of Panel members. Panel members were expected to dedicate time from their already busy individual schedules to the work of the Panel. They met virtually each month, and face-to- face twice a year in the affected region. During the face- to-face gatherings, Panel members visited locations and communities affected by the disaster, as well as restoration sites, to understand the issues first hand and to follow the progress of restoration. When Panel members attended seminars, conferences and other institutional meetings related to the restoration, they did so as Panel representatives and accessed resources from the Panel budget. 12 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL The Panel was governed by its detailed ToRs, codes of conduct and its Theory of Change (ToC). At an early stage in its work, the Panel enunciated an initial version of its ToC that set up outcome indicators and a strategy to monitor the uptake of its recommendations by the primary and secondary stakeholders of the restoration programmes under Renova\u2019s responsibility. The primary or secondary stakeholders were defined as \u201cMain Stakeholders, Policymakers, Influencers and Do- ers\u201d. The categories were sometimes overlapping and may have referred to entities with multiple roles in the restoration. BOX 2 \u2013 THE PANEL TARGET AUDIENCES Main Stakeholders Renova Foundation, CIF and its technical chambers Policymakers Federal, state and municipal governments, Basin committees, state agencies and regulatory institutions, legislature, judiciary and Public Prosecutor\u2019s office Influencers Universities and research institutes, national and international corporations, advisors to the judiciary, and to the Public Prosecutor\u2019s office DO-ers Affected people and its technical advisors, representative associations, private companies in the basin and NGOs working in the restoration process According to the ToC, Main stakeholders include organisations which were created in response to the disaster and which are a key part of the reparation\u2019s governance structure, such as the Renova Foundation, CIF and its Technical Chambers. Policymakers also deal directly with the consequences of the Fund\u00e3o Dam rupture and are part of the governance structure, but they have a broader scope of action and attributions beyond the reparation. Examples include the three Brazilian levels of government (federal, state, and municipal), basin committees, regulatory institutions, and legislative, judiciary and the public prosecutor. Influencers included active civil society and social movements within the region, as well as the media and higher educational institutions. Lastly, the ToC defines Do-ers as those which used natural resources and which were directly affected by the disaster. These include farmers, fishers and tourism operators, as well as iron and other mineral extraction companies, steel foundries", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "94905974-d299-4916-bff6-d6e1298efff4": {"__data__": {"id_": "94905974-d299-4916-bff6-d6e1298efff4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-meat-production-smallholder-farms-dehesas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ecological Footprint: meat production in smallholder farms, dehesas, Extremadura, Spain", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-meat-production-smallholder-farms-dehesas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f9369fddd19a302fcd322c7c800ce0931e2337a558428c4724ae4801cc2bf576"}, "3": {"node_id": "17ce3048-aa65-41e8-b68e-12df8d42cacc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-meat-production-smallholder-farms-dehesas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "642057a874b1adca126b947a11fe80a8947a4aeda997a18f1d073069ec455e10"}}, "hash": "9d864f9ba2111754afacdc0f3a4768936645df7c0d0aeb864d62b059f5b9dfad", "text": "and forest plantations, as well as other actors such as Independent Technical Advisors and NGOs. 13 October 9, 2018 Renova Foundation | Expedition Caminho da Repara\u00e7\u00e3o Aerial view of the vicinity of the mouth of the Rio Doce.

The Panel used a tailored approach to present the recommendations to main stakeholders and policymakers, promoting in-depth meetings, discussions, and joint events. Similarly, to ensure that the recommendations reached a broader audience, such as influencers, the Panel organised webinars and participated in scientific events. The Panel expected these strategies to foster engagement and bring the stakeholders to a common vision. It was hoped that these stakeholders would ultimately use and implement the Panel\u2019s recommendations according to their interest, mandate, and possibilities. Over time, the ToC evolved to go beyond Renova, aiming to reach a broader range of primary stakeholders such as state governments and the Rio Doce Watershed Committee. The Panel began to engage more directly with these groups in 2020. At that time, it was becoming clear that Renova would be unable to act on all the Panel\u2019s recommendations, since many recommendations required broader governmental and societal engagement. The ToC articulated the way in which the Panel would have to balance the demands of different actors while maintaining its independence. Managing such demands and the Panel\u2019s independence required constant vigilance. From the outset, the Panel\u2019s approach was to define the central issues and develop its recommendations, drawing upon contemporary peer- reviewed scientific literature and other publicly accessible sources.

The full list of issue or thematic selection criteria is listed in Box 3, below: 17 An issue or theme would be considered \u2018high\u2019 priority only if it passed the first three criteria and at least three of the remaining eight. Prioritisation was done in-house and based on the consensus view of Panel members. Their detailed scientific knowledge of the critical problems facing the basin and its peoples helped to identify the themes that needed to be addressed. Consensus was often achieved following extensive debate among Panel members. Once prioritised, the Chair selected an interdisciplinary core group of Panel members who were tasked to develop draft recommendations and the accompanying justification for further discussion. The leader of this core group was responsible for the paper\u2019s structure following consultation with the other Panel members and for delegating specific responsibilities to other core group members. This draft outline was then discussed at an alignment meeting with Renova\u2019s technical staff to determine whether the paper would meet the information requirements of the Foundation and other key stakeholders. The core group then began the academic research through peer-reviewed and internationally recognised publications. The research might include publicly available studies by Renova or other agencies, as well as reports from the consulting companies that had been contracted by the public prosecutor\u2019s office to review the restoration\u2019s progress. Even when Renova did not agree with a theme, the Panel\u2019s independence enabled it to proceed if it felt the theme was relevant to the broader restoration programme. Thematic Report number 2 (May et al., 2020) was one such example. Covering the impact of climate change on the basin\u2019s long-term restoration, the Panel proceeded with its preparation on the grounds that it was consistent with global concern and the impacts of regional climatic events. The Panel\u2019s work was invariably seen as independent, technical, and scientifically grounded. This was partly because the Panel members were well-known leaders in their respective fields. Some had taught or worked with decision-makers at Renova or in government agencies while they were at university or in other roles. Just as important, the Panel relied almost exclusively on peer- reviewed and internationally recognised publications. It focused on strategic, longer-term issues relating to the reparation, rather than engaging in detailed analysis of the day-to-day issues. The Panel initially thought they could produce a substantial volume of papers in short order, but this was simply not the case. The issues were complex. Documents required every Panel member to sign off. And IUCN publication guidelines contained multiple steps. This slow delivery frustrated both Renova and the Panel. Future Panels may wish to make the process more agile, to avoid overpromising and under-delivering. The multidisciplinary character of the Panel, and the part-time nature of Panel members\u2019 involvement could also interfere with timelines. Time commitments were flexible, allowing time for revision and reflection, and deadlines were not always strict. When necessary, for example, timelines were modified so that Panel members could visit sites or meet with stakeholders. The dynamic nature of the restoration also meant that Panel members sometimes needed to incorporate new information as it emerged. In 2021, the Panel\u2019s modus operandi changed when Renova requested a new methodology for ex post impact assessments in the marine and coastal areas. Since a member of the Panel \u2013 Professor Luis S\u00e1nchez \u2013 is widely known as one of the most important academic specialists in this area, the Panel agreed to carry out the 18 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL study to help advance the restoration in the affected coastal areas. This led the Panel to adopt a different mode of engagement with Renova staff, although without relinquishing its independence. The Panel\u2019s new approach enabled a constructive dialogue between the Panel and Renova\u2019s Impact Curatorship and Biodiversity teams. Professor S\u00e1nchez led successive workshops at which Panel members collaborated with Renova to further elaborate the methodology for the impact assessment. This process was the basis for producing the fifth and final Thematic Report, which presented the methodology for assessing environmental impacts on coastal and marine environments (S\u00e1nchez, et al., 2022).

The Panel\u2019s monthly meetings were already managed through videoconferencing and their internal exchanges were largely unaffected, but they did manage to organise \u201cvirtual site visits\u201d, for which each Panel member devoted a week in September/October 2020 and March 2021. Renova staff also devised virtual field experiences (\u2018Come See\u2019 expeditions) using interactive video so that Panel members could understand the restoration\u2019s progress.

This was true for the Rio Doce Panel, which benefitted from the support of IUCN\u2019s well-organised, professional support staff at internal meetings and for regular communication with Renova and others. Based in Bras\u00edlia and at the organisation\u2019s headquarters in Switzerland, the IUCN staff ensured that the Panel was able to access the most current peer-reviewed studies as well as media reports and offered insights into the perspectives of different actors and decision-makers. The support staff also managed the complex planning of site visits and meetings, both internal and external, all of which were overseen impeccably. Without the support and legitimacy of IUCN, the Panel would not have been as effective in its analysis and communications. The monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL) related to Panel outputs and recommendations were an added burden for IUCN staff, but the Panel was then able to systematically track the uptake of its recommendations by different stakeholders. The inclusion of a full-time MEL officer and the elaboration of the ToC were key decisions that shaped the Panel\u2019s success. These might usefully be replicated early in the organisation of any future ISTAP. The IUCN communication staff played a critical role in ensuring that the Panel had regular, updated access to all the relevant articles that appeared in the printed and online media, including items appearing in the local and regional, national and international press. The IUCN communications team was also responsible for communication with the press on the Panel\u2019s behalf, using different formats and media to promote public awareness of the Panel\u2019s existence as well as of its activities and recommendations, releasing all reports both in Portuguese and in English. To avoid undue duplication and mixed signals, the Panel Chair took responsibility for all direct substantive engagement with the press, while a targeted communication and outreach strategy optimised dissemination of the Panel\u2019s work to stakeholders by seeking forms for interaction that would reinforce the key messages. The editorial and layout experience of IUCN country and headquarters staff ensured the quality of the reports and their visual appeal. IUCN Members in Brazil and other parts of Latin America were consulted at the outset and informed about the progress Panel\u2019s work. Some Members expressed concern about a partnership with major mining companies in the wake of Brazil\u2019s worst environmental disaster, fearing consequences for IUCN\u2019s institutional integrity and reputation. However, the Panel Chair had impeccable credentials and was trusted by the environmental community. No formal objection was lodged. The Panel kept the international expert community and other stakeholders informed about their work through regular presentations at annual conferences of the International Association for Impact Assessment (IAIA), roundtables at the IUCN World Conservation Congress, and regional IUCN meetings. Panel members also participated in conferences to discuss their findings and stimulate broader awareness. Meetings in affected areas offered opportunities for representatives of the impacted communities to express their concerns.

Finally, the Panel\u2019s experience reinforced the critical importance for ISTAPs of listening to the people, communities, and organisations affected by the disaster, as well as analysts in research institutions, non-governmental organisation (NGOs), universities, and the media. Hearing from those who suffered the consequences of the dam collapse, as they explained their grievances, brought home the full weight of the tragedy as well as the difficulties they face in being heard by the institutions that should be responsible for their well-being. 4 SUPPORT FROM IUCN AND OTHER ACTORS 21 At the outset, the Renova Foundation was composed of a relatively small cadre of highly motivated, idealistic leaders, and specialists. But as the largest of the 42 programmes swung into action, and their associated funding increased, Renova grew into one of the region\u2019s largest employers. It was one of the few private organisations in the world to have been tasked with the restoration of a damaged ecosystem and economy after a major environmental and social catastrophe. Over time, Renova evolved as it sought to build a better operational structure and increase its capacity to deliver the 42 programmes. However, this led to increasing compartmentalisation along the lines set out in the TTAC, a factor that was subsequently reinforced as many of the programmes became subject to judicial review. Renova\u2019s exponential growth in addressing the TTAC\u2019s increasingly compartmentalised programmes made the Panel\u2019s work more complex. How to engage with the large number of technically specialised departments and promote an integrated landscape approach and a long-term vision in such a highly compartmentalised framework? 5 WORKING WITH RENOVA: LEARNING BY DOING Above: Restoration work on the church affected by mud in Paracatu de Baixo, Minas Gerais.

Photo: All rights reserved to NITRO Historias Visuais 22 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL In response to the emerging complexity and as new actors became involved, the Panel broadened its remit, offering independent technical and scientific recommendations to - and engaging with - a wider set of stakeholders. These included the CIF, some of the technical chambers that advise it, the public prosecutor\u2019s office, local governments, academic institutions, non-governmental organisations including some that were advising the affected communities, and the CBH-Doce. Renova\u2019s high staff turnover added another layer of complexity. This might have impeded continuity in stakeholder relations and threatened the institutional knowledge base. However, the Renova staff who served as go-betweens for relationships built over five years of Panel activities, remained more stable. From the outset, the Panel was connected to the Institutional Relations and Governance teams at Renova, whose staff and consultants were relatively constant throughout much of the period. They accompanied the Panel on field visits and assisted IUCN with the logistics and programming of face-to-face meetings. The Renova staff tasked with accompanying the Panel offered regular updates on key issues emerging during the restoration and informed the Panel on whether these issues remained relevant. While the Panel\u2019s objectives remained constant since the TTAC was signed, Renova had to adapt to new realities, and this led the Panel to modify its own strategy.

Photo: DIDA SAMPAIO / ESTAD\u00c3O CONTE\u00daDO 24 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL 6.1 SCALE AND COMPLEXITY The collapse of the Fund\u00e3o Dam was one of the largest and most complex human-made disasters in recent history. When the 39.2 million m3 of tailings flowed downstream into the Rio Doce, they affected land and human settlements along 670 km of river as well as extensive coastal and marine areas. The disaster had multiple direct and indirect impacts on physical and chemical conditions in the river, on the biota and their maintenance processes, and on the living conditions, economy and society of people living along the river and coastal areas. Given the complexity of the disaster, the vast amount of information generated, and controversies relating to the interpretation and understanding of the data, the Panel decided to rely exclusively on publicly available sources, with a preference for peer-reviewed journals. Many publications were devoted to the disaster, while volumes of consultancy studies were prepared for Renova, the public prosecutors\u2019 offices, and the courts. Much of this was made available online. To ensure independence and transparency, the Panel did not cite unpublished materials including those prepared for Renova and other entities. Renova and its parent companies questioned this approach since they had invested heavily in the research. However, much of this work had not been made publicly available and the Panel opted not to cite these sources. Nearly seven years have passed since the disaster, and there is still no comprehensive analysis of the environmental and socioeconomic impacts. Renova, the public prosecutors\u2019 office, and others have contracted a large number of studies, and peer-reviewed articles have been published in academic journals. But up to the time of this publication no overall synthesis has been published. Similarly, no overall assessment of the reparations has been carried out. The Renova website offers a month- by-month progress report on the programmes, but these have tended to focus on inputs and outputs (amounts spent, numbers of people employed, areas reforested, and so on) rather than on the achievement of the TTAC\u2019s long-term objectives of returning socio-environmental conditions to their pre-disaster condition. When the Panel was convened, therefore, its first priority was to prepare an overview of the situation in the Rio Doce Basin, applying the Panel members\u2019 specialist knowledge. The first thematic report (TR01 \u2013 S\u00e1nchez et al., 2018) synthesised the available information, providing an objective summary of the disaster together with background on the affected regions. Its general recommendations \u2013 which may well be applicable in other, similar situations \u2013 focused on the need for a comprehensive assessment of the impacts and the use of an adaptive management strategy. This latter should start with an evaluation of the mitigation programmes together with the potential threats \u2013 including climate change \u2013 that could undermine their expected outcomes. It also emphasised the importance of managing and disseminating knowledge gained from the disaster response. Subsequently, some of the recommendations conveyed by the initial thematic report were further developed \u2013 with agreement from Renova \u2013 while others were put aside. Renova or other primary stakeholders did not regard them as a priority, since they were prioritising the short-term goals needed to respond to the direct obligations of the TTAC. For example, the Panel saw adaptive management as essential to the long-term viability of the TTAC programmes, but this approach was rarely employed. The restoration effort appeared insufficiently flexible and unable to respond to the learning process required due to the uncertainties and impracticable timelines. Information management is another important theme in a complex post-disaster situation. The Panel offered to help Renova with the development of a strategy to manage the wealth of knowledge generated by the consultancy studies it had contracted as well as the natural and social science studies published by other organisations such as universities and research institutions. Panel members insisted that an effective strategy for knowledge management would be vital to ensure the legacy of the restoration. However, Renova had already decided to contract other consultants on knowledge management and was preparing to set up regional information centres. To avoid overlap, the Panel\u2019s proposal was dropped. 25 The Panel\u2019s recommendations were initially directed at Renova, though as per the Panel\u2019s ToC, they were also intended to influence government agencies and others involved in the restoration. Subsequently the Panel adapted to the complex and changing legal and institutional context and broadened the scope of its recommendations to engage with a range of other stakeholders.

This led to the involvement of federal government agencies, two state governments, the Public Prosecutors\u2019 offices in the two states and at least 40 municipal governments in the reparation. These governments and agencies will eventually have to take responsibility for the maintenance of the long-term programmes. As in other regions of Brazil, local government capacity is often severely constrained by the limited population in many municipalities. More than half the affected municipalities in MG, for instance, have less than 10,000 inhabitants. Local governments lack the resources to manage critical services, such as water supply, wastewater treatment, and the disposal of solid waste. Moreover, while everyone benefits from environmental services, they are not as visible as the community infrastructure that attracts votes, especially in small and rural municipalities. Toward the end of its tenure, the Panel aimed its advice not just at Renova but also at government agencies and the other stakeholders represented in the CIF and Technical Chambers (CT). The relations between Renova and the CIF/CT were often more adversarial than complementary, and this complicated efforts to engage effectively with all parties critical to restoration of the Rio Doce Basin. Further obstacles came from the fact that the TTAC was designed to facilitate a disaster response without waiting for the outcome of lengthy legal proceedings, but disagreements between Renova and the CIF/CT have regularly been referred to court. This led to uncertainty and delays in the restoration programmes. In 2020, the Panel decided to make recommendations on governance issues, focusing on the long-term legacy of restoration in the Rio Doce Basin. Drawing on experience from the Rio Doce and other post-disaster situations, the Panel focused on the need to start with a participatory approach that would allow a broad range of stakeholders \u2013 especially the people most directly affected \u2013 to share their vision for the Rio Doce Basin. Their \u2018buy-in\u2019 to a long-term vision was seen as essential to achieve consensus and commitment regarding the restoration and long-term improvement of the basin, and to eventually facilitate the handover of the programmes from Renova to the agencies that will be responsible for their long-term continuity once Renova\u2019s mandate has been fulfilled. In hindsight, it would have been better to initiate the governance review earlier, helping Renova and other key stakeholders (CIF and CT) to think about the reparation\u2019s long-term goals and the need for early engagement as part of a \u201cpolycentric governance\u201d strategy (Ostrom, 2010). But Renova had been conceived as a temporary arrangement, offering a rapid solution to the most immediate and pressing problems of the restoration. The government and other agencies are expected eventually to take over, continue, and complement the investments and programmes that had been initiated and financed by Renova. 6.2 THE LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT 26 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL One conceptual challenge faced by the Panel was to develop a workable framework for the ex post analysis of the disaster\u2019s environmental impacts. The conventional frameworks for environmental impact analysis (EIA) have primarily been developed for the ex ante determination of the potential impacts of investments, especially in infrastructure, extractive and industrial projects, where data is collected and analysed, and mitigation measures developed, before a project is started. In 2019, Renova\u2019s management team requested support with implementation of a recommendation from the first thematic report (S\u00e1nchez et al., 2018). In response, the Panel submitted a general framework for assessing the environmental and social impacts of disasters, which was well received. This issue paper (IP04 \u2013 S\u00e1nchez et al., 2019) encouraged Renova to establish an Impact Curatorship (Curadoria de Impactos). In 2021 Renova requested the Panel\u2019s help to develop a framework for assessing the impacts of the dam\u2019s collapse on coastal and marine areas. It was agreed that the scope would be limited to environmental impacts \u2013 which in themselves are extremely complex \u2013 and would not cover the social and economic impacts.

The Panel has had to look beyond these existing approaches, however, to develop a systematic, evidence-based framework for ex post EIA in other affected coastal and marine environments. In the study of impacts on coastal and marine areas, the Panel and Renova faced the challenge of working outside the conventional framework for EIA. The challenge was compounded by the absence of reliable data on the pre-disaster situation \u2013 for instance, information on critical areas such as water quality (physical, chemical and biological characteristics). Moreover, it is extremely difficult to distinguish the impacts of the Fund\u00e3o tailings from the cumulative, historical impacts from over 400 years of mining and industrial activity, deforestation of the basin, and contamination from agrochemicals, raw sewage and solid waste. The Panel was able to draw on the available data and were supported by IUCN staff to identify new sources of information from academic journals and other sources to draw inferences regarding the impact of the dam break on coastal and marine habitats. Based on this broad literature review, the Panel emphasised that impact analysis should focus on the medium- to long-term risks to the biota and to human health from dispersal and re-dispersal of the Fund\u00e3o tailings, rather than the immediate impacts after the dam break. 6.3 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ANALYSIS AND BASELINE DATA 27 The TTAC requires the restoration to return conditions to the pre-disaster state as it was in November 2015 (Clause 06.II). However, even if adequate data were available to characterise the ex ante environmental conditions, the Panel took the position that such a \u2018causal nexus\u2019 restriction would be neither feasible nor desirable. Instead, the Panel viewed the restoration as an opportunity to \u2018build back better\u2019, through a wide- ranging programme for the continual recovery of the Rio Doce Basin that could eventually be replicated in Brazil\u2019s other river basins and elsewhere. Renova had been organised to implement the programmes outlined in the TTAC, and the completion of these programmes was the Foundation\u2019s number one priority. However, the TTAC\u2019s emphasis on programme-by-programme implementation led to a compartmentalised approach, which made it more difficult to achieve an overall understanding of the disaster\u2019s impacts and to develop viable long-term solutions for the most chronic and critical impacts. From the start, however, the Panel argued for a more integrated strategy, one that would combine Landscape and S2S approaches. An S2S approach would enable a better understanding of the dynamics between the social, economic and environmental aspects. It would also focus more on the interrelationship between different environmental concerns, such as water quality, wastewater treatment, land use, biodiversity, livelihoods and human health, among others. The integration of Landscape and S2S approaches would therefore allow stakeholders to better understand and plan for the long-term restoration of the Rio Doce Basin, including attention to the estuary, coastal, and marine areas. These approaches should be understood not solely as a theoretical approach but as an innovative set of tools that can combine with participatory stakeholder engagement for an effective restoration plan. 6.4 ADOPTING SOURCE-TO-SEA AND LANDSCAPE APPROACHES 28 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL Below: Parts of the Rio Doce estuary, September 7, 2020.

Early on, however, the Panel did address some of the broader economic development issues in an innovative paper (IP01 \u2013 May et al., 2019), that suggested an alternative vision for the basin, based on more intensive, sustainable agriculture, rural tourism, the vertical integration of value chains, improved standards, and the development of a learning economy to be financed by permanent revolving funds.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e0cf2659-dc7f-4132-abed-1f849dd0f284": {"__data__": {"id_": "e0cf2659-dc7f-4132-abed-1f849dd0f284", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-meat-production-smallholder-farms-dehesas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ecological Footprint: meat production in smallholder farms, dehesas, Extremadura, Spain", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-meat-production-smallholder-farms-dehesas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6c2f66181d897fe7f9db127dc367dd2ea43b90d9290d38a624e873f43f20434d"}, "2": {"node_id": "e230f03f-8b42-4d93-ba5d-8417a97f040a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-meat-production-smallholder-farms-dehesas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f081d8129cf4f2b58cf0a2c0e01981ef5acabe31373b72378549e1001777124b"}}, "hash": "396cc3766dff9802057374ffa7998bbb50e8c03337b73d8030f89cd9d6396e62", "text": "A second issue paper (IP02 \u2013 Brito et al., 2019) argued that the restoration of inland and coastal fisheries would require a unified decision-making framework to determine when and how the responsible authorities could lift the fishing bans following their imposition in the wake of the disaster.

In principle, Renova responded positively to this idea, and put the approach into practice by involving local people to monitor water quality. Indeed, bulletins on Renova\u2019s website represent a positive example of how information from monitoring programmes can be obtained and presented in a way that is accessible and comprehensible to the general public. However, this citizen science approach did not go much further even though some of the directly affected communities, such as Degredo, a traditional Afro-Brazilian (quilombola) community on the ES coast, possessed the organisation and qualified professionals needed to permit more ambitious participatory monitoring programmes. These could have included the monitoring of flora and fauna, fisheries, and the quality and availability of ground and surface water. 6.5 SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS Below: Rio Doce Panel visiting Instituto Terra and its nursery of native plants used to restore the Rio Doce Basin.

Photo: All rights reserved to NITRO Historias Visuais 30 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL One of the most frequently repeated demands to the Panel, made by the affected population, was for better information about the disaster\u2019s impacts on physical and mental health. Such impacts are typically seen as a consequence of direct exposure to the tailings, to tailings dust, and to the contamination of water supplies. But human health can also be affected by the consumption of contaminated fish and irrigated vegetables, as well as the social and psychological impact of community displacement, loss of livelihoods and dependence on monthly indemnity payments to displaced households, fishers, artisanal miners, and other affected groups. The Panel recognised that an integrated treatment of human and ecosystem health would be beneficial for people affected by the disaster. This was thus a serious lacuna in the restoration process. Renova staff have tried to lay the groundwork for a programme of Integrated Environmental and Human Health Management (GAISMA). However, the judicial decisions have required that Renova treat these issues separately. As a result, this integration has been omitted from most remediation and restoration efforts over the seven years since the dam break. The Panel did, however, draw attention to the continued need for an integrative perspective. For example, its final Issue Paper recommended the One Health approach (IP05 \u2013 Alonso et al., 2020). This approach shows how best to coordinate programmes, policies, legislation and research in order to unlock collaboration between the human and animal health and ecosystem conservation sectors, thereby improving public health. IP05 addressed the wider links between human health and the environment, recommending support for public health monitoring and the exchange of information between the formal public health system (SUS, from Portuguese acronym Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade) and organisations in the fields of community and environmental health. These recommendations were not immediately taken up, but public health was later included as a priority theme in the TTAC\u2019s renegotiation. Additional studies would provide a more complete assessment of the disaster\u2019s impacts on human health in the areas most directly affected, but they remain stymied due to dissent in the judicial arena. 6.6 HEALTH IMPACTS Below: Group of people on a boat at the mouth of the Rio Doce.

One critical theme that was not tackled was how to manage the tailings deposited in the river, on the floodplain and \u2013 most of all \u2014 in the reservoir of the Risoleta Neves (Candonga) hydropower plant.

Photo: IUCN/ Rio Doce Panel archive 32 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL When the Panel began its work, it did not prioritise the potential cumulative impacts from tailings deposition and sediment flows on the marine and freshwater biota, but it was agreed that, should the need arise, additional expertise would be sought, either through an external consultant or by adding an extra member to the Panel. As discussed above, however, Renova later sought the Panel\u2019s advice on how to better understand and manage the environmental impacts on the coastal and marine areas. Meanwhile, Renova had contracted a detailed assessment and monitoring of biota in the estuary and adjacent coastal region to a consortium of universities and scientific researchers in Esp\u00edrito Santo, along with parallel studies by the Brazilian Foundation for Sustainable Development (FBDS) and consultants assigned by UNESCO. The emerging complexity and conflicting scientific findings from these overlapping studies pointed to the continued risk from deposition of the tailings. Given the lack of a common basis for describing and assessing impacts, and the need to systematise impacts into a common structure, Renova and the Panel agreed to work on the development of a systematic framework that would enable interpretation of the results generated by these and other studies.

This suspicion has been compounded by the pressure to take decisions and implement them in a timely fashion, since the disaster deprived people of essential environmental services, such as potable water, fisheries and housing. Here, the Panel offers some general suggestions that might be useful for future ISTAPs and Rio Doce stakeholders to help prioritise issues, achieve consensus and implement sustainable, efficient and long-term solutions. 34 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL Left: Aerial view of the Rio Doce below the city bridge.

All rights reserved to NITRO Historias Visuais 35 The effects of the Fund\u00e3o Dam disaster were complex and the process of recovery has to be sustainable in the long run. To ensure such results, the process itself is as important as the outcomes. Thus, successful engagement with government and civil society is key to a sustainable and lasting restoration. The Panel focused its work on issues that contribute to the long- term sustainability of the basin and its inhabitants. To achieve long-term sustainability, these issues depend on successful intervention and engagement with local and regional institutions. Man-made and natural disasters can have devastating impacts on the local population, their economies and social infrastructure, but they can also offer an opportunity for longer-term improvement. Recovery is not simply a return to prior conditions. The opportunities should be mapped and planned with input from diverse stakeholders \u2013 especially those that have been most directly affected \u2013 to achieve a common vision for the future. The full benefits of a shared vision may not be felt for decades. The socioeconomic benefits of changes to economic structure, education, and sanitation may not be felt in the short term, but in the long term they are essential for the continual improvement of the environment, economy and social conditions.

Consultation and engagement are key to achieve a shared vision and to the development of viable programmes with an exit strategy that will ensure the restoration\u2019s continuity and sustainability. Such investments may not have immediately visible results, but they are essential for human and ecosystem health. When adapted to the specific realities of other regions and countries, this model could be applied to most post-disaster scenarios. It could also be adapted to major investments in infrastructure or extractive projects. A participatory process may appear more complex and time-consuming, but it is the only way to guarantee a process of continual improvement that will satisfy the expectations and needs of the people affected. In the Rio Doce case, affected communities were not involved in drawing up the TTAC or in the subsequent decision- making, and this has exacerbated the mistrust and conflicts generated throughout the restoration. Some of this was inevitable, but it could have been lessened by more effective engagement with the different groups of people affected. In the immediate aftermath of disaster, short-term solutions are required to cover people\u2019s immediate needs, reinstating access to potable water, energy supply and housing. Once this has been achieved, and people\u2019s confidence restored through short-term actions, it becomes necessary to start thinking more strategically. This requires longer-term process-oriented programmes that allow for continual improvement. Even shorter-term restoration activities should encourage participation and 7.1 PROMOTE A LONG-TERM, SHARED VISION FOR CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT Below: In the image, a person driving a boat at the mouth of the Rio Doce.

By producing rapid results and \u2018quick wins\u2019, engagement can build trust between the different stakeholders. The Panel consistently recommended the need for affected people to have the opportunity to participate in decisions about the restoration. In the case of the Fund\u00e3o Dam disaster, the decision-making structure established under the TTAC led to drawn-out discussions that extended from federal and state government agencies to the public prosecutors and eventually to the judiciary. It lacked the mechanisms that would allow greater participation by those most directly affected, thus limiting their engagement and commitment to the restoration programmes. Participation is not easy \u2013 but if decision- making is done only by the existing governmental bureaucracy, then it becomes more difficult to empower society and to achieve the long-term changes needed for \u2018building back better\u2019. In the beginning, the Panel focused on making recommendations to Renova. As time went on, however, the Panel realised the importance of engaging with other stakeholders, since different actors had to be involved to achieve lasting results through a more participatory process. One of the lessons that may be applicable to other ISTAPs, therefore, is not to focus exclusively on one or more specific stakeholders, but to share the recommendations more widely and engage directly with all the relevant stakeholders. The Panel had been slow to work with agencies other than Renova, but during the preparation of TR02 (May et al., 2020) Renova expressed its discomfort with managing issues related to climate change. This helped the Panel appreciate the importance of engaging with a broader group of actors. Below: Rio Doce Panel and IUCN secretariat during internal meeting during visit to the Rio Doce Basin.

This underscores an important issue for future ISTAPs. Their need for independence prevents them from acting as an intermediary between business or government agencies and the people directly affected. However, an ISTAP should be able to recognise the concerns of affected people, give voice to their aspirations, and encourage the relevant agencies to engage with them more effectively. 7.2 RECOGNISE THE POWER OF LEADERSHIP AND COLLABORATION Right: Yolanda Kakabadse, Chair of the Rio Doce Panel, during the launching of the 5th article of the series Issue Paper. Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais. March 2020. Photo: IUCN/Rio Doce Panel archive 38 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL 7.3 LOOK FOR INTEGRATED, MULTIDISCIPLINARY SOLUTIONS The desire for quick results may lead to the compartmentalisation of discussions and solutions, rather than calling for an integrated approach and acknowledging the complexity of the situation and the wide range of stakeholders. Many restoration issues are in fact connected and the existence of parallel structures can interfere with one another. For example, if the water is contaminated, then the fish may also be contaminated, with implications for people\u2019s livelihoods, nutrition, and health. This is obvious, but when different departments or agencies are responsible for water quality, biota, public health and the economy, it becomes more difficult to attain an integrated approach. The responses of different agencies may even contradict one another as in the case of the fisheries ban discussed in IP02 (Brito et al., 2019). Technical discussions can get lost in minor details that impede the search for effective solutions when they should be considered together, taking a broader landscape perspective to address issues that affect local welfare. The Panel consistently stressed the value of a landscape approach, rather than compartmentalised solutions. Renova did not fully internalise this view, but other stakeholders did acknowledge the need for integrated solutions to the chronic problems facing the Rio Doce Basin and associated coastal and marine areas. In this respect, the Panel played an important role, presenting the S2S approach together with landscape perspectives in a specific thematic report focused on the integration of biodiversity and water quality (TR03 \u2013 Brito et al., 2021). The S2S framework is a practical approach that has been tried and tested, not only in the Fund\u00e3o case, but also in other similar situations. The S2S principle could be applied elsewhere to restore and improve the environmental, social, and economic situation of a disaster-affected region. The impact analysis and the design of medium and long-term measures should avoid a piecemeal approach. Instead, they should adopt a broader perspective, combining landscape and S2S approaches from the start. This makes it easier to respond to the environmental, social, financial, economic, and cultural aspects of the affected region. The approach encompasses not only the spatial dimension (terrestrial and/or coastal areas), but also key flows \u2013 water, biota, sediment, pollutants, materials and ecosystem services. The S2S concept was first introduced by the Panel in its Issue Paper No. 3 (IP03 - Barbosa et al., 2019), in which it was proposed that Renova consider installing a permanent floodgate in the Rio Pequeno to protect waters of the Juparan\u00e3 lake \u2013 an important water source in the lower Rio Doce \u2013 from pollution by the Rio Doce in flooding conditions. The floodgate would have an opening and closing system to control the volume of water in rainy and dry periods to ensure connectivity between ecosystems. The affected territory covers a vast area in two Brazilian states, with distinct social, economic, and cultural characteristics. Both states have been degraded by centuries of extractive activities, unsustainable agricultural practices and contamination with raw sewage and solid waste. Rather than seeking a return to the pre-disaster situation as a baseline, it would be better to seek a negotiated solution that would improve conditions and kick-start a process of continual improvement in the region. This requires engagement with all the relevant parties. The Panel addressed the baseline considerations in TR04 (Maroun et al., 2021) and acknowledged the vital importance of a common vision for the region\u2019s future rather than a return to the pre-disaster conditions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9a6c6aec-faf9-495d-8ec9-3d52022c3e47": {"__data__": {"id_": "9a6c6aec-faf9-495d-8ec9-3d52022c3e47", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-meat-production-smallholder-farms-dehesas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ecological Footprint: meat production in smallholder farms, dehesas, Extremadura, Spain", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-meat-production-smallholder-farms-dehesas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d9399d4f3da2f6951c2a00a96e67fbc3213458d582110437506e4d9eecea6375"}, "2": {"node_id": "caf104cc-13cb-45c6-a8dc-f9a26f66ae83", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-meat-production-smallholder-farms-dehesas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "64a486c103bd716cddf89b233e105387b5b7d44f5679bd8eb522b9b4bd93263c"}}, "hash": "12bcef35a88851795e4c4d5741466cf0136ac867b76378671e2596d3bf24c914", "text": "This recommendation was discussed with various stakeholders, but in retrospect the Panel should have highlighted the importance of this approach from the start.

The Panel also recommended that Renova support the establishment of a long-term fiduciary fund to finance continued efforts in the basin (IP01 \u2013 May et al., 2019) investing some of the resources originally intended for reparation. However, Renova rejected the concept on the grounds that it was not consistent with the mandate for immediate and short-term results. However, landscape analysis by Renova, UNESCO, the World Resources Institute (WRI), and other organisations have recommended that additional resources be directed toward a broader basin-level approach, including systematic analysis of the long-term development scenarios. 39 7.5 CONSIDER CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGHOUT The climate emergency threatens ecosystems and human well-being. Emerging diseases, water rationing, droughts, and floods will become more frequent in the coming years. Fundamental changes to the economy and social values will be vital to avoid and manage these challenges. Climate change is likely to aggravate the degradation of fragile and degraded landscapes such as the Rio Doce Basin. Restoration plans and programmes should share a common climate strategy, covering both assessment and adaptation to the effects of climate change. The Panel needed to persuade Renova that climate change issues were within its remit. Renova had been doubtful on the grounds that, first, climate change would only impact the region in the distant future, and second, that the impacts of climate change were distinct from those caused by the dam collapse. This underscores the tension between the short and long term, and between the causal impacts of the dam collapse and the need to address the underlying environmental conditions. Renova and its Board of Directors strongly contested the idea, for example, that climate change could be the cause of the extraordinary storm and rainfall events associated with the repeated deposition of tailings along the river. The Panel insisted that the theme was relevant and discussed its recommendations from TR02 (May et al., 2020) with different stakeholders. The process of restoration should consider the long-term governance of the affected region, noting that permanent institutions and those responsible for the restoration may have overlapping and complementary roles to play. The restoration programmes have generated studies, data, information systems, and especially capacity to execute restoration actions, but these may be lost if they are not integrated into the permanent structures of governance for the maintenance of nature\u2019s services. In principle, there should be a balance between tasks assigned to the restoration programme\u2019s institutions and to the long-term, permanent institutions that will eventually continue the restoration\u2019s programmes and investments. Both CIF and Renova have engaged with permanent institutions such as the Rio Doce Watershed Committee, universities, and NGOs in the area, viewing them as valuable sources of expertise. Similarly, the Panel also prioritised permanent institutions when it reached out to other groups of stakeholders. Early on, the Panel completed a stakeholder mapping and analysis of the impacted region (see discussion of the Panel\u2019s ToC, above), allowing the Panel to understand which permanent institutions might manage selected programmes in the longer-term. During the preparation of the thematic report on governance (TR04 - Maroun et al., 2021), this analysis was updated to include a broader range of stakeholders. Key findings were also discussed with various institutions beyond Renova. The key lesson for other ISTAPs is to initiate a process of stakeholder mapping at the outset and to update it regularly. This will provide clear understanding of the governance roles of each actor or agency in the affected region. Understanding the involvement of these actors is fundamental to the early integration of restoration efforts, guaranteeing continuity and long-term improvement. 7.4 ENGAGE AND EMPOWER THE PERMANENT INSTITUTIONS Right: In the image, a stretch of the Rio Doce near its mouth.

This offers the opportunity for feedback and discussion and allows Panel members to learn from comparative perspectives and other cases, as well as permitting the Panel to share its work and insights with different stakeholders. To what extent should the Panel be involved in the definition of solutions and moving them forward?

Panel members met in person twice a year and held videoconferences at the end of every month. This helped to maintain the Panel\u2019s cohesion and the quality of interaction between its members. It also kept them up to date on the development of the thematic reports and issue papers and the reparation process itself. The Panel also held debriefing sessions following meetings and systematised the relevant information for use in subsequent analyses. Panel members met with the Chair at the end of each face-to-face meeting to evaluate each other\u2019s performance and consider future pathways. Panel members also found it useful to divide into core groups when developing drafts of the thematic reports and issue papers. However, Panel members found it difficult to review these products if more than one paper was being prepared simultaneously. Future ISTAPs are advised to discuss and consider this balance and to review it from time to time, considering the expertise of the Panel members and the need for their participation in selected documents. ISTAPs are also advised to generate shorter, more concise products, even carefully presented intermediate products, rather than high- quality, professionally edited reports that are outdated by the time they are presented.

Photo: All rights reserved to NITRO Historias Visuais 41 FINAL CONSIDERATIONS In the wake of the Fund\u00e3o tailings Dam collapse, the establishment of the Rio Doce Panel under the aegis of an institution as credible as IUCN helped to bring independent, impartial, landscape and long-term perspectives to the restoration of the affected area. The negotiations around the restoration and related processes were often extremely complex, since the multiple actors were often suspicious of each other and held distinct and often conflicting views. Moreover, the discussions tended to focus on specific, compartmentalised concerns. Despite the need for short-term solutions to respond to people\u2019s immediate needs, it is also essential to think about solutions to the long-term impacts caused by disaster. An ISTAP can influence the process by highlighting the need for a long-term, integrated perspective, even if implementation of the recommendations is neither direct nor immediate. An ISTAP\u2019s influence may not be felt immediately by stakeholders in a disaster restoration, but it does endure. ISTAPs can also influence important processes indirectly. One of the Panel\u2019s main legacies was the publication of impartial and independent analysis and technical advice that could be used by actors in different contexts, beyond that of the restoration of the Rio Doce watershed. By publishing thematic reports and issue papers throughout its five years of operation, the Panel contributed to discussions to change practices in the sector and to mainstream global concerns, such as climate change. 42 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL In the image, parts of the Rio Doce estuary. Renova Foundation. September 7, 2020. Photo: All rights reserved to NITRO Historias Visuais The Panel\u2019s recommendations were grounded in globally relevant scientific literature, and they reflected a long-term approach and landscape perspective. This can be adapted to similar disaster situations, whose frequency is increasing rapidly with climate change. The Panel\u2019s process for developing recommendations was as important as the recommendations themselves. Knowledge of topics and methodologies that would never have been considered without participation of an ISTAP became widely disseminated in the process of consultation with stakeholders.

March 2019. Photo: IUCN/Rio Doce Panel archive FOREWORD The socio-environmental and economic tragedy caused by the Fund\u00e3o dam failure in the city of Mariana (in the state of Minas Gerais) caused impacts that remain seven years later. Still, it is also important to recognise that many initiatives were \u2013 and continue to be \u2013 adopted successfully. Dealing with the biggest mining event of its kind on the planet required organised efforts proportional to the magnitude of the damage caused by the dam failure. This led to the signing of Terms of Transaction and Conduct Adjustment (TTAC, Termo de Transa\u00e7\u00e3o e Ajustamento de Conduta) and the adoption of a complex governance model, in which the Renova Foundation is the executing institution. In this context, an independent panel of specialists was established, called the Rio Doce Panel and linked to IUCN, one of the oldest and most respected non-governmental entities in the world devoted to the conservation of nature and the protection of the environment, with a history of significant achievements. The creation of the Panel, a group composed of experts from Brazil and abroad under the coordination of Yolanda Kakabadse \u2013 a former environment minister of Ecuador and internationally respected conservation leader and policy maker \u2013 was extremely relevant from an institutional perspective, as the Panel would act autonomously and independently and advise decision-makers involved in the governance system behind the reparation process. Thematic reports prepared by the Panel outlined expertise and best international practices for the reparation of areas, which had been affected by tragedies similar to the Fund\u00e3o Dam failure. The reports also enabled an ambience of reflection that would have been impossible within the Foundation\u2019s day-to-day work and immense pressure from repressed demands, court-mandated responsibilities, and dysfunctional aspects of their internal and external governance. By enabling discussions on essential topics and producing high-level technical-scientific documents, the Panel has provided a set of inputs to assist the Renova Foundation in remedying the disaster\u2019s damage. By bringing a new and outside perspective, the Panel contributed to the Foundation and other actors in decision-making, complementing the existing work, strengthening strategic planning, and expanding the Foundation\u2019s thinking on the best available alternatives to address the region\u2019s socio-environmental and economic problems, taking into account, primarily, the assistance to those affected and the environmental recovery in the areas of water quality and biodiversity. The Panel always conducted its interdisciplinary work in an integrated fashion and in coordination with the various stakeholders involved in restoring the Rio Doce. In this important document, the Panel shares its reflections and lessons learned during its five years of work. Together with IUCN, the Panel leaves behind it an important legacy for current and future reparations, in view of the long-term nature of these actions. Jos\u00e9 Carlos Carvalho Former Minister of Environment, Brazil V Independent Scientific and Technical Advisory Panels (ISTAPs) have been established to help address a range of controversial conservation and development issues that have emerged with growing frequency and complexity at national and global levels. This report is intended to contribute to discussion of ways to improve the effectiveness of ISTAPs by outlining lessons learned by the Rio Doce Panel, an ISTAP set up in the wake of the 2015 Fund\u00e3o iron tailings Dam collapse, widely considered one of Brazil\u2019s worst environmental disasters. The multidisciplinary seven-member Panel worked from September 2017 to December 2022 following its establishment under a joint agreement between the Renova Foundation, which was created to restore socio-environmental conditions after the disaster, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Working in a complex and often adversarial governance system, the Panel evolved over time from focusing on restoration to looking at the broader implications of environmental management of the basin and the wider Rio Doce catchment area, as well as engaging with a broader array of stakeholders.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8b4e5667-5c38-4a82-9ef3-31aca711b4e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "8b4e5667-5c38-4a82-9ef3-31aca711b4e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-fruit-and-vegetables-menorcas-custodia-agraria", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ecological Footprint: fruit and vegetables from Menorca\u2019s Cust\u00f2dia Agr\u00e0ria programme", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-fruit-and-vegetables-menorcas-custodia-agraria", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d5b03faab277222aadb38df89140a10ceac3d4d51548623115b5dd15f4e983f3"}, "2": {"node_id": "cf0ffe51-72af-4c2d-a696-ec4744063a89", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-fruit-and-vegetables-menorcas-custodia-agraria", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "32245da1a8514a305f0617808fc19a9b906869b9265de4dbf3082a30bcb57bac"}}, "hash": "05342a5f6dd35c4bc33f1ee7930c2bb4e184cd6226af7be54afc2ac6c4f85c39", "text": "The Panel\u2019s recommendations were based on three complementary perspectives: a long-term vision, a landscape approach, and the application of Nature-based Solutions (NbS).

These are areas where IUCN\u2019s global leadership and expertise is widely recognised. The lessons learned in the project include the importance of achieving a long-term, shared vision for the continual improvement of the basin and affected region; the need for effective leadership and collaboration; the identification and application of integrated, multidisciplinary solutions; the empowerment of permanent institutions; and systematic consideration of the implications of climate change. The Panel sought to influence the long-term outcomes of the restoration through its written recommendations and direct engagement with key stakeholders. Although the uptake of the Panel\u2019s recommendations has been neither direct nor immediate, its influence in the region is likely to have a greater effect in the long-term.

The dam contained around 52 million cubic meters (m3) of iron mining residues from the Samarco mining company\u2019s Germano Complex, jointly owned by two of the largest multinational mining corporations, Vale S.A and BHP Billiton (BHP). Reportedly, 39.2 million m3 of these tailings washed into the Santar\u00e9m reservoir, immediately below the dam, creating a wave of liquid mud that poured into the Gualaxo do Norte and do Carmo rivers, both headwaters of the Rio Doce. The mass of liquified tailings tore away soil, vegetation and sediments from the upper reaches of the river, affecting around 2,000 hectares belonging to some 200 rural properties and destroying 1,469 hectares of natural vegetation. The mud and debris demolished the villages of Bento Rodrigues and Paracatu de Baixo, damaging homes and community infrastructure further downstream in Gesteira and Barra Longa. The tailings also reached the Rio Doce estuary, 670 km below the dam, and created a plume, which spread along extensive coastal and marine areas, particularly along the shallow coastal platform. The disaster claimed 19 lives and physically displaced at least 320 families. As a consequence of the disaster, Samarco\u2019s iron ore extraction activities were halted for five years,1 and fishing remains banned in much of the basin, affecting employment and food security. Those displaced from the communities by the wave of mud were provided with temporary housing in Mariana and other urban areas in the basin, a situation that has lasted up to the time of this publication. Right after the disaster, local governments were forced to cut off the public supplies of water obtained from the Rio Doce and its tributaries, and to substitute them using tank trucks to deliver water to people in many of the towns and rural communities located downstream. In an effort to mitigate the impacts and restore the areas affected by the Fund\u00e3o Dam collapse, the Brazilian Federal Government, the States of Minas Gerais and Esp\u00edrito Santo, Samarco, Vale and BHP signed a detailed agreement on 2 March 2016, known as the Terms of Transaction and Conduct Adjustment (TTAC). 1 In late 2020, Samarco received the environmental licenses required to restart its iron mining, ore concentration and transport along a 400 km slurry pipeline, and pelletising operations at a port facility which it had installed in the late 1970s near Vit\u00f3ria, the state capital of Esp\u00edrito Santo. By mid-2022, the company had returned to 26 percent of its prior operating capacity. Samarco no longer deposits its coarse tailings behind dams but is drying and piling them for eventual use as construction materials. The fine tailings are being stored in an exhausted open pit. 1. WHY WAS THE RIO DOCE PANEL CREATED? Left: Inspection carried out by Ibama in July 2016 on the stretch affected by the collapse of the Samarco mining company\u2019s tailings dam in Mariana, Minas Gerais. Photo: Felipe Werneck/Ibama 1 The TTAC set out 42 programmes for reparation and compensation, and established an independent entity called the Renova Foundation to create, manage, and implement these programmes. Samarco\u2018s parent companies \u2013 Vale and BHP \u2013 would finance Renova, while an Inter-Federative Committee (CIF) would oversee the restoration process. The CIF included representatives from federal and state government agencies as well as municipal governments, representatives of affected populations and the civil society organisations that provide them with technical assistance. Together, Renova and the CIF were made formally responsible for the restoration, in consultation with affected communities. The idea of installing a specialist panel to provide independent technical advice on the restoration process took shape in the two years following the disaster. The objective proposed by the leadership of Renova and Samarco\u2019s parent companies was to identify global corporate best practices and science- based perspectives on the restoration. In December 2015, BHP staff members consulted with various international organisations that were concerned about the environmental and social impacts of the Fund\u00e3o Dam collapse.

They can help multiple stakeholders understand situations characterised by complexity, uncertainty, and cost and can contribute to effective and efficient decision- making. Organisations which have recently created such groups include the Global Environment Facility\u2019s Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP), the World Health Organization\u2019s Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee (STAC), and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change\u2019s Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP). Such panels are typically convened under conditions of uncertainty. The number of unforeseen environmental disasters has been growing, for example, linked to climate change, extinctions, ozone depletion, mine- tailing dam collapses, and more. Advisory panels are also a regular feature of complex infrastructure projects. Other IUCN panels have been set up to address the impacts of major oil and gas investments in Nigeria (IUCN Niger Delta Panel) and in Russia (IUCN Western Gray Whale Advisory Panel).3 Although some IUCN Members saw partnership with mining enterprises as contrary to the reputational 2 IUCN (2014), Procedures for establishing and managing IUCN-supported Independent Scientific & Technical Advisory Panels, https://iucn.org/sites/default/files/2022-11/iucn_istap_procedures_2014.pdf 3 See: https://www.iucn.org/western-gray-whale-advisory-panel and https://www.iucn.org/theme/business-and-biodiversity/our-work/business- partnerships-projects/shell/iucn-niger-delta-panel 4 The Brumadinho disaster led to 270 deaths, mostly employees of Vale who were in the company cafeteria located immediately below the dam when it collapsed upon them. 5 Global Tailings Review (2020) \u2013 Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management - https://globaltailingsreview.org/global-industry-standard/ - IUCN was part of the Tailings Review Advisory Group interests of the organisation, there was widespread support for \u2013 and acceptance of \u2013 the effort to achieve better results from the restoration. The reputational risk became more obvious after the occurrence of a second major dam collapse at Brumadinho in January of 2019, which caused many more deaths than the Fund\u00e3o disaster.4 IUCN followed the response to this new crisis closely: Why had the same mining enterprise (Vale) not learned enough in the three years following the Fund\u00e3o Dam failure to prevent further disasters? An international inquiry sparked by Brumadinho led to the adoption of new standards for the management of tailings dams and for restoration efforts after future ruptures (Oberle 2020).5 The effectiveness of ISTAPs is strongly associated with their credibility as arbiters or scientific/technical specialists, whose salience or recognised prominence in the fields is perceived as relevant to the issues at hand as well as their legitimacy in the eyes of principal stakeholders to offer advice on these complex matters (Cash et al., 2003). Furthermore, based upon its experience with other such Panels, IUCN recognises that \u2013 to be effective \u2014 an ISTAP should operate according to four general principles: independence, transparency, accountability, and engagement. These principles apply to all IUCN-supported ISTAPs (IUCN, 2014). While the generic principles for advisory panels (Cash et al., 2003) address criteria similar to those adopted by IUCN, the latter put greater emphasis on the need for independence from external influences while maintaining accountability to affected groups.

In the past two decades, IUCN has refined its ISTAP model to provide companies and other stakeholders with credible, relevant, and legitimate technical advice. According to IUCN (2021): \u201cISTAPs are established with the formal designation of a group of experts, who engage in provision of scientific and/or technical advice on a specific biodiversity conservation or natural resource management issue. Typically, the recipient of the advice is one or more business entities or public authorities.

October, 2018. Photo: IUCN/Rio Doce Panel archive 5 3 THE CREATION AND OPERATION OF THE RIO DOCE PANEL The first step in establishing the Panel was to select its chair through an international recruitment process that took place in parallel with the development of the Panel\u2019s terms of reference7 (TORs). This process took nearly a full year to complete and involved regular consultation with the leadership of the Renova Foundation. Given IUCN\u2019s principal conservation mission, the Panel focused on environmental remediation and the restoration of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. It also considered impact assessment and monitoring, and the relation between ecosystems and livelihoods, as well as human and ecosystem health in the affected communities. 7 Terms of Reference for the Rio Doce Panel are available at https://www.iucn.org/sites/default/files/2022-10/rio-doce-istap-terms-of-reference_updated_2020jan.pdf 6 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL These themes were compatible with the Panel\u2019s objectives, as defined by its TOR and FAQ,8 of making recommendations at a long-term, landscape scale and calling attention to NbS. The Panel\u2019s specific focus was to examine the impacts of the disaster on the environment and natural resources. The Panel\u2019s remit did not cover issues that had been referred to the courts, such as indemnification payments and relocation, or the management and disposal of the tailings and other engineering issues. Detailed discussion of the generic safety of tailings dams was also excluded since this was seen as an issue for the technical specialists engaged in the international review of dam safety. Central issues included biodiversity, basin management, water resources, fisheries and NbS, since IUCN is widely recognised for its global leadership and expertise in these areas. 8 Frequently Asked Questions regarding the Rio Doce Panel are available at www.iucn.org/riodocepanel. Above: Panel visits the area of Fund\u00e3o. October 2018. Photo: IUCN/Rio Doce Panel archive 7 Independence is central to the Panel\u2019s operating principles, but some stakeholders had questions. To what extent could the Panel avoid manipulation and co-optation given its institutional proximity and financial dependence on Renova? Any ISTAP created in the context of disaster reparation is liable to face this question. The answer is that the Rio Doce Panel \u2013 following the lead of previous IUCN ISTAPs \u2013 has engaged in a way that is independent, transparent and accountable to all the stakeholders involved. Although its role is advisory, the Panel is not beholden to Renova or to Samarco\u2019s shareholders and parent companies. Any real or potential conflict of interest is addressed through IUCN procedures and best practice. A thorough conflict of interest verification is conducted on a regular basis, for example, to ensure that Panel members do not personally benefit from their work. These principles have been explicit during Panel consultations in the Rio Doce Basin. 8 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL The aim of the Panel therefore was to provide independent expert advice and guidance to Renova and other entities involved in the long-term governance of the Rio Doce Basin.

The Panel needed to navigate these shifts while retaining its independence. The Panel initially assumed that it would respond primarily to Renova\u2019s needs, but this assumption was tested as policies changed and as relations shifted between Renova and other parties. Many \u2013 if not most \u2013 of the Panel\u2019s recommendations were then developed to include other governmental stakeholders such as the two state governments and the Rio Doce Watershed Committee (CBH-Doce). Over time, the Panel gradually put more effort into communicating its work and stimulating debate among the emerging primary stakeholders. This was essential, because these stakeholders would be responsible for maintenance of the socio-environmental health and revival of the basin\u2019s economy once Renova\u2019s work was finished.

Such issues had to be openly discussed among stakeholders. Panel members found the interdisciplinary composition and diversity of their professional backgrounds to be an asset. However, for a multidisciplinary panel of this kind to function effectively, it was essential that key decisions be reached through consensus. This required Panel members to listen carefully, respect the opinions of others, follow formal protocols, and make an effort to comprehend the technical issues from the perspective of other disciplines. This was particularly important in the finalisation of the analyses and recommendations set out in the thematic reports and issues papers, which IUCN published under the co-authorship of the Chair and all the Panel members, even though each report had its respective lead author. The need for consensus meant fewer documents were published, since publication required a time-consuming process of internal and external peer review, comment, and re-editing. However, the need for consensus also meant that arguments were more balanced, and the writing more carefully crafted. Although changes in the composition of the Panel occurred during the five-year period of activities for varied reasons, this did not affect the methodology adopted for tripartite teamwork on each paper, though it did cause some delay in delivery timelines. However, it may have influenced the selection of topics and the focus of some of the papers without interrupting the overall programme. The Panel made an early decision to differentiate its products into two types of reports. The first were issue papers (IP), which were relatively short, produced more rapidly, and focused on specific concerns facing the restoration. The second were thematic reports (TRs), which went into greater depth, were longer, and had a broader scope. The Panel Chair guided the process of deciding themes and asking Panel members whether they would participate in the core groups responsible for the initial drafts of technical reports and issue papers. All Panel members played an active role in discussing the relevance of possible topics, which were subsequently selected based on specific criteria such as the knowledge and experience of Panel members. Panel members were expected to dedicate time from their already busy individual schedules to the work of the Panel. They met virtually each month, and face-to- face twice a year in the affected region. During the face- to-face gatherings, Panel members visited locations and communities affected by the disaster, as well as restoration sites, to understand the issues first hand and to follow the progress of restoration. When Panel members attended seminars, conferences and other institutional meetings related to the restoration, they did so as Panel representatives and accessed resources from the Panel budget. 12 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL The Panel was governed by its detailed ToRs, codes of conduct and its Theory of Change (ToC). At an early stage in its work, the Panel enunciated an initial version of its ToC that set up outcome indicators and a strategy to monitor the uptake of its recommendations by the primary and secondary stakeholders of the restoration programmes under Renova\u2019s responsibility. The primary or secondary stakeholders were defined as \u201cMain Stakeholders, Policymakers, Influencers and Do- ers\u201d. The categories were sometimes overlapping and may have referred to entities with multiple roles in the restoration. BOX 2 \u2013 THE PANEL TARGET AUDIENCES Main Stakeholders Renova Foundation, CIF and its technical chambers Policymakers Federal, state and municipal governments, Basin committees, state agencies and regulatory institutions, legislature, judiciary and Public Prosecutor\u2019s office Influencers Universities and research institutes, national and international corporations, advisors to the judiciary, and to the Public Prosecutor\u2019s office DO-ers Affected people and its technical advisors, representative associations, private companies in the basin and NGOs working in the restoration process According to the ToC, Main stakeholders include organisations which were created in response to the disaster and which are a key part of the reparation\u2019s governance structure, such as the Renova Foundation, CIF and its Technical Chambers. Policymakers also deal directly with the consequences of the Fund\u00e3o Dam rupture and are part of the governance structure, but they have a broader scope of action and attributions beyond the reparation. Examples include the three Brazilian levels of government (federal, state, and municipal), basin committees, regulatory institutions, and legislative, judiciary and the public prosecutor. Influencers included active civil society and social movements within the region, as well as the media and higher educational institutions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68da7d0d-d345-486f-aff8-6debee719c70": {"__data__": {"id_": "68da7d0d-d345-486f-aff8-6debee719c70", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-fruit-and-vegetables-menorcas-custodia-agraria", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ecological Footprint: fruit and vegetables from Menorca\u2019s Cust\u00f2dia Agr\u00e0ria programme", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-fruit-and-vegetables-menorcas-custodia-agraria", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1f05cee546c9ed1077874185fa628358f5d3a778a9c762f982dc3e30002816a4"}, "2": {"node_id": "4b4ff6d3-9bfe-4d73-b272-4104c9762724", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-fruit-and-vegetables-menorcas-custodia-agraria", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2150742e743bb3f5c3084ea5d9991f6902b6ac3ce98148fb3319d5c0f39a874a"}}, "hash": "dc493c693022db4f4a27da8d1486bd33ad0072133ad2ad3aaca41f60fc6b725a", "text": "Lastly, the ToC defines Do-ers as those which used natural resources and which were directly affected by the disaster.

The Panel used a tailored approach to present the recommendations to main stakeholders and policymakers, promoting in-depth meetings, discussions, and joint events. Similarly, to ensure that the recommendations reached a broader audience, such as influencers, the Panel organised webinars and participated in scientific events. The Panel expected these strategies to foster engagement and bring the stakeholders to a common vision. It was hoped that these stakeholders would ultimately use and implement the Panel\u2019s recommendations according to their interest, mandate, and possibilities. Over time, the ToC evolved to go beyond Renova, aiming to reach a broader range of primary stakeholders such as state governments and the Rio Doce Watershed Committee. The Panel began to engage more directly with these groups in 2020. At that time, it was becoming clear that Renova would be unable to act on all the Panel\u2019s recommendations, since many recommendations required broader governmental and societal engagement. The ToC articulated the way in which the Panel would have to balance the demands of different actors while maintaining its independence. Managing such demands and the Panel\u2019s independence required constant vigilance. From the outset, the Panel\u2019s approach was to define the central issues and develop its recommendations, drawing upon contemporary peer- reviewed scientific literature and other publicly accessible sources.

The full list of issue or thematic selection criteria is listed in Box 3, below: 17 An issue or theme would be considered \u2018high\u2019 priority only if it passed the first three criteria and at least three of the remaining eight. Prioritisation was done in-house and based on the consensus view of Panel members. Their detailed scientific knowledge of the critical problems facing the basin and its peoples helped to identify the themes that needed to be addressed. Consensus was often achieved following extensive debate among Panel members. Once prioritised, the Chair selected an interdisciplinary core group of Panel members who were tasked to develop draft recommendations and the accompanying justification for further discussion. The leader of this core group was responsible for the paper\u2019s structure following consultation with the other Panel members and for delegating specific responsibilities to other core group members. This draft outline was then discussed at an alignment meeting with Renova\u2019s technical staff to determine whether the paper would meet the information requirements of the Foundation and other key stakeholders. The core group then began the academic research through peer-reviewed and internationally recognised publications. The research might include publicly available studies by Renova or other agencies, as well as reports from the consulting companies that had been contracted by the public prosecutor\u2019s office to review the restoration\u2019s progress. Even when Renova did not agree with a theme, the Panel\u2019s independence enabled it to proceed if it felt the theme was relevant to the broader restoration programme. Thematic Report number 2 (May et al., 2020) was one such example. Covering the impact of climate change on the basin\u2019s long-term restoration, the Panel proceeded with its preparation on the grounds that it was consistent with global concern and the impacts of regional climatic events. The Panel\u2019s work was invariably seen as independent, technical, and scientifically grounded. This was partly because the Panel members were well-known leaders in their respective fields. Some had taught or worked with decision-makers at Renova or in government agencies while they were at university or in other roles. Just as important, the Panel relied almost exclusively on peer- reviewed and internationally recognised publications. It focused on strategic, longer-term issues relating to the reparation, rather than engaging in detailed analysis of the day-to-day issues. The Panel initially thought they could produce a substantial volume of papers in short order, but this was simply not the case. The issues were complex. Documents required every Panel member to sign off. And IUCN publication guidelines contained multiple steps. This slow delivery frustrated both Renova and the Panel. Future Panels may wish to make the process more agile, to avoid overpromising and under-delivering. The multidisciplinary character of the Panel, and the part-time nature of Panel members\u2019 involvement could also interfere with timelines. Time commitments were flexible, allowing time for revision and reflection, and deadlines were not always strict. When necessary, for example, timelines were modified so that Panel members could visit sites or meet with stakeholders. The dynamic nature of the restoration also meant that Panel members sometimes needed to incorporate new information as it emerged. In 2021, the Panel\u2019s modus operandi changed when Renova requested a new methodology for ex post impact assessments in the marine and coastal areas. Since a member of the Panel \u2013 Professor Luis S\u00e1nchez \u2013 is widely known as one of the most important academic specialists in this area, the Panel agreed to carry out the 18 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL study to help advance the restoration in the affected coastal areas. This led the Panel to adopt a different mode of engagement with Renova staff, although without relinquishing its independence. The Panel\u2019s new approach enabled a constructive dialogue between the Panel and Renova\u2019s Impact Curatorship and Biodiversity teams.

This was true for the Rio Doce Panel, which benefitted from the support of IUCN\u2019s well-organised, professional support staff at internal meetings and for regular communication with Renova and others. Based in Bras\u00edlia and at the organisation\u2019s headquarters in Switzerland, the IUCN staff ensured that the Panel was able to access the most current peer-reviewed studies as well as media reports and offered insights into the perspectives of different actors and decision-makers. The support staff also managed the complex planning of site visits and meetings, both internal and external, all of which were overseen impeccably. Without the support and legitimacy of IUCN, the Panel would not have been as effective in its analysis and communications. The monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL) related to Panel outputs and recommendations were an added burden for IUCN staff, but the Panel was then able to systematically track the uptake of its recommendations by different stakeholders. The inclusion of a full-time MEL officer and the elaboration of the ToC were key decisions that shaped the Panel\u2019s success. These might usefully be replicated early in the organisation of any future ISTAP. The IUCN communication staff played a critical role in ensuring that the Panel had regular, updated access to all the relevant articles that appeared in the printed and online media, including items appearing in the local and regional, national and international press. The IUCN communications team was also responsible for communication with the press on the Panel\u2019s behalf, using different formats and media to promote public awareness of the Panel\u2019s existence as well as of its activities and recommendations, releasing all reports both in Portuguese and in English. To avoid undue duplication and mixed signals, the Panel Chair took responsibility for all direct substantive engagement with the press, while a targeted communication and outreach strategy optimised dissemination of the Panel\u2019s work to stakeholders by seeking forms for interaction that would reinforce the key messages. The editorial and layout experience of IUCN country and headquarters staff ensured the quality of the reports and their visual appeal. IUCN Members in Brazil and other parts of Latin America were consulted at the outset and informed about the progress Panel\u2019s work. Some Members expressed concern about a partnership with major mining companies in the wake of Brazil\u2019s worst environmental disaster, fearing consequences for IUCN\u2019s institutional integrity and reputation. However, the Panel Chair had impeccable credentials and was trusted by the environmental community. No formal objection was lodged. The Panel kept the international expert community and other stakeholders informed about their work through regular presentations at annual conferences of the International Association for Impact Assessment (IAIA), roundtables at the IUCN World Conservation Congress, and regional IUCN meetings. Panel members also participated in conferences to discuss their findings and stimulate broader awareness.

Finally, the Panel\u2019s experience reinforced the critical importance for ISTAPs of listening to the people, communities, and organisations affected by the disaster, as well as analysts in research institutions, non-governmental organisation (NGOs), universities, and the media. Hearing from those who suffered the consequences of the dam collapse, as they explained their grievances, brought home the full weight of the tragedy as well as the difficulties they face in being heard by the institutions that should be responsible for their well-being. 4 SUPPORT FROM IUCN AND OTHER ACTORS 21 At the outset, the Renova Foundation was composed of a relatively small cadre of highly motivated, idealistic leaders, and specialists. But as the largest of the 42 programmes swung into action, and their associated funding increased, Renova grew into one of the region\u2019s largest employers. It was one of the few private organisations in the world to have been tasked with the restoration of a damaged ecosystem and economy after a major environmental and social catastrophe. Over time, Renova evolved as it sought to build a better operational structure and increase its capacity to deliver the 42 programmes. However, this led to increasing compartmentalisation along the lines set out in the TTAC, a factor that was subsequently reinforced as many of the programmes became subject to judicial review. Renova\u2019s exponential growth in addressing the TTAC\u2019s increasingly compartmentalised programmes made the Panel\u2019s work more complex. How to engage with the large number of technically specialised departments and promote an integrated landscape approach and a long-term vision in such a highly compartmentalised framework? 5 WORKING WITH RENOVA: LEARNING BY DOING Above: Restoration work on the church affected by mud in Paracatu de Baixo, Minas Gerais.

Photo: All rights reserved to NITRO Historias Visuais 22 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL In response to the emerging complexity and as new actors became involved, the Panel broadened its remit, offering independent technical and scientific recommendations to - and engaging with - a wider set of stakeholders. These included the CIF, some of the technical chambers that advise it, the public prosecutor\u2019s office, local governments, academic institutions, non-governmental organisations including some that were advising the affected communities, and the CBH-Doce. Renova\u2019s high staff turnover added another layer of complexity. This might have impeded continuity in stakeholder relations and threatened the institutional knowledge base. However, the Renova staff who served as go-betweens for relationships built over five years of Panel activities, remained more stable. From the outset, the Panel was connected to the Institutional Relations and Governance teams at Renova, whose staff and consultants were relatively constant throughout much of the period. They accompanied the Panel on field visits and assisted IUCN with the logistics and programming of face-to-face meetings. The Renova staff tasked with accompanying the Panel offered regular updates on key issues emerging during the restoration and informed the Panel on whether these issues remained relevant. While the Panel\u2019s objectives remained constant since the TTAC was signed, Renova had to adapt to new realities, and this led the Panel to modify its own strategy.

The incident occurred on November 5, 2015. November 2, 2017. Photo: DIDA SAMPAIO / ESTAD\u00c3O CONTE\u00daDO 24 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL 6.1 SCALE AND COMPLEXITY The collapse of the Fund\u00e3o Dam was one of the largest and most complex human-made disasters in recent history. When the 39.2 million m3 of tailings flowed downstream into the Rio Doce, they affected land and human settlements along 670 km of river as well as extensive coastal and marine areas. The disaster had multiple direct and indirect impacts on physical and chemical conditions in the river, on the biota and their maintenance processes, and on the living conditions, economy and society of people living along the river and coastal areas. Given the complexity of the disaster, the vast amount of information generated, and controversies relating to the interpretation and understanding of the data, the Panel decided to rely exclusively on publicly available sources, with a preference for peer-reviewed journals. Many publications were devoted to the disaster, while volumes of consultancy studies were prepared for Renova, the public prosecutors\u2019 offices, and the courts. Much of this was made available online. To ensure independence and transparency, the Panel did not cite unpublished materials including those prepared for Renova and other entities. Renova and its parent companies questioned this approach since they had invested heavily in the research. However, much of this work had not been made publicly available and the Panel opted not to cite these sources. Nearly seven years have passed since the disaster, and there is still no comprehensive analysis of the environmental and socioeconomic impacts. Renova, the public prosecutors\u2019 office, and others have contracted a large number of studies, and peer-reviewed articles have been published in academic journals. But up to the time of this publication no overall synthesis has been published. Similarly, no overall assessment of the reparations has been carried out. The Renova website offers a month- by-month progress report on the programmes, but these have tended to focus on inputs and outputs (amounts spent, numbers of people employed, areas reforested, and so on) rather than on the achievement of the TTAC\u2019s long-term objectives of returning socio-environmental conditions to their pre-disaster condition. When the Panel was convened, therefore, its first priority was to prepare an overview of the situation in the Rio Doce Basin, applying the Panel members\u2019 specialist knowledge. The first thematic report (TR01 \u2013 S\u00e1nchez et al., 2018) synthesised the available information, providing an objective summary of the disaster together with background on the affected regions. Its general recommendations \u2013 which may well be applicable in other, similar situations \u2013 focused on the need for a comprehensive assessment of the impacts and the use of an adaptive management strategy. This latter should start with an evaluation of the mitigation programmes together with the potential threats \u2013 including climate change \u2013 that could undermine their expected outcomes. It also emphasised the importance of managing and disseminating knowledge gained from the disaster response. Subsequently, some of the recommendations conveyed by the initial thematic report were further developed \u2013 with agreement from Renova \u2013 while others were put aside. Renova or other primary stakeholders did not regard them as a priority, since they were prioritising the short-term goals needed to respond to the direct obligations of the TTAC. For example, the Panel saw adaptive management as essential to the long-term viability of the TTAC programmes, but this approach was rarely employed. The restoration effort appeared insufficiently flexible and unable to respond to the learning process required due to the uncertainties and impracticable timelines. Information management is another important theme in a complex post-disaster situation. The Panel offered to help Renova with the development of a strategy to manage the wealth of knowledge generated by the consultancy studies it had contracted as well as the natural and social science studies published by other organisations such as universities and research institutions. Panel members insisted that an effective strategy for knowledge management would be vital to ensure the legacy of the restoration. However, Renova had already decided to contract other consultants on knowledge management and was preparing to set up regional information centres.

This led to the involvement of federal government agencies, two state governments, the Public Prosecutors\u2019 offices in the two states and at least 40 municipal governments in the reparation. These governments and agencies will eventually have to take responsibility for the maintenance of the long-term programmes. As in other regions of Brazil, local government capacity is often severely constrained by the limited population in many municipalities. More than half the affected municipalities in MG, for instance, have less than 10,000 inhabitants. Local governments lack the resources to manage critical services, such as water supply, wastewater treatment, and the disposal of solid waste. Moreover, while everyone benefits from environmental services, they are not as visible as the community infrastructure that attracts votes, especially in small and rural municipalities. Toward the end of its tenure, the Panel aimed its advice not just at Renova but also at government agencies and the other stakeholders represented in the CIF and Technical Chambers (CT). The relations between Renova and the CIF/CT were often more adversarial than complementary, and this complicated efforts to engage effectively with all parties critical to restoration of the Rio Doce Basin. Further obstacles came from the fact that the TTAC was designed to facilitate a disaster response without waiting for the outcome of lengthy legal proceedings, but disagreements between Renova and the CIF/CT have regularly been referred to court. This led to uncertainty and delays in the restoration programmes. In 2020, the Panel decided to make recommendations on governance issues, focusing on the long-term legacy of restoration in the Rio Doce Basin. Drawing on experience from the Rio Doce and other post-disaster situations, the Panel focused on the need to start with a participatory approach that would allow a broad range of stakeholders \u2013 especially the people most directly affected \u2013 to share their vision for the Rio Doce Basin. Their \u2018buy-in\u2019 to a long-term vision was seen as essential to achieve consensus and commitment regarding the restoration and long-term improvement of the basin, and to eventually facilitate the handover of the programmes from Renova to the agencies that will be responsible for their long-term continuity once Renova\u2019s mandate has been fulfilled. In hindsight, it would have been better to initiate the governance review earlier, helping Renova and other key stakeholders (CIF and CT) to think about the reparation\u2019s long-term goals and the need for early engagement as part of a \u201cpolycentric governance\u201d strategy (Ostrom, 2010). But Renova had been conceived as a temporary arrangement, offering a rapid solution to the most immediate and pressing problems of the restoration. The government and other agencies are expected eventually to take over, continue, and complement the investments and programmes that had been initiated and financed by Renova. 6.2 THE LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT 26 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL One conceptual challenge faced by the Panel was to develop a workable framework for the ex post analysis of the disaster\u2019s environmental impacts. The conventional frameworks for environmental impact analysis (EIA) have primarily been developed for the ex ante determination of the potential impacts of investments, especially in infrastructure, extractive and industrial projects, where data is collected and analysed, and mitigation measures developed, before a project is started. In 2019, Renova\u2019s management team requested support with implementation of a recommendation from the first thematic report (S\u00e1nchez et al., 2018). In response, the Panel submitted a general framework for assessing the environmental and social impacts of disasters, which was well received. This issue paper (IP04 \u2013 S\u00e1nchez et al., 2019) encouraged Renova to establish an Impact Curatorship (Curadoria de Impactos). In 2021 Renova requested the Panel\u2019s help to develop a framework for assessing the impacts of the dam\u2019s collapse on coastal and marine areas. It was agreed that the scope would be limited to environmental impacts \u2013 which in themselves are extremely complex \u2013 and would not cover the social and economic impacts.

The Panel has had to look beyond these existing approaches, however, to develop a systematic, evidence-based framework for ex post EIA in other affected coastal and marine environments. In the study of impacts on coastal and marine areas, the Panel and Renova faced the challenge of working outside the conventional framework for EIA. The challenge was compounded by the absence of reliable data on the pre-disaster situation \u2013 for instance, information on critical areas such as water quality (physical, chemical and biological characteristics). Moreover, it is extremely difficult to distinguish the impacts of the Fund\u00e3o tailings from the cumulative, historical impacts from over 400 years of mining and industrial activity, deforestation of the basin, and contamination from agrochemicals, raw sewage and solid waste. The Panel was able to draw on the available data and were supported by IUCN staff to identify new sources of information from academic journals and other sources to draw inferences regarding the impact of the dam break on coastal and marine habitats. Based on this broad literature review, the Panel emphasised that impact analysis should focus on the medium- to long-term risks to the biota and to human health from dispersal and re-dispersal of the Fund\u00e3o tailings, rather than the immediate impacts after the dam break. 6.3 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ANALYSIS AND BASELINE DATA 27 The TTAC requires the restoration to return conditions to the pre-disaster state as it was in November 2015 (Clause 06.II). However, even if adequate data were available to characterise the ex ante environmental conditions, the Panel took the position that such a \u2018causal nexus\u2019 restriction would be neither feasible nor desirable. Instead, the Panel viewed the restoration as an opportunity to \u2018build back better\u2019, through a wide- ranging programme for the continual recovery of the Rio Doce Basin that could eventually be replicated in Brazil\u2019s other river basins and elsewhere. Renova had been organised to implement the programmes outlined in the TTAC, and the completion of these programmes was the Foundation\u2019s number one priority. However, the TTAC\u2019s emphasis on programme-by-programme implementation led to a compartmentalised approach, which made it more difficult to achieve an overall understanding of the disaster\u2019s impacts and to develop viable long-term solutions for the most chronic and critical impacts. From the start, however, the Panel argued for a more integrated strategy, one that would combine Landscape and S2S approaches. An S2S approach would enable a better understanding of the dynamics between the social, economic and environmental aspects. It would also focus more on the interrelationship between different environmental concerns, such as water quality, wastewater treatment, land use, biodiversity, livelihoods and human health, among others. The integration of Landscape and S2S approaches would therefore allow stakeholders to better understand and plan for the long-term restoration of the Rio Doce Basin, including attention to the estuary, coastal, and marine areas. These approaches should be understood not solely as a theoretical approach but as an innovative set of tools that can combine with participatory stakeholder engagement for an effective restoration plan. 6.4 ADOPTING SOURCE-TO-SEA AND LANDSCAPE APPROACHES 28 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL Below: Parts of the Rio Doce estuary, September 7, 2020.

Early on, however, the Panel did address some of the broader economic development issues in an innovative paper (IP01 \u2013 May et al., 2019), that suggested an alternative vision for the basin, based on more intensive, sustainable agriculture, rural tourism, the vertical integration of value chains, improved standards, and the development of a learning economy to be financed by permanent revolving funds.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8b3cb40-be13-4dfc-a0f0-79df4b6f3341": {"__data__": {"id_": "e8b3cb40-be13-4dfc-a0f0-79df4b6f3341", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-fruit-and-vegetables-menorcas-custodia-agraria", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ecological Footprint: fruit and vegetables from Menorca\u2019s Cust\u00f2dia Agr\u00e0ria programme", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-fruit-and-vegetables-menorcas-custodia-agraria", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2723aecc91300149a41572ac23846d7cc41c7665dafc6b625ad52eebb83d2e25"}, "2": {"node_id": "5d1a9a21-0e57-4580-9158-c39878c92be5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-fruit-and-vegetables-menorcas-custodia-agraria", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fac68e64ed2cc3b10fcc18e4f59cf7bfc8bacb43040f32f211c569eb8f3c570c"}}, "hash": "186fedeea8ca59c453418d1ddd031977bf5381f976768c31479734c7bf7276d3", "text": "A second issue paper (IP02 \u2013 Brito et al., 2019) argued that the restoration of inland and coastal fisheries would require a unified decision-making framework to determine when and how the responsible authorities could lift the fishing bans following their imposition in the wake of the disaster.

In principle, Renova responded positively to this idea, and put the approach into practice by involving local people to monitor water quality. Indeed, bulletins on Renova\u2019s website represent a positive example of how information from monitoring programmes can be obtained and presented in a way that is accessible and comprehensible to the general public. However, this citizen science approach did not go much further even though some of the directly affected communities, such as Degredo, a traditional Afro-Brazilian (quilombola) community on the ES coast, possessed the organisation and qualified professionals needed to permit more ambitious participatory monitoring programmes. These could have included the monitoring of flora and fauna, fisheries, and the quality and availability of ground and surface water. 6.5 SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS Below: Rio Doce Panel visiting Instituto Terra and its nursery of native plants used to restore the Rio Doce Basin.

Photo: All rights reserved to NITRO Historias Visuais 30 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL One of the most frequently repeated demands to the Panel, made by the affected population, was for better information about the disaster\u2019s impacts on physical and mental health. Such impacts are typically seen as a consequence of direct exposure to the tailings, to tailings dust, and to the contamination of water supplies. But human health can also be affected by the consumption of contaminated fish and irrigated vegetables, as well as the social and psychological impact of community displacement, loss of livelihoods and dependence on monthly indemnity payments to displaced households, fishers, artisanal miners, and other affected groups. The Panel recognised that an integrated treatment of human and ecosystem health would be beneficial for people affected by the disaster. This was thus a serious lacuna in the restoration process. Renova staff have tried to lay the groundwork for a programme of Integrated Environmental and Human Health Management (GAISMA). However, the judicial decisions have required that Renova treat these issues separately. As a result, this integration has been omitted from most remediation and restoration efforts over the seven years since the dam break. The Panel did, however, draw attention to the continued need for an integrative perspective. For example, its final Issue Paper recommended the One Health approach (IP05 \u2013 Alonso et al., 2020). This approach shows how best to coordinate programmes, policies, legislation and research in order to unlock collaboration between the human and animal health and ecosystem conservation sectors, thereby improving public health. IP05 addressed the wider links between human health and the environment, recommending support for public health monitoring and the exchange of information between the formal public health system (SUS, from Portuguese acronym Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade) and organisations in the fields of community and environmental health. These recommendations were not immediately taken up, but public health was later included as a priority theme in the TTAC\u2019s renegotiation. Additional studies would provide a more complete assessment of the disaster\u2019s impacts on human health in the areas most directly affected, but they remain stymied due to dissent in the judicial arena. 6.6 HEALTH IMPACTS Below: Group of people on a boat at the mouth of the Rio Doce.

Photo taken during the Rio Doce Panel\u2019s visit in July 2022. Photo: IUCN/ Rio Doce Panel archive 32 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL When the Panel began its work, it did not prioritise the potential cumulative impacts from tailings deposition and sediment flows on the marine and freshwater biota, but it was agreed that, should the need arise, additional expertise would be sought, either through an external consultant or by adding an extra member to the Panel. As discussed above, however, Renova later sought the Panel\u2019s advice on how to better understand and manage the environmental impacts on the coastal and marine areas. Meanwhile, Renova had contracted a detailed assessment and monitoring of biota in the estuary and adjacent coastal region to a consortium of universities and scientific researchers in Esp\u00edrito Santo, along with parallel studies by the Brazilian Foundation for Sustainable Development (FBDS) and consultants assigned by UNESCO. The emerging complexity and conflicting scientific findings from these overlapping studies pointed to the continued risk from deposition of the tailings. Given the lack of a common basis for describing and assessing impacts, and the need to systematise impacts into a common structure, Renova and the Panel agreed to work on the development of a systematic framework that would enable interpretation of the results generated by these and other studies.

This suspicion has been compounded by the pressure to take decisions and implement them in a timely fashion, since the disaster deprived people of essential environmental services, such as potable water, fisheries and housing. Here, the Panel offers some general suggestions that might be useful for future ISTAPs and Rio Doce stakeholders to help prioritise issues, achieve consensus and implement sustainable, efficient and long-term solutions. 34 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL Left: Aerial view of the Rio Doce below the city bridge.

All rights reserved to NITRO Historias Visuais 35 The effects of the Fund\u00e3o Dam disaster were complex and the process of recovery has to be sustainable in the long run. To ensure such results, the process itself is as important as the outcomes. Thus, successful engagement with government and civil society is key to a sustainable and lasting restoration. The Panel focused its work on issues that contribute to the long- term sustainability of the basin and its inhabitants. To achieve long-term sustainability, these issues depend on successful intervention and engagement with local and regional institutions. Man-made and natural disasters can have devastating impacts on the local population, their economies and social infrastructure, but they can also offer an opportunity for longer-term improvement. Recovery is not simply a return to prior conditions. The opportunities should be mapped and planned with input from diverse stakeholders \u2013 especially those that have been most directly affected \u2013 to achieve a common vision for the future. The full benefits of a shared vision may not be felt for decades. The socioeconomic benefits of changes to economic structure, education, and sanitation may not be felt in the short term, but in the long term they are essential for the continual improvement of the environment, economy and social conditions.

Consultation and engagement are key to achieve a shared vision and to the development of viable programmes with an exit strategy that will ensure the restoration\u2019s continuity and sustainability. Such investments may not have immediately visible results, but they are essential for human and ecosystem health. When adapted to the specific realities of other regions and countries, this model could be applied to most post-disaster scenarios. It could also be adapted to major investments in infrastructure or extractive projects. A participatory process may appear more complex and time-consuming, but it is the only way to guarantee a process of continual improvement that will satisfy the expectations and needs of the people affected. In the Rio Doce case, affected communities were not involved in drawing up the TTAC or in the subsequent decision- making, and this has exacerbated the mistrust and conflicts generated throughout the restoration. Some of this was inevitable, but it could have been lessened by more effective engagement with the different groups of people affected. In the immediate aftermath of disaster, short-term solutions are required to cover people\u2019s immediate needs, reinstating access to potable water, energy supply and housing. Once this has been achieved, and people\u2019s confidence restored through short-term actions, it becomes necessary to start thinking more strategically. This requires longer-term process-oriented programmes that allow for continual improvement. Even shorter-term restoration activities should encourage participation and 7.1 PROMOTE A LONG-TERM, SHARED VISION FOR CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT Below: In the image, a person driving a boat at the mouth of the Rio Doce.

By producing rapid results and \u2018quick wins\u2019, engagement can build trust between the different stakeholders. The Panel consistently recommended the need for affected people to have the opportunity to participate in decisions about the restoration. In the case of the Fund\u00e3o Dam disaster, the decision-making structure established under the TTAC led to drawn-out discussions that extended from federal and state government agencies to the public prosecutors and eventually to the judiciary. It lacked the mechanisms that would allow greater participation by those most directly affected, thus limiting their engagement and commitment to the restoration programmes. Participation is not easy \u2013 but if decision- making is done only by the existing governmental bureaucracy, then it becomes more difficult to empower society and to achieve the long-term changes needed for \u2018building back better\u2019. In the beginning, the Panel focused on making recommendations to Renova. As time went on, however, the Panel realised the importance of engaging with other stakeholders, since different actors had to be involved to achieve lasting results through a more participatory process. One of the lessons that may be applicable to other ISTAPs, therefore, is not to focus exclusively on one or more specific stakeholders, but to share the recommendations more widely and engage directly with all the relevant stakeholders. The Panel had been slow to work with agencies other than Renova, but during the preparation of TR02 (May et al., 2020) Renova expressed its discomfort with managing issues related to climate change. This helped the Panel appreciate the importance of engaging with a broader group of actors. Below: Rio Doce Panel and IUCN secretariat during internal meeting during visit to the Rio Doce Basin.

Trust and leadership make a difference. The capacity for collaboration among different stakeholders is critical to the establishment of responsive governance.

This underscores an important issue for future ISTAPs. Their need for independence prevents them from acting as an intermediary between business or government agencies and the people directly affected. However, an ISTAP should be able to recognise the concerns of affected people, give voice to their aspirations, and encourage the relevant agencies to engage with them more effectively. 7.2 RECOGNISE THE POWER OF LEADERSHIP AND COLLABORATION Right: Yolanda Kakabadse, Chair of the Rio Doce Panel, during the launching of the 5th article of the series Issue Paper. Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais. March 2020. Photo: IUCN/Rio Doce Panel archive 38 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL 7.3 LOOK FOR INTEGRATED, MULTIDISCIPLINARY SOLUTIONS The desire for quick results may lead to the compartmentalisation of discussions and solutions, rather than calling for an integrated approach and acknowledging the complexity of the situation and the wide range of stakeholders. Many restoration issues are in fact connected and the existence of parallel structures can interfere with one another. For example, if the water is contaminated, then the fish may also be contaminated, with implications for people\u2019s livelihoods, nutrition, and health. This is obvious, but when different departments or agencies are responsible for water quality, biota, public health and the economy, it becomes more difficult to attain an integrated approach. The responses of different agencies may even contradict one another as in the case of the fisheries ban discussed in IP02 (Brito et al., 2019). Technical discussions can get lost in minor details that impede the search for effective solutions when they should be considered together, taking a broader landscape perspective to address issues that affect local welfare. The Panel consistently stressed the value of a landscape approach, rather than compartmentalised solutions. Renova did not fully internalise this view, but other stakeholders did acknowledge the need for integrated solutions to the chronic problems facing the Rio Doce Basin and associated coastal and marine areas. In this respect, the Panel played an important role, presenting the S2S approach together with landscape perspectives in a specific thematic report focused on the integration of biodiversity and water quality (TR03 \u2013 Brito et al., 2021). The S2S framework is a practical approach that has been tried and tested, not only in the Fund\u00e3o case, but also in other similar situations. The S2S principle could be applied elsewhere to restore and improve the environmental, social, and economic situation of a disaster-affected region. The impact analysis and the design of medium and long-term measures should avoid a piecemeal approach. Instead, they should adopt a broader perspective, combining landscape and S2S approaches from the start. This makes it easier to respond to the environmental, social, financial, economic, and cultural aspects of the affected region. The approach encompasses not only the spatial dimension (terrestrial and/or coastal areas), but also key flows \u2013 water, biota, sediment, pollutants, materials and ecosystem services. The S2S concept was first introduced by the Panel in its Issue Paper No. 3 (IP03 - Barbosa et al., 2019), in which it was proposed that Renova consider installing a permanent floodgate in the Rio Pequeno to protect waters of the Juparan\u00e3 lake \u2013 an important water source in the lower Rio Doce \u2013 from pollution by the Rio Doce in flooding conditions. The floodgate would have an opening and closing system to control the volume of water in rainy and dry periods to ensure connectivity between ecosystems. The affected territory covers a vast area in two Brazilian states, with distinct social, economic, and cultural characteristics. Both states have been degraded by centuries of extractive activities, unsustainable agricultural practices and contamination with raw sewage and solid waste. Rather than seeking a return to the pre-disaster situation as a baseline, it would be better to seek a negotiated solution that would improve conditions and kick-start a process of continual improvement in the region. This requires engagement with all the relevant parties.

The Panel also recommended that Renova support the establishment of a long-term fiduciary fund to finance continued efforts in the basin (IP01 \u2013 May et al., 2019) investing some of the resources originally intended for reparation. However, Renova rejected the concept on the grounds that it was not consistent with the mandate for immediate and short-term results. However, landscape analysis by Renova, UNESCO, the World Resources Institute (WRI), and other organisations have recommended that additional resources be directed toward a broader basin-level approach, including systematic analysis of the long-term development scenarios. 39 7.5 CONSIDER CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGHOUT The climate emergency threatens ecosystems and human well-being. Emerging diseases, water rationing, droughts, and floods will become more frequent in the coming years. Fundamental changes to the economy and social values will be vital to avoid and manage these challenges. Climate change is likely to aggravate the degradation of fragile and degraded landscapes such as the Rio Doce Basin. Restoration plans and programmes should share a common climate strategy, covering both assessment and adaptation to the effects of climate change. The Panel needed to persuade Renova that climate change issues were within its remit. Renova had been doubtful on the grounds that, first, climate change would only impact the region in the distant future, and second, that the impacts of climate change were distinct from those caused by the dam collapse. This underscores the tension between the short and long term, and between the causal impacts of the dam collapse and the need to address the underlying environmental conditions. Renova and its Board of Directors strongly contested the idea, for example, that climate change could be the cause of the extraordinary storm and rainfall events associated with the repeated deposition of tailings along the river. The Panel insisted that the theme was relevant and discussed its recommendations from TR02 (May et al., 2020) with different stakeholders. The process of restoration should consider the long-term governance of the affected region, noting that permanent institutions and those responsible for the restoration may have overlapping and complementary roles to play. The restoration programmes have generated studies, data, information systems, and especially capacity to execute restoration actions, but these may be lost if they are not integrated into the permanent structures of governance for the maintenance of nature\u2019s services. In principle, there should be a balance between tasks assigned to the restoration programme\u2019s institutions and to the long-term, permanent institutions that will eventually continue the restoration\u2019s programmes and investments. Both CIF and Renova have engaged with permanent institutions such as the Rio Doce Watershed Committee, universities, and NGOs in the area, viewing them as valuable sources of expertise. Similarly, the Panel also prioritised permanent institutions when it reached out to other groups of stakeholders. Early on, the Panel completed a stakeholder mapping and analysis of the impacted region (see discussion of the Panel\u2019s ToC, above), allowing the Panel to understand which permanent institutions might manage selected programmes in the longer-term. During the preparation of the thematic report on governance (TR04 - Maroun et al., 2021), this analysis was updated to include a broader range of stakeholders. Key findings were also discussed with various institutions beyond Renova. The key lesson for other ISTAPs is to initiate a process of stakeholder mapping at the outset and to update it regularly. This will provide clear understanding of the governance roles of each actor or agency in the affected region. Understanding the involvement of these actors is fundamental to the early integration of restoration efforts, guaranteeing continuity and long-term improvement. 7.4 ENGAGE AND EMPOWER THE PERMANENT INSTITUTIONS Right: In the image, a stretch of the Rio Doce near its mouth. Renova Foundation.

This offers the opportunity for feedback and discussion and allows Panel members to learn from comparative perspectives and other cases, as well as permitting the Panel to share its work and insights with different stakeholders. To what extent should the Panel be involved in the definition of solutions and moving them forward? The Panel\u2019s distinct approach recognised the urgency of the situation as well as the need to consult on the direction of the papers.

Panel members met in person twice a year and held videoconferences at the end of every month. This helped to maintain the Panel\u2019s cohesion and the quality of interaction between its members. It also kept them up to date on the development of the thematic reports and issue papers and the reparation process itself. The Panel also held debriefing sessions following meetings and systematised the relevant information for use in subsequent analyses. Panel members met with the Chair at the end of each face-to-face meeting to evaluate each other\u2019s performance and consider future pathways. Panel members also found it useful to divide into core groups when developing drafts of the thematic reports and issue papers. However, Panel members found it difficult to review these products if more than one paper was being prepared simultaneously. Future ISTAPs are advised to discuss and consider this balance and to review it from time to time, considering the expertise of the Panel members and the need for their participation in selected documents. ISTAPs are also advised to generate shorter, more concise products, even carefully presented intermediate products, rather than high- quality, professionally edited reports that are outdated by the time they are presented.

The negotiations around the restoration and related processes were often extremely complex, since the multiple actors were often suspicious of each other and held distinct and often conflicting views. Moreover, the discussions tended to focus on specific, compartmentalised concerns. Despite the need for short-term solutions to respond to people\u2019s immediate needs, it is also essential to think about solutions to the long-term impacts caused by disaster. An ISTAP can influence the process by highlighting the need for a long-term, integrated perspective, even if implementation of the recommendations is neither direct nor immediate. An ISTAP\u2019s influence may not be felt immediately by stakeholders in a disaster restoration, but it does endure. ISTAPs can also influence important processes indirectly. One of the Panel\u2019s main legacies was the publication of impartial and independent analysis and technical advice that could be used by actors in different contexts, beyond that of the restoration of the Rio Doce watershed. By publishing thematic reports and issue papers throughout its five years of operation, the Panel contributed to discussions to change practices in the sector and to mainstream global concerns, such as climate change. 42 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL In the image, parts of the Rio Doce estuary. Renova Foundation. September 7, 2020. Photo: All rights reserved to NITRO Historias Visuais The Panel\u2019s recommendations were grounded in globally relevant scientific literature, and they reflected a long-term approach and landscape perspective. This can be adapted to similar disaster situations, whose frequency is increasing rapidly with climate change. The Panel\u2019s process for developing recommendations was as important as the recommendations themselves. Knowledge of topics and methodologies that would never have been considered without participation of an ISTAP became widely disseminated in the process of consultation with stakeholders. This holds true for the S2S approach, an innovative methodology introduced by the Panel for assessment and integrated management of river basins. In the Rio Doce example, the S2S approach was presented didactically to key stakeholders in the long-term development of the region.

March 2019. Photo: IUCN/Rio Doce Panel archive FOREWORD The socio-environmental and economic tragedy caused by the Fund\u00e3o dam failure in the city of Mariana (in the state of Minas Gerais) caused impacts that remain seven years later. Still, it is also important to recognise that many initiatives were \u2013 and continue to be \u2013 adopted successfully. Dealing with the biggest mining event of its kind on the planet required organised efforts proportional to the magnitude of the damage caused by the dam failure. This led to the signing of Terms of Transaction and Conduct Adjustment (TTAC, Termo de Transa\u00e7\u00e3o e Ajustamento de Conduta) and the adoption of a complex governance model, in which the Renova Foundation is the executing institution. In this context, an independent panel of specialists was established, called the Rio Doce Panel and linked to IUCN, one of the oldest and most respected non-governmental entities in the world devoted to the conservation of nature and the protection of the environment, with a history of significant achievements. The creation of the Panel, a group composed of experts from Brazil and abroad under the coordination of Yolanda Kakabadse \u2013 a former environment minister of Ecuador and internationally respected conservation leader and policy maker \u2013 was extremely relevant from an institutional perspective, as the Panel would act autonomously and independently and advise decision-makers involved in the governance system behind the reparation process. Thematic reports prepared by the Panel outlined expertise and best international practices for the reparation of areas, which had been affected by tragedies similar to the Fund\u00e3o Dam failure. The reports also enabled an ambience of reflection that would have been impossible within the Foundation\u2019s day-to-day work and immense pressure from repressed demands, court-mandated responsibilities, and dysfunctional aspects of their internal and external governance. By enabling discussions on essential topics and producing high-level technical-scientific documents, the Panel has provided a set of inputs to assist the Renova Foundation in remedying the disaster\u2019s damage. By bringing a new and outside perspective, the Panel contributed to the Foundation and other actors in decision-making, complementing the existing work, strengthening strategic planning, and expanding the Foundation\u2019s thinking on the best available alternatives to address the region\u2019s socio-environmental and economic problems, taking into account, primarily, the assistance to those affected and the environmental recovery in the areas of water quality and biodiversity. The Panel always conducted its interdisciplinary work in an integrated fashion and in coordination with the various stakeholders involved in restoring the Rio Doce. In this important document, the Panel shares its reflections and lessons learned during its five years of work. Together with IUCN, the Panel leaves behind it an important legacy for current and future reparations, in view of the long-term nature of these actions. Jos\u00e9 Carlos Carvalho Former Minister of Environment, Brazil V Independent Scientific and Technical Advisory Panels (ISTAPs) have been established to help address a range of controversial conservation and development issues that have emerged with growing frequency and complexity at national and global levels. This report is intended to contribute to discussion of ways to improve the effectiveness of ISTAPs by outlining lessons learned by the Rio Doce Panel, an ISTAP set up in the wake of the 2015 Fund\u00e3o iron tailings Dam collapse, widely considered one of Brazil\u2019s worst environmental disasters. The multidisciplinary seven-member Panel worked from September 2017 to December 2022 following its establishment under a joint agreement between the Renova Foundation, which was created to restore socio-environmental conditions after the disaster, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Working in a complex and often adversarial governance system, the Panel evolved over time from focusing on restoration to looking at the broader implications of environmental management of the basin and the wider Rio Doce catchment area, as well as engaging with a broader array of stakeholders.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "28d6be30-5987-4f36-838d-149669a287ac": {"__data__": {"id_": "28d6be30-5987-4f36-838d-149669a287ac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-beef-products-menorcas-custodia-agraria-programme", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ecological Footprint: beef products from Menorca\u2019s Cust\u00f2dia Agr\u00e0ria programme", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-beef-products-menorcas-custodia-agraria-programme", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "521969b1509a20a633e7c7ab652e8b727c5294a2ca9a9e8484aaaa7a1b20e7ef"}, "2": {"node_id": "81d57c02-46f6-49c7-b446-ca8e5e0dfc4c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-beef-products-menorcas-custodia-agraria-programme", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8615ccc77c4bf0bf3e35832bf8c2560340f08efa152f25eb910148b55036aed0"}}, "hash": "904d8ff7329d5ff1803b9643c0bff9ac55a4da0d6382c5eeba42ed6b7fc16163", "text": "The Panel\u2019s recommendations were based on three complementary perspectives: a long-term vision, a landscape approach, and the application of Nature-based Solutions (NbS).

The dam contained around 52 million cubic meters (m3) of iron mining residues from the Samarco mining company\u2019s Germano Complex, jointly owned by two of the largest multinational mining corporations, Vale S.A and BHP Billiton (BHP). Reportedly, 39.2 million m3 of these tailings washed into the Santar\u00e9m reservoir, immediately below the dam, creating a wave of liquid mud that poured into the Gualaxo do Norte and do Carmo rivers, both headwaters of the Rio Doce. The mass of liquified tailings tore away soil, vegetation and sediments from the upper reaches of the river, affecting around 2,000 hectares belonging to some 200 rural properties and destroying 1,469 hectares of natural vegetation. The mud and debris demolished the villages of Bento Rodrigues and Paracatu de Baixo, damaging homes and community infrastructure further downstream in Gesteira and Barra Longa. The tailings also reached the Rio Doce estuary, 670 km below the dam, and created a plume, which spread along extensive coastal and marine areas, particularly along the shallow coastal platform. The disaster claimed 19 lives and physically displaced at least 320 families. As a consequence of the disaster, Samarco\u2019s iron ore extraction activities were halted for five years,1 and fishing remains banned in much of the basin, affecting employment and food security. Those displaced from the communities by the wave of mud were provided with temporary housing in Mariana and other urban areas in the basin, a situation that has lasted up to the time of this publication. Right after the disaster, local governments were forced to cut off the public supplies of water obtained from the Rio Doce and its tributaries, and to substitute them using tank trucks to deliver water to people in many of the towns and rural communities located downstream. In an effort to mitigate the impacts and restore the areas affected by the Fund\u00e3o Dam collapse, the Brazilian Federal Government, the States of Minas Gerais and Esp\u00edrito Santo, Samarco, Vale and BHP signed a detailed agreement on 2 March 2016, known as the Terms of Transaction and Conduct Adjustment (TTAC). 1 In late 2020, Samarco received the environmental licenses required to restart its iron mining, ore concentration and transport along a 400 km slurry pipeline, and pelletising operations at a port facility which it had installed in the late 1970s near Vit\u00f3ria, the state capital of Esp\u00edrito Santo. By mid-2022, the company had returned to 26 percent of its prior operating capacity. Samarco no longer deposits its coarse tailings behind dams but is drying and piling them for eventual use as construction materials. The fine tailings are being stored in an exhausted open pit. 1.

Left: Inspection carried out by Ibama in July 2016 on the stretch affected by the collapse of the Samarco mining company\u2019s tailings dam in Mariana, Minas Gerais. Photo: Felipe Werneck/Ibama 1 The TTAC set out 42 programmes for reparation and compensation, and established an independent entity called the Renova Foundation to create, manage, and implement these programmes. Samarco\u2018s parent companies \u2013 Vale and BHP \u2013 would finance Renova, while an Inter-Federative Committee (CIF) would oversee the restoration process. The CIF included representatives from federal and state government agencies as well as municipal governments, representatives of affected populations and the civil society organisations that provide them with technical assistance. Together, Renova and the CIF were made formally responsible for the restoration, in consultation with affected communities. The idea of installing a specialist panel to provide independent technical advice on the restoration process took shape in the two years following the disaster. The objective proposed by the leadership of Renova and Samarco\u2019s parent companies was to identify global corporate best practices and science- based perspectives on the restoration. In December 2015, BHP staff members consulted with various international organisations that were concerned about the environmental and social impacts of the Fund\u00e3o Dam collapse. IUCN was among the organisations visited by the BHP staff members tasked with managing the restoration efforts. Although IUCN was unable to provide technical support to address the immediate short-term mitigation and restoration activities, the organisation had experience with the creation of ISTAPs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "026bc130-a957-46c4-9508-197f67039fee": {"__data__": {"id_": "026bc130-a957-46c4-9508-197f67039fee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-beef-products-menorcas-custodia-agraria-programme", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ecological Footprint: beef products from Menorca\u2019s Cust\u00f2dia Agr\u00e0ria programme", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-beef-products-menorcas-custodia-agraria-programme", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4d4aa92394e7330602b5c9ab86b7eb58871c498103c4d043f6b6ea737fc52dfb"}, "2": {"node_id": "4da47558-c6de-477b-ac2f-23212a75b648", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-beef-products-menorcas-custodia-agraria-programme", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "638fa061c349ace0084c349bf2b6116d85bc5670bafc5685c366e563a958bf00"}}, "hash": "baeba423559e5a3cffe14ae51e8a239f5f94cdafc9c0c7e83f74a544ba41cc9a", "text": "This initial consultation led to a dialogue between IUCN and BHP, that eventually led to the decision to create an independent panel.

They can help multiple stakeholders understand situations characterised by complexity, uncertainty, and cost and can contribute to effective and efficient decision- making. Organisations which have recently created such groups include the Global Environment Facility\u2019s Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP), the World Health Organization\u2019s Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee (STAC), and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change\u2019s Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP). Such panels are typically convened under conditions of uncertainty. The number of unforeseen environmental disasters has been growing, for example, linked to climate change, extinctions, ozone depletion, mine- tailing dam collapses, and more. Advisory panels are also a regular feature of complex infrastructure projects. Other IUCN panels have been set up to address the impacts of major oil and gas investments in Nigeria (IUCN Niger Delta Panel) and in Russia (IUCN Western Gray Whale Advisory Panel).3 Although some IUCN Members saw partnership with mining enterprises as contrary to the reputational 2 IUCN (2014), Procedures for establishing and managing IUCN-supported Independent Scientific & Technical Advisory Panels, https://iucn.org/sites/default/files/2022-11/iucn_istap_procedures_2014.pdf 3 See: https://www.iucn.org/western-gray-whale-advisory-panel and https://www.iucn.org/theme/business-and-biodiversity/our-work/business- partnerships-projects/shell/iucn-niger-delta-panel 4 The Brumadinho disaster led to 270 deaths, mostly employees of Vale who were in the company cafeteria located immediately below the dam when it collapsed upon them. 5 Global Tailings Review (2020) \u2013 Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management - https://globaltailingsreview.org/global-industry-standard/ - IUCN was part of the Tailings Review Advisory Group interests of the organisation, there was widespread support for \u2013 and acceptance of \u2013 the effort to achieve better results from the restoration. The reputational risk became more obvious after the occurrence of a second major dam collapse at Brumadinho in January of 2019, which caused many more deaths than the Fund\u00e3o disaster.4 IUCN followed the response to this new crisis closely: Why had the same mining enterprise (Vale) not learned enough in the three years following the Fund\u00e3o Dam failure to prevent further disasters? An international inquiry sparked by Brumadinho led to the adoption of new standards for the management of tailings dams and for restoration efforts after future ruptures (Oberle 2020).5 The effectiveness of ISTAPs is strongly associated with their credibility as arbiters or scientific/technical specialists, whose salience or recognised prominence in the fields is perceived as relevant to the issues at hand as well as their legitimacy in the eyes of principal stakeholders to offer advice on these complex matters (Cash et al., 2003). Furthermore, based upon its experience with other such Panels, IUCN recognises that \u2013 to be effective \u2014 an ISTAP should operate according to four general principles: independence, transparency, accountability, and engagement. These principles apply to all IUCN-supported ISTAPs (IUCN, 2014). While the generic principles for advisory panels (Cash et al., 2003) address criteria similar to those adopted by IUCN, the latter put greater emphasis on the need for independence from external influences while maintaining accountability to affected groups.

THE ROLE OF INDEPENDENT SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL ADVISORY PANELS 4 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL will reflect on the means employed by the Panel to ensure its effectiveness and to comply with the underlying principles that motivated its creation. In the past two decades, IUCN has refined its ISTAP model to provide companies and other stakeholders with credible, relevant, and legitimate technical advice. According to IUCN (2021): \u201cISTAPs are established with the formal designation of a group of experts, who engage in provision of scientific and/or technical advice on a specific biodiversity conservation or natural resource management issue. Typically, the recipient of the advice is one or more business entities or public authorities.

October, 2018. Photo: IUCN/Rio Doce Panel archive 5 3 THE CREATION AND OPERATION OF THE RIO DOCE PANEL The first step in establishing the Panel was to select its chair through an international recruitment process that took place in parallel with the development of the Panel\u2019s terms of reference7 (TORs). This process took nearly a full year to complete and involved regular consultation with the leadership of the Renova Foundation. Given IUCN\u2019s principal conservation mission, the Panel focused on environmental remediation and the restoration of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. It also considered impact assessment and monitoring, and the relation between ecosystems and livelihoods, as well as human and ecosystem health in the affected communities. 7 Terms of Reference for the Rio Doce Panel are available at https://www.iucn.org/sites/default/files/2022-10/rio-doce-istap-terms-of-reference_updated_2020jan.pdf 6 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL These themes were compatible with the Panel\u2019s objectives, as defined by its TOR and FAQ,8 of making recommendations at a long-term, landscape scale and calling attention to NbS. The Panel\u2019s specific focus was to examine the impacts of the disaster on the environment and natural resources. The Panel\u2019s remit did not cover issues that had been referred to the courts, such as indemnification payments and relocation, or the management and disposal of the tailings and other engineering issues. Detailed discussion of the generic safety of tailings dams was also excluded since this was seen as an issue for the technical specialists engaged in the international review of dam safety. Central issues included biodiversity, basin management, water resources, fisheries and NbS, since IUCN is widely recognised for its global leadership and expertise in these areas. 8 Frequently Asked Questions regarding the Rio Doce Panel are available at www.iucn.org/riodocepanel. Above: Panel visits the area of Fund\u00e3o. October 2018. Photo: IUCN/Rio Doce Panel archive 7 Independence is central to the Panel\u2019s operating principles, but some stakeholders had questions. To what extent could the Panel avoid manipulation and co-optation given its institutional proximity and financial dependence on Renova? Any ISTAP created in the context of disaster reparation is liable to face this question. The answer is that the Rio Doce Panel \u2013 following the lead of previous IUCN ISTAPs \u2013 has engaged in a way that is independent, transparent and accountable to all the stakeholders involved. Although its role is advisory, the Panel is not beholden to Renova or to Samarco\u2019s shareholders and parent companies. Any real or potential conflict of interest is addressed through IUCN procedures and best practice.

The Panel needed to navigate these shifts while retaining its independence.

Many \u2013 if not most \u2013 of the Panel\u2019s recommendations were then developed to include other governmental stakeholders such as the two state governments and the Rio Doce Watershed Committee (CBH-Doce). Over time, the Panel gradually put more effort into communicating its work and stimulating debate among the emerging primary stakeholders.

Such issues had to be openly discussed among stakeholders. Panel members found the interdisciplinary composition and diversity of their professional backgrounds to be an asset. However, for a multidisciplinary panel of this kind to function effectively, it was essential that key decisions be reached through consensus. This required Panel members to listen carefully, respect the opinions of others, follow formal protocols, and make an effort to comprehend the technical issues from the perspective of other disciplines. This was particularly important in the finalisation of the analyses and recommendations set out in the thematic reports and issues papers, which IUCN published under the co-authorship of the Chair and all the Panel members, even though each report had its respective lead author. The need for consensus meant fewer documents were published, since publication required a time-consuming process of internal and external peer review, comment, and re-editing. However, the need for consensus also meant that arguments were more balanced, and the writing more carefully crafted. Although changes in the composition of the Panel occurred during the five-year period of activities for varied reasons, this did not affect the methodology adopted for tripartite teamwork on each paper, though it did cause some delay in delivery timelines. However, it may have influenced the selection of topics and the focus of some of the papers without interrupting the overall programme. The Panel made an early decision to differentiate its products into two types of reports. The first were issue papers (IP), which were relatively short, produced more rapidly, and focused on specific concerns facing the restoration. The second were thematic reports (TRs), which went into greater depth, were longer, and had a broader scope. The Panel Chair guided the process of deciding themes and asking Panel members whether they would participate in the core groups responsible for the initial drafts of technical reports and issue papers. All Panel members played an active role in discussing the relevance of possible topics, which were subsequently selected based on specific criteria such as the knowledge and experience of Panel members. Panel members were expected to dedicate time from their already busy individual schedules to the work of the Panel. They met virtually each month, and face-to- face twice a year in the affected region. During the face- to-face gatherings, Panel members visited locations and communities affected by the disaster, as well as restoration sites, to understand the issues first hand and to follow the progress of restoration. When Panel members attended seminars, conferences and other institutional meetings related to the restoration, they did so as Panel representatives and accessed resources from the Panel budget. 12 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL The Panel was governed by its detailed ToRs, codes of conduct and its Theory of Change (ToC). At an early stage in its work, the Panel enunciated an initial version of its ToC that set up outcome indicators and a strategy to monitor the uptake of its recommendations by the primary and secondary stakeholders of the restoration programmes under Renova\u2019s responsibility. The primary or secondary stakeholders were defined as \u201cMain Stakeholders, Policymakers, Influencers and Do- ers\u201d. The categories were sometimes overlapping and may have referred to entities with multiple roles in the restoration. BOX 2 \u2013 THE PANEL TARGET AUDIENCES Main Stakeholders Renova Foundation, CIF and its technical chambers Policymakers Federal, state and municipal governments, Basin committees, state agencies and regulatory institutions, legislature, judiciary and Public Prosecutor\u2019s office Influencers Universities and research institutes, national and international corporations, advisors to the judiciary, and to the Public Prosecutor\u2019s office DO-ers Affected people and its technical advisors, representative associations, private companies in the basin and NGOs working in the restoration process According to the ToC, Main stakeholders include organisations which were created in response to the disaster and which are a key part of the reparation\u2019s governance structure, such as the Renova Foundation, CIF and its Technical Chambers. Policymakers also deal directly with the consequences of the Fund\u00e3o Dam rupture and are part of the governance structure, but they have a broader scope of action and attributions beyond the reparation. Examples include the three Brazilian levels of government (federal, state, and municipal), basin committees, regulatory institutions, and legislative, judiciary and the public prosecutor.

The Panel used a tailored approach to present the recommendations to main stakeholders and policymakers, promoting in-depth meetings, discussions, and joint events. Similarly, to ensure that the recommendations reached a broader audience, such as influencers, the Panel organised webinars and participated in scientific events. The Panel expected these strategies to foster engagement and bring the stakeholders to a common vision. It was hoped that these stakeholders would ultimately use and implement the Panel\u2019s recommendations according to their interest, mandate, and possibilities. Over time, the ToC evolved to go beyond Renova, aiming to reach a broader range of primary stakeholders such as state governments and the Rio Doce Watershed Committee. The Panel began to engage more directly with these groups in 2020. At that time, it was becoming clear that Renova would be unable to act on all the Panel\u2019s recommendations, since many recommendations required broader governmental and societal engagement. The ToC articulated the way in which the Panel would have to balance the demands of different actors while maintaining its independence. Managing such demands and the Panel\u2019s independence required constant vigilance. From the outset, the Panel\u2019s approach was to define the central issues and develop its recommendations, drawing upon contemporary peer- reviewed scientific literature and other publicly accessible sources.

The full list of issue or thematic selection criteria is listed in Box 3, below: 17 An issue or theme would be considered \u2018high\u2019 priority only if it passed the first three criteria and at least three of the remaining eight. Prioritisation was done in-house and based on the consensus view of Panel members. Their detailed scientific knowledge of the critical problems facing the basin and its peoples helped to identify the themes that needed to be addressed. Consensus was often achieved following extensive debate among Panel members. Once prioritised, the Chair selected an interdisciplinary core group of Panel members who were tasked to develop draft recommendations and the accompanying justification for further discussion. The leader of this core group was responsible for the paper\u2019s structure following consultation with the other Panel members and for delegating specific responsibilities to other core group members. This draft outline was then discussed at an alignment meeting with Renova\u2019s technical staff to determine whether the paper would meet the information requirements of the Foundation and other key stakeholders. The core group then began the academic research through peer-reviewed and internationally recognised publications. The research might include publicly available studies by Renova or other agencies, as well as reports from the consulting companies that had been contracted by the public prosecutor\u2019s office to review the restoration\u2019s progress. Even when Renova did not agree with a theme, the Panel\u2019s independence enabled it to proceed if it felt the theme was relevant to the broader restoration programme. Thematic Report number 2 (May et al., 2020) was one such example. Covering the impact of climate change on the basin\u2019s long-term restoration, the Panel proceeded with its preparation on the grounds that it was consistent with global concern and the impacts of regional climatic events. The Panel\u2019s work was invariably seen as independent, technical, and scientifically grounded. This was partly because the Panel members were well-known leaders in their respective fields. Some had taught or worked with decision-makers at Renova or in government agencies while they were at university or in other roles. Just as important, the Panel relied almost exclusively on peer- reviewed and internationally recognised publications. It focused on strategic, longer-term issues relating to the reparation, rather than engaging in detailed analysis of the day-to-day issues. The Panel initially thought they could produce a substantial volume of papers in short order, but this was simply not the case. The issues were complex. Documents required every Panel member to sign off. And IUCN publication guidelines contained multiple steps. This slow delivery frustrated both Renova and the Panel. Future Panels may wish to make the process more agile, to avoid overpromising and under-delivering. The multidisciplinary character of the Panel, and the part-time nature of Panel members\u2019 involvement could also interfere with timelines. Time commitments were flexible, allowing time for revision and reflection, and deadlines were not always strict. When necessary, for example, timelines were modified so that Panel members could visit sites or meet with stakeholders. The dynamic nature of the restoration also meant that Panel members sometimes needed to incorporate new information as it emerged. In 2021, the Panel\u2019s modus operandi changed when Renova requested a new methodology for ex post impact assessments in the marine and coastal areas. Since a member of the Panel \u2013 Professor Luis S\u00e1nchez \u2013 is widely known as one of the most important academic specialists in this area, the Panel agreed to carry out the 18 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL study to help advance the restoration in the affected coastal areas. This led the Panel to adopt a different mode of engagement with Renova staff, although without relinquishing its independence. The Panel\u2019s new approach enabled a constructive dialogue between the Panel and Renova\u2019s Impact Curatorship and Biodiversity teams. Professor S\u00e1nchez led successive workshops at which Panel members collaborated with Renova to further elaborate the methodology for the impact assessment. This process was the basis for producing the fifth and final Thematic Report, which presented the methodology for assessing environmental impacts on coastal and marine environments (S\u00e1nchez, et al., 2022).

This was true for the Rio Doce Panel, which benefitted from the support of IUCN\u2019s well-organised, professional support staff at internal meetings and for regular communication with Renova and others. Based in Bras\u00edlia and at the organisation\u2019s headquarters in Switzerland, the IUCN staff ensured that the Panel was able to access the most current peer-reviewed studies as well as media reports and offered insights into the perspectives of different actors and decision-makers. The support staff also managed the complex planning of site visits and meetings, both internal and external, all of which were overseen impeccably. Without the support and legitimacy of IUCN, the Panel would not have been as effective in its analysis and communications. The monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL) related to Panel outputs and recommendations were an added burden for IUCN staff, but the Panel was then able to systematically track the uptake of its recommendations by different stakeholders. The inclusion of a full-time MEL officer and the elaboration of the ToC were key decisions that shaped the Panel\u2019s success. These might usefully be replicated early in the organisation of any future ISTAP. The IUCN communication staff played a critical role in ensuring that the Panel had regular, updated access to all the relevant articles that appeared in the printed and online media, including items appearing in the local and regional, national and international press. The IUCN communications team was also responsible for communication with the press on the Panel\u2019s behalf, using different formats and media to promote public awareness of the Panel\u2019s existence as well as of its activities and recommendations, releasing all reports both in Portuguese and in English. To avoid undue duplication and mixed signals, the Panel Chair took responsibility for all direct substantive engagement with the press, while a targeted communication and outreach strategy optimised dissemination of the Panel\u2019s work to stakeholders by seeking forms for interaction that would reinforce the key messages. The editorial and layout experience of IUCN country and headquarters staff ensured the quality of the reports and their visual appeal. IUCN Members in Brazil and other parts of Latin America were consulted at the outset and informed about the progress Panel\u2019s work. Some Members expressed concern about a partnership with major mining companies in the wake of Brazil\u2019s worst environmental disaster, fearing consequences for IUCN\u2019s institutional integrity and reputation. However, the Panel Chair had impeccable credentials and was trusted by the environmental community. No formal objection was lodged. The Panel kept the international expert community and other stakeholders informed about their work through regular presentations at annual conferences of the International Association for Impact Assessment (IAIA), roundtables at the IUCN World Conservation Congress, and regional IUCN meetings. Panel members also participated in conferences to discuss their findings and stimulate broader awareness.

Finally, the Panel\u2019s experience reinforced the critical importance for ISTAPs of listening to the people, communities, and organisations affected by the disaster, as well as analysts in research institutions, non-governmental organisation (NGOs), universities, and the media. Hearing from those who suffered the consequences of the dam collapse, as they explained their grievances, brought home the full weight of the tragedy as well as the difficulties they face in being heard by the institutions that should be responsible for their well-being. 4 SUPPORT FROM IUCN AND OTHER ACTORS 21 At the outset, the Renova Foundation was composed of a relatively small cadre of highly motivated, idealistic leaders, and specialists. But as the largest of the 42 programmes swung into action, and their associated funding increased, Renova grew into one of the region\u2019s largest employers. It was one of the few private organisations in the world to have been tasked with the restoration of a damaged ecosystem and economy after a major environmental and social catastrophe. Over time, Renova evolved as it sought to build a better operational structure and increase its capacity to deliver the 42 programmes. However, this led to increasing compartmentalisation along the lines set out in the TTAC, a factor that was subsequently reinforced as many of the programmes became subject to judicial review. Renova\u2019s exponential growth in addressing the TTAC\u2019s increasingly compartmentalised programmes made the Panel\u2019s work more complex. How to engage with the large number of technically specialised departments and promote an integrated landscape approach and a long-term vision in such a highly compartmentalised framework? 5 WORKING WITH RENOVA: LEARNING BY DOING Above: Restoration work on the church affected by mud in Paracatu de Baixo, Minas Gerais.

These included the CIF, some of the technical chambers that advise it, the public prosecutor\u2019s office, local governments, academic institutions, non-governmental organisations including some that were advising the affected communities, and the CBH-Doce. Renova\u2019s high staff turnover added another layer of complexity. This might have impeded continuity in stakeholder relations and threatened the institutional knowledge base. However, the Renova staff who served as go-betweens for relationships built over five years of Panel activities, remained more stable. From the outset, the Panel was connected to the Institutional Relations and Governance teams at Renova, whose staff and consultants were relatively constant throughout much of the period. They accompanied the Panel on field visits and assisted IUCN with the logistics and programming of face-to-face meetings. The Renova staff tasked with accompanying the Panel offered regular updates on key issues emerging during the restoration and informed the Panel on whether these issues remained relevant. While the Panel\u2019s objectives remained constant since the TTAC was signed, Renova had to adapt to new realities, and this led the Panel to modify its own strategy.

When the 39.2 million m3 of tailings flowed downstream into the Rio Doce, they affected land and human settlements along 670 km of river as well as extensive coastal and marine areas. The disaster had multiple direct and indirect impacts on physical and chemical conditions in the river, on the biota and their maintenance processes, and on the living conditions, economy and society of people living along the river and coastal areas. Given the complexity of the disaster, the vast amount of information generated, and controversies relating to the interpretation and understanding of the data, the Panel decided to rely exclusively on publicly available sources, with a preference for peer-reviewed journals. Many publications were devoted to the disaster, while volumes of consultancy studies were prepared for Renova, the public prosecutors\u2019 offices, and the courts. Much of this was made available online. To ensure independence and transparency, the Panel did not cite unpublished materials including those prepared for Renova and other entities. Renova and its parent companies questioned this approach since they had invested heavily in the research. However, much of this work had not been made publicly available and the Panel opted not to cite these sources. Nearly seven years have passed since the disaster, and there is still no comprehensive analysis of the environmental and socioeconomic impacts. Renova, the public prosecutors\u2019 office, and others have contracted a large number of studies, and peer-reviewed articles have been published in academic journals. But up to the time of this publication no overall synthesis has been published. Similarly, no overall assessment of the reparations has been carried out. The Renova website offers a month- by-month progress report on the programmes, but these have tended to focus on inputs and outputs (amounts spent, numbers of people employed, areas reforested, and so on) rather than on the achievement of the TTAC\u2019s long-term objectives of returning socio-environmental conditions to their pre-disaster condition. When the Panel was convened, therefore, its first priority was to prepare an overview of the situation in the Rio Doce Basin, applying the Panel members\u2019 specialist knowledge. The first thematic report (TR01 \u2013 S\u00e1nchez et al., 2018) synthesised the available information, providing an objective summary of the disaster together with background on the affected regions. Its general recommendations \u2013 which may well be applicable in other, similar situations \u2013 focused on the need for a comprehensive assessment of the impacts and the use of an adaptive management strategy. This latter should start with an evaluation of the mitigation programmes together with the potential threats \u2013 including climate change \u2013 that could undermine their expected outcomes. It also emphasised the importance of managing and disseminating knowledge gained from the disaster response. Subsequently, some of the recommendations conveyed by the initial thematic report were further developed \u2013 with agreement from Renova \u2013 while others were put aside. Renova or other primary stakeholders did not regard them as a priority, since they were prioritising the short-term goals needed to respond to the direct obligations of the TTAC. For example, the Panel saw adaptive management as essential to the long-term viability of the TTAC programmes, but this approach was rarely employed. The restoration effort appeared insufficiently flexible and unable to respond to the learning process required due to the uncertainties and impracticable timelines. Information management is another important theme in a complex post-disaster situation. The Panel offered to help Renova with the development of a strategy to manage the wealth of knowledge generated by the consultancy studies it had contracted as well as the natural and social science studies published by other organisations such as universities and research institutions. Panel members insisted that an effective strategy for knowledge management would be vital to ensure the legacy of the restoration. However, Renova had already decided to contract other consultants on knowledge management and was preparing to set up regional information centres. To avoid overlap, the Panel\u2019s proposal was dropped. 25 The Panel\u2019s recommendations were initially directed at Renova, though as per the Panel\u2019s ToC, they were also intended to influence government agencies and others involved in the restoration.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "54fa951d-93a4-47b2-a539-febb9bc26a1e": {"__data__": {"id_": "54fa951d-93a4-47b2-a539-febb9bc26a1e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-beef-products-menorcas-custodia-agraria-programme", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ecological Footprint: beef products from Menorca\u2019s Cust\u00f2dia Agr\u00e0ria programme", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-beef-products-menorcas-custodia-agraria-programme", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "64ab6c731df72a3e90596900a66037619df2d26cc9f16e4bf4d6e26b94be6766"}, "2": {"node_id": "85106d00-d92e-42cf-922a-51bcc28fb912", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-beef-products-menorcas-custodia-agraria-programme", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6fd3db8809aa0015740322a7d38370ca5cd99f85aa88005c9175ba1902ec2cf9"}}, "hash": "839fc47eefc56060318485d199b6c59e7c33fa3520bb2cfe23894f87dd512373", "text": "Subsequently the Panel adapted to the complex and changing legal and institutional context and broadened the scope of its recommendations to engage with a range of other stakeholders.

This led to the involvement of federal government agencies, two state governments, the Public Prosecutors\u2019 offices in the two states and at least 40 municipal governments in the reparation. These governments and agencies will eventually have to take responsibility for the maintenance of the long-term programmes. As in other regions of Brazil, local government capacity is often severely constrained by the limited population in many municipalities. More than half the affected municipalities in MG, for instance, have less than 10,000 inhabitants. Local governments lack the resources to manage critical services, such as water supply, wastewater treatment, and the disposal of solid waste. Moreover, while everyone benefits from environmental services, they are not as visible as the community infrastructure that attracts votes, especially in small and rural municipalities. Toward the end of its tenure, the Panel aimed its advice not just at Renova but also at government agencies and the other stakeholders represented in the CIF and Technical Chambers (CT). The relations between Renova and the CIF/CT were often more adversarial than complementary, and this complicated efforts to engage effectively with all parties critical to restoration of the Rio Doce Basin. Further obstacles came from the fact that the TTAC was designed to facilitate a disaster response without waiting for the outcome of lengthy legal proceedings, but disagreements between Renova and the CIF/CT have regularly been referred to court. This led to uncertainty and delays in the restoration programmes. In 2020, the Panel decided to make recommendations on governance issues, focusing on the long-term legacy of restoration in the Rio Doce Basin. Drawing on experience from the Rio Doce and other post-disaster situations, the Panel focused on the need to start with a participatory approach that would allow a broad range of stakeholders \u2013 especially the people most directly affected \u2013 to share their vision for the Rio Doce Basin. Their \u2018buy-in\u2019 to a long-term vision was seen as essential to achieve consensus and commitment regarding the restoration and long-term improvement of the basin, and to eventually facilitate the handover of the programmes from Renova to the agencies that will be responsible for their long-term continuity once Renova\u2019s mandate has been fulfilled. In hindsight, it would have been better to initiate the governance review earlier, helping Renova and other key stakeholders (CIF and CT) to think about the reparation\u2019s long-term goals and the need for early engagement as part of a \u201cpolycentric governance\u201d strategy (Ostrom, 2010). But Renova had been conceived as a temporary arrangement, offering a rapid solution to the most immediate and pressing problems of the restoration. The government and other agencies are expected eventually to take over, continue, and complement the investments and programmes that had been initiated and financed by Renova. 6.2 THE LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT 26 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL One conceptual challenge faced by the Panel was to develop a workable framework for the ex post analysis of the disaster\u2019s environmental impacts. The conventional frameworks for environmental impact analysis (EIA) have primarily been developed for the ex ante determination of the potential impacts of investments, especially in infrastructure, extractive and industrial projects, where data is collected and analysed, and mitigation measures developed, before a project is started. In 2019, Renova\u2019s management team requested support with implementation of a recommendation from the first thematic report (S\u00e1nchez et al., 2018). In response, the Panel submitted a general framework for assessing the environmental and social impacts of disasters, which was well received. This issue paper (IP04 \u2013 S\u00e1nchez et al., 2019) encouraged Renova to establish an Impact Curatorship (Curadoria de Impactos). In 2021 Renova requested the Panel\u2019s help to develop a framework for assessing the impacts of the dam\u2019s collapse on coastal and marine areas. It was agreed that the scope would be limited to environmental impacts \u2013 which in themselves are extremely complex \u2013 and would not cover the social and economic impacts.

The Panel has had to look beyond these existing approaches, however, to develop a systematic, evidence-based framework for ex post EIA in other affected coastal and marine environments. In the study of impacts on coastal and marine areas, the Panel and Renova faced the challenge of working outside the conventional framework for EIA. The challenge was compounded by the absence of reliable data on the pre-disaster situation \u2013 for instance, information on critical areas such as water quality (physical, chemical and biological characteristics). Moreover, it is extremely difficult to distinguish the impacts of the Fund\u00e3o tailings from the cumulative, historical impacts from over 400 years of mining and industrial activity, deforestation of the basin, and contamination from agrochemicals, raw sewage and solid waste. The Panel was able to draw on the available data and were supported by IUCN staff to identify new sources of information from academic journals and other sources to draw inferences regarding the impact of the dam break on coastal and marine habitats. Based on this broad literature review, the Panel emphasised that impact analysis should focus on the medium- to long-term risks to the biota and to human health from dispersal and re-dispersal of the Fund\u00e3o tailings, rather than the immediate impacts after the dam break. 6.3 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ANALYSIS AND BASELINE DATA 27 The TTAC requires the restoration to return conditions to the pre-disaster state as it was in November 2015 (Clause 06.II). However, even if adequate data were available to characterise the ex ante environmental conditions, the Panel took the position that such a \u2018causal nexus\u2019 restriction would be neither feasible nor desirable. Instead, the Panel viewed the restoration as an opportunity to \u2018build back better\u2019, through a wide- ranging programme for the continual recovery of the Rio Doce Basin that could eventually be replicated in Brazil\u2019s other river basins and elsewhere. Renova had been organised to implement the programmes outlined in the TTAC, and the completion of these programmes was the Foundation\u2019s number one priority. However, the TTAC\u2019s emphasis on programme-by-programme implementation led to a compartmentalised approach, which made it more difficult to achieve an overall understanding of the disaster\u2019s impacts and to develop viable long-term solutions for the most chronic and critical impacts. From the start, however, the Panel argued for a more integrated strategy, one that would combine Landscape and S2S approaches. An S2S approach would enable a better understanding of the dynamics between the social, economic and environmental aspects. It would also focus more on the interrelationship between different environmental concerns, such as water quality, wastewater treatment, land use, biodiversity, livelihoods and human health, among others. The integration of Landscape and S2S approaches would therefore allow stakeholders to better understand and plan for the long-term restoration of the Rio Doce Basin, including attention to the estuary, coastal, and marine areas. These approaches should be understood not solely as a theoretical approach but as an innovative set of tools that can combine with participatory stakeholder engagement for an effective restoration plan. 6.4 ADOPTING SOURCE-TO-SEA AND LANDSCAPE APPROACHES 28 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL Below: Parts of the Rio Doce estuary, September 7, 2020.

Early on, however, the Panel did address some of the broader economic development issues in an innovative paper (IP01 \u2013 May et al., 2019), that suggested an alternative vision for the basin, based on more intensive, sustainable agriculture, rural tourism, the vertical integration of value chains, improved standards, and the development of a learning economy to be financed by permanent revolving funds.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "80e3e405-09f3-42e1-b42a-bc429b500ce5": {"__data__": {"id_": "80e3e405-09f3-42e1-b42a-bc429b500ce5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-beef-products-menorcas-custodia-agraria-programme", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ecological Footprint: beef products from Menorca\u2019s Cust\u00f2dia Agr\u00e0ria programme", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-beef-products-menorcas-custodia-agraria-programme", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3ed97c571ef759641499097adbba385d3b84c61cc28980ac5bb1b005dfaa53ee"}, "2": {"node_id": "b7684dde-ff5b-49c4-b43a-f633f155048b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-beef-products-menorcas-custodia-agraria-programme", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bea3473e4a8cb4779dfeb92e51056e32a8715e336329a91db3641d91222bc8af"}}, "hash": "0fff8bef86628e9d720c226fc81508bc19e61bb8e71a8ddb21df4d0c7f531d69", "text": "A second issue paper (IP02 \u2013 Brito et al., 2019) argued that the restoration of inland and coastal fisheries would require a unified decision-making framework to determine when and how the responsible authorities could lift the fishing bans following their imposition in the wake of the disaster.

In principle, Renova responded positively to this idea, and put the approach into practice by involving local people to monitor water quality. Indeed, bulletins on Renova\u2019s website represent a positive example of how information from monitoring programmes can be obtained and presented in a way that is accessible and comprehensible to the general public. However, this citizen science approach did not go much further even though some of the directly affected communities, such as Degredo, a traditional Afro-Brazilian (quilombola) community on the ES coast, possessed the organisation and qualified professionals needed to permit more ambitious participatory monitoring programmes. These could have included the monitoring of flora and fauna, fisheries, and the quality and availability of ground and surface water. 6.5 SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS Below: Rio Doce Panel visiting Instituto Terra and its nursery of native plants used to restore the Rio Doce Basin.

Such impacts are typically seen as a consequence of direct exposure to the tailings, to tailings dust, and to the contamination of water supplies. But human health can also be affected by the consumption of contaminated fish and irrigated vegetables, as well as the social and psychological impact of community displacement, loss of livelihoods and dependence on monthly indemnity payments to displaced households, fishers, artisanal miners, and other affected groups. The Panel recognised that an integrated treatment of human and ecosystem health would be beneficial for people affected by the disaster. This was thus a serious lacuna in the restoration process. Renova staff have tried to lay the groundwork for a programme of Integrated Environmental and Human Health Management (GAISMA). However, the judicial decisions have required that Renova treat these issues separately. As a result, this integration has been omitted from most remediation and restoration efforts over the seven years since the dam break. The Panel did, however, draw attention to the continued need for an integrative perspective. For example, its final Issue Paper recommended the One Health approach (IP05 \u2013 Alonso et al., 2020). This approach shows how best to coordinate programmes, policies, legislation and research in order to unlock collaboration between the human and animal health and ecosystem conservation sectors, thereby improving public health. IP05 addressed the wider links between human health and the environment, recommending support for public health monitoring and the exchange of information between the formal public health system (SUS, from Portuguese acronym Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade) and organisations in the fields of community and environmental health. These recommendations were not immediately taken up, but public health was later included as a priority theme in the TTAC\u2019s renegotiation. Additional studies would provide a more complete assessment of the disaster\u2019s impacts on human health in the areas most directly affected, but they remain stymied due to dissent in the judicial arena. 6.6 HEALTH IMPACTS Below: Group of people on a boat at the mouth of the Rio Doce.

Photo taken during the Rio Doce Panel\u2019s visit in July 2022. Photo: IUCN/ Rio Doce Panel archive 32 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL When the Panel began its work, it did not prioritise the potential cumulative impacts from tailings deposition and sediment flows on the marine and freshwater biota, but it was agreed that, should the need arise, additional expertise would be sought, either through an external consultant or by adding an extra member to the Panel. As discussed above, however, Renova later sought the Panel\u2019s advice on how to better understand and manage the environmental impacts on the coastal and marine areas. Meanwhile, Renova had contracted a detailed assessment and monitoring of biota in the estuary and adjacent coastal region to a consortium of universities and scientific researchers in Esp\u00edrito Santo, along with parallel studies by the Brazilian Foundation for Sustainable Development (FBDS) and consultants assigned by UNESCO. The emerging complexity and conflicting scientific findings from these overlapping studies pointed to the continued risk from deposition of the tailings. Given the lack of a common basis for describing and assessing impacts, and the need to systematise impacts into a common structure, Renova and the Panel agreed to work on the development of a systematic framework that would enable interpretation of the results generated by these and other studies.

This suspicion has been compounded by the pressure to take decisions and implement them in a timely fashion, since the disaster deprived people of essential environmental services, such as potable water, fisheries and housing. Here, the Panel offers some general suggestions that might be useful for future ISTAPs and Rio Doce stakeholders to help prioritise issues, achieve consensus and implement sustainable, efficient and long-term solutions. 34 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL Left: Aerial view of the Rio Doce below the city bridge.

All rights reserved to NITRO Historias Visuais 35 The effects of the Fund\u00e3o Dam disaster were complex and the process of recovery has to be sustainable in the long run. To ensure such results, the process itself is as important as the outcomes. Thus, successful engagement with government and civil society is key to a sustainable and lasting restoration. The Panel focused its work on issues that contribute to the long- term sustainability of the basin and its inhabitants. To achieve long-term sustainability, these issues depend on successful intervention and engagement with local and regional institutions. Man-made and natural disasters can have devastating impacts on the local population, their economies and social infrastructure, but they can also offer an opportunity for longer-term improvement. Recovery is not simply a return to prior conditions. The opportunities should be mapped and planned with input from diverse stakeholders \u2013 especially those that have been most directly affected \u2013 to achieve a common vision for the future. The full benefits of a shared vision may not be felt for decades. The socioeconomic benefits of changes to economic structure, education, and sanitation may not be felt in the short term, but in the long term they are essential for the continual improvement of the environment, economy and social conditions.

Consultation and engagement are key to achieve a shared vision and to the development of viable programmes with an exit strategy that will ensure the restoration\u2019s continuity and sustainability. Such investments may not have immediately visible results, but they are essential for human and ecosystem health. When adapted to the specific realities of other regions and countries, this model could be applied to most post-disaster scenarios. It could also be adapted to major investments in infrastructure or extractive projects. A participatory process may appear more complex and time-consuming, but it is the only way to guarantee a process of continual improvement that will satisfy the expectations and needs of the people affected. In the Rio Doce case, affected communities were not involved in drawing up the TTAC or in the subsequent decision- making, and this has exacerbated the mistrust and conflicts generated throughout the restoration. Some of this was inevitable, but it could have been lessened by more effective engagement with the different groups of people affected. In the immediate aftermath of disaster, short-term solutions are required to cover people\u2019s immediate needs, reinstating access to potable water, energy supply and housing. Once this has been achieved, and people\u2019s confidence restored through short-term actions, it becomes necessary to start thinking more strategically. This requires longer-term process-oriented programmes that allow for continual improvement. Even shorter-term restoration activities should encourage participation and 7.1 PROMOTE A LONG-TERM, SHARED VISION FOR CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT Below: In the image, a person driving a boat at the mouth of the Rio Doce.

By producing rapid results and \u2018quick wins\u2019, engagement can build trust between the different stakeholders. The Panel consistently recommended the need for affected people to have the opportunity to participate in decisions about the restoration. In the case of the Fund\u00e3o Dam disaster, the decision-making structure established under the TTAC led to drawn-out discussions that extended from federal and state government agencies to the public prosecutors and eventually to the judiciary. It lacked the mechanisms that would allow greater participation by those most directly affected, thus limiting their engagement and commitment to the restoration programmes. Participation is not easy \u2013 but if decision- making is done only by the existing governmental bureaucracy, then it becomes more difficult to empower society and to achieve the long-term changes needed for \u2018building back better\u2019. In the beginning, the Panel focused on making recommendations to Renova. As time went on, however, the Panel realised the importance of engaging with other stakeholders, since different actors had to be involved to achieve lasting results through a more participatory process. One of the lessons that may be applicable to other ISTAPs, therefore, is not to focus exclusively on one or more specific stakeholders, but to share the recommendations more widely and engage directly with all the relevant stakeholders. The Panel had been slow to work with agencies other than Renova, but during the preparation of TR02 (May et al., 2020) Renova expressed its discomfort with managing issues related to climate change. This helped the Panel appreciate the importance of engaging with a broader group of actors. Below: Rio Doce Panel and IUCN secretariat during internal meeting during visit to the Rio Doce Basin.

This underscores an important issue for future ISTAPs. Their need for independence prevents them from acting as an intermediary between business or government agencies and the people directly affected. However, an ISTAP should be able to recognise the concerns of affected people, give voice to their aspirations, and encourage the relevant agencies to engage with them more effectively. 7.2 RECOGNISE THE POWER OF LEADERSHIP AND COLLABORATION Right: Yolanda Kakabadse, Chair of the Rio Doce Panel, during the launching of the 5th article of the series Issue Paper. Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais. March 2020. Photo: IUCN/Rio Doce Panel archive 38 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL 7.3 LOOK FOR INTEGRATED, MULTIDISCIPLINARY SOLUTIONS The desire for quick results may lead to the compartmentalisation of discussions and solutions, rather than calling for an integrated approach and acknowledging the complexity of the situation and the wide range of stakeholders. Many restoration issues are in fact connected and the existence of parallel structures can interfere with one another. For example, if the water is contaminated, then the fish may also be contaminated, with implications for people\u2019s livelihoods, nutrition, and health. This is obvious, but when different departments or agencies are responsible for water quality, biota, public health and the economy, it becomes more difficult to attain an integrated approach. The responses of different agencies may even contradict one another as in the case of the fisheries ban discussed in IP02 (Brito et al., 2019). Technical discussions can get lost in minor details that impede the search for effective solutions when they should be considered together, taking a broader landscape perspective to address issues that affect local welfare. The Panel consistently stressed the value of a landscape approach, rather than compartmentalised solutions. Renova did not fully internalise this view, but other stakeholders did acknowledge the need for integrated solutions to the chronic problems facing the Rio Doce Basin and associated coastal and marine areas. In this respect, the Panel played an important role, presenting the S2S approach together with landscape perspectives in a specific thematic report focused on the integration of biodiversity and water quality (TR03 \u2013 Brito et al., 2021). The S2S framework is a practical approach that has been tried and tested, not only in the Fund\u00e3o case, but also in other similar situations. The S2S principle could be applied elsewhere to restore and improve the environmental, social, and economic situation of a disaster-affected region. The impact analysis and the design of medium and long-term measures should avoid a piecemeal approach. Instead, they should adopt a broader perspective, combining landscape and S2S approaches from the start. This makes it easier to respond to the environmental, social, financial, economic, and cultural aspects of the affected region. The approach encompasses not only the spatial dimension (terrestrial and/or coastal areas), but also key flows \u2013 water, biota, sediment, pollutants, materials and ecosystem services. The S2S concept was first introduced by the Panel in its Issue Paper No. 3 (IP03 - Barbosa et al., 2019), in which it was proposed that Renova consider installing a permanent floodgate in the Rio Pequeno to protect waters of the Juparan\u00e3 lake \u2013 an important water source in the lower Rio Doce \u2013 from pollution by the Rio Doce in flooding conditions. The floodgate would have an opening and closing system to control the volume of water in rainy and dry periods to ensure connectivity between ecosystems. The affected territory covers a vast area in two Brazilian states, with distinct social, economic, and cultural characteristics. Both states have been degraded by centuries of extractive activities, unsustainable agricultural practices and contamination with raw sewage and solid waste. Rather than seeking a return to the pre-disaster situation as a baseline, it would be better to seek a negotiated solution that would improve conditions and kick-start a process of continual improvement in the region. This requires engagement with all the relevant parties. The Panel addressed the baseline considerations in TR04 (Maroun et al., 2021) and acknowledged the vital importance of a common vision for the region\u2019s future rather than a return to the pre-disaster conditions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "de6417b0-0b4f-48df-93c9-1ac2485159fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "de6417b0-0b4f-48df-93c9-1ac2485159fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-beef-products-menorcas-custodia-agraria-programme", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ecological Footprint: beef products from Menorca\u2019s Cust\u00f2dia Agr\u00e0ria programme", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-beef-products-menorcas-custodia-agraria-programme", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bfdf5529f6ea3eb8add31337ecec8b8d90d70a23e38d2c311086262762ecae42"}, "2": {"node_id": "7d763b7e-23ef-42d8-abb6-542d98a22373", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ecological-footprint-beef-products-menorcas-custodia-agraria-programme", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e15fc3a6987f8e6183a8a7e6848df2e5d34a7f28b4da6b497c343ebfbcedd663"}}, "hash": "1fce71d91a60121e329bcb3e3eac53919343ab7942d5c0aac30971c670ef3788", "text": "This recommendation was discussed with various stakeholders, but in retrospect the Panel should have highlighted the importance of this approach from the start.

The Panel also recommended that Renova support the establishment of a long-term fiduciary fund to finance continued efforts in the basin (IP01 \u2013 May et al., 2019) investing some of the resources originally intended for reparation. However, Renova rejected the concept on the grounds that it was not consistent with the mandate for immediate and short-term results. However, landscape analysis by Renova, UNESCO, the World Resources Institute (WRI), and other organisations have recommended that additional resources be directed toward a broader basin-level approach, including systematic analysis of the long-term development scenarios. 39 7.5 CONSIDER CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGHOUT The climate emergency threatens ecosystems and human well-being. Emerging diseases, water rationing, droughts, and floods will become more frequent in the coming years. Fundamental changes to the economy and social values will be vital to avoid and manage these challenges. Climate change is likely to aggravate the degradation of fragile and degraded landscapes such as the Rio Doce Basin. Restoration plans and programmes should share a common climate strategy, covering both assessment and adaptation to the effects of climate change. The Panel needed to persuade Renova that climate change issues were within its remit. Renova had been doubtful on the grounds that, first, climate change would only impact the region in the distant future, and second, that the impacts of climate change were distinct from those caused by the dam collapse. This underscores the tension between the short and long term, and between the causal impacts of the dam collapse and the need to address the underlying environmental conditions. Renova and its Board of Directors strongly contested the idea, for example, that climate change could be the cause of the extraordinary storm and rainfall events associated with the repeated deposition of tailings along the river. The Panel insisted that the theme was relevant and discussed its recommendations from TR02 (May et al., 2020) with different stakeholders. The process of restoration should consider the long-term governance of the affected region, noting that permanent institutions and those responsible for the restoration may have overlapping and complementary roles to play. The restoration programmes have generated studies, data, information systems, and especially capacity to execute restoration actions, but these may be lost if they are not integrated into the permanent structures of governance for the maintenance of nature\u2019s services. In principle, there should be a balance between tasks assigned to the restoration programme\u2019s institutions and to the long-term, permanent institutions that will eventually continue the restoration\u2019s programmes and investments. Both CIF and Renova have engaged with permanent institutions such as the Rio Doce Watershed Committee, universities, and NGOs in the area, viewing them as valuable sources of expertise. Similarly, the Panel also prioritised permanent institutions when it reached out to other groups of stakeholders. Early on, the Panel completed a stakeholder mapping and analysis of the impacted region (see discussion of the Panel\u2019s ToC, above), allowing the Panel to understand which permanent institutions might manage selected programmes in the longer-term. During the preparation of the thematic report on governance (TR04 - Maroun et al., 2021), this analysis was updated to include a broader range of stakeholders. Key findings were also discussed with various institutions beyond Renova. The key lesson for other ISTAPs is to initiate a process of stakeholder mapping at the outset and to update it regularly. This will provide clear understanding of the governance roles of each actor or agency in the affected region. Understanding the involvement of these actors is fundamental to the early integration of restoration efforts, guaranteeing continuity and long-term improvement. 7.4 ENGAGE AND EMPOWER THE PERMANENT INSTITUTIONS Right: In the image, a stretch of the Rio Doce near its mouth.

This offers the opportunity for feedback and discussion and allows Panel members to learn from comparative perspectives and other cases, as well as permitting the Panel to share its work and insights with different stakeholders. To what extent should the Panel be involved in the definition of solutions and moving them forward? The Panel\u2019s distinct approach recognised the urgency of the situation as well as the need to consult on the direction of the papers.

Panel members met in person twice a year and held videoconferences at the end of every month. This helped to maintain the Panel\u2019s cohesion and the quality of interaction between its members. It also kept them up to date on the development of the thematic reports and issue papers and the reparation process itself. The Panel also held debriefing sessions following meetings and systematised the relevant information for use in subsequent analyses. Panel members met with the Chair at the end of each face-to-face meeting to evaluate each other\u2019s performance and consider future pathways. Panel members also found it useful to divide into core groups when developing drafts of the thematic reports and issue papers. However, Panel members found it difficult to review these products if more than one paper was being prepared simultaneously. Future ISTAPs are advised to discuss and consider this balance and to review it from time to time, considering the expertise of the Panel members and the need for their participation in selected documents. ISTAPs are also advised to generate shorter, more concise products, even carefully presented intermediate products, rather than high- quality, professionally edited reports that are outdated by the time they are presented.

The negotiations around the restoration and related processes were often extremely complex, since the multiple actors were often suspicious of each other and held distinct and often conflicting views. Moreover, the discussions tended to focus on specific, compartmentalised concerns. Despite the need for short-term solutions to respond to people\u2019s immediate needs, it is also essential to think about solutions to the long-term impacts caused by disaster. An ISTAP can influence the process by highlighting the need for a long-term, integrated perspective, even if implementation of the recommendations is neither direct nor immediate. An ISTAP\u2019s influence may not be felt immediately by stakeholders in a disaster restoration, but it does endure. ISTAPs can also influence important processes indirectly. One of the Panel\u2019s main legacies was the publication of impartial and independent analysis and technical advice that could be used by actors in different contexts, beyond that of the restoration of the Rio Doce watershed. By publishing thematic reports and issue papers throughout its five years of operation, the Panel contributed to discussions to change practices in the sector and to mainstream global concerns, such as climate change. 42 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL In the image, parts of the Rio Doce estuary. Renova Foundation. September 7, 2020. Photo: All rights reserved to NITRO Historias Visuais The Panel\u2019s recommendations were grounded in globally relevant scientific literature, and they reflected a long-term approach and landscape perspective. This can be adapted to similar disaster situations, whose frequency is increasing rapidly with climate change. The Panel\u2019s process for developing recommendations was as important as the recommendations themselves. Knowledge of topics and methodologies that would never have been considered without participation of an ISTAP became widely disseminated in the process of consultation with stakeholders. This holds true for the S2S approach, an innovative methodology introduced by the Panel for assessment and integrated management of river basins.

March 2019. Photo: IUCN/Rio Doce Panel archive FOREWORD The socio-environmental and economic tragedy caused by the Fund\u00e3o dam failure in the city of Mariana (in the state of Minas Gerais) caused impacts that remain seven years later. Still, it is also important to recognise that many initiatives were \u2013 and continue to be \u2013 adopted successfully. Dealing with the biggest mining event of its kind on the planet required organised efforts proportional to the magnitude of the damage caused by the dam failure. This led to the signing of Terms of Transaction and Conduct Adjustment (TTAC, Termo de Transa\u00e7\u00e3o e Ajustamento de Conduta) and the adoption of a complex governance model, in which the Renova Foundation is the executing institution. In this context, an independent panel of specialists was established, called the Rio Doce Panel and linked to IUCN, one of the oldest and most respected non-governmental entities in the world devoted to the conservation of nature and the protection of the environment, with a history of significant achievements. The creation of the Panel, a group composed of experts from Brazil and abroad under the coordination of Yolanda Kakabadse \u2013 a former environment minister of Ecuador and internationally respected conservation leader and policy maker \u2013 was extremely relevant from an institutional perspective, as the Panel would act autonomously and independently and advise decision-makers involved in the governance system behind the reparation process. Thematic reports prepared by the Panel outlined expertise and best international practices for the reparation of areas, which had been affected by tragedies similar to the Fund\u00e3o Dam failure. The reports also enabled an ambience of reflection that would have been impossible within the Foundation\u2019s day-to-day work and immense pressure from repressed demands, court-mandated responsibilities, and dysfunctional aspects of their internal and external governance. By enabling discussions on essential topics and producing high-level technical-scientific documents, the Panel has provided a set of inputs to assist the Renova Foundation in remedying the disaster\u2019s damage. By bringing a new and outside perspective, the Panel contributed to the Foundation and other actors in decision-making, complementing the existing work, strengthening strategic planning, and expanding the Foundation\u2019s thinking on the best available alternatives to address the region\u2019s socio-environmental and economic problems, taking into account, primarily, the assistance to those affected and the environmental recovery in the areas of water quality and biodiversity. The Panel always conducted its interdisciplinary work in an integrated fashion and in coordination with the various stakeholders involved in restoring the Rio Doce. In this important document, the Panel shares its reflections and lessons learned during its five years of work. Together with IUCN, the Panel leaves behind it an important legacy for current and future reparations, in view of the long-term nature of these actions. Jos\u00e9 Carlos Carvalho Former Minister of Environment, Brazil V Independent Scientific and Technical Advisory Panels (ISTAPs) have been established to help address a range of controversial conservation and development issues that have emerged with growing frequency and complexity at national and global levels. This report is intended to contribute to discussion of ways to improve the effectiveness of ISTAPs by outlining lessons learned by the Rio Doce Panel, an ISTAP set up in the wake of the 2015 Fund\u00e3o iron tailings Dam collapse, widely considered one of Brazil\u2019s worst environmental disasters. The multidisciplinary seven-member Panel worked from September 2017 to December 2022 following its establishment under a joint agreement between the Renova Foundation, which was created to restore socio-environmental conditions after the disaster, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Working in a complex and often adversarial governance system, the Panel evolved over time from focusing on restoration to looking at the broader implications of environmental management of the basin and the wider Rio Doce catchment area, as well as engaging with a broader array of stakeholders.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a365a025-3191-4401-9dbe-dfdeec598291": {"__data__": {"id_": "a365a025-3191-4401-9dbe-dfdeec598291", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-extended-version", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Impact Report of the Alliance for Mediterranean Nature & Culture (extended version)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-extended-version", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7eb60330ab8b9e52e4a8357ca129872a996aa00f680d9170db0179cd4daa31d4"}, "2": {"node_id": "5fb7df74-7a9b-4294-bb3d-e7bfb07c6ab4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-extended-version", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eff062b5e4efda1f0c14857bba4a427d6487a410cf253711abbb28a4732b0b8f"}}, "hash": "64adba835f23dc3e636f932894ee7f22e29b5e3f287cfbf5a994d99c95057d01", "text": "The Panel\u2019s recommendations were based on three complementary perspectives: a long-term vision, a landscape approach, and the application of Nature-based Solutions (NbS).

The Panel sought to influence the long-term outcomes of the restoration through its written recommendations and direct engagement with key stakeholders. Although the uptake of the Panel\u2019s recommendations has been neither direct nor immediate, its influence in the region is likely to have a greater effect in the long-term.

The dam contained around 52 million cubic meters (m3) of iron mining residues from the Samarco mining company\u2019s Germano Complex, jointly owned by two of the largest multinational mining corporations, Vale S.A and BHP Billiton (BHP). Reportedly, 39.2 million m3 of these tailings washed into the Santar\u00e9m reservoir, immediately below the dam, creating a wave of liquid mud that poured into the Gualaxo do Norte and do Carmo rivers, both headwaters of the Rio Doce. The mass of liquified tailings tore away soil, vegetation and sediments from the upper reaches of the river, affecting around 2,000 hectares belonging to some 200 rural properties and destroying 1,469 hectares of natural vegetation. The mud and debris demolished the villages of Bento Rodrigues and Paracatu de Baixo, damaging homes and community infrastructure further downstream in Gesteira and Barra Longa. The tailings also reached the Rio Doce estuary, 670 km below the dam, and created a plume, which spread along extensive coastal and marine areas, particularly along the shallow coastal platform. The disaster claimed 19 lives and physically displaced at least 320 families. As a consequence of the disaster, Samarco\u2019s iron ore extraction activities were halted for five years,1 and fishing remains banned in much of the basin, affecting employment and food security. Those displaced from the communities by the wave of mud were provided with temporary housing in Mariana and other urban areas in the basin, a situation that has lasted up to the time of this publication. Right after the disaster, local governments were forced to cut off the public supplies of water obtained from the Rio Doce and its tributaries, and to substitute them using tank trucks to deliver water to people in many of the towns and rural communities located downstream. In an effort to mitigate the impacts and restore the areas affected by the Fund\u00e3o Dam collapse, the Brazilian Federal Government, the States of Minas Gerais and Esp\u00edrito Santo, Samarco, Vale and BHP signed a detailed agreement on 2 March 2016, known as the Terms of Transaction and Conduct Adjustment (TTAC). 1 In late 2020, Samarco received the environmental licenses required to restart its iron mining, ore concentration and transport along a 400 km slurry pipeline, and pelletising operations at a port facility which it had installed in the late 1970s near Vit\u00f3ria, the state capital of Esp\u00edrito Santo. By mid-2022, the company had returned to 26 percent of its prior operating capacity. Samarco no longer deposits its coarse tailings behind dams but is drying and piling them for eventual use as construction materials. The fine tailings are being stored in an exhausted open pit. 1. WHY WAS THE RIO DOCE PANEL CREATED?

Photo: Felipe Werneck/Ibama 1 The TTAC set out 42 programmes for reparation and compensation, and established an independent entity called the Renova Foundation to create, manage, and implement these programmes. Samarco\u2018s parent companies \u2013 Vale and BHP \u2013 would finance Renova, while an Inter-Federative Committee (CIF) would oversee the restoration process. The CIF included representatives from federal and state government agencies as well as municipal governments, representatives of affected populations and the civil society organisations that provide them with technical assistance. Together, Renova and the CIF were made formally responsible for the restoration, in consultation with affected communities. The idea of installing a specialist panel to provide independent technical advice on the restoration process took shape in the two years following the disaster. The objective proposed by the leadership of Renova and Samarco\u2019s parent companies was to identify global corporate best practices and science- based perspectives on the restoration. In December 2015, BHP staff members consulted with various international organisations that were concerned about the environmental and social impacts of the Fund\u00e3o Dam collapse. IUCN was among the organisations visited by the BHP staff members tasked with managing the restoration efforts. Although IUCN was unable to provide technical support to address the immediate short-term mitigation and restoration activities, the organisation had experience with the creation of ISTAPs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "88bb303d-4454-4791-82d8-ebd53fb79cff": {"__data__": {"id_": "88bb303d-4454-4791-82d8-ebd53fb79cff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-extended-version", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Impact Report of the Alliance for Mediterranean Nature & Culture (extended version)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-extended-version", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "48676d4395487399f2b854abc6e8aefbf8c1d594f1a906ee25c33578e07d707a"}, "2": {"node_id": "8259f211-b5a3-4056-a514-9c269b17a848", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-extended-version", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "579da79e5c385eeec4e9db9c58942afe109113468f1e06c0d9c77e16c5d34fdc"}}, "hash": "8564fe71850ad525ff8ab22d48fe1b6a799b884eeade635200bd8d9aab7f1860", "text": "This initial consultation led to a dialogue between IUCN and BHP, that eventually led to the decision to create an independent panel.

They can help multiple stakeholders understand situations characterised by complexity, uncertainty, and cost and can contribute to effective and efficient decision- making. Organisations which have recently created such groups include the Global Environment Facility\u2019s Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP), the World Health Organization\u2019s Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee (STAC), and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change\u2019s Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP). Such panels are typically convened under conditions of uncertainty. The number of unforeseen environmental disasters has been growing, for example, linked to climate change, extinctions, ozone depletion, mine- tailing dam collapses, and more. Advisory panels are also a regular feature of complex infrastructure projects. Other IUCN panels have been set up to address the impacts of major oil and gas investments in Nigeria (IUCN Niger Delta Panel) and in Russia (IUCN Western Gray Whale Advisory Panel).3 Although some IUCN Members saw partnership with mining enterprises as contrary to the reputational 2 IUCN (2014), Procedures for establishing and managing IUCN-supported Independent Scientific & Technical Advisory Panels, https://iucn.org/sites/default/files/2022-11/iucn_istap_procedures_2014.pdf 3 See: https://www.iucn.org/western-gray-whale-advisory-panel and https://www.iucn.org/theme/business-and-biodiversity/our-work/business- partnerships-projects/shell/iucn-niger-delta-panel 4 The Brumadinho disaster led to 270 deaths, mostly employees of Vale who were in the company cafeteria located immediately below the dam when it collapsed upon them. 5 Global Tailings Review (2020) \u2013 Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management - https://globaltailingsreview.org/global-industry-standard/ - IUCN was part of the Tailings Review Advisory Group interests of the organisation, there was widespread support for \u2013 and acceptance of \u2013 the effort to achieve better results from the restoration. The reputational risk became more obvious after the occurrence of a second major dam collapse at Brumadinho in January of 2019, which caused many more deaths than the Fund\u00e3o disaster.4 IUCN followed the response to this new crisis closely: Why had the same mining enterprise (Vale) not learned enough in the three years following the Fund\u00e3o Dam failure to prevent further disasters? An international inquiry sparked by Brumadinho led to the adoption of new standards for the management of tailings dams and for restoration efforts after future ruptures (Oberle 2020).5 The effectiveness of ISTAPs is strongly associated with their credibility as arbiters or scientific/technical specialists, whose salience or recognised prominence in the fields is perceived as relevant to the issues at hand as well as their legitimacy in the eyes of principal stakeholders to offer advice on these complex matters (Cash et al., 2003). Furthermore, based upon its experience with other such Panels, IUCN recognises that \u2013 to be effective \u2014 an ISTAP should operate according to four general principles: independence, transparency, accountability, and engagement. These principles apply to all IUCN-supported ISTAPs (IUCN, 2014). While the generic principles for advisory panels (Cash et al., 2003) address criteria similar to those adopted by IUCN, the latter put greater emphasis on the need for independence from external influences while maintaining accountability to affected groups.

In the past two decades, IUCN has refined its ISTAP model to provide companies and other stakeholders with credible, relevant, and legitimate technical advice. According to IUCN (2021): \u201cISTAPs are established with the formal designation of a group of experts, who engage in provision of scientific and/or technical advice on a specific biodiversity conservation or natural resource management issue. Typically, the recipient of the advice is one or more business entities or public authorities. While an ISTAP approach demands an objective perspective, it also links independent scientists, the private sector, governments, financial institutions, and NGOs in helping find solutions to challenging issues.

Photo: IUCN/Rio Doce Panel archive 5 3 THE CREATION AND OPERATION OF THE RIO DOCE PANEL The first step in establishing the Panel was to select its chair through an international recruitment process that took place in parallel with the development of the Panel\u2019s terms of reference7 (TORs). This process took nearly a full year to complete and involved regular consultation with the leadership of the Renova Foundation. Given IUCN\u2019s principal conservation mission, the Panel focused on environmental remediation and the restoration of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. It also considered impact assessment and monitoring, and the relation between ecosystems and livelihoods, as well as human and ecosystem health in the affected communities. 7 Terms of Reference for the Rio Doce Panel are available at https://www.iucn.org/sites/default/files/2022-10/rio-doce-istap-terms-of-reference_updated_2020jan.pdf 6 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL These themes were compatible with the Panel\u2019s objectives, as defined by its TOR and FAQ,8 of making recommendations at a long-term, landscape scale and calling attention to NbS. The Panel\u2019s specific focus was to examine the impacts of the disaster on the environment and natural resources. The Panel\u2019s remit did not cover issues that had been referred to the courts, such as indemnification payments and relocation, or the management and disposal of the tailings and other engineering issues. Detailed discussion of the generic safety of tailings dams was also excluded since this was seen as an issue for the technical specialists engaged in the international review of dam safety. Central issues included biodiversity, basin management, water resources, fisheries and NbS, since IUCN is widely recognised for its global leadership and expertise in these areas. 8 Frequently Asked Questions regarding the Rio Doce Panel are available at www.iucn.org/riodocepanel. Above: Panel visits the area of Fund\u00e3o. October 2018. Photo: IUCN/Rio Doce Panel archive 7 Independence is central to the Panel\u2019s operating principles, but some stakeholders had questions. To what extent could the Panel avoid manipulation and co-optation given its institutional proximity and financial dependence on Renova? Any ISTAP created in the context of disaster reparation is liable to face this question. The answer is that the Rio Doce Panel \u2013 following the lead of previous IUCN ISTAPs \u2013 has engaged in a way that is independent, transparent and accountable to all the stakeholders involved. Although its role is advisory, the Panel is not beholden to Renova or to Samarco\u2019s shareholders and parent companies. Any real or potential conflict of interest is addressed through IUCN procedures and best practice. A thorough conflict of interest verification is conducted on a regular basis, for example, to ensure that Panel members do not personally benefit from their work. These principles have been explicit during Panel consultations in the Rio Doce Basin. 8 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL The aim of the Panel therefore was to provide independent expert advice and guidance to Renova and other entities involved in the long-term governance of the Rio Doce Basin.

Many \u2013 if not most \u2013 of the Panel\u2019s recommendations were then developed to include other governmental stakeholders such as the two state governments and the Rio Doce Watershed Committee (CBH-Doce).

Such issues had to be openly discussed among stakeholders. Panel members found the interdisciplinary composition and diversity of their professional backgrounds to be an asset. However, for a multidisciplinary panel of this kind to function effectively, it was essential that key decisions be reached through consensus. This required Panel members to listen carefully, respect the opinions of others, follow formal protocols, and make an effort to comprehend the technical issues from the perspective of other disciplines. This was particularly important in the finalisation of the analyses and recommendations set out in the thematic reports and issues papers, which IUCN published under the co-authorship of the Chair and all the Panel members, even though each report had its respective lead author. The need for consensus meant fewer documents were published, since publication required a time-consuming process of internal and external peer review, comment, and re-editing. However, the need for consensus also meant that arguments were more balanced, and the writing more carefully crafted. Although changes in the composition of the Panel occurred during the five-year period of activities for varied reasons, this did not affect the methodology adopted for tripartite teamwork on each paper, though it did cause some delay in delivery timelines. However, it may have influenced the selection of topics and the focus of some of the papers without interrupting the overall programme. The Panel made an early decision to differentiate its products into two types of reports. The first were issue papers (IP), which were relatively short, produced more rapidly, and focused on specific concerns facing the restoration. The second were thematic reports (TRs), which went into greater depth, were longer, and had a broader scope. The Panel Chair guided the process of deciding themes and asking Panel members whether they would participate in the core groups responsible for the initial drafts of technical reports and issue papers. All Panel members played an active role in discussing the relevance of possible topics, which were subsequently selected based on specific criteria such as the knowledge and experience of Panel members. Panel members were expected to dedicate time from their already busy individual schedules to the work of the Panel. They met virtually each month, and face-to- face twice a year in the affected region. During the face- to-face gatherings, Panel members visited locations and communities affected by the disaster, as well as restoration sites, to understand the issues first hand and to follow the progress of restoration. When Panel members attended seminars, conferences and other institutional meetings related to the restoration, they did so as Panel representatives and accessed resources from the Panel budget. 12 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL The Panel was governed by its detailed ToRs, codes of conduct and its Theory of Change (ToC). At an early stage in its work, the Panel enunciated an initial version of its ToC that set up outcome indicators and a strategy to monitor the uptake of its recommendations by the primary and secondary stakeholders of the restoration programmes under Renova\u2019s responsibility. The primary or secondary stakeholders were defined as \u201cMain Stakeholders, Policymakers, Influencers and Do- ers\u201d. The categories were sometimes overlapping and may have referred to entities with multiple roles in the restoration. BOX 2 \u2013 THE PANEL TARGET AUDIENCES Main Stakeholders Renova Foundation, CIF and its technical chambers Policymakers Federal, state and municipal governments, Basin committees, state agencies and regulatory institutions, legislature, judiciary and Public Prosecutor\u2019s office Influencers Universities and research institutes, national and international corporations, advisors to the judiciary, and to the Public Prosecutor\u2019s office DO-ers Affected people and its technical advisors, representative associations, private companies in the basin and NGOs working in the restoration process According to the ToC, Main stakeholders include organisations which were created in response to the disaster and which are a key part of the reparation\u2019s governance structure, such as the Renova Foundation, CIF and its Technical Chambers. Policymakers also deal directly with the consequences of the Fund\u00e3o Dam rupture and are part of the governance structure, but they have a broader scope of action and attributions beyond the reparation. Examples include the three Brazilian levels of government (federal, state, and municipal), basin committees, regulatory institutions, and legislative, judiciary and the public prosecutor. Influencers included active civil society and social movements within the region, as well as the media and higher educational institutions.

The Panel used a tailored approach to present the recommendations to main stakeholders and policymakers, promoting in-depth meetings, discussions, and joint events. Similarly, to ensure that the recommendations reached a broader audience, such as influencers, the Panel organised webinars and participated in scientific events. The Panel expected these strategies to foster engagement and bring the stakeholders to a common vision. It was hoped that these stakeholders would ultimately use and implement the Panel\u2019s recommendations according to their interest, mandate, and possibilities. Over time, the ToC evolved to go beyond Renova, aiming to reach a broader range of primary stakeholders such as state governments and the Rio Doce Watershed Committee. The Panel began to engage more directly with these groups in 2020. At that time, it was becoming clear that Renova would be unable to act on all the Panel\u2019s recommendations, since many recommendations required broader governmental and societal engagement. The ToC articulated the way in which the Panel would have to balance the demands of different actors while maintaining its independence. Managing such demands and the Panel\u2019s independence required constant vigilance. From the outset, the Panel\u2019s approach was to define the central issues and develop its recommendations, drawing upon contemporary peer- reviewed scientific literature and other publicly accessible sources.

The full list of issue or thematic selection criteria is listed in Box 3, below: 17 An issue or theme would be considered \u2018high\u2019 priority only if it passed the first three criteria and at least three of the remaining eight. Prioritisation was done in-house and based on the consensus view of Panel members. Their detailed scientific knowledge of the critical problems facing the basin and its peoples helped to identify the themes that needed to be addressed. Consensus was often achieved following extensive debate among Panel members. Once prioritised, the Chair selected an interdisciplinary core group of Panel members who were tasked to develop draft recommendations and the accompanying justification for further discussion. The leader of this core group was responsible for the paper\u2019s structure following consultation with the other Panel members and for delegating specific responsibilities to other core group members. This draft outline was then discussed at an alignment meeting with Renova\u2019s technical staff to determine whether the paper would meet the information requirements of the Foundation and other key stakeholders. The core group then began the academic research through peer-reviewed and internationally recognised publications. The research might include publicly available studies by Renova or other agencies, as well as reports from the consulting companies that had been contracted by the public prosecutor\u2019s office to review the restoration\u2019s progress. Even when Renova did not agree with a theme, the Panel\u2019s independence enabled it to proceed if it felt the theme was relevant to the broader restoration programme. Thematic Report number 2 (May et al., 2020) was one such example. Covering the impact of climate change on the basin\u2019s long-term restoration, the Panel proceeded with its preparation on the grounds that it was consistent with global concern and the impacts of regional climatic events. The Panel\u2019s work was invariably seen as independent, technical, and scientifically grounded. This was partly because the Panel members were well-known leaders in their respective fields. Some had taught or worked with decision-makers at Renova or in government agencies while they were at university or in other roles. Just as important, the Panel relied almost exclusively on peer- reviewed and internationally recognised publications. It focused on strategic, longer-term issues relating to the reparation, rather than engaging in detailed analysis of the day-to-day issues. The Panel initially thought they could produce a substantial volume of papers in short order, but this was simply not the case. The issues were complex. Documents required every Panel member to sign off. And IUCN publication guidelines contained multiple steps. This slow delivery frustrated both Renova and the Panel. Future Panels may wish to make the process more agile, to avoid overpromising and under-delivering. The multidisciplinary character of the Panel, and the part-time nature of Panel members\u2019 involvement could also interfere with timelines. Time commitments were flexible, allowing time for revision and reflection, and deadlines were not always strict. When necessary, for example, timelines were modified so that Panel members could visit sites or meet with stakeholders. The dynamic nature of the restoration also meant that Panel members sometimes needed to incorporate new information as it emerged. In 2021, the Panel\u2019s modus operandi changed when Renova requested a new methodology for ex post impact assessments in the marine and coastal areas. Since a member of the Panel \u2013 Professor Luis S\u00e1nchez \u2013 is widely known as one of the most important academic specialists in this area, the Panel agreed to carry out the 18 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL study to help advance the restoration in the affected coastal areas. This led the Panel to adopt a different mode of engagement with Renova staff, although without relinquishing its independence. The Panel\u2019s new approach enabled a constructive dialogue between the Panel and Renova\u2019s Impact Curatorship and Biodiversity teams. Professor S\u00e1nchez led successive workshops at which Panel members collaborated with Renova to further elaborate the methodology for the impact assessment. This process was the basis for producing the fifth and final Thematic Report, which presented the methodology for assessing environmental impacts on coastal and marine environments (S\u00e1nchez, et al., 2022).

This was true for the Rio Doce Panel, which benefitted from the support of IUCN\u2019s well-organised, professional support staff at internal meetings and for regular communication with Renova and others. Based in Bras\u00edlia and at the organisation\u2019s headquarters in Switzerland, the IUCN staff ensured that the Panel was able to access the most current peer-reviewed studies as well as media reports and offered insights into the perspectives of different actors and decision-makers. The support staff also managed the complex planning of site visits and meetings, both internal and external, all of which were overseen impeccably. Without the support and legitimacy of IUCN, the Panel would not have been as effective in its analysis and communications. The monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL) related to Panel outputs and recommendations were an added burden for IUCN staff, but the Panel was then able to systematically track the uptake of its recommendations by different stakeholders. The inclusion of a full-time MEL officer and the elaboration of the ToC were key decisions that shaped the Panel\u2019s success. These might usefully be replicated early in the organisation of any future ISTAP. The IUCN communication staff played a critical role in ensuring that the Panel had regular, updated access to all the relevant articles that appeared in the printed and online media, including items appearing in the local and regional, national and international press. The IUCN communications team was also responsible for communication with the press on the Panel\u2019s behalf, using different formats and media to promote public awareness of the Panel\u2019s existence as well as of its activities and recommendations, releasing all reports both in Portuguese and in English. To avoid undue duplication and mixed signals, the Panel Chair took responsibility for all direct substantive engagement with the press, while a targeted communication and outreach strategy optimised dissemination of the Panel\u2019s work to stakeholders by seeking forms for interaction that would reinforce the key messages. The editorial and layout experience of IUCN country and headquarters staff ensured the quality of the reports and their visual appeal. IUCN Members in Brazil and other parts of Latin America were consulted at the outset and informed about the progress Panel\u2019s work. Some Members expressed concern about a partnership with major mining companies in the wake of Brazil\u2019s worst environmental disaster, fearing consequences for IUCN\u2019s institutional integrity and reputation. However, the Panel Chair had impeccable credentials and was trusted by the environmental community. No formal objection was lodged. The Panel kept the international expert community and other stakeholders informed about their work through regular presentations at annual conferences of the International Association for Impact Assessment (IAIA), roundtables at the IUCN World Conservation Congress, and regional IUCN meetings. Panel members also participated in conferences to discuss their findings and stimulate broader awareness. Meetings in affected areas offered opportunities for representatives of the impacted communities to express their concerns.

Finally, the Panel\u2019s experience reinforced the critical importance for ISTAPs of listening to the people, communities, and organisations affected by the disaster, as well as analysts in research institutions, non-governmental organisation (NGOs), universities, and the media. Hearing from those who suffered the consequences of the dam collapse, as they explained their grievances, brought home the full weight of the tragedy as well as the difficulties they face in being heard by the institutions that should be responsible for their well-being. 4 SUPPORT FROM IUCN AND OTHER ACTORS 21 At the outset, the Renova Foundation was composed of a relatively small cadre of highly motivated, idealistic leaders, and specialists. But as the largest of the 42 programmes swung into action, and their associated funding increased, Renova grew into one of the region\u2019s largest employers. It was one of the few private organisations in the world to have been tasked with the restoration of a damaged ecosystem and economy after a major environmental and social catastrophe. Over time, Renova evolved as it sought to build a better operational structure and increase its capacity to deliver the 42 programmes. However, this led to increasing compartmentalisation along the lines set out in the TTAC, a factor that was subsequently reinforced as many of the programmes became subject to judicial review. Renova\u2019s exponential growth in addressing the TTAC\u2019s increasingly compartmentalised programmes made the Panel\u2019s work more complex. How to engage with the large number of technically specialised departments and promote an integrated landscape approach and a long-term vision in such a highly compartmentalised framework? 5 WORKING WITH RENOVA: LEARNING BY DOING Above: Restoration work on the church affected by mud in Paracatu de Baixo, Minas Gerais.

These included the CIF, some of the technical chambers that advise it, the public prosecutor\u2019s office, local governments, academic institutions, non-governmental organisations including some that were advising the affected communities, and the CBH-Doce. Renova\u2019s high staff turnover added another layer of complexity. This might have impeded continuity in stakeholder relations and threatened the institutional knowledge base. However, the Renova staff who served as go-betweens for relationships built over five years of Panel activities, remained more stable. From the outset, the Panel was connected to the Institutional Relations and Governance teams at Renova, whose staff and consultants were relatively constant throughout much of the period. They accompanied the Panel on field visits and assisted IUCN with the logistics and programming of face-to-face meetings. The Renova staff tasked with accompanying the Panel offered regular updates on key issues emerging during the restoration and informed the Panel on whether these issues remained relevant. While the Panel\u2019s objectives remained constant since the TTAC was signed, Renova had to adapt to new realities, and this led the Panel to modify its own strategy.

Photo: DIDA SAMPAIO / ESTAD\u00c3O CONTE\u00daDO 24 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL 6.1 SCALE AND COMPLEXITY The collapse of the Fund\u00e3o Dam was one of the largest and most complex human-made disasters in recent history. When the 39.2 million m3 of tailings flowed downstream into the Rio Doce, they affected land and human settlements along 670 km of river as well as extensive coastal and marine areas. The disaster had multiple direct and indirect impacts on physical and chemical conditions in the river, on the biota and their maintenance processes, and on the living conditions, economy and society of people living along the river and coastal areas. Given the complexity of the disaster, the vast amount of information generated, and controversies relating to the interpretation and understanding of the data, the Panel decided to rely exclusively on publicly available sources, with a preference for peer-reviewed journals. Many publications were devoted to the disaster, while volumes of consultancy studies were prepared for Renova, the public prosecutors\u2019 offices, and the courts. Much of this was made available online. To ensure independence and transparency, the Panel did not cite unpublished materials including those prepared for Renova and other entities. Renova and its parent companies questioned this approach since they had invested heavily in the research. However, much of this work had not been made publicly available and the Panel opted not to cite these sources. Nearly seven years have passed since the disaster, and there is still no comprehensive analysis of the environmental and socioeconomic impacts. Renova, the public prosecutors\u2019 office, and others have contracted a large number of studies, and peer-reviewed articles have been published in academic journals. But up to the time of this publication no overall synthesis has been published. Similarly, no overall assessment of the reparations has been carried out. The Renova website offers a month- by-month progress report on the programmes, but these have tended to focus on inputs and outputs (amounts spent, numbers of people employed, areas reforested, and so on) rather than on the achievement of the TTAC\u2019s long-term objectives of returning socio-environmental conditions to their pre-disaster condition. When the Panel was convened, therefore, its first priority was to prepare an overview of the situation in the Rio Doce Basin, applying the Panel members\u2019 specialist knowledge. The first thematic report (TR01 \u2013 S\u00e1nchez et al., 2018) synthesised the available information, providing an objective summary of the disaster together with background on the affected regions. Its general recommendations \u2013 which may well be applicable in other, similar situations \u2013 focused on the need for a comprehensive assessment of the impacts and the use of an adaptive management strategy. This latter should start with an evaluation of the mitigation programmes together with the potential threats \u2013 including climate change \u2013 that could undermine their expected outcomes. It also emphasised the importance of managing and disseminating knowledge gained from the disaster response. Subsequently, some of the recommendations conveyed by the initial thematic report were further developed \u2013 with agreement from Renova \u2013 while others were put aside. Renova or other primary stakeholders did not regard them as a priority, since they were prioritising the short-term goals needed to respond to the direct obligations of the TTAC. For example, the Panel saw adaptive management as essential to the long-term viability of the TTAC programmes, but this approach was rarely employed. The restoration effort appeared insufficiently flexible and unable to respond to the learning process required due to the uncertainties and impracticable timelines. Information management is another important theme in a complex post-disaster situation. The Panel offered to help Renova with the development of a strategy to manage the wealth of knowledge generated by the consultancy studies it had contracted as well as the natural and social science studies published by other organisations such as universities and research institutions. Panel members insisted that an effective strategy for knowledge management would be vital to ensure the legacy of the restoration. However, Renova had already decided to contract other consultants on knowledge management and was preparing to set up regional information centres. To avoid overlap, the Panel\u2019s proposal was dropped. 25 The Panel\u2019s recommendations were initially directed at Renova, though as per the Panel\u2019s ToC, they were also intended to influence government agencies and others involved in the restoration. Subsequently the Panel adapted to the complex and changing legal and institutional context and broadened the scope of its recommendations to engage with a range of other stakeholders. The institutional arrangements are complex, first,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "50870679-dde6-4167-aac5-4c5d1b6ca624": {"__data__": {"id_": "50870679-dde6-4167-aac5-4c5d1b6ca624", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-extended-version", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Impact Report of the Alliance for Mediterranean Nature & Culture (extended version)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-extended-version", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a965f86f082c98dad0de7b9840dac69d14bc2883290fc1e5df8ba8ef96eac66d"}, "3": {"node_id": "32549c7c-ab47-4de1-98ca-4f8abd791abf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-extended-version", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7819781a2a55e15d751f7d15f6e462d09af041748a9a528c5d4ff33b32bcedac"}}, "hash": "acb57bcf03050c4466296c6e2d54a53bd4fbc493608f85f85831ff30e19eb033", "text": "because the Rio Doce flows through two Brazilian states (Minas Gerais \u2013 MG and Esp\u00edrito Santo \u2013 ES) and therefore its basin management comes under federal jurisdiction. This led to the involvement of federal government agencies, two state governments, the Public Prosecutors\u2019 offices in the two states and at least 40 municipal governments in the reparation. These governments and agencies will eventually have to take responsibility for the maintenance of the long-term programmes. As in other regions of Brazil, local government capacity is often severely constrained by the limited population in many municipalities. More than half the affected municipalities in MG, for instance, have less than 10,000 inhabitants. Local governments lack the resources to manage critical services, such as water supply, wastewater treatment, and the disposal of solid waste. Moreover, while everyone benefits from environmental services, they are not as visible as the community infrastructure that attracts votes, especially in small and rural municipalities. Toward the end of its tenure, the Panel aimed its advice not just at Renova but also at government agencies and the other stakeholders represented in the CIF and Technical Chambers (CT). The relations between Renova and the CIF/CT were often more adversarial than complementary, and this complicated efforts to engage effectively with all parties critical to restoration of the Rio Doce Basin. Further obstacles came from the fact that the TTAC was designed to facilitate a disaster response without waiting for the outcome of lengthy legal proceedings, but disagreements between Renova and the CIF/CT have regularly been referred to court. This led to uncertainty and delays in the restoration programmes. In 2020, the Panel decided to make recommendations on governance issues, focusing on the long-term legacy of restoration in the Rio Doce Basin. Drawing on experience from the Rio Doce and other post-disaster situations, the Panel focused on the need to start with a participatory approach that would allow a broad range of stakeholders \u2013 especially the people most directly affected \u2013 to share their vision for the Rio Doce Basin. Their \u2018buy-in\u2019 to a long-term vision was seen as essential to achieve consensus and commitment regarding the restoration and long-term improvement of the basin, and to eventually facilitate the handover of the programmes from Renova to the agencies that will be responsible for their long-term continuity once Renova\u2019s mandate has been fulfilled. In hindsight, it would have been better to initiate the governance review earlier, helping Renova and other key stakeholders (CIF and CT) to think about the reparation\u2019s long-term goals and the need for early engagement as part of a \u201cpolycentric governance\u201d strategy (Ostrom, 2010). But Renova had been conceived as a temporary arrangement, offering a rapid solution to the most immediate and pressing problems of the restoration. The government and other agencies are expected eventually to take over, continue, and complement the investments and programmes that had been initiated and financed by Renova. 6.2 THE LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT 26 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL One conceptual challenge faced by the Panel was to develop a workable framework for the ex post analysis of the disaster\u2019s environmental impacts. The conventional frameworks for environmental impact analysis (EIA) have primarily been developed for the ex ante determination of the potential impacts of investments, especially in infrastructure, extractive and industrial projects, where data is collected and analysed, and mitigation measures developed, before a project is started. In 2019, Renova\u2019s management team requested support with implementation of a recommendation from the first thematic report (S\u00e1nchez et al., 2018). In response, the Panel submitted a general framework for assessing the environmental and social impacts of disasters, which was well received. This issue paper (IP04 \u2013 S\u00e1nchez et al., 2019) encouraged Renova to establish an Impact Curatorship (Curadoria de Impactos). In 2021 Renova requested the Panel\u2019s help to develop a framework for assessing the impacts of the dam\u2019s collapse on coastal and marine areas. It was agreed that the scope would be limited to environmental impacts \u2013 which in themselves are extremely complex \u2013 and would not cover the social and economic impacts. These latter impacts were controversial since key decisions were subject to judicial deliberations. Despite this necessarily restricted scope, the Panel consistently stressed the importance of a S2S approach (Granit et al., 2017), including social and economic impacts in the basin and related coastal and marine areas.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "32549c7c-ab47-4de1-98ca-4f8abd791abf": {"__data__": {"id_": "32549c7c-ab47-4de1-98ca-4f8abd791abf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-extended-version", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Impact Report of the Alliance for Mediterranean Nature & Culture (extended version)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-extended-version", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a965f86f082c98dad0de7b9840dac69d14bc2883290fc1e5df8ba8ef96eac66d"}, "2": {"node_id": "50870679-dde6-4167-aac5-4c5d1b6ca624", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-extended-version", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "acb57bcf03050c4466296c6e2d54a53bd4fbc493608f85f85831ff30e19eb033"}}, "hash": "7819781a2a55e15d751f7d15f6e462d09af041748a9a528c5d4ff33b32bcedac", "text": "The process of developing this ex post framework differed from the Panel\u2019s earlier initiatives and involved more active engagement with Renova specialist staff \u2013 represented primarily by members of the Impact Assessment and Aquatic Biodiversity Conservation Teams.

The Panel has had to look beyond these existing approaches, however, to develop a systematic, evidence-based framework for ex post EIA in other affected coastal and marine environments. In the study of impacts on coastal and marine areas, the Panel and Renova faced the challenge of working outside the conventional framework for EIA. The challenge was compounded by the absence of reliable data on the pre-disaster situation \u2013 for instance, information on critical areas such as water quality (physical, chemical and biological characteristics). Moreover, it is extremely difficult to distinguish the impacts of the Fund\u00e3o tailings from the cumulative, historical impacts from over 400 years of mining and industrial activity, deforestation of the basin, and contamination from agrochemicals, raw sewage and solid waste. The Panel was able to draw on the available data and were supported by IUCN staff to identify new sources of information from academic journals and other sources to draw inferences regarding the impact of the dam break on coastal and marine habitats. Based on this broad literature review, the Panel emphasised that impact analysis should focus on the medium- to long-term risks to the biota and to human health from dispersal and re-dispersal of the Fund\u00e3o tailings, rather than the immediate impacts after the dam break. 6.3 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ANALYSIS AND BASELINE DATA 27 The TTAC requires the restoration to return conditions to the pre-disaster state as it was in November 2015 (Clause 06.II). However, even if adequate data were available to characterise the ex ante environmental conditions, the Panel took the position that such a \u2018causal nexus\u2019 restriction would be neither feasible nor desirable. Instead, the Panel viewed the restoration as an opportunity to \u2018build back better\u2019, through a wide- ranging programme for the continual recovery of the Rio Doce Basin that could eventually be replicated in Brazil\u2019s other river basins and elsewhere. Renova had been organised to implement the programmes outlined in the TTAC, and the completion of these programmes was the Foundation\u2019s number one priority. However, the TTAC\u2019s emphasis on programme-by-programme implementation led to a compartmentalised approach, which made it more difficult to achieve an overall understanding of the disaster\u2019s impacts and to develop viable long-term solutions for the most chronic and critical impacts. From the start, however, the Panel argued for a more integrated strategy, one that would combine Landscape and S2S approaches. An S2S approach would enable a better understanding of the dynamics between the social, economic and environmental aspects. It would also focus more on the interrelationship between different environmental concerns, such as water quality, wastewater treatment, land use, biodiversity, livelihoods and human health, among others. The integration of Landscape and S2S approaches would therefore allow stakeholders to better understand and plan for the long-term restoration of the Rio Doce Basin, including attention to the estuary, coastal, and marine areas. These approaches should be understood not solely as a theoretical approach but as an innovative set of tools that can combine with participatory stakeholder engagement for an effective restoration plan. 6.4 ADOPTING SOURCE-TO-SEA AND LANDSCAPE APPROACHES 28 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL Below: Parts of the Rio Doce estuary, September 7, 2020.

Early on, however, the Panel did address some of the broader economic development issues in an innovative paper (IP01 \u2013 May et al., 2019), that suggested an alternative vision for the basin, based on more intensive, sustainable agriculture, rural tourism, the vertical integration of value chains, improved standards, and the development of a learning economy to be financed by permanent revolving funds.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "38d34c1a-9087-438a-8cea-55bd1f33b6be": {"__data__": {"id_": "38d34c1a-9087-438a-8cea-55bd1f33b6be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-extended-version", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Impact Report of the Alliance for Mediterranean Nature & Culture (extended version)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-extended-version", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9d5c1f34fe1a62459788407385bfa2e14a7f500b906f75f5ed73b977e33f4cbe"}, "2": {"node_id": "f0f15083-aee6-48b5-ba96-69c1b1bff4e3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-extended-version", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "04aedd845693b9689732e35e24e46eb536771552fb6349df16928ac1ed8ec82f"}}, "hash": "7ae7100c9195623d67753526fbf075283c25141d4916e93c3cfffe0260bea9fb", "text": "A second issue paper (IP02 \u2013 Brito et al., 2019) argued that the restoration of inland and coastal fisheries would require a unified decision-making framework to determine when and how the responsible authorities could lift the fishing bans following their imposition in the wake of the disaster.

In principle, Renova responded positively to this idea, and put the approach into practice by involving local people to monitor water quality. Indeed, bulletins on Renova\u2019s website represent a positive example of how information from monitoring programmes can be obtained and presented in a way that is accessible and comprehensible to the general public. However, this citizen science approach did not go much further even though some of the directly affected communities, such as Degredo, a traditional Afro-Brazilian (quilombola) community on the ES coast, possessed the organisation and qualified professionals needed to permit more ambitious participatory monitoring programmes. These could have included the monitoring of flora and fauna, fisheries, and the quality and availability of ground and surface water. 6.5 SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS Below: Rio Doce Panel visiting Instituto Terra and its nursery of native plants used to restore the Rio Doce Basin.

Photo: All rights reserved to NITRO Historias Visuais 30 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL One of the most frequently repeated demands to the Panel, made by the affected population, was for better information about the disaster\u2019s impacts on physical and mental health. Such impacts are typically seen as a consequence of direct exposure to the tailings, to tailings dust, and to the contamination of water supplies. But human health can also be affected by the consumption of contaminated fish and irrigated vegetables, as well as the social and psychological impact of community displacement, loss of livelihoods and dependence on monthly indemnity payments to displaced households, fishers, artisanal miners, and other affected groups. The Panel recognised that an integrated treatment of human and ecosystem health would be beneficial for people affected by the disaster. This was thus a serious lacuna in the restoration process. Renova staff have tried to lay the groundwork for a programme of Integrated Environmental and Human Health Management (GAISMA). However, the judicial decisions have required that Renova treat these issues separately. As a result, this integration has been omitted from most remediation and restoration efforts over the seven years since the dam break. The Panel did, however, draw attention to the continued need for an integrative perspective. For example, its final Issue Paper recommended the One Health approach (IP05 \u2013 Alonso et al., 2020). This approach shows how best to coordinate programmes, policies, legislation and research in order to unlock collaboration between the human and animal health and ecosystem conservation sectors, thereby improving public health. IP05 addressed the wider links between human health and the environment, recommending support for public health monitoring and the exchange of information between the formal public health system (SUS, from Portuguese acronym Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade) and organisations in the fields of community and environmental health. These recommendations were not immediately taken up, but public health was later included as a priority theme in the TTAC\u2019s renegotiation. Additional studies would provide a more complete assessment of the disaster\u2019s impacts on human health in the areas most directly affected, but they remain stymied due to dissent in the judicial arena. 6.6 HEALTH IMPACTS Below: Group of people on a boat at the mouth of the Rio Doce.

Photo taken during the Rio Doce Panel\u2019s visit in July 2022. Photo: IUCN/ Rio Doce Panel archive 32 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL When the Panel began its work, it did not prioritise the potential cumulative impacts from tailings deposition and sediment flows on the marine and freshwater biota, but it was agreed that, should the need arise, additional expertise would be sought, either through an external consultant or by adding an extra member to the Panel. As discussed above, however, Renova later sought the Panel\u2019s advice on how to better understand and manage the environmental impacts on the coastal and marine areas. Meanwhile, Renova had contracted a detailed assessment and monitoring of biota in the estuary and adjacent coastal region to a consortium of universities and scientific researchers in Esp\u00edrito Santo, along with parallel studies by the Brazilian Foundation for Sustainable Development (FBDS) and consultants assigned by UNESCO. The emerging complexity and conflicting scientific findings from these overlapping studies pointed to the continued risk from deposition of the tailings. Given the lack of a common basis for describing and assessing impacts, and the need to systematise impacts into a common structure, Renova and the Panel agreed to work on the development of a systematic framework that would enable interpretation of the results generated by these and other studies.

This suspicion has been compounded by the pressure to take decisions and implement them in a timely fashion, since the disaster deprived people of essential environmental services, such as potable water, fisheries and housing. Here, the Panel offers some general suggestions that might be useful for future ISTAPs and Rio Doce stakeholders to help prioritise issues, achieve consensus and implement sustainable, efficient and long-term solutions. 34 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL Left: Aerial view of the Rio Doce below the city bridge.

All rights reserved to NITRO Historias Visuais 35 The effects of the Fund\u00e3o Dam disaster were complex and the process of recovery has to be sustainable in the long run. To ensure such results, the process itself is as important as the outcomes. Thus, successful engagement with government and civil society is key to a sustainable and lasting restoration. The Panel focused its work on issues that contribute to the long- term sustainability of the basin and its inhabitants. To achieve long-term sustainability, these issues depend on successful intervention and engagement with local and regional institutions. Man-made and natural disasters can have devastating impacts on the local population, their economies and social infrastructure, but they can also offer an opportunity for longer-term improvement. Recovery is not simply a return to prior conditions. The opportunities should be mapped and planned with input from diverse stakeholders \u2013 especially those that have been most directly affected \u2013 to achieve a common vision for the future. The full benefits of a shared vision may not be felt for decades. The socioeconomic benefits of changes to economic structure, education, and sanitation may not be felt in the short term, but in the long term they are essential for the continual improvement of the environment, economy and social conditions.

Consultation and engagement are key to achieve a shared vision and to the development of viable programmes with an exit strategy that will ensure the restoration\u2019s continuity and sustainability. Such investments may not have immediately visible results, but they are essential for human and ecosystem health. When adapted to the specific realities of other regions and countries, this model could be applied to most post-disaster scenarios. It could also be adapted to major investments in infrastructure or extractive projects. A participatory process may appear more complex and time-consuming, but it is the only way to guarantee a process of continual improvement that will satisfy the expectations and needs of the people affected. In the Rio Doce case, affected communities were not involved in drawing up the TTAC or in the subsequent decision- making, and this has exacerbated the mistrust and conflicts generated throughout the restoration. Some of this was inevitable, but it could have been lessened by more effective engagement with the different groups of people affected. In the immediate aftermath of disaster, short-term solutions are required to cover people\u2019s immediate needs, reinstating access to potable water, energy supply and housing. Once this has been achieved, and people\u2019s confidence restored through short-term actions, it becomes necessary to start thinking more strategically. This requires longer-term process-oriented programmes that allow for continual improvement. Even shorter-term restoration activities should encourage participation and 7.1 PROMOTE A LONG-TERM, SHARED VISION FOR CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT Below: In the image, a person driving a boat at the mouth of the Rio Doce.

By producing rapid results and \u2018quick wins\u2019, engagement can build trust between the different stakeholders. The Panel consistently recommended the need for affected people to have the opportunity to participate in decisions about the restoration. In the case of the Fund\u00e3o Dam disaster, the decision-making structure established under the TTAC led to drawn-out discussions that extended from federal and state government agencies to the public prosecutors and eventually to the judiciary. It lacked the mechanisms that would allow greater participation by those most directly affected, thus limiting their engagement and commitment to the restoration programmes. Participation is not easy \u2013 but if decision- making is done only by the existing governmental bureaucracy, then it becomes more difficult to empower society and to achieve the long-term changes needed for \u2018building back better\u2019. In the beginning, the Panel focused on making recommendations to Renova. As time went on, however, the Panel realised the importance of engaging with other stakeholders, since different actors had to be involved to achieve lasting results through a more participatory process. One of the lessons that may be applicable to other ISTAPs, therefore, is not to focus exclusively on one or more specific stakeholders, but to share the recommendations more widely and engage directly with all the relevant stakeholders. The Panel had been slow to work with agencies other than Renova, but during the preparation of TR02 (May et al., 2020) Renova expressed its discomfort with managing issues related to climate change. This helped the Panel appreciate the importance of engaging with a broader group of actors. Below: Rio Doce Panel and IUCN secretariat during internal meeting during visit to the Rio Doce Basin.

This underscores an important issue for future ISTAPs. Their need for independence prevents them from acting as an intermediary between business or government agencies and the people directly affected. However, an ISTAP should be able to recognise the concerns of affected people, give voice to their aspirations, and encourage the relevant agencies to engage with them more effectively. 7.2 RECOGNISE THE POWER OF LEADERSHIP AND COLLABORATION Right: Yolanda Kakabadse, Chair of the Rio Doce Panel, during the launching of the 5th article of the series Issue Paper.

Photo: IUCN/Rio Doce Panel archive 38 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL 7.3 LOOK FOR INTEGRATED, MULTIDISCIPLINARY SOLUTIONS The desire for quick results may lead to the compartmentalisation of discussions and solutions, rather than calling for an integrated approach and acknowledging the complexity of the situation and the wide range of stakeholders. Many restoration issues are in fact connected and the existence of parallel structures can interfere with one another. For example, if the water is contaminated, then the fish may also be contaminated, with implications for people\u2019s livelihoods, nutrition, and health. This is obvious, but when different departments or agencies are responsible for water quality, biota, public health and the economy, it becomes more difficult to attain an integrated approach. The responses of different agencies may even contradict one another as in the case of the fisheries ban discussed in IP02 (Brito et al., 2019). Technical discussions can get lost in minor details that impede the search for effective solutions when they should be considered together, taking a broader landscape perspective to address issues that affect local welfare. The Panel consistently stressed the value of a landscape approach, rather than compartmentalised solutions. Renova did not fully internalise this view, but other stakeholders did acknowledge the need for integrated solutions to the chronic problems facing the Rio Doce Basin and associated coastal and marine areas. In this respect, the Panel played an important role, presenting the S2S approach together with landscape perspectives in a specific thematic report focused on the integration of biodiversity and water quality (TR03 \u2013 Brito et al., 2021). The S2S framework is a practical approach that has been tried and tested, not only in the Fund\u00e3o case, but also in other similar situations. The S2S principle could be applied elsewhere to restore and improve the environmental, social, and economic situation of a disaster-affected region. The impact analysis and the design of medium and long-term measures should avoid a piecemeal approach. Instead, they should adopt a broader perspective, combining landscape and S2S approaches from the start. This makes it easier to respond to the environmental, social, financial, economic, and cultural aspects of the affected region. The approach encompasses not only the spatial dimension (terrestrial and/or coastal areas), but also key flows \u2013 water, biota, sediment, pollutants, materials and ecosystem services. The S2S concept was first introduced by the Panel in its Issue Paper No. 3 (IP03 - Barbosa et al., 2019), in which it was proposed that Renova consider installing a permanent floodgate in the Rio Pequeno to protect waters of the Juparan\u00e3 lake \u2013 an important water source in the lower Rio Doce \u2013 from pollution by the Rio Doce in flooding conditions. The floodgate would have an opening and closing system to control the volume of water in rainy and dry periods to ensure connectivity between ecosystems. The affected territory covers a vast area in two Brazilian states, with distinct social, economic, and cultural characteristics. Both states have been degraded by centuries of extractive activities, unsustainable agricultural practices and contamination with raw sewage and solid waste. Rather than seeking a return to the pre-disaster situation as a baseline, it would be better to seek a negotiated solution that would improve conditions and kick-start a process of continual improvement in the region. This requires engagement with all the relevant parties. The Panel addressed the baseline considerations in TR04 (Maroun et al., 2021) and acknowledged the vital importance of a common vision for the region\u2019s future rather than a return to the pre-disaster conditions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bc2c62bd-8b36-4706-878d-2a783d3c0d1b": {"__data__": {"id_": "bc2c62bd-8b36-4706-878d-2a783d3c0d1b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-extended-version", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Impact Report of the Alliance for Mediterranean Nature & Culture (extended version)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-extended-version", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "38a3670906a7504f96805ddd51376c309c325b92d00bc5081e8350d3746fd9ca"}, "2": {"node_id": "543465a9-bda3-4ece-8e5a-f5800b050804", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-extended-version", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a25c931a78982f8e5957ac9783d760463f91fcfafc5f7a6c0a4ecdf608192312"}}, "hash": "bd9ba60db0eb215de92c19290590565b72471927a73ba6c96390137671fed267", "text": "This recommendation was discussed with various stakeholders, but in retrospect the Panel should have highlighted the importance of this approach from the start.

The Panel also recommended that Renova support the establishment of a long-term fiduciary fund to finance continued efforts in the basin (IP01 \u2013 May et al., 2019) investing some of the resources originally intended for reparation. However, Renova rejected the concept on the grounds that it was not consistent with the mandate for immediate and short-term results. However, landscape analysis by Renova, UNESCO, the World Resources Institute (WRI), and other organisations have recommended that additional resources be directed toward a broader basin-level approach, including systematic analysis of the long-term development scenarios. 39 7.5 CONSIDER CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGHOUT The climate emergency threatens ecosystems and human well-being. Emerging diseases, water rationing, droughts, and floods will become more frequent in the coming years. Fundamental changes to the economy and social values will be vital to avoid and manage these challenges. Climate change is likely to aggravate the degradation of fragile and degraded landscapes such as the Rio Doce Basin. Restoration plans and programmes should share a common climate strategy, covering both assessment and adaptation to the effects of climate change. The Panel needed to persuade Renova that climate change issues were within its remit. Renova had been doubtful on the grounds that, first, climate change would only impact the region in the distant future, and second, that the impacts of climate change were distinct from those caused by the dam collapse. This underscores the tension between the short and long term, and between the causal impacts of the dam collapse and the need to address the underlying environmental conditions. Renova and its Board of Directors strongly contested the idea, for example, that climate change could be the cause of the extraordinary storm and rainfall events associated with the repeated deposition of tailings along the river. The Panel insisted that the theme was relevant and discussed its recommendations from TR02 (May et al., 2020) with different stakeholders. The process of restoration should consider the long-term governance of the affected region, noting that permanent institutions and those responsible for the restoration may have overlapping and complementary roles to play. The restoration programmes have generated studies, data, information systems, and especially capacity to execute restoration actions, but these may be lost if they are not integrated into the permanent structures of governance for the maintenance of nature\u2019s services. In principle, there should be a balance between tasks assigned to the restoration programme\u2019s institutions and to the long-term, permanent institutions that will eventually continue the restoration\u2019s programmes and investments. Both CIF and Renova have engaged with permanent institutions such as the Rio Doce Watershed Committee, universities, and NGOs in the area, viewing them as valuable sources of expertise. Similarly, the Panel also prioritised permanent institutions when it reached out to other groups of stakeholders. Early on, the Panel completed a stakeholder mapping and analysis of the impacted region (see discussion of the Panel\u2019s ToC, above), allowing the Panel to understand which permanent institutions might manage selected programmes in the longer-term. During the preparation of the thematic report on governance (TR04 - Maroun et al., 2021), this analysis was updated to include a broader range of stakeholders. Key findings were also discussed with various institutions beyond Renova. The key lesson for other ISTAPs is to initiate a process of stakeholder mapping at the outset and to update it regularly. This will provide clear understanding of the governance roles of each actor or agency in the affected region. Understanding the involvement of these actors is fundamental to the early integration of restoration efforts, guaranteeing continuity and long-term improvement. 7.4 ENGAGE AND EMPOWER THE PERMANENT INSTITUTIONS Right: In the image, a stretch of the Rio Doce near its mouth.

Photo: All rights reserved to NITRO Historias Visuais 40 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL An important aspect to be considered in future ISTAPs is to support Panel members to participate in important regional and international events. This offers the opportunity for feedback and discussion and allows Panel members to learn from comparative perspectives and other cases, as well as permitting the Panel to share its work and insights with different stakeholders. To what extent should the Panel be involved in the definition of solutions and moving them forward? The Panel\u2019s distinct approach recognised the urgency of the situation as well as the need to consult on the direction of the papers.

Panel members met in person twice a year and held videoconferences at the end of every month. This helped to maintain the Panel\u2019s cohesion and the quality of interaction between its members. It also kept them up to date on the development of the thematic reports and issue papers and the reparation process itself. The Panel also held debriefing sessions following meetings and systematised the relevant information for use in subsequent analyses. Panel members met with the Chair at the end of each face-to-face meeting to evaluate each other\u2019s performance and consider future pathways. Panel members also found it useful to divide into core groups when developing drafts of the thematic reports and issue papers. However, Panel members found it difficult to review these products if more than one paper was being prepared simultaneously. Future ISTAPs are advised to discuss and consider this balance and to review it from time to time, considering the expertise of the Panel members and the need for their participation in selected documents. ISTAPs are also advised to generate shorter, more concise products, even carefully presented intermediate products, rather than high- quality, professionally edited reports that are outdated by the time they are presented.

The negotiations around the restoration and related processes were often extremely complex, since the multiple actors were often suspicious of each other and held distinct and often conflicting views. Moreover, the discussions tended to focus on specific, compartmentalised concerns. Despite the need for short-term solutions to respond to people\u2019s immediate needs, it is also essential to think about solutions to the long-term impacts caused by disaster. An ISTAP can influence the process by highlighting the need for a long-term, integrated perspective, even if implementation of the recommendations is neither direct nor immediate. An ISTAP\u2019s influence may not be felt immediately by stakeholders in a disaster restoration, but it does endure. ISTAPs can also influence important processes indirectly. One of the Panel\u2019s main legacies was the publication of impartial and independent analysis and technical advice that could be used by actors in different contexts, beyond that of the restoration of the Rio Doce watershed. By publishing thematic reports and issue papers throughout its five years of operation, the Panel contributed to discussions to change practices in the sector and to mainstream global concerns, such as climate change. 42 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL In the image, parts of the Rio Doce estuary. Renova Foundation. September 7, 2020. Photo: All rights reserved to NITRO Historias Visuais The Panel\u2019s recommendations were grounded in globally relevant scientific literature, and they reflected a long-term approach and landscape perspective. This can be adapted to similar disaster situations, whose frequency is increasing rapidly with climate change. The Panel\u2019s process for developing recommendations was as important as the recommendations themselves. Knowledge of topics and methodologies that would never have been considered without participation of an ISTAP became widely disseminated in the process of consultation with stakeholders. This holds true for the S2S approach, an innovative methodology introduced by the Panel for assessment and integrated management of river basins. In the Rio Doce example, the S2S approach was presented didactically to key stakeholders in the long-term development of the region.

March 2019. Photo: IUCN/Rio Doce Panel archive FOREWORD The socio-environmental and economic tragedy caused by the Fund\u00e3o dam failure in the city of Mariana (in the state of Minas Gerais) caused impacts that remain seven years later. Still, it is also important to recognise that many initiatives were \u2013 and continue to be \u2013 adopted successfully. Dealing with the biggest mining event of its kind on the planet required organised efforts proportional to the magnitude of the damage caused by the dam failure. This led to the signing of Terms of Transaction and Conduct Adjustment (TTAC, Termo de Transa\u00e7\u00e3o e Ajustamento de Conduta) and the adoption of a complex governance model, in which the Renova Foundation is the executing institution. In this context, an independent panel of specialists was established, called the Rio Doce Panel and linked to IUCN, one of the oldest and most respected non-governmental entities in the world devoted to the conservation of nature and the protection of the environment, with a history of significant achievements. The creation of the Panel, a group composed of experts from Brazil and abroad under the coordination of Yolanda Kakabadse \u2013 a former environment minister of Ecuador and internationally respected conservation leader and policy maker \u2013 was extremely relevant from an institutional perspective, as the Panel would act autonomously and independently and advise decision-makers involved in the governance system behind the reparation process. Thematic reports prepared by the Panel outlined expertise and best international practices for the reparation of areas, which had been affected by tragedies similar to the Fund\u00e3o Dam failure. The reports also enabled an ambience of reflection that would have been impossible within the Foundation\u2019s day-to-day work and immense pressure from repressed demands, court-mandated responsibilities, and dysfunctional aspects of their internal and external governance. By enabling discussions on essential topics and producing high-level technical-scientific documents, the Panel has provided a set of inputs to assist the Renova Foundation in remedying the disaster\u2019s damage. By bringing a new and outside perspective, the Panel contributed to the Foundation and other actors in decision-making, complementing the existing work, strengthening strategic planning, and expanding the Foundation\u2019s thinking on the best available alternatives to address the region\u2019s socio-environmental and economic problems, taking into account, primarily, the assistance to those affected and the environmental recovery in the areas of water quality and biodiversity. The Panel always conducted its interdisciplinary work in an integrated fashion and in coordination with the various stakeholders involved in restoring the Rio Doce. In this important document, the Panel shares its reflections and lessons learned during its five years of work. Together with IUCN, the Panel leaves behind it an important legacy for current and future reparations, in view of the long-term nature of these actions. Jos\u00e9 Carlos Carvalho Former Minister of Environment, Brazil V Independent Scientific and Technical Advisory Panels (ISTAPs) have been established to help address a range of controversial conservation and development issues that have emerged with growing frequency and complexity at national and global levels. This report is intended to contribute to discussion of ways to improve the effectiveness of ISTAPs by outlining lessons learned by the Rio Doce Panel, an ISTAP set up in the wake of the 2015 Fund\u00e3o iron tailings Dam collapse, widely considered one of Brazil\u2019s worst environmental disasters.

The dam contained around 52 million cubic meters (m3) of iron mining residues from the Samarco mining company\u2019s Germano Complex, jointly owned by two of the largest multinational mining corporations, Vale S.A and BHP Billiton (BHP). Reportedly, 39.2 million m3 of these tailings washed into the Santar\u00e9m reservoir, immediately below the dam, creating a wave of liquid mud that poured into the Gualaxo do Norte and do Carmo rivers, both headwaters of the Rio Doce. The mass of liquified tailings tore away soil, vegetation and sediments from the upper reaches of the river, affecting around 2,000 hectares belonging to some 200 rural properties and destroying 1,469 hectares of natural vegetation. The mud and debris demolished the villages of Bento Rodrigues and Paracatu de Baixo, damaging homes and community infrastructure further downstream in Gesteira and Barra Longa. The tailings also reached the Rio Doce estuary, 670 km below the dam, and created a plume, which spread along extensive coastal and marine areas, particularly along the shallow coastal platform. The disaster claimed 19 lives and physically displaced at least 320 families. As a consequence of the disaster, Samarco\u2019s iron ore extraction activities were halted for five years,1 and fishing remains banned in much of the basin, affecting employment and food security. Those displaced from the communities by the wave of mud were provided with temporary housing in Mariana and other urban areas in the basin, a situation that has lasted up to the time of this publication. Right after the disaster, local governments were forced to cut off the public supplies of water obtained from the Rio Doce and its tributaries, and to substitute them using tank trucks to deliver water to people in many of the towns and rural communities located downstream. In an effort to mitigate the impacts and restore the areas affected by the Fund\u00e3o Dam collapse, the Brazilian Federal Government, the States of Minas Gerais and Esp\u00edrito Santo, Samarco, Vale and BHP signed a detailed agreement on 2 March 2016, known as the Terms of Transaction and Conduct Adjustment (TTAC). 1 In late 2020, Samarco received the environmental licenses required to restart its iron mining, ore concentration and transport along a 400 km slurry pipeline, and pelletising operations at a port facility which it had installed in the late 1970s near Vit\u00f3ria, the state capital of Esp\u00edrito Santo. By mid-2022, the company had returned to 26 percent of its prior operating capacity. Samarco no longer deposits its coarse tailings behind dams but is drying and piling them for eventual use as construction materials. The fine tailings are being stored in an exhausted open pit. 1. WHY WAS THE RIO DOCE PANEL CREATED? Left: Inspection carried out by Ibama in July 2016 on the stretch affected by the collapse of the Samarco mining company\u2019s tailings dam in Mariana, Minas Gerais. Photo: Felipe Werneck/Ibama 1 The TTAC set out 42 programmes for reparation and compensation, and established an independent entity called the Renova Foundation to create, manage, and implement these programmes. Samarco\u2018s parent companies \u2013 Vale and BHP \u2013 would finance Renova, while an Inter-Federative Committee (CIF) would oversee the restoration process. The CIF included representatives from federal and state government agencies as well as municipal governments, representatives of affected populations and the civil society organisations that provide them with technical assistance. Together, Renova and the CIF were made formally responsible for the restoration, in consultation with affected communities. The idea of installing a specialist panel to provide independent technical advice on the restoration process took shape in the two years following the disaster. The objective proposed by the leadership of Renova and Samarco\u2019s parent companies was to identify global corporate best practices and science- based perspectives on the restoration. In December 2015, BHP staff members consulted with various international organisations that were concerned about the environmental and social impacts of the Fund\u00e3o Dam collapse. IUCN was among the organisations visited by the BHP staff members tasked with managing the restoration efforts. Although IUCN was unable to provide technical support to address the immediate short-term mitigation and restoration activities, the organisation had experience with the creation of ISTAPs. This initial consultation led to a dialogue between IUCN and BHP, that eventually led to the decision to create an independent panel.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c92a89b1-f715-48db-8153-34865aaffdd8": {"__data__": {"id_": "c92a89b1-f715-48db-8153-34865aaffdd8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-summary", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Impact Report of the Alliance for Mediterranean Nature & Culture (summary)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-summary", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b819012599c0708497895ca7741698ca00007bf178569125afe178e52f1d974c"}, "2": {"node_id": "7b41b92f-97d5-4a26-99d0-d2ea12358fad", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-summary", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "39ac1922be78ad9d72a896c44b4b5166011a7ea707229f3cf679b255ab214b6c"}}, "hash": "2e6b3b6bab4e4f1aa8966d23efd3a30ad3865bc75f36784f0db366177a56d79c", "text": "On 5 December 2017, more than two years after the Fund\u00e3o Dam collapsed, IUCN and the Renova Foundation\u2019s Board of Directors signed a five-year cooperation agreement to establish the Rio Doce Panel as an IUCN-supported ISTAP. 2 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL Below: The collapse of the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1a68356a-8579-4135-863f-a88b9904f614": {"__data__": {"id_": "1a68356a-8579-4135-863f-a88b9904f614", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-summary", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Impact Report of the Alliance for Mediterranean Nature & Culture (summary)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-summary", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cd1b87b5ea5acf1882bd7f90dd4e059b05183833badfc6b4eb6799389509b78f"}, "3": {"node_id": "886efac2-73b5-4c49-95ec-fc976fb2b376", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-summary", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "982dafb2877c43c49197c7acd7af6fe272e2c4e3902eeb77150b90fd2be4719a"}}, "hash": "ec858eb614b915ef6f54e0e972cc941bc5bde7019ec50a5ab778a040c74bcd9e", "text": "tailings dam belonging to Samarco, owned by Vale and Anglo-Australian BHP, caused a mud flood to inundate several houses in the Bento Rodrigues district of Mariana in the central region of Minas Gerais.

They can help multiple stakeholders understand situations characterised by complexity, uncertainty, and cost and can contribute to effective and efficient decision- making. Organisations which have recently created such groups include the Global Environment Facility\u2019s Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP), the World Health Organization\u2019s Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee (STAC), and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change\u2019s Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP). Such panels are typically convened under conditions of uncertainty. The number of unforeseen environmental disasters has been growing, for example, linked to climate change, extinctions, ozone depletion, mine- tailing dam collapses, and more. Advisory panels are also a regular feature of complex infrastructure projects. Other IUCN panels have been set up to address the impacts of major oil and gas investments in Nigeria (IUCN Niger Delta Panel) and in Russia (IUCN Western Gray Whale Advisory Panel).3 Although some IUCN Members saw partnership with mining enterprises as contrary to the reputational 2 IUCN (2014), Procedures for establishing and managing IUCN-supported Independent Scientific & Technical Advisory Panels, https://iucn.org/sites/default/files/2022-11/iucn_istap_procedures_2014.pdf 3 See: https://www.iucn.org/western-gray-whale-advisory-panel and https://www.iucn.org/theme/business-and-biodiversity/our-work/business- partnerships-projects/shell/iucn-niger-delta-panel 4 The Brumadinho disaster led to 270 deaths, mostly employees of Vale who were in the company cafeteria located immediately below the dam when it collapsed upon them. 5 Global Tailings Review (2020) \u2013 Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management - https://globaltailingsreview.org/global-industry-standard/ - IUCN was part of the Tailings Review Advisory Group interests of the organisation, there was widespread support for \u2013 and acceptance of \u2013 the effort to achieve better results from the restoration. The reputational risk became more obvious after the occurrence of a second major dam collapse at Brumadinho in January of 2019, which caused many more deaths than the Fund\u00e3o disaster.4 IUCN followed the response to this new crisis closely: Why had the same mining enterprise (Vale) not learned enough in the three years following the Fund\u00e3o Dam failure to prevent further disasters? An international inquiry sparked by Brumadinho led to the adoption of new standards for the management of tailings dams and for restoration efforts after future ruptures (Oberle 2020).5 The effectiveness of ISTAPs is strongly associated with their credibility as arbiters or scientific/technical specialists, whose salience or recognised prominence in the fields is perceived as relevant to the issues at hand as well as their legitimacy in the eyes of principal stakeholders to offer advice on these complex matters (Cash et al., 2003). Furthermore, based upon its experience with other such Panels, IUCN recognises that \u2013 to be effective \u2014 an ISTAP should operate according to four general principles: independence, transparency, accountability, and engagement. These principles apply to all IUCN-supported ISTAPs (IUCN, 2014). While the generic principles for advisory panels (Cash et al., 2003) address criteria similar to those adopted by IUCN, the latter put greater emphasis on the need for independence from external influences while maintaining accountability to affected groups.

THE ROLE OF INDEPENDENT SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL ADVISORY PANELS 4 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL will reflect on the means employed by the Panel to ensure its effectiveness and to comply with the underlying principles that motivated its creation. In the past two decades, IUCN has refined its ISTAP model to provide companies and other stakeholders with credible, relevant, and legitimate technical advice. According to IUCN (2021): \u201cISTAPs are established with the formal designation of a group of experts, who engage in provision of scientific and/or technical advice on a specific biodiversity conservation or natural resource management issue.

Photo: IUCN/Rio Doce Panel archive 5 3 THE CREATION AND OPERATION OF THE RIO DOCE PANEL The first step in establishing the Panel was to select its chair through an international recruitment process that took place in parallel with the development of the Panel\u2019s terms of reference7 (TORs). This process took nearly a full year to complete and involved regular consultation with the leadership of the Renova Foundation. Given IUCN\u2019s principal conservation mission, the Panel focused on environmental remediation and the restoration of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. It also considered impact assessment and monitoring, and the relation between ecosystems and livelihoods, as well as human and ecosystem health in the affected communities. 7 Terms of Reference for the Rio Doce Panel are available at https://www.iucn.org/sites/default/files/2022-10/rio-doce-istap-terms-of-reference_updated_2020jan.pdf 6 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL These themes were compatible with the Panel\u2019s objectives, as defined by its TOR and FAQ,8 of making recommendations at a long-term, landscape scale and calling attention to NbS. The Panel\u2019s specific focus was to examine the impacts of the disaster on the environment and natural resources. The Panel\u2019s remit did not cover issues that had been referred to the courts, such as indemnification payments and relocation, or the management and disposal of the tailings and other engineering issues. Detailed discussion of the generic safety of tailings dams was also excluded since this was seen as an issue for the technical specialists engaged in the international review of dam safety. Central issues included biodiversity, basin management, water resources, fisheries and NbS, since IUCN is widely recognised for its global leadership and expertise in these areas. 8 Frequently Asked Questions regarding the Rio Doce Panel are available at www.iucn.org/riodocepanel. Above: Panel visits the area of Fund\u00e3o. October 2018. Photo: IUCN/Rio Doce Panel archive 7 Independence is central to the Panel\u2019s operating principles, but some stakeholders had questions. To what extent could the Panel avoid manipulation and co-optation given its institutional proximity and financial dependence on Renova? Any ISTAP created in the context of disaster reparation is liable to face this question. The answer is that the Rio Doce Panel \u2013 following the lead of previous IUCN ISTAPs \u2013 has engaged in a way that is independent, transparent and accountable to all the stakeholders involved. Although its role is advisory, the Panel is not beholden to Renova or to Samarco\u2019s shareholders and parent companies. Any real or potential conflict of interest is addressed through IUCN procedures and best practice. A thorough conflict of interest verification is conducted on a regular basis, for example, to ensure that Panel members do not personally benefit from their work. These principles have been explicit during Panel consultations in the Rio Doce Basin. 8 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL The aim of the Panel therefore was to provide independent expert advice and guidance to Renova and other entities involved in the long-term governance of the Rio Doce Basin.

The Panel needed to navigate these shifts while retaining its independence.

Many \u2013 if not most \u2013 of the Panel\u2019s recommendations were then developed to include other governmental stakeholders such as the two state governments and the Rio Doce Watershed Committee (CBH-Doce). Over time, the Panel gradually put more effort into communicating its work and stimulating debate among the emerging primary stakeholders.

Such issues had to be openly discussed among stakeholders. Panel members found the interdisciplinary composition and diversity of their professional backgrounds to be an asset. However, for a multidisciplinary panel of this kind to function effectively, it was essential that key decisions be reached through consensus. This required Panel members to listen carefully, respect the opinions of others, follow formal protocols, and make an effort to comprehend the technical issues from the perspective of other disciplines. This was particularly important in the finalisation of the analyses and recommendations set out in the thematic reports and issues papers, which IUCN published under the co-authorship of the Chair and all the Panel members, even though each report had its respective lead author. The need for consensus meant fewer documents were published, since publication required a time-consuming process of internal and external peer review, comment, and re-editing. However, the need for consensus also meant that arguments were more balanced, and the writing more carefully crafted. Although changes in the composition of the Panel occurred during the five-year period of activities for varied reasons, this did not affect the methodology adopted for tripartite teamwork on each paper, though it did cause some delay in delivery timelines. However, it may have influenced the selection of topics and the focus of some of the papers without interrupting the overall programme. The Panel made an early decision to differentiate its products into two types of reports. The first were issue papers (IP), which were relatively short, produced more rapidly, and focused on specific concerns facing the restoration. The second were thematic reports (TRs), which went into greater depth, were longer, and had a broader scope. The Panel Chair guided the process of deciding themes and asking Panel members whether they would participate in the core groups responsible for the initial drafts of technical reports and issue papers. All Panel members played an active role in discussing the relevance of possible topics, which were subsequently selected based on specific criteria such as the knowledge and experience of Panel members. Panel members were expected to dedicate time from their already busy individual schedules to the work of the Panel. They met virtually each month, and face-to- face twice a year in the affected region. During the face- to-face gatherings, Panel members visited locations and communities affected by the disaster, as well as restoration sites, to understand the issues first hand and to follow the progress of restoration. When Panel members attended seminars, conferences and other institutional meetings related to the restoration, they did so as Panel representatives and accessed resources from the Panel budget. 12 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL The Panel was governed by its detailed ToRs, codes of conduct and its Theory of Change (ToC). At an early stage in its work, the Panel enunciated an initial version of its ToC that set up outcome indicators and a strategy to monitor the uptake of its recommendations by the primary and secondary stakeholders of the restoration programmes under Renova\u2019s responsibility. The primary or secondary stakeholders were defined as \u201cMain Stakeholders, Policymakers, Influencers and Do- ers\u201d. The categories were sometimes overlapping and may have referred to entities with multiple roles in the restoration. BOX 2 \u2013 THE PANEL TARGET AUDIENCES Main Stakeholders Renova Foundation, CIF and its technical chambers Policymakers Federal, state and municipal governments, Basin committees, state agencies and regulatory institutions, legislature, judiciary and Public Prosecutor\u2019s office Influencers Universities and research institutes, national and international corporations, advisors to the judiciary, and to the Public Prosecutor\u2019s office DO-ers Affected people and its technical advisors, representative associations, private companies in the basin and NGOs working in the restoration process According to the ToC, Main stakeholders include organisations which were created in response to the disaster and which are a key part of the reparation\u2019s governance structure, such as the Renova Foundation, CIF and its Technical Chambers. Policymakers also deal directly with the consequences of the Fund\u00e3o Dam rupture and are part of the governance structure, but they have a broader scope of action and attributions beyond the reparation. Examples include the three Brazilian levels of government (federal, state, and municipal), basin committees, regulatory institutions, and legislative, judiciary and the public prosecutor. Influencers included active civil society and social movements within the region, as well as the media and higher educational institutions. Lastly, the ToC defines Do-ers as those which used natural resources and which were directly affected by the disaster.

The Panel used a tailored approach to present the recommendations to main stakeholders and policymakers, promoting in-depth meetings, discussions, and joint events. Similarly, to ensure that the recommendations reached a broader audience, such as influencers, the Panel organised webinars and participated in scientific events. The Panel expected these strategies to foster engagement and bring the stakeholders to a common vision. It was hoped that these stakeholders would ultimately use and implement the Panel\u2019s recommendations according to their interest, mandate, and possibilities. Over time, the ToC evolved to go beyond Renova, aiming to reach a broader range of primary stakeholders such as state governments and the Rio Doce Watershed Committee. The Panel began to engage more directly with these groups in 2020. At that time, it was becoming clear that Renova would be unable to act on all the Panel\u2019s recommendations, since many recommendations required broader governmental and societal engagement. The ToC articulated the way in which the Panel would have to balance the demands of different actors while maintaining its independence. Managing such demands and the Panel\u2019s independence required constant vigilance. From the outset, the Panel\u2019s approach was to define the central issues and develop its recommendations, drawing upon contemporary peer- reviewed scientific literature and other publicly accessible sources.

The full list of issue or thematic selection criteria is listed in Box 3, below: 17 An issue or theme would be considered \u2018high\u2019 priority only if it passed the first three criteria and at least three of the remaining eight. Prioritisation was done in-house and based on the consensus view of Panel members. Their detailed scientific knowledge of the critical problems facing the basin and its peoples helped to identify the themes that needed to be addressed. Consensus was often achieved following extensive debate among Panel members. Once prioritised, the Chair selected an interdisciplinary core group of Panel members who were tasked to develop draft recommendations and the accompanying justification for further discussion. The leader of this core group was responsible for the paper\u2019s structure following consultation with the other Panel members and for delegating specific responsibilities to other core group members. This draft outline was then discussed at an alignment meeting with Renova\u2019s technical staff to determine whether the paper would meet the information requirements of the Foundation and other key stakeholders. The core group then began the academic research through peer-reviewed and internationally recognised publications. The research might include publicly available studies by Renova or other agencies, as well as reports from the consulting companies that had been contracted by the public prosecutor\u2019s office to review the restoration\u2019s progress. Even when Renova did not agree with a theme, the Panel\u2019s independence enabled it to proceed if it felt the theme was relevant to the broader restoration programme. Thematic Report number 2 (May et al., 2020) was one such example. Covering the impact of climate change on the basin\u2019s long-term restoration, the Panel proceeded with its preparation on the grounds that it was consistent with global concern and the impacts of regional climatic events. The Panel\u2019s work was invariably seen as independent, technical, and scientifically grounded. This was partly because the Panel members were well-known leaders in their respective fields. Some had taught or worked with decision-makers at Renova or in government agencies while they were at university or in other roles. Just as important, the Panel relied almost exclusively on peer- reviewed and internationally recognised publications. It focused on strategic, longer-term issues relating to the reparation, rather than engaging in detailed analysis of the day-to-day issues. The Panel initially thought they could produce a substantial volume of papers in short order, but this was simply not the case. The issues were complex. Documents required every Panel member to sign off. And IUCN publication guidelines contained multiple steps. This slow delivery frustrated both Renova and the Panel. Future Panels may wish to make the process more agile, to avoid overpromising and under-delivering. The multidisciplinary character of the Panel, and the part-time nature of Panel members\u2019 involvement could also interfere with timelines. Time commitments were flexible, allowing time for revision and reflection, and deadlines were not always strict. When necessary, for example, timelines were modified so that Panel members could visit sites or meet with stakeholders. The dynamic nature of the restoration also meant that Panel members sometimes needed to incorporate new information as it emerged. In 2021, the Panel\u2019s modus operandi changed when Renova requested a new methodology for ex post impact assessments in the marine and coastal areas. Since a member of the Panel \u2013 Professor Luis S\u00e1nchez \u2013 is widely known as one of the most important academic specialists in this area, the Panel agreed to carry out the 18 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL study to help advance the restoration in the affected coastal areas. This led the Panel to adopt a different mode of engagement with Renova staff, although without relinquishing its independence. The Panel\u2019s new approach enabled a constructive dialogue between the Panel and Renova\u2019s Impact Curatorship and Biodiversity teams. Professor S\u00e1nchez led successive workshops at which Panel members collaborated with Renova to further elaborate the methodology for the impact assessment. This process was the basis for producing the fifth and final Thematic Report, which presented the methodology for assessing environmental impacts on coastal and marine environments (S\u00e1nchez, et al., 2022).

This was true for the Rio Doce Panel, which benefitted from the support of IUCN\u2019s well-organised, professional support staff at internal meetings and for regular communication with Renova and others. Based in Bras\u00edlia and at the organisation\u2019s headquarters in Switzerland, the IUCN staff ensured that the Panel was able to access the most current peer-reviewed studies as well as media reports and offered insights into the perspectives of different actors and decision-makers. The support staff also managed the complex planning of site visits and meetings, both internal and external, all of which were overseen impeccably. Without the support and legitimacy of IUCN, the Panel would not have been as effective in its analysis and communications. The monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL) related to Panel outputs and recommendations were an added burden for IUCN staff, but the Panel was then able to systematically track the uptake of its recommendations by different stakeholders. The inclusion of a full-time MEL officer and the elaboration of the ToC were key decisions that shaped the Panel\u2019s success. These might usefully be replicated early in the organisation of any future ISTAP. The IUCN communication staff played a critical role in ensuring that the Panel had regular, updated access to all the relevant articles that appeared in the printed and online media, including items appearing in the local and regional, national and international press. The IUCN communications team was also responsible for communication with the press on the Panel\u2019s behalf, using different formats and media to promote public awareness of the Panel\u2019s existence as well as of its activities and recommendations, releasing all reports both in Portuguese and in English. To avoid undue duplication and mixed signals, the Panel Chair took responsibility for all direct substantive engagement with the press, while a targeted communication and outreach strategy optimised dissemination of the Panel\u2019s work to stakeholders by seeking forms for interaction that would reinforce the key messages. The editorial and layout experience of IUCN country and headquarters staff ensured the quality of the reports and their visual appeal. IUCN Members in Brazil and other parts of Latin America were consulted at the outset and informed about the progress Panel\u2019s work. Some Members expressed concern about a partnership with major mining companies in the wake of Brazil\u2019s worst environmental disaster, fearing consequences for IUCN\u2019s institutional integrity and reputation. However, the Panel Chair had impeccable credentials and was trusted by the environmental community. No formal objection was lodged. The Panel kept the international expert community and other stakeholders informed about their work through regular presentations at annual conferences of the International Association for Impact Assessment (IAIA), roundtables at the IUCN World Conservation Congress, and regional IUCN meetings. Panel members also participated in conferences to discuss their findings and stimulate broader awareness. Meetings in affected areas offered opportunities for representatives of the impacted communities to express their concerns.

Finally, the Panel\u2019s experience reinforced the critical importance for ISTAPs of listening to the people, communities, and organisations affected by the disaster, as well as analysts in research institutions, non-governmental organisation (NGOs), universities, and the media. Hearing from those who suffered the consequences of the dam collapse, as they explained their grievances, brought home the full weight of the tragedy as well as the difficulties they face in being heard by the institutions that should be responsible for their well-being. 4 SUPPORT FROM IUCN AND OTHER ACTORS 21 At the outset, the Renova Foundation was composed of a relatively small cadre of highly motivated, idealistic leaders, and specialists. But as the largest of the 42 programmes swung into action, and their associated funding increased, Renova grew into one of the region\u2019s largest employers. It was one of the few private organisations in the world to have been tasked with the restoration of a damaged ecosystem and economy after a major environmental and social catastrophe. Over time, Renova evolved as it sought to build a better operational structure and increase its capacity to deliver the 42 programmes. However, this led to increasing compartmentalisation along the lines set out in the TTAC, a factor that was subsequently reinforced as many of the programmes became subject to judicial review. Renova\u2019s exponential growth in addressing the TTAC\u2019s increasingly compartmentalised programmes made the Panel\u2019s work more complex. How to engage with the large number of technically specialised departments and promote an integrated landscape approach and a long-term vision in such a highly compartmentalised framework? 5 WORKING WITH RENOVA: LEARNING BY DOING Above: Restoration work on the church affected by mud in Paracatu de Baixo, Minas Gerais.

Photo: All rights reserved to NITRO Historias Visuais 22 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL In response to the emerging complexity and as new actors became involved, the Panel broadened its remit, offering independent technical and scientific recommendations to - and engaging with - a wider set of stakeholders. These included the CIF, some of the technical chambers that advise it, the public prosecutor\u2019s office, local governments, academic institutions, non-governmental organisations including some that were advising the affected communities, and the CBH-Doce. Renova\u2019s high staff turnover added another layer of complexity. This might have impeded continuity in stakeholder relations and threatened the institutional knowledge base. However, the Renova staff who served as go-betweens for relationships built over five years of Panel activities, remained more stable. From the outset, the Panel was connected to the Institutional Relations and Governance teams at Renova, whose staff and consultants were relatively constant throughout much of the period. They accompanied the Panel on field visits and assisted IUCN with the logistics and programming of face-to-face meetings. The Renova staff tasked with accompanying the Panel offered regular updates on key issues emerging during the restoration and informed the Panel on whether these issues remained relevant. While the Panel\u2019s objectives remained constant since the TTAC was signed, Renova had to adapt to new realities, and this led the Panel to modify its own strategy.

Photo: DIDA SAMPAIO / ESTAD\u00c3O CONTE\u00daDO 24 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL 6.1 SCALE AND COMPLEXITY The collapse of the Fund\u00e3o Dam was one of the largest and most complex human-made disasters in recent history. When the 39.2 million m3 of tailings flowed downstream into the Rio Doce, they affected land and human settlements along 670 km of river as well as extensive coastal and marine areas. The disaster had multiple direct and indirect impacts on physical and chemical conditions in the river, on the biota and their maintenance processes, and on the living conditions, economy and society of people living along the river and coastal areas. Given the complexity of the disaster, the vast amount of information generated, and controversies relating to the interpretation and understanding of the data, the Panel decided to rely exclusively on publicly available sources, with a preference for peer-reviewed journals. Many publications were devoted to the disaster, while volumes of consultancy studies were prepared for Renova, the public prosecutors\u2019 offices, and the courts. Much of this was made available online. To ensure independence and transparency, the Panel did not cite unpublished materials including those prepared for Renova and other entities. Renova and its parent companies questioned this approach since they had invested heavily in the research. However, much of this work had not been made publicly available and the Panel opted not to cite these sources. Nearly seven years have passed since the disaster, and there is still no comprehensive analysis of the environmental and socioeconomic impacts. Renova, the public prosecutors\u2019 office, and others have contracted a large number of studies, and peer-reviewed articles have been published in academic journals. But up to the time of this publication no overall synthesis has been published. Similarly, no overall assessment of the reparations has been carried out. The Renova website offers a month- by-month progress report on the programmes, but these have tended to focus on inputs and outputs (amounts spent, numbers of people employed, areas reforested, and so on) rather than on the achievement of the TTAC\u2019s long-term objectives of returning socio-environmental conditions to their pre-disaster condition. When the Panel was convened, therefore, its first priority was to prepare an overview of the situation in the Rio Doce Basin, applying the Panel members\u2019 specialist knowledge. The first thematic report (TR01 \u2013 S\u00e1nchez et al., 2018) synthesised the available information, providing an objective summary of the disaster together with background on the affected regions. Its general recommendations \u2013 which may well be applicable in other, similar situations \u2013 focused on the need for a comprehensive assessment of the impacts and the use of an adaptive management strategy. This latter should start with an evaluation of the mitigation programmes together with the potential threats \u2013 including climate change \u2013 that could undermine their expected outcomes. It also emphasised the importance of managing and disseminating knowledge gained from the disaster response. Subsequently, some of the recommendations conveyed by the initial thematic report were further developed \u2013 with agreement from Renova \u2013 while others were put aside. Renova or other primary stakeholders did not regard them as a priority, since they were prioritising the short-term goals needed to respond to the direct obligations of the TTAC. For example, the Panel saw adaptive management as essential to the long-term viability of the TTAC programmes, but this approach was rarely employed. The restoration effort appeared insufficiently flexible and unable to respond to the learning process required due to the uncertainties and impracticable timelines. Information management is another important theme in a complex post-disaster situation. The Panel offered to help Renova with the development of a strategy to manage the wealth of knowledge generated by the consultancy studies it had contracted as well as the natural and social science studies published by other organisations such as universities and research institutions. Panel members insisted that an effective strategy for knowledge management would be vital to ensure the legacy of the restoration. However, Renova had already decided to contract other consultants on knowledge management and was preparing to set up regional information centres. To avoid overlap, the Panel\u2019s proposal was dropped. 25 The Panel\u2019s recommendations were initially directed at Renova, though as per the Panel\u2019s ToC, they were also intended to influence government agencies and others involved in the restoration. Subsequently the Panel adapted to the complex and changing legal and institutional context and broadened the scope of its recommendations to engage with a range of other stakeholders. The institutional arrangements are complex, first,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cb892c55-c527-4aa1-ac22-17311fa1e6eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "cb892c55-c527-4aa1-ac22-17311fa1e6eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-summary", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Impact Report of the Alliance for Mediterranean Nature & Culture (summary)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-summary", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6c67eb95133575aaf53a9141fec366ce6ffd0750243b0adba32a65f0d7991b60"}, "3": {"node_id": "4d589f1a-033a-4332-b088-fc53559ba6bc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-summary", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fec36849a0a5a42f766ffbf859a67639f08877c809a4c0aa58e3327d726204d4"}}, "hash": "d63f74cf8592cd81fc982d19d891b00c1aeeffe72c9be5b1e6f9e808a94be007", "text": "because the Rio Doce flows through two Brazilian states (Minas Gerais \u2013 MG and Esp\u00edrito Santo \u2013 ES) and therefore its basin management comes under federal jurisdiction. This led to the involvement of federal government agencies, two state governments, the Public Prosecutors\u2019 offices in the two states and at least 40 municipal governments in the reparation. These governments and agencies will eventually have to take responsibility for the maintenance of the long-term programmes. As in other regions of Brazil, local government capacity is often severely constrained by the limited population in many municipalities. More than half the affected municipalities in MG, for instance, have less than 10,000 inhabitants. Local governments lack the resources to manage critical services, such as water supply, wastewater treatment, and the disposal of solid waste. Moreover, while everyone benefits from environmental services, they are not as visible as the community infrastructure that attracts votes, especially in small and rural municipalities. Toward the end of its tenure, the Panel aimed its advice not just at Renova but also at government agencies and the other stakeholders represented in the CIF and Technical Chambers (CT). The relations between Renova and the CIF/CT were often more adversarial than complementary, and this complicated efforts to engage effectively with all parties critical to restoration of the Rio Doce Basin. Further obstacles came from the fact that the TTAC was designed to facilitate a disaster response without waiting for the outcome of lengthy legal proceedings, but disagreements between Renova and the CIF/CT have regularly been referred to court. This led to uncertainty and delays in the restoration programmes. In 2020, the Panel decided to make recommendations on governance issues, focusing on the long-term legacy of restoration in the Rio Doce Basin. Drawing on experience from the Rio Doce and other post-disaster situations, the Panel focused on the need to start with a participatory approach that would allow a broad range of stakeholders \u2013 especially the people most directly affected \u2013 to share their vision for the Rio Doce Basin. Their \u2018buy-in\u2019 to a long-term vision was seen as essential to achieve consensus and commitment regarding the restoration and long-term improvement of the basin, and to eventually facilitate the handover of the programmes from Renova to the agencies that will be responsible for their long-term continuity once Renova\u2019s mandate has been fulfilled. In hindsight, it would have been better to initiate the governance review earlier, helping Renova and other key stakeholders (CIF and CT) to think about the reparation\u2019s long-term goals and the need for early engagement as part of a \u201cpolycentric governance\u201d strategy (Ostrom, 2010). But Renova had been conceived as a temporary arrangement, offering a rapid solution to the most immediate and pressing problems of the restoration. The government and other agencies are expected eventually to take over, continue, and complement the investments and programmes that had been initiated and financed by Renova. 6.2 THE LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT 26 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL One conceptual challenge faced by the Panel was to develop a workable framework for the ex post analysis of the disaster\u2019s environmental impacts. The conventional frameworks for environmental impact analysis (EIA) have primarily been developed for the ex ante determination of the potential impacts of investments, especially in infrastructure, extractive and industrial projects, where data is collected and analysed, and mitigation measures developed, before a project is started. In 2019, Renova\u2019s management team requested support with implementation of a recommendation from the first thematic report (S\u00e1nchez et al., 2018). In response, the Panel submitted a general framework for assessing the environmental and social impacts of disasters, which was well received. This issue paper (IP04 \u2013 S\u00e1nchez et al., 2019) encouraged Renova to establish an Impact Curatorship (Curadoria de Impactos). In 2021 Renova requested the Panel\u2019s help to develop a framework for assessing the impacts of the dam\u2019s collapse on coastal and marine areas. It was agreed that the scope would be limited to environmental impacts \u2013 which in themselves are extremely complex \u2013 and would not cover the social and economic impacts. These latter impacts were controversial since key decisions were subject to judicial deliberations. Despite this necessarily restricted scope, the Panel consistently stressed the importance of a S2S approach (Granit et al., 2017), including social and economic impacts in the basin and related coastal and marine areas.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d589f1a-033a-4332-b088-fc53559ba6bc": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d589f1a-033a-4332-b088-fc53559ba6bc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-summary", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Impact Report of the Alliance for Mediterranean Nature & Culture (summary)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-summary", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6c67eb95133575aaf53a9141fec366ce6ffd0750243b0adba32a65f0d7991b60"}, "2": {"node_id": "cb892c55-c527-4aa1-ac22-17311fa1e6eb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-summary", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d63f74cf8592cd81fc982d19d891b00c1aeeffe72c9be5b1e6f9e808a94be007"}}, "hash": "fec36849a0a5a42f766ffbf859a67639f08877c809a4c0aa58e3327d726204d4", "text": "The process of developing this ex post framework differed from the Panel\u2019s earlier initiatives and involved more active engagement with Renova specialist staff \u2013 represented primarily by members of the Impact Assessment and Aquatic Biodiversity Conservation Teams.

The Panel has had to look beyond these existing approaches, however, to develop a systematic, evidence-based framework for ex post EIA in other affected coastal and marine environments. In the study of impacts on coastal and marine areas, the Panel and Renova faced the challenge of working outside the conventional framework for EIA. The challenge was compounded by the absence of reliable data on the pre-disaster situation \u2013 for instance, information on critical areas such as water quality (physical, chemical and biological characteristics). Moreover, it is extremely difficult to distinguish the impacts of the Fund\u00e3o tailings from the cumulative, historical impacts from over 400 years of mining and industrial activity, deforestation of the basin, and contamination from agrochemicals, raw sewage and solid waste. The Panel was able to draw on the available data and were supported by IUCN staff to identify new sources of information from academic journals and other sources to draw inferences regarding the impact of the dam break on coastal and marine habitats. Based on this broad literature review, the Panel emphasised that impact analysis should focus on the medium- to long-term risks to the biota and to human health from dispersal and re-dispersal of the Fund\u00e3o tailings, rather than the immediate impacts after the dam break. 6.3 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ANALYSIS AND BASELINE DATA 27 The TTAC requires the restoration to return conditions to the pre-disaster state as it was in November 2015 (Clause 06.II). However, even if adequate data were available to characterise the ex ante environmental conditions, the Panel took the position that such a \u2018causal nexus\u2019 restriction would be neither feasible nor desirable. Instead, the Panel viewed the restoration as an opportunity to \u2018build back better\u2019, through a wide- ranging programme for the continual recovery of the Rio Doce Basin that could eventually be replicated in Brazil\u2019s other river basins and elsewhere. Renova had been organised to implement the programmes outlined in the TTAC, and the completion of these programmes was the Foundation\u2019s number one priority. However, the TTAC\u2019s emphasis on programme-by-programme implementation led to a compartmentalised approach, which made it more difficult to achieve an overall understanding of the disaster\u2019s impacts and to develop viable long-term solutions for the most chronic and critical impacts. From the start, however, the Panel argued for a more integrated strategy, one that would combine Landscape and S2S approaches. An S2S approach would enable a better understanding of the dynamics between the social, economic and environmental aspects. It would also focus more on the interrelationship between different environmental concerns, such as water quality, wastewater treatment, land use, biodiversity, livelihoods and human health, among others. The integration of Landscape and S2S approaches would therefore allow stakeholders to better understand and plan for the long-term restoration of the Rio Doce Basin, including attention to the estuary, coastal, and marine areas. These approaches should be understood not solely as a theoretical approach but as an innovative set of tools that can combine with participatory stakeholder engagement for an effective restoration plan. 6.4 ADOPTING SOURCE-TO-SEA AND LANDSCAPE APPROACHES 28 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL Below: Parts of the Rio Doce estuary, September 7, 2020.

Early on, however, the Panel did address some of the broader economic development issues in an innovative paper (IP01 \u2013 May et al., 2019), that suggested an alternative vision for the basin, based on more intensive, sustainable agriculture, rural tourism, the vertical integration of value chains, improved standards, and the development of a learning economy to be financed by permanent revolving funds.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0d280e36-7d34-4a3e-b864-0d2a2dff139d": {"__data__": {"id_": "0d280e36-7d34-4a3e-b864-0d2a2dff139d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-summary", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Impact Report of the Alliance for Mediterranean Nature & Culture (summary)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-summary", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ea5d86421d7ba42a9f59827029f7cfd3903960f0ae99097c90a82c798e3a0de3"}, "2": {"node_id": "378e2bea-d994-4948-8f69-36ead7232a30", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-summary", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "71883b9c4b8ee9f603b4f240f5f5680bc5e6359e97fb96d9db50fc37f1803edd"}}, "hash": "aa909c1e7a036b3279c1ab3a4a3e3229981c075a4b5c32f496c0c5ea2a6182f1", "text": "A second issue paper (IP02 \u2013 Brito et al., 2019) argued that the restoration of inland and coastal fisheries would require a unified decision-making framework to determine when and how the responsible authorities could lift the fishing bans following their imposition in the wake of the disaster.

In principle, Renova responded positively to this idea, and put the approach into practice by involving local people to monitor water quality. Indeed, bulletins on Renova\u2019s website represent a positive example of how information from monitoring programmes can be obtained and presented in a way that is accessible and comprehensible to the general public. However, this citizen science approach did not go much further even though some of the directly affected communities, such as Degredo, a traditional Afro-Brazilian (quilombola) community on the ES coast, possessed the organisation and qualified professionals needed to permit more ambitious participatory monitoring programmes. These could have included the monitoring of flora and fauna, fisheries, and the quality and availability of ground and surface water. 6.5 SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS Below: Rio Doce Panel visiting Instituto Terra and its nursery of native plants used to restore the Rio Doce Basin.

Such impacts are typically seen as a consequence of direct exposure to the tailings, to tailings dust, and to the contamination of water supplies. But human health can also be affected by the consumption of contaminated fish and irrigated vegetables, as well as the social and psychological impact of community displacement, loss of livelihoods and dependence on monthly indemnity payments to displaced households, fishers, artisanal miners, and other affected groups. The Panel recognised that an integrated treatment of human and ecosystem health would be beneficial for people affected by the disaster. This was thus a serious lacuna in the restoration process. Renova staff have tried to lay the groundwork for a programme of Integrated Environmental and Human Health Management (GAISMA). However, the judicial decisions have required that Renova treat these issues separately. As a result, this integration has been omitted from most remediation and restoration efforts over the seven years since the dam break. The Panel did, however, draw attention to the continued need for an integrative perspective. For example, its final Issue Paper recommended the One Health approach (IP05 \u2013 Alonso et al., 2020). This approach shows how best to coordinate programmes, policies, legislation and research in order to unlock collaboration between the human and animal health and ecosystem conservation sectors, thereby improving public health. IP05 addressed the wider links between human health and the environment, recommending support for public health monitoring and the exchange of information between the formal public health system (SUS, from Portuguese acronym Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade) and organisations in the fields of community and environmental health. These recommendations were not immediately taken up, but public health was later included as a priority theme in the TTAC\u2019s renegotiation. Additional studies would provide a more complete assessment of the disaster\u2019s impacts on human health in the areas most directly affected, but they remain stymied due to dissent in the judicial arena. 6.6 HEALTH IMPACTS Below: Group of people on a boat at the mouth of the Rio Doce.

Photo: IUCN/ Rio Doce Panel archive 32 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL When the Panel began its work, it did not prioritise the potential cumulative impacts from tailings deposition and sediment flows on the marine and freshwater biota, but it was agreed that, should the need arise, additional expertise would be sought, either through an external consultant or by adding an extra member to the Panel. As discussed above, however, Renova later sought the Panel\u2019s advice on how to better understand and manage the environmental impacts on the coastal and marine areas. Meanwhile, Renova had contracted a detailed assessment and monitoring of biota in the estuary and adjacent coastal region to a consortium of universities and scientific researchers in Esp\u00edrito Santo, along with parallel studies by the Brazilian Foundation for Sustainable Development (FBDS) and consultants assigned by UNESCO. The emerging complexity and conflicting scientific findings from these overlapping studies pointed to the continued risk from deposition of the tailings. Given the lack of a common basis for describing and assessing impacts, and the need to systematise impacts into a common structure, Renova and the Panel agreed to work on the development of a systematic framework that would enable interpretation of the results generated by these and other studies.

This suspicion has been compounded by the pressure to take decisions and implement them in a timely fashion, since the disaster deprived people of essential environmental services, such as potable water, fisheries and housing. Here, the Panel offers some general suggestions that might be useful for future ISTAPs and Rio Doce stakeholders to help prioritise issues, achieve consensus and implement sustainable, efficient and long-term solutions. 34 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL Left: Aerial view of the Rio Doce below the city bridge.

All rights reserved to NITRO Historias Visuais 35 The effects of the Fund\u00e3o Dam disaster were complex and the process of recovery has to be sustainable in the long run. To ensure such results, the process itself is as important as the outcomes. Thus, successful engagement with government and civil society is key to a sustainable and lasting restoration. The Panel focused its work on issues that contribute to the long- term sustainability of the basin and its inhabitants. To achieve long-term sustainability, these issues depend on successful intervention and engagement with local and regional institutions. Man-made and natural disasters can have devastating impacts on the local population, their economies and social infrastructure, but they can also offer an opportunity for longer-term improvement. Recovery is not simply a return to prior conditions. The opportunities should be mapped and planned with input from diverse stakeholders \u2013 especially those that have been most directly affected \u2013 to achieve a common vision for the future. The full benefits of a shared vision may not be felt for decades. The socioeconomic benefits of changes to economic structure, education, and sanitation may not be felt in the short term, but in the long term they are essential for the continual improvement of the environment, economy and social conditions.

Consultation and engagement are key to achieve a shared vision and to the development of viable programmes with an exit strategy that will ensure the restoration\u2019s continuity and sustainability. Such investments may not have immediately visible results, but they are essential for human and ecosystem health. When adapted to the specific realities of other regions and countries, this model could be applied to most post-disaster scenarios. It could also be adapted to major investments in infrastructure or extractive projects. A participatory process may appear more complex and time-consuming, but it is the only way to guarantee a process of continual improvement that will satisfy the expectations and needs of the people affected. In the Rio Doce case, affected communities were not involved in drawing up the TTAC or in the subsequent decision- making, and this has exacerbated the mistrust and conflicts generated throughout the restoration. Some of this was inevitable, but it could have been lessened by more effective engagement with the different groups of people affected. In the immediate aftermath of disaster, short-term solutions are required to cover people\u2019s immediate needs, reinstating access to potable water, energy supply and housing. Once this has been achieved, and people\u2019s confidence restored through short-term actions, it becomes necessary to start thinking more strategically. This requires longer-term process-oriented programmes that allow for continual improvement. Even shorter-term restoration activities should encourage participation and 7.1 PROMOTE A LONG-TERM, SHARED VISION FOR CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT Below: In the image, a person driving a boat at the mouth of the Rio Doce.

By producing rapid results and \u2018quick wins\u2019, engagement can build trust between the different stakeholders. The Panel consistently recommended the need for affected people to have the opportunity to participate in decisions about the restoration. In the case of the Fund\u00e3o Dam disaster, the decision-making structure established under the TTAC led to drawn-out discussions that extended from federal and state government agencies to the public prosecutors and eventually to the judiciary. It lacked the mechanisms that would allow greater participation by those most directly affected, thus limiting their engagement and commitment to the restoration programmes. Participation is not easy \u2013 but if decision- making is done only by the existing governmental bureaucracy, then it becomes more difficult to empower society and to achieve the long-term changes needed for \u2018building back better\u2019. In the beginning, the Panel focused on making recommendations to Renova. As time went on, however, the Panel realised the importance of engaging with other stakeholders, since different actors had to be involved to achieve lasting results through a more participatory process. One of the lessons that may be applicable to other ISTAPs, therefore, is not to focus exclusively on one or more specific stakeholders, but to share the recommendations more widely and engage directly with all the relevant stakeholders. The Panel had been slow to work with agencies other than Renova, but during the preparation of TR02 (May et al., 2020) Renova expressed its discomfort with managing issues related to climate change. This helped the Panel appreciate the importance of engaging with a broader group of actors. Below: Rio Doce Panel and IUCN secretariat during internal meeting during visit to the Rio Doce Basin. March 2019. Photo: IUCN/ Rio Doce Panel archive 37 Individuals are an important part of the restoration process, especially when difficult negotiations are required. Trust and leadership make a difference. The capacity for collaboration among different stakeholders is critical to the establishment of responsive governance. According to Young (2013,p. 93), different types of leadership can improve the quality of collaboration: \u201ci) cognitive leadership is the ability to come up with new ways of thinking about key issues; ii) entrepreneurial leadership [is] \u2026 the ability to exercise skill in making deals or devising the terms of mutually acceptable agreements; and iii) structural leadership is the ability to bring the influence of powerful actors to bear in a constructive manner.\u201d Regardless of the leadership type, however, some stakeholders in a governance scenario must show one or more of these abilities, which are not mutually exclusive. Where collaboration between stakeholders is essential, individuals can make the difference if they have the capability and will to influence key decision makers. Indeed, the Panel observed that different styles of leadership impacted the negotiations and implementation during the restoration.

This underscores an important issue for future ISTAPs. Their need for independence prevents them from acting as an intermediary between business or government agencies and the people directly affected. However, an ISTAP should be able to recognise the concerns of affected people, give voice to their aspirations, and encourage the relevant agencies to engage with them more effectively. 7.2 RECOGNISE THE POWER OF LEADERSHIP AND COLLABORATION Right: Yolanda Kakabadse, Chair of the Rio Doce Panel, during the launching of the 5th article of the series Issue Paper. Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais. March 2020. Photo: IUCN/Rio Doce Panel archive 38 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL 7.3 LOOK FOR INTEGRATED, MULTIDISCIPLINARY SOLUTIONS The desire for quick results may lead to the compartmentalisation of discussions and solutions, rather than calling for an integrated approach and acknowledging the complexity of the situation and the wide range of stakeholders. Many restoration issues are in fact connected and the existence of parallel structures can interfere with one another. For example, if the water is contaminated, then the fish may also be contaminated, with implications for people\u2019s livelihoods, nutrition, and health. This is obvious, but when different departments or agencies are responsible for water quality, biota, public health and the economy, it becomes more difficult to attain an integrated approach. The responses of different agencies may even contradict one another as in the case of the fisheries ban discussed in IP02 (Brito et al., 2019). Technical discussions can get lost in minor details that impede the search for effective solutions when they should be considered together, taking a broader landscape perspective to address issues that affect local welfare. The Panel consistently stressed the value of a landscape approach, rather than compartmentalised solutions. Renova did not fully internalise this view, but other stakeholders did acknowledge the need for integrated solutions to the chronic problems facing the Rio Doce Basin and associated coastal and marine areas. In this respect, the Panel played an important role, presenting the S2S approach together with landscape perspectives in a specific thematic report focused on the integration of biodiversity and water quality (TR03 \u2013 Brito et al., 2021). The S2S framework is a practical approach that has been tried and tested, not only in the Fund\u00e3o case, but also in other similar situations. The S2S principle could be applied elsewhere to restore and improve the environmental, social, and economic situation of a disaster-affected region. The impact analysis and the design of medium and long-term measures should avoid a piecemeal approach. Instead, they should adopt a broader perspective, combining landscape and S2S approaches from the start. This makes it easier to respond to the environmental, social, financial, economic, and cultural aspects of the affected region. The approach encompasses not only the spatial dimension (terrestrial and/or coastal areas), but also key flows \u2013 water, biota, sediment, pollutants, materials and ecosystem services. The S2S concept was first introduced by the Panel in its Issue Paper No. 3 (IP03 - Barbosa et al., 2019), in which it was proposed that Renova consider installing a permanent floodgate in the Rio Pequeno to protect waters of the Juparan\u00e3 lake \u2013 an important water source in the lower Rio Doce \u2013 from pollution by the Rio Doce in flooding conditions. The floodgate would have an opening and closing system to control the volume of water in rainy and dry periods to ensure connectivity between ecosystems. The affected territory covers a vast area in two Brazilian states, with distinct social, economic, and cultural characteristics. Both states have been degraded by centuries of extractive activities, unsustainable agricultural practices and contamination with raw sewage and solid waste. Rather than seeking a return to the pre-disaster situation as a baseline, it would be better to seek a negotiated solution that would improve conditions and kick-start a process of continual improvement in the region. This requires engagement with all the relevant parties.

The Panel also recommended that Renova support the establishment of a long-term fiduciary fund to finance continued efforts in the basin (IP01 \u2013 May et al., 2019) investing some of the resources originally intended for reparation. However, Renova rejected the concept on the grounds that it was not consistent with the mandate for immediate and short-term results. However, landscape analysis by Renova, UNESCO, the World Resources Institute (WRI), and other organisations have recommended that additional resources be directed toward a broader basin-level approach, including systematic analysis of the long-term development scenarios. 39 7.5 CONSIDER CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGHOUT The climate emergency threatens ecosystems and human well-being. Emerging diseases, water rationing, droughts, and floods will become more frequent in the coming years. Fundamental changes to the economy and social values will be vital to avoid and manage these challenges. Climate change is likely to aggravate the degradation of fragile and degraded landscapes such as the Rio Doce Basin. Restoration plans and programmes should share a common climate strategy, covering both assessment and adaptation to the effects of climate change. The Panel needed to persuade Renova that climate change issues were within its remit. Renova had been doubtful on the grounds that, first, climate change would only impact the region in the distant future, and second, that the impacts of climate change were distinct from those caused by the dam collapse. This underscores the tension between the short and long term, and between the causal impacts of the dam collapse and the need to address the underlying environmental conditions. Renova and its Board of Directors strongly contested the idea, for example, that climate change could be the cause of the extraordinary storm and rainfall events associated with the repeated deposition of tailings along the river. The Panel insisted that the theme was relevant and discussed its recommendations from TR02 (May et al., 2020) with different stakeholders. The process of restoration should consider the long-term governance of the affected region, noting that permanent institutions and those responsible for the restoration may have overlapping and complementary roles to play. The restoration programmes have generated studies, data, information systems, and especially capacity to execute restoration actions, but these may be lost if they are not integrated into the permanent structures of governance for the maintenance of nature\u2019s services. In principle, there should be a balance between tasks assigned to the restoration programme\u2019s institutions and to the long-term, permanent institutions that will eventually continue the restoration\u2019s programmes and investments. Both CIF and Renova have engaged with permanent institutions such as the Rio Doce Watershed Committee, universities, and NGOs in the area, viewing them as valuable sources of expertise. Similarly, the Panel also prioritised permanent institutions when it reached out to other groups of stakeholders. Early on, the Panel completed a stakeholder mapping and analysis of the impacted region (see discussion of the Panel\u2019s ToC, above), allowing the Panel to understand which permanent institutions might manage selected programmes in the longer-term. During the preparation of the thematic report on governance (TR04 - Maroun et al., 2021), this analysis was updated to include a broader range of stakeholders. Key findings were also discussed with various institutions beyond Renova. The key lesson for other ISTAPs is to initiate a process of stakeholder mapping at the outset and to update it regularly. This will provide clear understanding of the governance roles of each actor or agency in the affected region. Understanding the involvement of these actors is fundamental to the early integration of restoration efforts, guaranteeing continuity and long-term improvement. 7.4 ENGAGE AND EMPOWER THE PERMANENT INSTITUTIONS Right: In the image, a stretch of the Rio Doce near its mouth. Renova Foundation. Photo: All rights reserved to NITRO Historias Visuais 40 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL An important aspect to be considered in future ISTAPs is to support Panel members to participate in important regional and international events. This offers the opportunity for feedback and discussion and allows Panel members to learn from comparative perspectives and other cases, as well as permitting the Panel to share its work and insights with different stakeholders. To what extent should the Panel be involved in the definition of solutions and moving them forward? The Panel\u2019s distinct approach recognised the urgency of the situation as well as the need to consult on the direction of the papers.

That said, however, the Panel\u2019s recommendations invariably suggested pathways to improve the restoration process, whose results were carefully monitored for effectiveness. 7.6 REFLECTIONS ON THE PANEL\u2019S MODUS OPERANDI The Panel\u2019s structure and modus operandi may be relevant for future ISTAPs. Panel members met in person twice a year and held videoconferences at the end of every month. This helped to maintain the Panel\u2019s cohesion and the quality of interaction between its members. It also kept them up to date on the development of the thematic reports and issue papers and the reparation process itself. The Panel also held debriefing sessions following meetings and systematised the relevant information for use in subsequent analyses. Panel members met with the Chair at the end of each face-to-face meeting to evaluate each other\u2019s performance and consider future pathways. Panel members also found it useful to divide into core groups when developing drafts of the thematic reports and issue papers. However, Panel members found it difficult to review these products if more than one paper was being prepared simultaneously. Future ISTAPs are advised to discuss and consider this balance and to review it from time to time, considering the expertise of the Panel members and the need for their participation in selected documents. ISTAPs are also advised to generate shorter, more concise products, even carefully presented intermediate products, rather than high- quality, professionally edited reports that are outdated by the time they are presented.

The negotiations around the restoration and related processes were often extremely complex, since the multiple actors were often suspicious of each other and held distinct and often conflicting views. Moreover, the discussions tended to focus on specific, compartmentalised concerns. Despite the need for short-term solutions to respond to people\u2019s immediate needs, it is also essential to think about solutions to the long-term impacts caused by disaster. An ISTAP can influence the process by highlighting the need for a long-term, integrated perspective, even if implementation of the recommendations is neither direct nor immediate. An ISTAP\u2019s influence may not be felt immediately by stakeholders in a disaster restoration, but it does endure. ISTAPs can also influence important processes indirectly. One of the Panel\u2019s main legacies was the publication of impartial and independent analysis and technical advice that could be used by actors in different contexts, beyond that of the restoration of the Rio Doce watershed. By publishing thematic reports and issue papers throughout its five years of operation, the Panel contributed to discussions to change practices in the sector and to mainstream global concerns, such as climate change. 42 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL In the image, parts of the Rio Doce estuary. Renova Foundation. September 7, 2020. Photo: All rights reserved to NITRO Historias Visuais The Panel\u2019s recommendations were grounded in globally relevant scientific literature, and they reflected a long-term approach and landscape perspective. This can be adapted to similar disaster situations, whose frequency is increasing rapidly with climate change. The Panel\u2019s process for developing recommendations was as important as the recommendations themselves. Knowledge of topics and methodologies that would never have been considered without participation of an ISTAP became widely disseminated in the process of consultation with stakeholders. This holds true for the S2S approach, an innovative methodology introduced by the Panel for assessment and integrated management of river basins. In the Rio Doce example, the S2S approach was presented didactically to key stakeholders in the long-term development of the region. These stakeholders included the CBH-Doce and the Pro-Rio Doce Management Committee, led by the government of Minas Gerais, both of which reacted favourably.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "70684ae1-765c-46c4-8a21-d1a36b9f1b17": {"__data__": {"id_": "70684ae1-765c-46c4-8a21-d1a36b9f1b17", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-summary", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Impact Report of the Alliance for Mediterranean Nature & Culture (summary)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-summary", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1c9c53272abd8890fab8452f69db7cb0d5b98c747c87c9ca5c873d172a1e67e9"}, "2": {"node_id": "eb6954b2-ffc3-4bf1-9b6d-09b61ca000f4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-report-alliance-mediterranean-nature-culture-summary", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f2bd19bd965e43fa2876db853bd7c9e6daa21078382315e59c7b9387e8fac885"}}, "hash": "daf9f07ef49dbfce1727b18dbcad9d43df1f37b644fb39596731d1c58a0195bf", "text": "While preparing documents, the Panel\u2019s interactions may indirectly have enabled communication and collaboration between different Renova staff, including those who had not previously worked together in an integrated fashion.

March 2019. Photo: IUCN/Rio Doce Panel archive FOREWORD The socio-environmental and economic tragedy caused by the Fund\u00e3o dam failure in the city of Mariana (in the state of Minas Gerais) caused impacts that remain seven years later. Still, it is also important to recognise that many initiatives were \u2013 and continue to be \u2013 adopted successfully. Dealing with the biggest mining event of its kind on the planet required organised efforts proportional to the magnitude of the damage caused by the dam failure. This led to the signing of Terms of Transaction and Conduct Adjustment (TTAC, Termo de Transa\u00e7\u00e3o e Ajustamento de Conduta) and the adoption of a complex governance model, in which the Renova Foundation is the executing institution. In this context, an independent panel of specialists was established, called the Rio Doce Panel and linked to IUCN, one of the oldest and most respected non-governmental entities in the world devoted to the conservation of nature and the protection of the environment, with a history of significant achievements. The creation of the Panel, a group composed of experts from Brazil and abroad under the coordination of Yolanda Kakabadse \u2013 a former environment minister of Ecuador and internationally respected conservation leader and policy maker \u2013 was extremely relevant from an institutional perspective, as the Panel would act autonomously and independently and advise decision-makers involved in the governance system behind the reparation process. Thematic reports prepared by the Panel outlined expertise and best international practices for the reparation of areas, which had been affected by tragedies similar to the Fund\u00e3o Dam failure. The reports also enabled an ambience of reflection that would have been impossible within the Foundation\u2019s day-to-day work and immense pressure from repressed demands, court-mandated responsibilities, and dysfunctional aspects of their internal and external governance. By enabling discussions on essential topics and producing high-level technical-scientific documents, the Panel has provided a set of inputs to assist the Renova Foundation in remedying the disaster\u2019s damage. By bringing a new and outside perspective, the Panel contributed to the Foundation and other actors in decision-making, complementing the existing work, strengthening strategic planning, and expanding the Foundation\u2019s thinking on the best available alternatives to address the region\u2019s socio-environmental and economic problems, taking into account, primarily, the assistance to those affected and the environmental recovery in the areas of water quality and biodiversity. The Panel always conducted its interdisciplinary work in an integrated fashion and in coordination with the various stakeholders involved in restoring the Rio Doce. In this important document, the Panel shares its reflections and lessons learned during its five years of work. Together with IUCN, the Panel leaves behind it an important legacy for current and future reparations, in view of the long-term nature of these actions. Jos\u00e9 Carlos Carvalho Former Minister of Environment, Brazil V Independent Scientific and Technical Advisory Panels (ISTAPs) have been established to help address a range of controversial conservation and development issues that have emerged with growing frequency and complexity at national and global levels. This report is intended to contribute to discussion of ways to improve the effectiveness of ISTAPs by outlining lessons learned by the Rio Doce Panel, an ISTAP set up in the wake of the 2015 Fund\u00e3o iron tailings Dam collapse, widely considered one of Brazil\u2019s worst environmental disasters. The multidisciplinary seven-member Panel worked from September 2017 to December 2022 following its establishment under a joint agreement between the Renova Foundation, which was created to restore socio-environmental conditions after the disaster, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4b2253e5-3c89-44ec-b5a6-764512925bbc": {"__data__": {"id_": "4b2253e5-3c89-44ec-b5a6-764512925bbc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/briefings-uicn-para-negociadores-sessao-do-tratado-plastico-inc-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Briefings UICN para Negociadores, Sess\u00e3o do Tratado Pl\u00e1stico INC-2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/briefings-uicn-para-negociadores-sessao-do-tratado-plastico-inc-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eb59773e9638b8ccc2be73f2d40763bd7ee9ad500b90121b91a2145219032de9"}, "2": {"node_id": "59d3154b-4af0-47e0-8e7c-e568f9a18c08", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/briefings-uicn-para-negociadores-sessao-do-tratado-plastico-inc-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8bad8be25620737cdd725189a7df26e1b608f7f2af2447ba7eb118639235e088"}}, "hash": "9f46dab703d3726c39ee9a9a146fa14c3c1a8469a7c49fcb05607ae1280074f3", "text": "Working in a complex and often adversarial governance system, the Panel evolved over time from focusing on restoration to looking at the broader implications of environmental management of the basin and the wider Rio Doce catchment area, as well as engaging with a broader array of stakeholders.

The Panel sought to influence the long-term outcomes of the restoration through its written recommendations and direct engagement with key stakeholders. Although the uptake of the Panel\u2019s recommendations has been neither direct nor immediate, its influence in the region is likely to have a greater effect in the long-term.

The dam contained around 52 million cubic meters (m3) of iron mining residues from the Samarco mining company\u2019s Germano Complex, jointly owned by two of the largest multinational mining corporations, Vale S.A and BHP Billiton (BHP). Reportedly, 39.2 million m3 of these tailings washed into the Santar\u00e9m reservoir, immediately below the dam, creating a wave of liquid mud that poured into the Gualaxo do Norte and do Carmo rivers, both headwaters of the Rio Doce. The mass of liquified tailings tore away soil, vegetation and sediments from the upper reaches of the river, affecting around 2,000 hectares belonging to some 200 rural properties and destroying 1,469 hectares of natural vegetation. The mud and debris demolished the villages of Bento Rodrigues and Paracatu de Baixo, damaging homes and community infrastructure further downstream in Gesteira and Barra Longa. The tailings also reached the Rio Doce estuary, 670 km below the dam, and created a plume, which spread along extensive coastal and marine areas, particularly along the shallow coastal platform. The disaster claimed 19 lives and physically displaced at least 320 families. As a consequence of the disaster, Samarco\u2019s iron ore extraction activities were halted for five years,1 and fishing remains banned in much of the basin, affecting employment and food security. Those displaced from the communities by the wave of mud were provided with temporary housing in Mariana and other urban areas in the basin, a situation that has lasted up to the time of this publication. Right after the disaster, local governments were forced to cut off the public supplies of water obtained from the Rio Doce and its tributaries, and to substitute them using tank trucks to deliver water to people in many of the towns and rural communities located downstream. In an effort to mitigate the impacts and restore the areas affected by the Fund\u00e3o Dam collapse, the Brazilian Federal Government, the States of Minas Gerais and Esp\u00edrito Santo, Samarco, Vale and BHP signed a detailed agreement on 2 March 2016, known as the Terms of Transaction and Conduct Adjustment (TTAC). 1 In late 2020, Samarco received the environmental licenses required to restart its iron mining, ore concentration and transport along a 400 km slurry pipeline, and pelletising operations at a port facility which it had installed in the late 1970s near Vit\u00f3ria, the state capital of Esp\u00edrito Santo. By mid-2022, the company had returned to 26 percent of its prior operating capacity. Samarco no longer deposits its coarse tailings behind dams but is drying and piling them for eventual use as construction materials. The fine tailings are being stored in an exhausted open pit. 1. WHY WAS THE RIO DOCE PANEL CREATED? Left: Inspection carried out by Ibama in July 2016 on the stretch affected by the collapse of the Samarco mining company\u2019s tailings dam in Mariana, Minas Gerais. Photo: Felipe Werneck/Ibama 1 The TTAC set out 42 programmes for reparation and compensation, and established an independent entity called the Renova Foundation to create, manage, and implement these programmes. Samarco\u2018s parent companies \u2013 Vale and BHP \u2013 would finance Renova, while an Inter-Federative Committee (CIF) would oversee the restoration process. The CIF included representatives from federal and state government agencies as well as municipal governments, representatives of affected populations and the civil society organisations that provide them with technical assistance. Together, Renova and the CIF were made formally responsible for the restoration, in consultation with affected communities. The idea of installing a specialist panel to provide independent technical advice on the restoration process took shape in the two years following the disaster. The objective proposed by the leadership of Renova and Samarco\u2019s parent companies was to identify global corporate best practices and science- based perspectives on the restoration. In December 2015, BHP staff members consulted with various international organisations that were concerned about the environmental and social impacts of the Fund\u00e3o Dam collapse. IUCN was among the organisations visited by the BHP staff members tasked with managing the restoration efforts. Although IUCN was unable to provide technical support to address the immediate short-term mitigation and restoration activities, the organisation had experience with the creation of ISTAPs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "44281e4f-7a43-4b04-ac2e-f89063f03e1b": {"__data__": {"id_": "44281e4f-7a43-4b04-ac2e-f89063f03e1b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/briefings-uicn-para-negociadores-sessao-do-tratado-plastico-inc-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Briefings UICN para Negociadores, Sess\u00e3o do Tratado Pl\u00e1stico INC-2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/briefings-uicn-para-negociadores-sessao-do-tratado-plastico-inc-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b3b97d2cfa4b1cda4f362f479b82ef4dedfa5fa0a9b3111c661149755c7f2d97"}, "2": {"node_id": "d76303a8-d9d3-41a3-a218-78c1e8fea52a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/briefings-uicn-para-negociadores-sessao-do-tratado-plastico-inc-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c06f080a483eb1e692572f53b857c5936bc3f07afa772130b5dd196bf7315550"}}, "hash": "ef57daec5706b4b8cccb1778f1e9a3163e041fdd5eeba36baa80fcad99dc728b", "text": "This initial consultation led to a dialogue between IUCN and BHP, that eventually led to the decision to create an independent panel.

They can help multiple stakeholders understand situations characterised by complexity, uncertainty, and cost and can contribute to effective and efficient decision- making. Organisations which have recently created such groups include the Global Environment Facility\u2019s Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP), the World Health Organization\u2019s Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee (STAC), and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change\u2019s Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP). Such panels are typically convened under conditions of uncertainty. The number of unforeseen environmental disasters has been growing, for example, linked to climate change, extinctions, ozone depletion, mine- tailing dam collapses, and more. Advisory panels are also a regular feature of complex infrastructure projects. Other IUCN panels have been set up to address the impacts of major oil and gas investments in Nigeria (IUCN Niger Delta Panel) and in Russia (IUCN Western Gray Whale Advisory Panel).3 Although some IUCN Members saw partnership with mining enterprises as contrary to the reputational 2 IUCN (2014), Procedures for establishing and managing IUCN-supported Independent Scientific & Technical Advisory Panels, https://iucn.org/sites/default/files/2022-11/iucn_istap_procedures_2014.pdf 3 See: https://www.iucn.org/western-gray-whale-advisory-panel and https://www.iucn.org/theme/business-and-biodiversity/our-work/business- partnerships-projects/shell/iucn-niger-delta-panel 4 The Brumadinho disaster led to 270 deaths, mostly employees of Vale who were in the company cafeteria located immediately below the dam when it collapsed upon them. 5 Global Tailings Review (2020) \u2013 Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management - https://globaltailingsreview.org/global-industry-standard/ - IUCN was part of the Tailings Review Advisory Group interests of the organisation, there was widespread support for \u2013 and acceptance of \u2013 the effort to achieve better results from the restoration. The reputational risk became more obvious after the occurrence of a second major dam collapse at Brumadinho in January of 2019, which caused many more deaths than the Fund\u00e3o disaster.4 IUCN followed the response to this new crisis closely: Why had the same mining enterprise (Vale) not learned enough in the three years following the Fund\u00e3o Dam failure to prevent further disasters? An international inquiry sparked by Brumadinho led to the adoption of new standards for the management of tailings dams and for restoration efforts after future ruptures (Oberle 2020).5 The effectiveness of ISTAPs is strongly associated with their credibility as arbiters or scientific/technical specialists, whose salience or recognised prominence in the fields is perceived as relevant to the issues at hand as well as their legitimacy in the eyes of principal stakeholders to offer advice on these complex matters (Cash et al., 2003). Furthermore, based upon its experience with other such Panels, IUCN recognises that \u2013 to be effective \u2014 an ISTAP should operate according to four general principles: independence, transparency, accountability, and engagement. These principles apply to all IUCN-supported ISTAPs (IUCN, 2014). While the generic principles for advisory panels (Cash et al., 2003) address criteria similar to those adopted by IUCN, the latter put greater emphasis on the need for independence from external influences while maintaining accountability to affected groups.

In the past two decades, IUCN has refined its ISTAP model to provide companies and other stakeholders with credible, relevant, and legitimate technical advice. According to IUCN (2021): \u201cISTAPs are established with the formal designation of a group of experts, who engage in provision of scientific and/or technical advice on a specific biodiversity conservation or natural resource management issue. Typically, the recipient of the advice is one or more business entities or public authorities.

October, 2018. Photo: IUCN/Rio Doce Panel archive 5 3 THE CREATION AND OPERATION OF THE RIO DOCE PANEL The first step in establishing the Panel was to select its chair through an international recruitment process that took place in parallel with the development of the Panel\u2019s terms of reference7 (TORs). This process took nearly a full year to complete and involved regular consultation with the leadership of the Renova Foundation. Given IUCN\u2019s principal conservation mission, the Panel focused on environmental remediation and the restoration of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. It also considered impact assessment and monitoring, and the relation between ecosystems and livelihoods, as well as human and ecosystem health in the affected communities. 7 Terms of Reference for the Rio Doce Panel are available at https://www.iucn.org/sites/default/files/2022-10/rio-doce-istap-terms-of-reference_updated_2020jan.pdf 6 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL These themes were compatible with the Panel\u2019s objectives, as defined by its TOR and FAQ,8 of making recommendations at a long-term, landscape scale and calling attention to NbS. The Panel\u2019s specific focus was to examine the impacts of the disaster on the environment and natural resources. The Panel\u2019s remit did not cover issues that had been referred to the courts, such as indemnification payments and relocation, or the management and disposal of the tailings and other engineering issues. Detailed discussion of the generic safety of tailings dams was also excluded since this was seen as an issue for the technical specialists engaged in the international review of dam safety. Central issues included biodiversity, basin management, water resources, fisheries and NbS, since IUCN is widely recognised for its global leadership and expertise in these areas. 8 Frequently Asked Questions regarding the Rio Doce Panel are available at www.iucn.org/riodocepanel. Above: Panel visits the area of Fund\u00e3o. October 2018. Photo: IUCN/Rio Doce Panel archive 7 Independence is central to the Panel\u2019s operating principles, but some stakeholders had questions. To what extent could the Panel avoid manipulation and co-optation given its institutional proximity and financial dependence on Renova? Any ISTAP created in the context of disaster reparation is liable to face this question. The answer is that the Rio Doce Panel \u2013 following the lead of previous IUCN ISTAPs \u2013 has engaged in a way that is independent, transparent and accountable to all the stakeholders involved. Although its role is advisory, the Panel is not beholden to Renova or to Samarco\u2019s shareholders and parent companies. Any real or potential conflict of interest is addressed through IUCN procedures and best practice.

Many \u2013 if not most \u2013 of the Panel\u2019s recommendations were then developed to include other governmental stakeholders such as the two state governments and the Rio Doce Watershed Committee (CBH-Doce). Over time, the Panel gradually put more effort into communicating its work and stimulating debate among the emerging primary stakeholders.

Such issues had to be openly discussed among stakeholders. Panel members found the interdisciplinary composition and diversity of their professional backgrounds to be an asset. However, for a multidisciplinary panel of this kind to function effectively, it was essential that key decisions be reached through consensus. This required Panel members to listen carefully, respect the opinions of others, follow formal protocols, and make an effort to comprehend the technical issues from the perspective of other disciplines. This was particularly important in the finalisation of the analyses and recommendations set out in the thematic reports and issues papers, which IUCN published under the co-authorship of the Chair and all the Panel members, even though each report had its respective lead author. The need for consensus meant fewer documents were published, since publication required a time-consuming process of internal and external peer review, comment, and re-editing. However, the need for consensus also meant that arguments were more balanced, and the writing more carefully crafted. Although changes in the composition of the Panel occurred during the five-year period of activities for varied reasons, this did not affect the methodology adopted for tripartite teamwork on each paper, though it did cause some delay in delivery timelines. However, it may have influenced the selection of topics and the focus of some of the papers without interrupting the overall programme. The Panel made an early decision to differentiate its products into two types of reports. The first were issue papers (IP), which were relatively short, produced more rapidly, and focused on specific concerns facing the restoration. The second were thematic reports (TRs), which went into greater depth, were longer, and had a broader scope. The Panel Chair guided the process of deciding themes and asking Panel members whether they would participate in the core groups responsible for the initial drafts of technical reports and issue papers. All Panel members played an active role in discussing the relevance of possible topics, which were subsequently selected based on specific criteria such as the knowledge and experience of Panel members. Panel members were expected to dedicate time from their already busy individual schedules to the work of the Panel. They met virtually each month, and face-to- face twice a year in the affected region. During the face- to-face gatherings, Panel members visited locations and communities affected by the disaster, as well as restoration sites, to understand the issues first hand and to follow the progress of restoration. When Panel members attended seminars, conferences and other institutional meetings related to the restoration, they did so as Panel representatives and accessed resources from the Panel budget. 12 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL The Panel was governed by its detailed ToRs, codes of conduct and its Theory of Change (ToC). At an early stage in its work, the Panel enunciated an initial version of its ToC that set up outcome indicators and a strategy to monitor the uptake of its recommendations by the primary and secondary stakeholders of the restoration programmes under Renova\u2019s responsibility. The primary or secondary stakeholders were defined as \u201cMain Stakeholders, Policymakers, Influencers and Do- ers\u201d. The categories were sometimes overlapping and may have referred to entities with multiple roles in the restoration. BOX 2 \u2013 THE PANEL TARGET AUDIENCES Main Stakeholders Renova Foundation, CIF and its technical chambers Policymakers Federal, state and municipal governments, Basin committees, state agencies and regulatory institutions, legislature, judiciary and Public Prosecutor\u2019s office Influencers Universities and research institutes, national and international corporations, advisors to the judiciary, and to the Public Prosecutor\u2019s office DO-ers Affected people and its technical advisors, representative associations, private companies in the basin and NGOs working in the restoration process According to the ToC, Main stakeholders include organisations which were created in response to the disaster and which are a key part of the reparation\u2019s governance structure, such as the Renova Foundation, CIF and its Technical Chambers. Policymakers also deal directly with the consequences of the Fund\u00e3o Dam rupture and are part of the governance structure, but they have a broader scope of action and attributions beyond the reparation. Examples include the three Brazilian levels of government (federal, state, and municipal), basin committees, regulatory institutions, and legislative, judiciary and the public prosecutor.

The Panel used a tailored approach to present the recommendations to main stakeholders and policymakers, promoting in-depth meetings, discussions, and joint events. Similarly, to ensure that the recommendations reached a broader audience, such as influencers, the Panel organised webinars and participated in scientific events. The Panel expected these strategies to foster engagement and bring the stakeholders to a common vision. It was hoped that these stakeholders would ultimately use and implement the Panel\u2019s recommendations according to their interest, mandate, and possibilities. Over time, the ToC evolved to go beyond Renova, aiming to reach a broader range of primary stakeholders such as state governments and the Rio Doce Watershed Committee. The Panel began to engage more directly with these groups in 2020. At that time, it was becoming clear that Renova would be unable to act on all the Panel\u2019s recommendations, since many recommendations required broader governmental and societal engagement. The ToC articulated the way in which the Panel would have to balance the demands of different actors while maintaining its independence. Managing such demands and the Panel\u2019s independence required constant vigilance. From the outset, the Panel\u2019s approach was to define the central issues and develop its recommendations, drawing upon contemporary peer- reviewed scientific literature and other publicly accessible sources.

The full list of issue or thematic selection criteria is listed in Box 3, below: 17 An issue or theme would be considered \u2018high\u2019 priority only if it passed the first three criteria and at least three of the remaining eight. Prioritisation was done in-house and based on the consensus view of Panel members. Their detailed scientific knowledge of the critical problems facing the basin and its peoples helped to identify the themes that needed to be addressed. Consensus was often achieved following extensive debate among Panel members. Once prioritised, the Chair selected an interdisciplinary core group of Panel members who were tasked to develop draft recommendations and the accompanying justification for further discussion. The leader of this core group was responsible for the paper\u2019s structure following consultation with the other Panel members and for delegating specific responsibilities to other core group members. This draft outline was then discussed at an alignment meeting with Renova\u2019s technical staff to determine whether the paper would meet the information requirements of the Foundation and other key stakeholders. The core group then began the academic research through peer-reviewed and internationally recognised publications. The research might include publicly available studies by Renova or other agencies, as well as reports from the consulting companies that had been contracted by the public prosecutor\u2019s office to review the restoration\u2019s progress. Even when Renova did not agree with a theme, the Panel\u2019s independence enabled it to proceed if it felt the theme was relevant to the broader restoration programme. Thematic Report number 2 (May et al., 2020) was one such example. Covering the impact of climate change on the basin\u2019s long-term restoration, the Panel proceeded with its preparation on the grounds that it was consistent with global concern and the impacts of regional climatic events. The Panel\u2019s work was invariably seen as independent, technical, and scientifically grounded. This was partly because the Panel members were well-known leaders in their respective fields. Some had taught or worked with decision-makers at Renova or in government agencies while they were at university or in other roles. Just as important, the Panel relied almost exclusively on peer- reviewed and internationally recognised publications. It focused on strategic, longer-term issues relating to the reparation, rather than engaging in detailed analysis of the day-to-day issues. The Panel initially thought they could produce a substantial volume of papers in short order, but this was simply not the case. The issues were complex. Documents required every Panel member to sign off. And IUCN publication guidelines contained multiple steps. This slow delivery frustrated both Renova and the Panel. Future Panels may wish to make the process more agile, to avoid overpromising and under-delivering. The multidisciplinary character of the Panel, and the part-time nature of Panel members\u2019 involvement could also interfere with timelines. Time commitments were flexible, allowing time for revision and reflection, and deadlines were not always strict. When necessary, for example, timelines were modified so that Panel members could visit sites or meet with stakeholders. The dynamic nature of the restoration also meant that Panel members sometimes needed to incorporate new information as it emerged. In 2021, the Panel\u2019s modus operandi changed when Renova requested a new methodology for ex post impact assessments in the marine and coastal areas. Since a member of the Panel \u2013 Professor Luis S\u00e1nchez \u2013 is widely known as one of the most important academic specialists in this area, the Panel agreed to carry out the 18 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL study to help advance the restoration in the affected coastal areas. This led the Panel to adopt a different mode of engagement with Renova staff, although without relinquishing its independence. The Panel\u2019s new approach enabled a constructive dialogue between the Panel and Renova\u2019s Impact Curatorship and Biodiversity teams. Professor S\u00e1nchez led successive workshops at which Panel members collaborated with Renova to further elaborate the methodology for the impact assessment. This process was the basis for producing the fifth and final Thematic Report, which presented the methodology for assessing environmental impacts on coastal and marine environments (S\u00e1nchez, et al., 2022).

This was true for the Rio Doce Panel, which benefitted from the support of IUCN\u2019s well-organised, professional support staff at internal meetings and for regular communication with Renova and others. Based in Bras\u00edlia and at the organisation\u2019s headquarters in Switzerland, the IUCN staff ensured that the Panel was able to access the most current peer-reviewed studies as well as media reports and offered insights into the perspectives of different actors and decision-makers. The support staff also managed the complex planning of site visits and meetings, both internal and external, all of which were overseen impeccably. Without the support and legitimacy of IUCN, the Panel would not have been as effective in its analysis and communications. The monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL) related to Panel outputs and recommendations were an added burden for IUCN staff, but the Panel was then able to systematically track the uptake of its recommendations by different stakeholders. The inclusion of a full-time MEL officer and the elaboration of the ToC were key decisions that shaped the Panel\u2019s success. These might usefully be replicated early in the organisation of any future ISTAP. The IUCN communication staff played a critical role in ensuring that the Panel had regular, updated access to all the relevant articles that appeared in the printed and online media, including items appearing in the local and regional, national and international press. The IUCN communications team was also responsible for communication with the press on the Panel\u2019s behalf, using different formats and media to promote public awareness of the Panel\u2019s existence as well as of its activities and recommendations, releasing all reports both in Portuguese and in English. To avoid undue duplication and mixed signals, the Panel Chair took responsibility for all direct substantive engagement with the press, while a targeted communication and outreach strategy optimised dissemination of the Panel\u2019s work to stakeholders by seeking forms for interaction that would reinforce the key messages. The editorial and layout experience of IUCN country and headquarters staff ensured the quality of the reports and their visual appeal. IUCN Members in Brazil and other parts of Latin America were consulted at the outset and informed about the progress Panel\u2019s work. Some Members expressed concern about a partnership with major mining companies in the wake of Brazil\u2019s worst environmental disaster, fearing consequences for IUCN\u2019s institutional integrity and reputation. However, the Panel Chair had impeccable credentials and was trusted by the environmental community. No formal objection was lodged. The Panel kept the international expert community and other stakeholders informed about their work through regular presentations at annual conferences of the International Association for Impact Assessment (IAIA), roundtables at the IUCN World Conservation Congress, and regional IUCN meetings. Panel members also participated in conferences to discuss their findings and stimulate broader awareness.
