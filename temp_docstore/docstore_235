In Indonesia, the state electricity company Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) has been installing additional transformers and extending its low voltage network, training staff on how to reduce technical losses, setting up dedicated electricity loss reduction teams at headquarters and regional offices, and using devices to monitor electricity use to control consumption from street lighting. So far these actions have led to a reduction of network losses from 11.45 percent in 2006 to 9.70 percent in 2010. Similarly, in Lao PDR, Electricit\u00e9 du Laos has upgraded substations and transformers, optimized feeder line lengths, 48 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre replaced old meters, and mainstreamed state-of-the-art software and hardware for computerized monitoring. The Nepal Electricity Authority currently pursues a loss reduction strategy of rehabilitating 27 feeders and distribution lines, and reducing system losses in transmission and distribution have also been initiated in Bangladesh, India, Mongolia, Philippines, Samoa, and the Solomon Islands. 7.3 Industrial and commercial programmes/energy audits Asia-Pacific countries also save energy by improving the efficiency of industrial and commercial enterprises. Bangladesh has a formal Energy Audit Cell created in 1984 to conduct energy audits in several industries. In Fiji, the Department of Energy has conducted \u201cpreliminary energy audits\u201d of a few government and commercial buildings such as Food Processors Limited, the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, G. L. Chartered Accountants, the Auditor General\u2019s Office, and Tapoo City.112 The non-governmental organization World Wildlife Fund (WWF) estimated in 2011 that the typical hotel and resort operation in Fiji could cut energy consumption by 21 percent and save about $100,000 per year in energy bills.113 India has a National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency, passed in 2009, which has a Perform, Achieve, and Trade scheme calling for market mechanisms to enhance energy efficiency within large energy intensive industries, and an Energy Efficiency Project Financing scheme which promotes fiscal incentives such as tax exemptions for energy efficiency service companies (ESCOs) and creates a revolving fund to promote carbon finance. India also has Certified Energy Auditors and Certified Energy Managers programmes. In Indonesia, the Directorate General of Electricity and Energy Utilization has a programme that provides free energy audits for industries through PT Koneba, which has also carried out audits in the cement, pulp and paper, iron and steel, and fertilizer sectors. Other programmes also exist in Malaysia, Mongolia, Samoa, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam. 7.4 efficient lighting A remarkably diverse number of lighting efficiency programmes exist among the sample of 18 Asia-Pacific countries. Bangladesh has launched the Efficient Lighting programme which aims to replace incandescent light bulbs with energy efficient and quality compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) in households. About 10.5 million CFLs have been distributed in Phase I and another 7.5 million will be distributed in the second phase. In Cambodia, the Office of Energy Efficiency within the Ministry of Industry, Mining and Energy has promoted energy efficiency in the garments industry for lighting, and in Indonesia PLN manages an incandescent lamp replacement programme which sells CFLs at half market price. Lighting efficiency programmes are ongoing in India, the Philippines, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu. 7.5 Demand-side management Demand-side management includes utility-scale programmes which attempt to reduce demand for energy. Bangladesh\u2019s Agricultural Demand Side Management programme is replacing inefficient pump sets, substituting diesel sets with solar driven pumps, other agricultural equipment, and distributing more efficient street lighting. India\u2019s 2009 National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency has a \u201cMarket Transformation Scheme\u201d accelerating the shift to demand-side management programmes, supplemented with financing from the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol. An autonomous Bureau of Energy Efficiency also exists within the Ministry of Power, responsible for promoting energy efficiency, and State Designated Agencies are statutory bodies set up by states to implement energy conservation measures at the state level. In Thailand, a demand side management programme has developed a five-year master plan, targeting 13 specific programmes across the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors, and built 330 \u201cgreen learning rooms\u201d to increase awareness about energy efficiency in schools.114 7.6 Building codes Energy efficient building codes are less established than labels, audits, lighting, and other programmes, but do exist in at least six countries within the sample.

Figure 14 A sample Energy Efficiency Label for a Mongolian building Source: Mongolia Country RA/GA 2012. 7.7 energy efficiency funds Energy efficiency funds are also less common than other options, but they are emerging in India, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. India\u2019s 2009 National Mission involves a revolving efficiency fund as part of its efforts to accrue investments under the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol. Sri Lanka has their Sustainable Guarantee Facility available for energy efficiency improvement projects carried out through energy service companies. Thailand has an Energy Conservation Promotion Fund, created in 1992, which funds various energy conservation activities through soft loans and grants, and it has spent roughly $40 million on energy efficiency projects so far.115 7.8 Combined heat and power A final nascent but important energy efficiency measure being introduced in Bangladesh and India is requirements for cogeneration and CHP. CHP systems produce thermal energy and electricity from a single fuel source, thereby recycling heat that is normally wasted in most conventional generation systems. Recycled thermal energy may be used directly for air preheating, industrial processes that require large amounts of heat, even space cooling and refrigeration. Bangladesh has roughly 1,200 MW of CHP potential for its natural gas combined cycle power plants, and in the gas sector 13 billion cubic feet of gas from industrial boilers and another 50 billion cubic feet of gas can be saved every year if waste heat was recycled in CHP/cogeneration plants. India\u2019s \u201cPower Sector Technology Strategy\u201d is also promoting retrofits and upgrades at power plants and prototyping Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle clean coal power facilities and CHP units. 51 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre 8 ReNewABLe eNeRgy From the geothermal reserves of Indonesia and the Philippines and the agricultural waste in Malaysia and Thailand to the water moving through the Mekong Delta and the Himalayas to the winds through the Gobi desert and offshore, Asia-Pacific countries have a diverse and significant amount of renewable energy potential that can be converted into commercially viable electricity and energy. One global assessment recently calculated that renewable energy sources can produce incredibly cheap power without subsidies. At the low end of the range, table 9 shows that hydroelectric, geothermal, wind, and biomass can all generate electricity for 12 \u00a2/kWh or less.116 As table 10 summarizes, if technically potential resources were accessed, sited, and built properly, the 18 countries in the sample could more than meet all of their electricity needs exclusively with existing, commercially available renewable electricity technologies. In 2009, for example, these countries combined had 318,161 MW of installed capacity but had 1,969,875 MW of technical renewable electricity potential, more than 6.2 times the size of their existing grids, though this would require further trading of electricity between countries than currently takes place (as some could not be entirely self-sufficient). Also, technical potential is not the same as economic or achievable potential. Indeed, for these reasons many Asian countries are aggressively promoting renewable energy sources as part of their future capacity additions. Because installed capacity gives only a crude indication of potential since electricity generators have varying capacity factors and operational lifetimes, the calculation can be repeated focusing on electricity generation. In this case, presuming typical capacity factors for new systems installed in 2010 (resulting in a conservative estimate since those factors will likely continue to improve), these 18 countries generated 1,577,879 GWh in 2010 but had 3,332,592 GWh of renewable electricity potential\u2014enough to meet twice their collective demand. Figure 15 shows how this potential is not uniform, with some countries such as Bangladesh having mostly solar energy whereas Bhutan and Nepal possess abundant hydroelectric potential and Mongolia, Sri, Lanka and Viet Nam boast substantial wind potential.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5391e9d8-5569-4280-99fa-c012f2b277b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "5391e9d8-5569-4280-99fa-c012f2b277b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7ccede103e337fe576f655be94341ece20eae4806dd2f0e9a3917926a88c1d45"}, "2": {"node_id": "9bc6fa11-f5b2-45d3-9d26-af02a5f599a8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e52f04fffe42cf6c872ec707b78d48c5238f43c013cd87869947c5e4bbcc8f24"}}, "hash": "da1041e078ac62b430e6277904f5d548b5a53e2d80f4204b6636e11f3c0480e0", "text": "reNewaBle eNergy 52 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre Table 9 Levelized cost of energy for new renewable power plants (2010) Technology Characteristics Typical Production Costs (US \u00a2/kWh) Commercial/utility-scale grid-connect- ed systems Large hydro 10 MW to 18,000 MW 3-5 Small hydro 1 to 10 MW 5-12 Onshore wind 1.5 to 3.5 MW (rotor", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3f006d56-011a-4ef5-9481-cfec8dfa151b": {"__data__": {"id_": "3f006d56-011a-4ef5-9481-cfec8dfa151b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "379db55e6eb67d3b13aec7269d3d1d280afb8c3f3ebc8797e9c72e171ba07484"}, "3": {"node_id": "429e37cc-301e-4b1d-8ebb-ed457935a426", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2415e98fc29a4b74cf00c13373ba3b84f16e291ee40a11d6993408a3d8b4ddf9"}}, "hash": "f9e43dce0f531cc0bb699bbdfb9e04a4ab1d7be2b63b48fdf3755e466a440add", "text": "diameter 60-100 meters) 5-9 Offshore wind 1.5 to 5 MW (rotor diameter 70-125 meters) 10-20 Biomass power 1 to 20 MW 5-12 Geothermal power 1 to 100 MW (binary, single- and double-flash, natural steam) 4-7 Rooftop solar PV 2 to 5 kWp 17-34 Utility-scale solar PV 200 kWp to 100 MWp 15-30 CSP 50-100 MW (trough) 10-20 MW (tower) 14-18 Hot water, heating, and cooling Biomass heating 1 to 20 MWth 1-6 Solar hot water/heating 2 to 200 square meters (evacuated tube and flat plate) 1-20 Geothermal heating 1 to 10 MWth (heat pumps, cooling, direct use, chillers) 0.5-2 Biofuels Ethanol (sugar) Sugarcane and sugar beets 30-50 \u00a2/liter Ethanol (corn) Corn 60-80 \u00a2/liter Biodiesel Soy, mustard seed, palm, jatropha, and waste oils 40-80 \u00a2/liter Small-scale off-grid systems Minihydro 100 to 1,000 kW 5-12 Microhydro 1 to 100 kW 7-30 Picohydro 0.1 to 1 kW 20-40 Biogas digester 6 to 8 cubic meters 3-14 Biomass gasifier 20 to 5,000 kW 8-12 Small wind turbine 3 to 100 kW 15-25 Household wind turbine 0.1 to 3 kW 15-35 Village-scale mini-grid 10 to 1,000 kW 25-100 Solar home system 20 to 100 Wp 40-60 Source: REN21.

One recent study conducted jointly by the Center for Development Research in Germany and the Islamic University of Technology noted that the technical potential for grid-connected solar PV systems was so large throughout 14 widespread locations that Bangladesh could install 50,174 MW of it, though such a large amount of solar capacity would need to be integrated into the grid and/or coupled with energy storage. Not only do such centralized solar PV facilities have the potential to expand existing electricity capacity by roughly a factor of ten, they can also do a number of things off-grid systems cannot do. The larger-scale grid-connected solar facilities, the study notes, can reduce energy and capacity losses throughout the entire distribution network, and avoid the need for costly transmission and distribution upgrades.117 In Malaysia, the IEA calculates that solar is the most abundant renewable energy resource, given the country\u2019s close proximity to the equator and support from a newly implemented National Renewable Energy Policy and Action Plan, which includes an attractive feed-in tariff for up to 150 MW of near-term solar PV deployment. Thailand, too, has abundant average solar radiation ranging from 5.0 to 5.3 kWh/ m2/day, and the northern and northeastern regions receive 2,200 to 2,900 hours of sunshine per year.118 Thus, 50,000 MWh of solar potential exist in the country, and many commercial enterprises are seeking to invest in harnessing it. About 60 MW have so far been installed, though 90 other solar farms were announced with financing and purchasing agreements in place for an additional capacity of 250 MW119 and 341 plants with 326 MW of capacity in the construction and planning period.120 The World Bank has projected that as much as 5,000 MW of capacity could be theoretically developed over the next decade.121 8.2 wind Mongolia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam had the largest resource potential for wind energy. Mongolia\u2019s potential is substantial, with wind resources occupying almost 10 percent of the country\u2019s total land area with power density of 400-600 W/m2. These resources could potentially supply over 1,100 GW of installed capacity.

Wind mapping surveys reveal that the country could generate as much as 70,000 MW from economically exploitable wind resources located in 47 provinces, with the most significant resources in the north and northeast of the country.122 Surveys in Sri Lanka have also revealed 24,000 MW of wind energy potential there. And with a coastline of 3,000 km, and average wind speeds of 5.6 m/s in coastal regions, and up to 8 m/s on certain islands, the potential for wind power generation is high in Viet Nam, with an achievable capacity of 120.5 GW. 8.3 geothermal Geothermal energy is most viable in Fiji, PNG, the Philippines, and the Solomon Islands (it also has significant potential totaling 27,150 MW in Indonesia, though this comes third after the potential for hydro and biomass). Given the volcanic nature of Fijian islands, their Department of Energy estimates that at least 14 \u201cfeasible\u201d sites exist with at least 38 MW of potential: 15 MW from Viti Levu and 23 MW from Vanua Levu, with a preliminary plan to develop 3.5 MW at Savusavu as a pilot project, though as of 2012 nothing has been developed.123 PNG, too, has immense geothermal potential at 21.9 TWh or 800 MW, meaning the country could meet all of its energy needs through geothermal plants, although as of 2010 only 56 MW had been installed in the country.124 With a total installed capacity of 1,966 MW, geothermal provides 12 percent of electricity in the Philippines, making it the second largest producer of geothermal electricity in the world after the United States. This capacity already saves the country more than $600 million per year in avoided fossil fuel imports. To realize the estimated 4,500 MW that could be economically and technically harnessed \u201cimmediately\u201d, the government is currently committed to developing as much as 100 MW and it has drilled 36 exploratory wells with at least 11 earmarked for private sector financing. In the Solomon Islands, roughly 10 MW of geothermal potential has been calculated in the areas of Nggurara and Paraso Bay, and in March 2012, the Government issued a prospecting license to explore the geothermal resources on the island of Savo, offshore from Honiara.

Bhutan already meets it electricity needs primarily from hydropower plants, and it plans to add an additional 10,000 MW of hydropower capacity by 2020, which will primarily be for exports but will also help Bhutan meet domestic demand. The technical potential of hydropower resources in Cambodia is estimated at 10,000 MW, with around 50 percent of these resources located in the Mekong River Basin, 40 percent on tributaries of the Mekong River, and the remaining 10 percent in the south-western coastal areas.132 Hydroelectricity is a backbone of the Fiji electricity sector, providing 48 percent of power in 2010. In September 2008 the Sinohydro Corporation Limited of China was commissioned to construct the $150 million 41.7 MW Nadarivatu Renewable Hydro Power Project, expected to generate 101 million kWh per year, save $25 million (F$44 million) in annual fuel costs, and reduce carbon emissions by 66,000 tons per year. That facility started operating in September 2012.133 India has about 37,000 MW of installed hydroelectric capacity but a total potential of 84,000 MW at a 60 percent load factor (or 150,000 MW at lower load factors).134 The IEA expects India to add 13,000 MW of new hydroelectric capacity from 2012 to 2017.135 Indonesia has abundant hydropower resources and the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources estimated its hydropower potential at about 41,436 MW with small (mini and micro) hydro potential accounting for a tiny share, about 450 MW. In Lao PDR, hydropower is the predominant renewable energy source. Almost all on-grid electricity generated within Lao PDR comes from hydropower: 97 percent of the current 700 MW capacity are hydropower plants (though much of this amount is exported to Thailand). However, the currently exploited hydropower resource represents a tiny fraction of the potential, which is estimated at 26,500 MW with about 23,000 MW technically exploitable. Various projections suggest that due to its mountainous terrain Nepal has 83,000 MW of exploitable hydropower resources, and almost 43,000 MW of \u201ceconomic potential\u201d shown in table 13 which could generate 180,000 GWh/yr, emanating from thousands of its fast flowing rivers and streams that total a length of more than 45,000 kilometers. Yet so far the country has tapped less than 750 MW of this potential, and hydroelectricity meets less than 1 percent of total national energy consumption.136 Table 13 Nepal hydropower potential (in MW) River basin Potential in MW Total theoretical potential Number of project sites Technical potential Number of project sites Economic potential Sapta Koshi 22,350 53 11,400 40 10,860 Sapta Gandaki 20,650 18 6,660 12 5,270 Karnali and Mahakali 36,180 34 26,570 9 25,125 Southern River 4110 9 980 5 878 Total 83,290 114 45,610 66 42,133 Source: Surendra, K.C. et al.

Socially, every year about 4 million people are displaced by activities relating to hydroelectricity construction or operation, and 80 million have been displaced in the past 50 years from the construction of 300 large dams.140 However, large dams also have important advantages. As the 22,500 MW Three Gorges Dam in China can attest to, such facilities can provide incredibly large amounts of energy. Over the course of their lifecycle, they have fewer greenhouse gas emissions than both fossil-fueled facilities and nuclear power plants. Unlike wind and solar, which are intermittent during the day, they can provide baseload electricity twenty- four hours a day. They also represent a key sector of renewable energy investment: 31 GW of hydroelectric capacity was added in 2009, an increase in capacity second only to wind power among all sources of renewable energy. Total installed capacity and investments in hydropower also dwarf that of all other major renewable sources of energy. China roughly doubled its hydroelectric capacity from 2004 to 2009 and significant expansion is expected in Brazil, India, Russia, Turkey, and Viet Nam.141 And once built, they tend to produce electricity very cheaply over long periods of time, and they have very positive energy returns on investment (meaning society gets much more energy out of them compared to what gets put into them).142 The implication is that large dams are an essential part of SE4ALL, but to ensure they are sustainable they must be properly managed. How hydroelectric facilities, how communities are consulted, and the strength (or weakness) of environmental and social impact assessments will determine the degree to which large dams can produce net social and economic benefits or costs. 8.6 Biomass Biomass is a resource with the most potential for Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka. In Bangladesh, 9 million tons of rice husks are produced annually from the country\u2019s 100,000 rice mills that could be utilized to generate 300 MW of electricity today and up to 1,330 MW by 2030. Nearly 800,000 tons of sugar bagasse is also produced from 14 sugar mills, enough to generate 37 MW of electricity. Cambodia possesses a mosaic of biomass energy resources in the form of plantation forests as well as rubber plantations and agricultural residues that come from processing corn, rice, and palm oil. One study conducted by Japan\u2019s Institute for Global Environmental Strategies and the Cambodian Research Centre for Development estimated an energy generation potential of 15,400 MW or 19,000 GWh per year, more than 30 times Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge\u2019s installed generation capacity\u2014and that amount excluded biomass from natural forests and some agricultural residues.143 61 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre Because India has an agrarian economy, biomass generation costs are very low, similar to those from wind energy. India has almost 700 million tons of biomass agricultural residues of which one-fifth can be used for electricity. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy projects that 17,000 MW of power could be generated from agricultural residues and another 34,000 MW of power can be derived from wood and energy plantations on wastelands.144 Furthermore, Indonesia and Malaysia possess very large biomass sources arising from their palm oil industries and agricultural sectors, and Sri Lanka has at least 4,000 MW of \u201cdendro\u201d energy mostly available from farming residues and tea plantations. 63 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre 9 BARRIeRS AND ImPeDImeNtS Despite the many and multifaceted social and economic benefits of expanding energy access, at least 24 separate types of barriers impede progress. As table 14 illustrates, and as socio-technical systems theory predicts (see Appendix I for more on that concept), these barriers fall roughly into technical, economic and financial, political and institutional, and social and cultural categories. Technical barriers include things like lack of equipment, expertise or maintenance whereas economic and financial barriers relate to high energy prices, poverty, and lack of financing. Political and institutional barriers include constrained capacity to plan and implement projects as well as corruption and instability. Social and cultural barriers encompass things such as community opposition and lack of awareness. As figures 16 and 17 also imply, every country in the sample confronts a multitude of these barriers.

Though the section above separates these barriers into 24 distinct categories, in many cases they (a) can be particular to a technology, place or region and (b) often overlap and intersect. For instance, geothermal power development in Indonesia faces impediments cutting across technical, economic, political, and social dimensions. These barriers include: \u2022\ufffd momentous investment needs that are estimated to be as much as $10-12 billion to achieve the government\u2019s renewable energy \u201cfast track\u201d programme; \u2022\ufffd insufficient policy and regulatory support for implementation of the Geothermal Law; \u2022\ufffd inadequate incentives and pricing mechanisms that fail to both reflect the environmental benefits of the technology and enable investors to secure a return commensurate with the higher risks they face especially when developing unexplored (green) geothermal fields; \u2022\ufffd limited institutional capability to properly plan geothermal development and sufficiently engage suitable developers; and \u2022\ufffd weak domestic capacity in the areas of resource assessment, equipment manufacturing, construction, and operation and maintenance of geothermal energy facilities. In PNG, there is a similar, multidimensional and complicated matrix of barriers facing SHS. The country\u2019s rugged terrain and frequent storms and disasters make transporting and distributing SHSs difficult. End-users are not well trained in simple maintenance, leading many SHSs to break down prematurely. Economic obstacles include poverty and lack of capital among end users, who have enough trouble meeting subsistence needs and little money left aside to purchase a SHS. Limited financing and financial illiteracy make it even harder for rural households to commit to owning their own SHS. Political obstacles include poor institutional capacity within the government, the national electricity provider, and even development partners to effectively distribute SHSs, as well as a system of patronage where \u201cbig men\u201d provide electricity or energy services to their constituents or clan members for free. National governments are often committed to increasing income from extractive industries and fossil fuels, which can be at odds with policies supporting SHSs. SHS technologies have also been prone to 66 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre unusually high rates of vandalism and theft. Under a wantok system rooted in tribal traditions, clans there share resources. Solar panels, which benefit a particular house or individual instead of the community, assault this system of wantok. Tribal communities have therefore smashed hundreds of solar panels or, worse, threatened their owners.145 This section discusses these types of barriers in greater detail, though it does not provide examples from every country, in order to keep its length manageable. Instead, it offers a few illustrative examples for each barrier category, and it attempts to keep the barriers classified into distinct, though interrelated categories. 9.1 technical 9.1.1 Lack of equipment or expertise Perhaps the simplest technical barrier, one afflicting many countries across the sample, is lack of equipment, expertise, or resources.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b0a299d-83d6-4d79-9eda-8edcec407b8f": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b0a299d-83d6-4d79-9eda-8edcec407b8f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4067777259089688a123fecef96a334e45d7f3895533c32e59c198096697137d"}, "2": {"node_id": "4ad83748-b9c6-4e36-8bf0-3afcd6405c37", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6f484ac6b92602fa93692e8eee1403c4bc29be6d2d2c63efa4030bbfec9a5e27"}}, "hash": "19a2770aaeb000d9de4ff84a1da289921bf6e31749f85030be8537a143aba786", "text": "In Lao PDR, business owners and operators report a lack of appropriate electrical equipment for productive use activities as an obstacle to expanding access to energy.

This mismatch between when water is available and when it is needed year-round to generate hydroelectricity creates a complicated engineering challenge, leading severe load shedding particularly in winter, of up to 18 hours at times. A recent independent evaluation of Thailand\u2019s renewable energy sector noted that \u201cthe absence of skilled manpower and spare parts\u201d is a \u201cprime\u201d barrier, with capacity lacking particularly in wind energy and municipal solid waste combustion.146 Shortages of raw materials such as steel and concrete have become another prominent barrier for Figure 17 Summary of barriers to achieving SE4ALL targets in selected Asia- Pacific countries 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 Bangladesh Bhutan Cambodia Fiji India Indonesia Laos Malaysia Mongolia Nepal Papua New Guinea Philippines Samoa Solomon Islands Sri Lanka Thailand Vanuatu Viet Nam Number of Barriers Facing Each Country Technical Barriers Economic Barriers PoliJcal Barriers Social Barriers Source: Country Rapid Assessment and Gap Analyses, and Country Energy Reviews (2012), categorized according to the social-science systems approach summarized in Appendix I. 67 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre renewable energy expansion, and biomass powered facilities have reported difficulties procuring feedstocks, with most biomass resources produced during harvesting periods from December to April, leaving a gap for the rest of the year.147 Similarly, Thailand has significant hydroelectric potential but some locations have no water during the dry season, making hydro units completely inoperable, at least in certain provinces.148 In Vanuatu, a small but highly mobile population speaking many languages dispersed over many islands makes it difficult to build up and retain skills. Though a biomass gasification electrification scheme has some potential, two salient technical challenges exist. One is the lack of rural technical expertise to maintain gasifier hardware in a sustainable manner. Another is the lack of professionals able to choose systems, negotiate with suppliers, arrange training, and develop mechanisms for maintenance and financial management. A third is the difficulty of sustaining cooperative or community-based energy projects in Vanuatu. To improve local technical expertise, rural educational or vocational centers would need to integrate principles of bioenergy systems into their curricula, and household surveys would need to be conducted to ensure that the communities surrounding these projects would approve of their use of forest resources.149 9.1.2 Poor maintenance and performance In India, repair and maintenance services tend to be unreliable, with relatively simple and minor things such as fixing transformers or even fuses taking weeks to months.150 In Nepal, a prevalence of water with high rates of silt and lack of sufficient crews to conduct maintenance explain why the average capacity factor\u2014the amount of time a dam is actually producing electricity\u2014hovers around 59 percent.151 As one study of Nepal concluded, \u201cat the local level, rural communities lack minimal level of technical knowledge to operate and maintain established renewable technologies.\u201d152 In PNG, a majority of their hydropower facilities are in excess of 35 years old and in states of disrepair, given infrequent maintenance (due in part to lack of parts, and in part to lack of expertise).153 In Thailand, one academic investigation noted that \u201cdespite extensive experience\u201d with renewable energy throughout the country, more than 60 percent of solar battery charging stations and 45 percent of solar water pumping systems have failed due to maintenance issues resulting from a lack of training, and to designs not suitable for the specific needs of Thai communities.154 In Viet Nam, supply chains for renewable energy equipment are \u201cweakly developed\u201d leading to a lack of \u201coperation and maintenance\u201d.155 9.1.3 Logistical challenges and project delays In Nepal, another barrier is logistical problems connected to building facilities in remote locations, and having adequate maintenance support. For a hydroelectric facility to work well, geographic and water conditions must be optimal, but many of these sites are remote, at high altitude, and freeze over in the winter.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ed205eb1-f587-412f-99d8-d52b73ecfbf0": {"__data__": {"id_": "ed205eb1-f587-412f-99d8-d52b73ecfbf0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "43de7a6109f32787dfa9ff04d552124cf0a22397b1ae97e498d89bb735a73717"}, "2": {"node_id": "9ff5ac74-df06-4a1c-891e-19cabf7ae2bd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eb0c1766a1ec88999feae6b7f6c876ab9e95f78c5eeb2f37800f01c8a4aac9b4"}}, "hash": "0394b1fb57d597616b7e0bd8967104e69d3ee7ac30cc08d4477b35840bf61ce7", "text": "Difficulty procuring technology and hiring experienced staff to install remote systems serve as obstacles.156 And in Vanuatu, the ADB notes that infrastructure outside of main urban areas in Vanuatu is \u201cof poor quality\u201d or nonexistent, that airstrips and ports facilities in the outer islands are in poor repair, that roads often do not exist, and that cargo supply arrangements are", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "675de2f6-8130-4433-bba0-143e68ef7a55": {"__data__": {"id_": "675de2f6-8130-4433-bba0-143e68ef7a55", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0921a6b311f3b5d5aa573c58b5423feb10e9d424dffc67c359541fa3d1b226fd"}, "3": {"node_id": "6486ce46-94f9-44ba-abae-998ff855bd36", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "30701ac33f6e78fe08eb06c44c7203211ade1b84f064cd4cc2ef59d5b9e325d3"}}, "hash": "fe93bd5d7008d2194f58459abbe18832f4bb6043ea35120bb26b0acfb528cd95", "text": "intermittent.157 These can create logistical hurdles to disseminating renewable energy equipment. 9.1.4 Dependence on imported technology This impediment is also experienced in eight countries. As examples, in Bangladesh, one assessment documented lack of national quality standards for solar equipment, the limited nature of local manufacturing and assembly of SHS units, and the limited capacity to design, operate, and install solar systems as significant \u201ctechnical barriers\u201d.158 The World Bank has cautioned that Thailand still lacks a \u201clandmark investment\u201d in solar energy because the industry must rely on expensive foreign technology and does not have the capacity to develop it indigenously. As it concluded, \u201cmajor barriers to development are the lack of technology, trouble connecting to the supply grid, expertise, and the availability of capital and private sector participation.\u201d159 9.1.5 Lack of adequate or reliable transmission and distribution This barrier, though it affects at least five countries, comes in many different forms. One is high rates of losses and grid inefficiency. For instance, the Solomon Islands has some of the least efficient transmission and distribution grids in the entire Pacific, with 20 percent of their electricity sales \u201clost\u201d in the network in 2009. Oddly, these losses are 68 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre getting worse, rather than better, over time. In 2010, the Solomon Islands Electricity Authority (SIEA) reported losses of 29 percent, amounting to a loss of revenue of $4.8 to $6.4 million for the SIEA every year, representing about 30 percent of the SIEA\u2019s generation assets for that year.160 This problem is only compounded by a poor bill collection efficiency that currently hovers around 70 percent, meaning the SIEA does not receive revenue from almost one-third of their customers.161 Another variant of this barrier is transmission networks that must shed load. The Cambodian grid is known for being unreliable for large industrial users and commercial enterprises such as hospitals and hotels, due to sudden power outages and fluctuations in voltage, convincing many establishments to invest in expensive backup generators and equipment.162 In Nepal, the annual peak power demand of the Integrated Nepal Power System in fiscal 2011 was estimated to be 1,027 MW yet 448 MW of equivalent demand had to be shed. Experts in Nepal have called this load shedding detrimental with \u201cthe complete shutting down and relocation of industries, inability to attract new companies to Nepal, a deteriorating service and welfare sector including health and education, in short, the complete paralysis of the Nepali economy.\u201d163 A third variant is limited transmission infrastructure for \u201cevacuating\u201d renewable resources of electricity located too remotely or distantly from existing transmission lines. As the World Bank has noted, in India \u201cmuch economically attractive wind and small hydropower potential remains untapped because of lack of adequate grid evacuation capacity and approach roads.\u201d164 Similarly, in PNG, \u201cthe technical potential for renewable energy sources is enormous, but many of these resources are in remote locations with limited demand, and are not readily exploitable.\u201d165 And in Sri Lanka, \u201cinadequate absorptive capacity of the Sri Lankan power system (national grid) to accommodate renewable sources is considered as a major barrier.\u201d166 A final type of transmission challenge relates to high \u201caggregated transmission and commercial losses,\u201d a term that describes \u201clost\u201d power due either to inefficiency or theft from illegal tapping of transmission lines. Nationwide in India, in 2011 these losses were greater than 31 percent, much higher than China (5 percent), Japan (5 percent), and the Republic of Korea (4 percent), and they created a significant burden on electric utilities, as functionally one-third of their electricity produces no revenue.167 9.1.6 Lack of water A final technical challenge relates to the lack of water. In 2012, for example, the Raichur Thermal Power Station in India had to shut down four of its eight coal fired units due to lack of water in the Krishna River. The loss of more than 800 MW of capacity left Karnataka State with erratic power supply.

These countries are especially vulnerable to cyclones and storm-induced floods that can damage energy infrastructure and lower national incomes. Figure 18 shows that since the 1950s, the quantity and magnitude of natural disasters throughout the Pacific has increased significantly. Table 14 also shows how most Pacific islands have seen severe damage inflicted by such disasters.169 These hurt the technical capacity of SIDS to expand energy access and implement energy programmes in myriad ways, from direct flooding and damage to power plants and transmission lines, to the disruption of the delivery of imported energy fuels, to the destruction of crops for biofuels, and to lowering the income base and adding to government debt. 69 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre Figure 18 Number of natural disasters Pacific Islands region (1950-2008) Source: World Bank: Preparedness, Planning and Prevention (2009). Consider the following examples. Fiji depends on hydroelectricity for almost half of its grid-connected power, yet hydro\u2019s share of electricity has fallen considerably from the 1980s (when it was above 90 percent) to today. This fall is not only due to increased thermal capacity coming online, but decreased reliability at hydro sites due to unexpected shortfalls in water, which saw a 15 percent increase in diesel fuel consumption from 2010 to 2011 alone. The past five years have seen Samoa survive repeated economic shocks related to a global financial crisis, food and fuel crises, and the September 2009 tsunami. In 2008 and 2009, the economy shrunk by 5.1 percent and contracted a further 0.2 percent from 2009 to 2010. The tsunami was the worst natural disaster to strike Samoa since it declared independence in 1962.170 It damaged the Electric Power Corporation\u2019s (EPC) generation and distribution assets in the southern and eastern coastal areas of Upolu, Manono, and Savii. Damages included toppled power poles and fittings, cracked transformers, and destroyed meters. The tsunami also damaged the headrace of the Fale ole Fee Hydroelectric Power Station, and caused a landslide which blocked the intake canal of the Alaoa Hydroelectric Station.171 With assets of only $163 million and a net operating profit of $2.1 million per year, the EPC has little revenue to draw from to address these types of damages. Indeed, the Ministry of Natural Resources, Environment, and Meteorology has projected that sea level rises from climate change will threaten 70 percent of the country\u2019s population and infrastructure, which are situated in low-lying coastal areas. It also noted that \u201cinfrastructure assets\u201d such as power plants \u201cwill be the most vulnerable given the cost incurred for construction and maintenance.\u201d172 In the Solomon Islands, the Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Meteorology has cautioned that \u201cenergy production, utilization, conversion and transportation\u201d have and will continue to be negatively affected by \u201cdroughts, floods, fires, storm surges, and cyclones.\u201d Forecasted droughts are expected to reduce potential hydroelectricity capacity and also decrease the productivity of biofuel crops and coconut plantations. Flooding and cyclones are anticipated to affect both potential hydropower and the potential generation of solar PV and wind power, which could be susceptible to flooding induced landslides and direct damage from high wind speeds. Forest fires could ravage fuelwood and energy crops and storm surges can flood low-lying areas and delay the delivery of renewable energy equipment.173 As a result, one article recently mused that \u201cit is hard to imagine a country anywhere in the world that is more challenging in terms of infrastructure provision than the Solomon Islands.\u201d174 Unfortunately, it is not just SIDS that are at risk. In Bangladesh, floods, landslides, and tsunamis are among only a few of the recent events that have directly destroyed renewable energy equipment as well as cultivated and arable land thereby reducing the capital villagers have available to make the down payment for systems.

In Thailand, the number of people at risk from flooding in Bangkok is expected to rise from approximately 900,000 to more than 5 million by 2070, creating $39 billion to $1.1 trillion in economic losses.177 The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) already warns that \u201cweather conditions\u201d and \u201cextreme weather events\u201d are complicating their operations and inducing losses in revenue. Heavy rains and floods in the second half of 2011 led to a severe shortage of raw materials at industrial facilities, forcing EGAT to curtail supply. More seriously, rains and floods \u201csignificantly affected\u201d most of EGAT\u2019s transmission system including the destruction of nine high voltage substations and more than 6,100 transmission towers.178 Outside the realm of electricity, biofuel manufacturing, especially from oil palm, is vulnerable to climate variations, such as droughts, and requires heavy investments in irrigation and fertilizers.179 9.2.2 Distorted energy prices Distorted prices are a major challenge for many countries. For some, the issue is low prices. In many countries natural gas, petrol, and electricity prices are artificially low due to subsidies that are generally unsustainable, inefficient in terms of equity goals and sometimes causing inequality, and a drag on GDP growth. This includes India, China, Indonesia and Viet Nam and therefore a very large part of Asia\u2019s population. For others, the issue is high prices. Due to its current small size of domestic capacity, its high dependence on imported fuels, the prevalence of heavy fuel oil and diesel, and relatively high transmission losses, Cambodia\u2019s electricity is one of the most expensive in Southeast Asia, costing about 14.6 \u00a2/kWh in 2000 for Phnom Penh and 25.0 to 50.1 \u00a2/kWh in remote areas; this amount has risen to 18 \u00a2/kWh today and 77 \u00a2/kWh in the most remote areas. Many of the batteries that households rely on for lighting are charged at diesel generators, further adding to costs, and the country spent roughly $60 million importing electricity from Thailand and Viet Nam in 2009.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "76bc4621-5a3c-4c0c-af14-d3884b1c42da": {"__data__": {"id_": "76bc4621-5a3c-4c0c-af14-d3884b1c42da", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1b6c2706cf27392312a22c0b0671f1387c8dbff45b2a61b546949236b163e290"}, "2": {"node_id": "9a64cb09-c30d-4d63-9ae5-6e84e99abf94", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "18079fbbcd5ffc5d7bf3f182ec7acf352922732d2e1e59cbc25cc41079338d2e"}}, "hash": "de6ffe9639aaecf3f287d42b2698100c5b05aafbd71cbe150fa9eb0d574391a1", "text": "Households simply cannot afford these high rates, even if electricity were to be made more available.180 In Fiji, half of total commercial energy must be imported, and oil imports totaled $700 million in 2008 and $1.1 billion in 2011, when it amounted to almost half of the country\u2019s entire import bill. Diesel fuel costs have recently soared by a factor of four from 2007 to 2011 in current dollars, causing a consequent increase in Fiji Electricity Authority electricity prices, since about half of their generation portfolio is diesel-fired.

In Lao PDR, starting a new business requires seven procedures, takes 93 days, and costs 7.6 percent of income per capita. Also, for an entrepreneur in Lao PDR to connect a warehouse to electricity, it requires five procedures and takes 134 days. 9.2.4 Poverty and lack of capital Low national incomes, lack of available capital, and poverty frequently make energy equipment too difficult to afford\u2014even if it would save households and companies money and other benefits such as improvements in health and productivity. In Lao PDR, one review of a biogas plant programme supported by Netherlands Development 72 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre Organisation (SNV) revealed that the upfront costs of bio-digesters and access to credits and financing have been \u201cthe key barriers\u201d to the success of that programme. After more than quadrupling the national electricity access rate from mainly grid expansion over the last 15 years, Lao PDR also faces an economic challenge to connect the remaining unconnected population who lives in very remote, hard-to-reach places including in mountainous areas. The current grid expansion\u2019s approach is becoming very expensive. The average cost of grid extension has nearly doubled from $450- 550 per household seven years ago to approximately $900 in 2010. In Viet Nam, one significant barrier is \u201cthe relatively expensive nature of new technology for consumers. Most rural families have limited cash whilst fuel wood is generally free. This limits the uptake of improved technology and limits the willingness to take loans.\u201d183 9.2.5 Tariffs and power purchase agreements Discriminatory electricity tariffs and power purchase agreements stand as another economic and financial impediment. In most PICs, electricity tariffs are set below real cost. In India, overly subsidized rates for farms have driven many electricity companies out of business, since they must serve these customers below cost.184 In Malaysia, a national Small Renewable Energy Power Programme intended to encourage the diffusion of mini-hydro, solar, and biomass technologies (mostly landfill gas capture and distributed generation at palm oil mills) has failed to achieve its targets because electricity tariffs under the programme did not match true production costs, were not based on sound economics, and did not provide cost recovery for project developers.185 In Viet Nam, electricity prices are capped and new projects proceed only with large subsidies from the government.186 9.2.6 Limited financing Limited financing is another substantial barrier. In Fiji, the penetration of credit unions and microfinance institutions remains limited (at 2.5 percent) and the country\u2019s national debt stands at an official $3.5 billion in 2011, meaning little funds are available to finance or invest in renewable energy, efficiency, or access. The government is trying to address this barrier.187 In India, many state electricity boards and smaller energy companies have \u201csignificant financial problems\u201d, with many operating at a loss and unable to make a profit with electricity tariffs that do not enable full recovery of costs.188 The World Bank has noted that India\u2019s regulatory framework \u201cfails to adequately address utilities\u2019 long-term financial concerns.\u201d189 Project developers consequently report difficulty finding credit and financing for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. As one report recently put it, \u201cthe non-availability of sufficient credit facilities and the difficulties in obtaining required finances for energy-saving projects are strong deterrents to investments in energy efficiency in India.\u201d190 In Malaysia, financing for energy efficiency \u201cremains a challenge due to limited successful cases\u201d and costs of renewable energy technologies are still \u201cconsidered high\u201d and risky by financiers.191 In Nepal, inabilities to procure financing and foreign investment are major barriers.", "start_char_idx": null,

Asia-Pacific Regional Centre electrification and expansion of access difficult because returns on investment are much lower and operate on longer timeframes. Moreover, PPL must operate at a profit because it funnels money back into government revenue needed to fund general government work.197 In the Solomon Islands, the government has defaulted on previous loan interest payments, actions that make it difficult, even today, to secure financing for energy projects, given that investors see the Solomon Islands as high risk.198 As one study noted, \u201ccommercial finance is difficult to obtain on affordable terms.\u201d199 9.3 Political and institutional 9.3.1 Political instability Political instability can also reduce investment and complicate efforts at energy planning and policymaking. For instance, Bangladesh has since 1971 seen a war, multiple famines, disease epidemics, killer cyclones, massive floods, military coups, and changes in government every two to three years, making it difficult to implement long-term energy plans and regulations. In Nepal, civil unrest lasted 11 years. It stopped with the formal end of the monarchy in Nepal and the establishment of the \u201cPeople\u2019s Republic of Nepal\u201d in 2006. Yet as of November 2011, the government was still in \u201ccrisis\u201d without an elected Prime Minister. As a result, experts have noted that \u201cfor the past three months, the economy has come to a grinding halt, nothing is happening, no funds have been allocated to Nepal Electricity Authority or to energy.\u201d200 Although the new budget published in November 2010 allocated 16.69 billion Nepalese Rupees to power generation and transmission systems, the Independent Power Producers of Nepal already stated that it is insufficient to bring any projects online. In the Solomon Islands, civil unrest and conflict in 2002 and 2003 saw national GDP decrease by 24 percent and government debt increase 40 percent. 9.3.2 Constrained institutional capacity Constrained institutional capacity serves as a meaningful barrier. As two examples, consider Cambodia and Fiji. Legal and regulatory mechanisms in Cambodia for promoting renewables and efficiency have been called \u201cweak\u201d and \u201carbitrary\u201d.201 The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) report confirmed some of these points when it noted that though the government seems interested in energy efficiency, they have not implemented specific legislation, have not created any supporting funds or incentives, and retain a \u201cweak institutional capacity for planning, implementation and maintenance of energy efficiency policies and programmes.\u201d202 Fiji exhibits rapid turnover of experienced and well-educated personnel and a dependence on foreign expertise to conduct energy assessments and assist with energy planning. As one example of limited capacity, consider the current Renewable Energy Services Company (RESCO) Programme, which most households have reported being \u201cunsatisfied\u201d with.203 Not a single household in Vunivao and less than 25 percent of households in Nakawakawa considered the maintenance element of the programme satisfactory. Some households reportedly went without electricity for almost 500 days as they waited for their systems to be repaired. As another indication of problems with capacity, there were hundreds of biogas digesters built in the 1980s of various designs, mostly floating dome types for piggeries, but they fell into disuse. Thousands of improved cookstoves were also built and sold in the 1980s but few exist today. This pattern of installing and then abandoning equipment does suggest the need for better institutional capacity in maintaining technology and managing rural energy programmes. 74 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre 9.3.3 Fragmentation or gaps in regulation Most critically, complicated energy policy landscapes and gaps in regulation can make it time consuming and difficult to pursue renewable energy or energy efficiency.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "86fc0ff0-bb9d-4a2b-b2ae-906d642e20fb": {"__data__": {"id_": "86fc0ff0-bb9d-4a2b-b2ae-906d642e20fb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8e18a9d3939cc0b23636641215306dc48e35eaffc965a680a510dc5696480e29"}, "2": {"node_id": "c35372e5-bba7-4a8c-97d3-9cf678b86719", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2a97e04529201cd388f524091b7fd9da4dc850b4c60bc4393f43140d74f0ceca"}}, "hash": "c4df09b7dca5cb60cee9cd44341eb7fa7501531dcbc423ff3c96993ff30decf9", "text": "In India, the IEA describes acquiring permits for land as \u201ca slow and lengthy process\u201d with \u201cmany key energy and infrastructure projects\u201d not progressing due to \u201cthe lagging administrative process\u201d and \u201cexcessive red tape\u201d.204 The World Bank has noted that one negative result of India\u2019s regulatory environment is \u201cunintended overlaps, reduced transparency and fiscal discipline, unnecessary complexity in claiming subsidies, and ineffective leverage for the amount spent on renewable energy development.\u201d205 Consequently, Indian renewable energy projects suffer from an excessively long development cycle.206 As one example of this, the World Bank estimates that 60 percent of a small hydropower project cycle time involves getting various government clearances from: (1) wildlife, fisheries, panchayat, irrigation, public health, and revenue departments; (2) the Structural Engineering Research Centre (for power", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c128ab7-f7f4-4a9f-92ae-0b6b75699743": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c128ab7-f7f4-4a9f-92ae-0b6b75699743", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "184c385dc48c26c8e051cd7e56f7a07bfe39e53e2b55985c2eff39275ce2b05d"}, "3": {"node_id": "fe7e2482-aecf-44cd-9932-8f8bfa885143", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "58af331697c58ef1ae1f8f586504a51a3c80daf4855fc1b455a55786ee334497"}}, "hash": "ce215673b886ce082f70481f4301063095112e7f33b162f3acf120bc97d6d826", "text": "purchase agreements); (3) forest center, pollution control board, industrial license, labor permits, state transmission utilities; (4) distribution companies\u2019 approval for interconnection and for usage of explosives for excavation; (5) state nodal agencies (for implementation agreement, infrastructure permission); and (5) approval from state utilities and transfer of land in cases involving tribal areas.

In Mongolia, institutional capacity is still limited within and between government planners, development agencies, soum centers, and retailers. As reported in the national rapid assessment and gap analysis (RA/GA), an \u201cinstitutional and regulatory vacuum\u201d remains, with no single government agency committed to advancing renewable energy. Although Mongolia continues to improve its regulatory framework to promote energy efficiency, its current energy planning processes suffers from inconsistent policies and poor coordination between different ministries and a lack of transparency. In Nepal, UNDP has noted that \u201cno single institution\u201d could \u201cprovide the horizontal alignment and necessary focus on linkages between energy poverty\u201d and give \u201coverall direction to a collective pro-poor energy strategy\u201d.207 UNDP also documented a lack of centralized energy planning, duplication of efforts resulting from lack of coordination, and disputes between local and national institutions over energy planning. In Samoa, access to rivers on customary owned land and obtaining village support is often time consuming and full of uncertainties. Most villages dispute government claims of state ownership of rivers and water bodies, often resulting in protracted negotiations for compensation.208 This complicates attempts to build new hydroelectric and biomass-based energy systems. The Rural Electrification Unit within the Energy Division of the Solomon Islands is notoriously understaffed and underfunded, and \u201cno dedicated agency is assigned to manage and promote rural electrification.\u201d209 In Thailand, notwithstanding a strong policy framework for renewable energy, some studies have identified a \u201clack of collaboration between agencies and companies\u201d which can result in delays for many renewable energy projects.210 Laws requiring public input and participation in project siting, especially for hydroelectric dams, may protect communities from projects they see as harmful but also result in meaningful delays on getting projects approved.211 In Vanuatu, friction exists between an electricity system predicated on concessions, which must make money, and electrification efforts, which cost money.212 In Viet Nam, a \u201cprimary gap\u201d is \u201cno comprehensive policy or plan for enhancing access to all forms of thermal energy for households, on its own or as part of wider national energy policies.\u201d213 9.3.4 Corruption and patronage The analysis shows that corruption and political patronage can impede SE4ALL efforts. For instance, in Lao PDR, slow implementation of the anti-corruption decree issued in November 1999 by the Prime Minister\u2019s Office has corresponded with a rise in bribes, patronage, and corruption associated with energy projects. In Nepal, only 2 percent of the economy in Nepal is \u201cformal\u201d, meaning the bulk of activity is untaxed and unregulated.214 9.3.5 Commitment to fossil fuels Many Asian governments remain fully committed to fossil fuels, obviating a lasting commitment to SE4ALL.

The government has also announced plans to build the fifth power station in the capital city, a new 480 MW coal-fired facility near the Shivee Ovoo mine to provide electricity throughout the area as well as a 150 MW plant near Uhaahudag 76 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre and an additional 450 MW facility at Oyu Tolgoi. With economic growth rates of 17.6 percent in 2011 and 12.3 percent in 2012, the government also expects that they will need to build more centralized plants around Ulaanbaatar and extend the grid to accommodate new commercial and industrial users. Even in Sri Lanka, with its strong markets for renewable energy and the creation of its Sustainable Energy Authority, it is clear that the government\u2019s main goal seems to be to quickly restore development particularly in the northern and eastern parts of the country that were damaged by the civil war and kick start Sri Lanka\u2019s industrial development, including investing in energy infrastructure. Two new major coal power plants are currently under construction, one in Puttalam, Northwestern Province (900 MW), and the other in Trincomalee, Eastern Province (1,000 MW), which are seen as harbingers of economic growth for the country. In fact, these plants have become such potent national symbols that Sri Lanka now carries them on their currency. Moreover, with 88 percent of households electrified thus far and ambitious targets to achieve 100 percent electrification by late 2012 and early 2013,216 energy access is seen as a political priority that has been accomplished. 9.3.6 Lack of private sector involvement Some Asian energy sectors remain heavily dominated by public sector companies with little private sector participation. In India, for example, the electricity, oil, gas, and coal sectors all have less than 40 percent participation of the private sector. This has served as a significant deterrent to foreign investment in Indian energy infrastructure.217 Indonesia and Malaysia, too, have energy sectors aligned closely with government- linked companies such as Pertamina, PLN, Petronas, and Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB). In the Philippines, renewable energy diffusion remains impeded by \u201crestrictions on foreign ownership of renewable projects\u201d.218 9.4 Social and cultural 9.4.1 Stigmatization Startup problems and lack of confidence can lead to a negative stigmatization of renewable energy projects in some cases. Given the challenges facing the government\u2019s Solar RESCO Programme mentioned above, the most significant social barrier in Fiji could now be a social stigma developing against renewable energy, particularly SHS, in rural areas. Researchers at Murdoch University and the University of Western Australia, for example, concluded that the programme was \u201cseen by many stakeholders to suffer from a lack of well-developed planning and policy support\u201d manifesting in \u201ca lack of support infrastructure and in a weak monitoring and maintenance programme, which in turn give rise to significant technical problems.\u201d219 More than half of respondents surveyed reported that monthly payments on energy had increased rather than decreased, and a strong majority stated both that SHS use had failed to produce positive economic change and that they did not result in new employment opportunities. This type of a stigmatization barrier could conceivably exist wherever failed energy access programmes have soured perceptions of renewable energy and/ or electrification efforts. 9.4.2 Local opposition and protests A separate social challenge to renewable energy encompasses local opposition. Sometimes, upstream and downstream villages in Bhutan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka cannot agree on how to share water resources or, in other cases, agree on how to distribute the costs of installing a hydroelectric facility or using its electricity. 9.4.3 Limited awareness and information Shortages of information and limited awareness exist in many Asian countries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ba2590dd-e12a-491f-86e4-9632441210e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "ba2590dd-e12a-491f-86e4-9632441210e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f26f58f72f80d210065f9b896568de5348f84cfcc60475199570cfa9d83fd86a"}, "2": {"node_id": "8117b643-2ab7-493e-814e-c4ffddbc0326", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eb33f78075335a3a178fc6485d6815480e14ea39468f6f0aeb3956427dca4c49"}}, "hash": "2ec826c90c843a442c5f9e2c966fe3e83d05dfd5179169b74d9bd360c69e6f9b", "text": "In Lao PDR, almost one-third of business owners and operators reported a lack of information on equipment brand names, types, and sizes related to renewable energy and energy efficiency devices.220 In Mongolia, reliable information about the country\u2019s energy use is difficult to acquire.221 In Nepal, one study warned of a \u201clack of awareness\u201d about renewable energy in rural areas, with rural communities \u201cunaware\u201d of the benefits of renewables and the costs of depending on traditional energy.222 In Viet Nam, \u201climited understanding\u201d of renewable energy \u201cat the local level\u201d is reported as pervasive.223 9.4.4 Theft and vandalism A somewhat unique challenge relates to an abnormally high frequency of theft and vandalism of solar panels and other individual renewable energy units within PNG.

Introducing a solar panel into these types of homes can assault their communal value system, as it benefits only one household or community rather than the entire clan. Tribal communities can therefore react aggressively and negatively by stealing or destroying it.224 9.4.5 Social norms and consumer preferences Often, cultural norms and consumer preferences need to be factored in the dissemination of renewable energy. In Bangladesh, an aversion to pigs prevents households from adopting biogas units that would run on pig waste. Other households refuse to purchase biogas cookstoves at all because they are uncomfortable with the idea of piping in gas from livestock and human excrement, which they see as \u201cimpure\u201d.225 In Lao PDR, most cattle farmers and livestock owners do not pen their animals, making it difficult and time intensive to scour grasslands and fields to collect manure, especially compared to the relatively effortless task of collecting fuelwood.226 In Mongolia and parts of rural China, nomadic herders remain mobile all year round, making it difficult to provide them with either electricity or modern energy services. 9.4.6 Entitlement mentality Finally, some households perceive energy not as a commodity to be purchased, but as a gift or social necessity that they are entitled to for free. In Nepal, a social norm against collecting revenue for electricity further inhibits the profitability of hydro schemes. Many believe hydroelectric facilities should serve the community for free, and that poor families should not have to pay for electricity. The problem with this view is that it creates social opposition to charging rural households for hydroelectricity.227 Correspondingly, in PNG many rural families have no savings, credit, debt, or even money or even money, and also expect electricity and fuel to be given to them for free by wealthier clan members or even political leaders.228 In Sri Lanka, homes devastated by a longstanding civil war hold the government responsible and see free or low-cost provision of electricity as meeting their responsibility to repair the country.229 79 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre 10 oveRComINg BARRIeRS AND CASe StUDIeS The presence of the barriers in Chapter Nine of the report should not imply that successful case studies of expanding energy access do not exist, or that investments in electrification, energy access, and renewable energy do not bring a suite of social, economic, and environmental benefits. However, the 24 distinct barriers clearly imply the need for policy intervention. Moreover, current projections suggest that the investment required to eliminate energy poverty by 2030 is $49 billion per year, only 3 percent of total global energy infrastructure investments yet well above the $14 billion that is presently being invested each year.230 As the most recently available data reveal, there are 11 countries that have electrified less than half of their population\u2014 see table 16\u2014and there are 21 countries that have more than half of their population dependent on traditional fuels for cooking. Countries that have achieved success in electrification, energy efficiency and a share of renewables in the energy mix have often done so due to explicit and aggressive policies. Since its independence in 1957, Malaysia strived to achieve universal access to basic infrastructure services, and today has an electrification rate of 99.4 percent. This is to a large extent due to ambitious policy targets expressed in its consecutive five year National Development Plans, with appropriate development budget allocations. The Four-Fuel Diversification Policy introduced in 1981, aimed at reducing the over- dependence on a single fuel source and focus on four main sources of fuel, i.e., oil, hydropower, natural gas, and coal. A Fifth-Fuel Policy was introduced in 2000, focusing on incorporating renewable energy as next available fuel for power generation. In 2010 Malaysia approved a National Renewable Energy Policy and Action Plan for a more aggressive deployment of renewable energy in the country. The Philippines has an electrification rate of 89.7 percent, and almost tripled their power generation between 1991 and 2011, from 25,649 GWh in 1991 to 69,050 GWh in 2011. Their positive electrification rate stems from an aggressive National Electrification Act passed in 1969 which entrusted efforts to Rural Electric Cooperatives (RECs), which involved local communities as key elements of electrification. Currently, a rural electrification programme with rigorous targets is being implemented by the National Table 16 Electrification rates and traditional fuel dependence Country Electrification Rate (%) Country Population Dependent on Traditional Fuels (%) Myanmar 13 Timor-Leste 98.7 Afghanistan 15.5 DPR Korea 97.7 Solomon Islands 16 Cambodia 95 PNG 17.6 Afghanistan 95 Timor-Leste 22 Lao PDR 95", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ef3b9c2e-984f-487d-a0ee-709476f6869d": {"__data__": {"id_": "ef3b9c2e-984f-487d-a0ee-709476f6869d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c82d5f737c0f127f4112e542760edfde2b5b9fb8ee0e421e72b6d6be03cc21ea"}, "3": {"node_id": "ebe2b78d-75dc-48ae-bbb0-3220022e135d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "666eb144de2725e75be1a297b36df4bfecba1bff5e75480e6390a0fbd441845a"}}, "hash": "d58439b5012e5a292c431c3e6fc50d80920acbaf4f800de756fff4606eeeac22", "text": "Cambodia 24 Myanmar 95 DPR Korea 26 Solomon Islands 95 Vanuatu 27 PNG 90 Bangladesh 41 Bangladesh 89 Nepal 43.6 India 82 Lao PDR 55 Nepal 81 Pakistan 81 China 80 Vanuatu 79 Indonesia 72 Thailand 72 Samoa 70 Viet Nam 70 Bhutan 67 Sri Lanka 67 Mongolia 51 Source: Figures reorganized from those presented in the Introduction. overcomiNg BarrierS aND caSe StUDieS 80 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre Electrification Administration (NEA) and the country\u2019s 110 electric cooperatives, of which more than 53,000 households have benefitted so far, according to NEA. Looking to the future, what sorts of business and financial models are best suited to promote SE4ALL? What lessons do they tell us? And what particular case studies offer guidance in practice? This chapter discusses each question in turn. 10.1 Business and financial models for Se4ALL The policies and models employed by institutions and governments to promote energy access can vary significantly. Based on an extensive, four-year assessment of 1,156 energy access and development programmes being implemented throughout the Asia Pacific, many of them mentioned in this report, ten approaches seem the most widespread: (1) a cash model, (2) a donation model, (3) a credit or microfinance model, (4) a mixed finance model, (5) a fee for service or ESCO model, (6) a technology improvement model, (7) a cooperative model, (8) a cross subsidization model, (9) a project finance model, and (10) a capacity building model.231 A \u201ccash model\u201d refers to when customers purchase the product paying the full cost. It is most commonly applied to SHSs and small hydro schemes, and the owners of such technologies are usually moderately wealthy private individuals and in some cases communities or public organizations. A \u201cdonation model\u201d is one where the technology is transferred to the community as a gift, usually from a private entity (part of their corporate social responsibility programme) or a development donor. It has been utilized for all types of renewable energy with varying degrees of quality and installation. A \u201ccredit model\u201d or \u201cmicrofinance model\u201d refers to when local dealers sell their products to rural clients on credit against collateral or personal guarantees. It is commonly applied to SHSs, biogas units, and improved cookstoves. Payment is done in installments, and this type of partnership has high installation expenses due to the transaction costs associated with acquiring credit and high to medium quality products. This model also excludes poor families without the ability to provide collateral. A \u201cmixed finance model\u201d is when governments provide a fixed subsidy and the balance is borne by villagers or private firms. It is most commonly applied to microhydro schemes and SHSs, with ownership residing either with individuals or the community. The model requires high quality products from prequalified companies, and it has relatively high installation costs due to lengthy quality assurance procedures. A \u201cfee for service\u201d model is one where renewable energy technology is owned, operated, and maintained by a supplying company, but the customer pays regular fees for using it. It, too, has been utilized for all types of renewable energy with varying degrees of quality and installation cost. A \u201ctechnology improvement\u201d model attempts to \u201cpush\u201d the supply of a given technology by improving its performance, often through research subsidies, product guarantees, warranties, technical standards, or improved manufacturing techniques. It has been largely used for SHSs. A \u201ccooperative\u201d model refers to when households or investors band together to create their own cooperative which contributes all or some to the installation or operation of energy equipment. It is usually used for larger systems, such as solar micro-grids, commercial scale biogas units, or microhydro dams. A \u201ccross subsidization\u201d model refers to when wealthier homes, or particular subclasses of electricity or energy customers, pay higher energy rates to produce money that then offsets the cost of expanding access to energy for poorer customers. It is usually applied to grid-extension efforts and occasionally to SHSs. A \u201cproject finance model\u201d supports small- and medium-scale projects with loans and financial assistance from commercial banks. These projects are often at the commercial or village scale and involve micro-grids or sales of electricity back to the national grid.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ebe2b78d-75dc-48ae-bbb0-3220022e135d": {"__data__": {"id_": "ebe2b78d-75dc-48ae-bbb0-3220022e135d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c82d5f737c0f127f4112e542760edfde2b5b9fb8ee0e421e72b6d6be03cc21ea"}, "2": {"node_id": "ef3b9c2e-984f-487d-a0ee-709476f6869d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d58439b5012e5a292c431c3e6fc50d80920acbaf4f800de756fff4606eeeac22"}}, "hash": "666eb144de2725e75be1a297b36df4bfecba1bff5e75480e6390a0fbd441845a", "text": "A \u201ccapacity building model\u201d directs efforts not at technology per se, but at building the capacity of public institutions, private companies, or energy end-users themselves. 81 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre Many approaches use \u201chybrid\u201d models that involve one or many of these approaches integrated together.

From their perspective, those on the lower rungs of the energy ladder share a number of common attributes independent of their country: lower income levels, low ability to pay, low levels of consumption, geographic dispersion, high system losses in getting them electricity, and high costs of connection and maintenance. Public sector counterparts may view expanding energy access as a laudable goal, but can be limited in their ability to implement or finance projects, and are always under pressure to satisfy other urgent public needs related to jobs and economic growth, crime and corruption, public health, and national security, all of which tend to resonate more strongly with voters than \u201cenergy projects\u201d. National planners may hesitate to promote off-grid renewable energy projects since the technology often must be imported.233 As a result, the very poor \u201cfall through the cracks\u201d and are too politically distant and economically costly to provide with energy services. Furthermore, multilateral financial institutions such as the ADB and World Bank must demonstrate positive cost- benefit ratios for all of their projects, since they are indeed giving loans rather than grants, and many energy access projects have timelines that are too risky for these development partners. Thus, to ensure equal development and access for all, there is a need for specific programming to reach the poorest at the bottom of the ladder that are not served by commercial energy providers or large-scale energy projects that demand positive profit margins from an early point. Failure to do so prevents already disadvantaged families from participating in the Asian economic miracle; it also maintains the unequal distribution of wealth in societies. The most recent projections from the IEA subtly, but clearly, underscore that many of the poor are not likely to reach the goals of SE4ALL anytime soon. Using an Energy Development Index consisting of both household and community indicators, figure 20 presents the IEA\u2019s \u201cbottom 30 countries\u201d, five of which reside in Asia-Pacific: Nepal, Myanmar, Lao PDR, Cambodia, and PNG. When projecting the future in their latest World Energy Outlook, the IEA estimated that almost 1 billion people will still be without electricity by 2030 and that 2.6 billion people will still be without clean cooking facilities.234 That same year, the number of people without clean cooking technologies in India will amount to twice the population of the United States, and overall the IEA forecast that 39 percent of people in the Asia-Pacific would lack access to modern cooking. The IEA also estimated that about $76 billion would be required to achieve universal access to clean cooking by 2030 (an average of $3.8 billion per year) contributing to almost $1 trillion needed for universal access to energy (an average of $49 billion per year). As of 2012, however, only 3 percent of this needed investment has been committed. It is the poor households unlikely to be served by the private sector, government, or financial institutions\u2014the energy poor that even the IEA projects will not gain access to modern energy by 2030\u2014that development partners will need to consider serving. Put another way, there are certain high-impact opportunities that can help Asia-Pacific\u2019s poor leapfrog towards improved access to modern energy services. 10.3 Successful case studies What case studies, then, offer instructive direction for how to structure, implement, and enforce SE4ALL programmes? This section of the chapter presents successful case studies spread across household thermal needs, rural electrification, energy efficiency, and renewable energy. 84 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre 10.3.1 Household thermal needs overcoming the institutional and financial barrier: In 2006 and 2007, Indonesia created its \u201cLPG Conversion Programme\u201d to substitute liquefied petroleum gas for kerosene among Indonesian households. It appointed the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources to lead the programme and Pertamina, the state-owned oil and natural gas utility, as the sole programme executor. Its initial goal was to convert 42 million households and microbusinesses nationally over four years. Under the programme, every eligible household was given a 3 kilogram LPG canister, a coupon to fill that canister once for free, a single-burner stove, a hose, and a regulator. Over the programme implementation, Pertamina conducted market assessments, and built pressurized LPG terminals and filling stations to ensure LPG reliability.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "80dbaba5-c4bf-41a8-ab0b-b1629cb387e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "80dbaba5-c4bf-41a8-ab0b-b1629cb387e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8835569b197d4b949e46cf9b216d4dc73a09015831618bb46d64470f10504ac8"}, "2": {"node_id": "7307dfdc-ecbe-49d5-b781-67011d7862ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ba1debe640cd45b3c7f6af79cc44c10e98d3021bceafca671c09b6fc28e36523"}}, "hash": "908c3d12b976660848f401f8eabc5613b9979873786000d46242cc136f7fd03b", "text": "In less Figure 20 IEA\u2019s Energy Development Index (2002 and 2010) Source: IEA World Energy Outlook 2012. than three years, Pertamina had distributed initial packages to more than 44 million households and small-medium enterprises.

As figure 21 exhibits, these first six countries had the highest growth rates for electricity access from 2000 to 2009. 85 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre overcoming political and institutional barriers: The Philippines has a high electrification rate at 89.7 percent, meaning less than 9.5 million people lack access to electricity. Their positive electrification rate stems from an aggressive National Electrification Act passed in 1969 which entrusted efforts to RECs, which involved local communities as key elements of electrification efforts and massive amounts of government funding in the 1970s, when 120 RECs served more than 1 million customers.235 These cooperatives and the government\u2019s electrification strategy worked at electrifying homes, though independent assessments have indicated that many RECs face financial and operational challenges, are in debt, and that only 18.8 percent operate at a profit and are \u201cfinancially viable\u201d.236 Figure 21 Growth in electricity access versus GDP (per capita, 2000-2009) Viet Nam 100 80 60 40 20 0 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 Mongolia Lao PDR Cambodia GDP per capita (US$) Indonesia Philippines China Thailand 2000 2009 Papua New Guinea Percent Source: World Bank.

Washington, DC: World Bank. overcoming the economic barrier: Over two-thirds of Lao PDR households today enjoy access to grid-quality electricity; a far cry from just one in six families having a connection in 1995. The coverage is envisaged to reach 90 percent by 2020. How did this come about? Firstly, the Lao PDR government put rural electrification as a priority in the National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (2006-2010) and committed required resources. Then a comprehensive and sector-wide approach was adopted to carry out reform, strengthen institutions and build capacity, which resulted in expansion of generation capacity and distribution networks; improved operational efficiency; financial sustainability; and service quality. Both grid and off- grid solutions were used to expand the coverage. The government carried out tariff 86 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre reform\u2014including cross-subsidization in pricing\u2014and provided subsidy incentives for financial sustainability of the utility and affordability of consumers. Focused capacity building was carried out in Electricit\u00e9 du Lao, the national utility, in planning, design, implementation, and operation. On the ground, several innovative methods were used to improve the affordability for the consumers. A village screening process was put in place\u2014including gender- sensitivity criteria and consultation process\u2014to prioritize villages with clinics, schools, irrigation, and potential economic activities. A \u201cProductive Use of Electricity\u201d programme was launched to ensure income generation and extended social benefits. At the same time, a \u201cPower to the Poor\u201d programme was instituted to offer interest- free loans to the poor households to pay for the upfront cost of connection. When Power to the Poor was taken to already electrified villages, the coverage went up from 80 percent to 98 percent including the poor. Where off-grid solar systems were used to expand access, a hire-purchase scheme was implemented facilitating partial payments over a ten-year period making the systems accessible to the poor. Off-grid systems have covered about 2.5 percent of the households, particularly in remote, inaccessible regions. The tariff reforms carried out by the government coupled with capital subsidies have attained an average energy price of $0.065/kWh against the cost of supply of $0.05/kWh. Systems losses went down to 13 percent in 2009 from 20 percent in 2005. Some of the key lessons from the Lao PDR experience are: Well-governed utilities can achieve fast expansion of access with the private sector playing a complementary role; strong commitment of government is critical; a combination of pricing and incentive mechanisms are necessary for financial sustainability and consumer affordability; strong commitment and capacity are a requisite for programme managers; and, innovative, customized solutions such as are often required to reach the poor.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc4cbe71-a4de-403b-9c2f-999938d51505": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc4cbe71-a4de-403b-9c2f-999938d51505", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3d27bcb752732307c3ce6a05e7a18942efed2da99463983d4e4365d02274080d"}, "2": {"node_id": "e219298d-5565-4e21-ade8-34c07839be05", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "adbf4e2a3c8098a7152eb317ecf5d80d227810269ea3149e82452e8814790418"}}, "hash": "e5b189a0b41355392ef6d51d2dd014c1a5c8047e2c40c4c90138162abee2dd7a", "text": "Bangladesh and Sri Lanka also offer some interesting cases.

The Indian economy, for example, doubled in size from 2000 to 2007 and energy demand is expected to double nationwide from 2007 to 2030. The Government of India has therefore recognized the importance of energy efficiency, passing the National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency in 2009, the second of eight Missions under India\u2019s National Action Plan on Climate Change. The Mission\u2019s goal is to save 5 percent of energy consumption by 2015, or almost 100 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. This Mission is wide-ranging, and it involves the following schemes: \u2022\ufffd Perform, Achieve, and Trade: calling for market mechanisms to enhance energy efficiency within large energy intensive industries; \u2022\ufffd Market transformation: accelerating the shift to more efficient appliances and demand-side management programmes, supplemented with financing from the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol; \u2022\ufffd Energy Efficiency Project Financing: promoting fiscal incentives such as tax exemptions for ESCOs and creating a revolving fund to promote carbon finance; \u2022\ufffd Power Sector Technology Strategy: promoting retrofits and upgrades at power plants and prototyping Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle clean coal power facilities; \u2022\ufffd \u201cOther initiatives\u201d including the creation of public sector energy efficiency companies, state designated agencies, and enhancing public awareness. An autonomous Bureau of Energy Efficiency also exists within the Ministry of Power, responsible for promoting energy efficiency and designing policy, and State Designated Agencies are statutory bodies set up by states to implement energy conservation 87 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre Tariffs for microhydro units were set by each Microhydro Functional Group, and were based on loan repayments, operation and maintenance costs, depreciation, and provision of a reserve fund for maintenance. Only schemes expected to yield positive Net Present Value were promoted. overcoming the technical barrier: One unique element of the REDP was its emphasis on being decentralized and community-led (local ownership of operations and maintenance). The programme provided extensive training in operations and maintenance for local operators and managers from each local community doing a microhydro project, assigned to each system, so that they would understand technical aspects of operation, bill collection, disconnecting for non-payment, record keeping, and accounting. Turbines and control systems are manufactured in Nepal, and maintenance support facilities and service centers within districts were established and strengthened to provide technical support. Another unique element was that part of REDP project funds was given to promote women\u2019s empowerment, skills enhancement, better management of technology, and income generation. emphasizing sustainability: From the beginning, REDP focused on financial sustainability of the renewable energy system it supported. Each micro hydro plant was provided financial support and technical assistance to make productive use of electricity and generate revenue to cover operation and maintenance costs. A Community Energy Fund (CEF) is established in each project. This fund focused on coupling hydropower with income generation schemes, and it offered $400,000 in total for the promotion of non-lighting uses of electricity such as agro-processing, poultry farming, carpentry workshops, bakeries, ice making, lift irrigation, and water supply. To support these activities, Rs 10,000 per kW of installed capacity was given (though capped at Rs 250,000 per plant). Resources from partner organizations and the local communities were mobilized through CEF to cover the financing of projects. The CEF also gave grants for power connections from microhydro schemes to members of vulnerable and marginalized communities. Schools, health posts, clinics and hospitals in micro hydro catchment areas are provided energy at a concessional rate decided by the community. REDP also promoted afforestation to not only offset trees felled for the construction of distribution poles but also to support the communities to have their own forest. measures at the state level. India has an energy efficiency labeling programme, launched in May 2006, and an Energy Building Conservation Code, launched in May 2007. As the IEA has noted, \u201cenergy efficiency has emerged as one of the key policy priorities in India\u2019s energy sector.\u201d 237 The IEA has also estimated that 42 percent of emissions reductions in India during 2010 to 2050 will come from energy efficiency improvements at power plants, industrial users, and homes.238 Such potential for energy efficiency has been confirmed by multiple independent assessments as well.239 10.3.4 Renewable energy Though many countries", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "281dcfb9-4c9d-4fdf-9227-c42fb91e8c7e": {"__data__": {"id_": "281dcfb9-4c9d-4fdf-9227-c42fb91e8c7e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9e40e112224d5ca87a4780982ae136690a2011512fca733d47f542e8bd1adf26"}, "3": {"node_id": "80edd6ea-1914-4c8f-a381-e23ce00a5907", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "845996c9c8c053e4a89db6513aff3f9517e056b87da6be69bcfa5d6c852c38ab"}}, "hash": "b46e3c94e46337632db000a08832ad6b7975ebfc97360863d4ab5454ee8df3cf", "text": "within the 18 have demonstrated remarkable success with renewable energy, two especially stand out: Nepal for its promotion of off-grid microhydro through the REDP and Thailand for its policy framework for renewable electricity. overcoming institutional barriers: UNDP\u2019s REDP in Nepal, now Renewable Energy for Rural Livelihood Programme, offers an excellent example of how to rapidly diffuse microhydroelectric facilities ranging from 10 kW to 100 kW, with an average plant size of 25 to 30 kW. Programme implementation was decentralized to local governments, with District Development Communities and Village Development Communities required to form Microhydro Functional Groups in each community. The Alternative Energy Promotion Center, an autonomous body established in 1996 under the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment, was tasked with assuming overall management of the Programme. The intended benefit was to provide customers currently dependent on kerosene and other fuels for lighting with reliable electricity. A secondary benefit came from the promotion of productive end use activities such as cereal milling, rice husking, and mustard seed processing as well as the replacement of manual implements for carpentry by electrical machines and tools, though to prevent deforestation project financing could not be used for sawmills. The REDP required that communities wishing to build microhydro facilities donate land for the construction of canals, penstocks, power houses, and distribution lines voluntarily. Furthermore, villagers were required to contribute labor for civil works related to microhydro units. 88 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre As a result of these combined efforts, microhydro system coverage grew under the REDP from only a few thousand homes in 25 districts in 2003 to 40 out of 50 targeted districts and 40,000 households in 2007 and more than 75,000 homes as of December 2012. Now, all 75 districts of Nepal have a District Energy and Environment Section to support communities to install and operate renewable energy systems. REDP started as a pilot project in 1996 and then expanded with the World Bank and UNDP funding in 2003 and is being mainstreamed through the National Rural and Renewable Energy Programme of Alternative Energy Promotion Centre. The Government of Nepal is planning to reach another 150,000 households by 2017 through the National Rural and Renewable Energy Programme. overcoming political and regulatory barriers: Thailand has done a noteworthy job promoting renewable sources of electricity. Indeed, the IEA has ranked Thailand\u2019s level of policy support for renewables as \u201chigh\u201d, ranking it more favorably than any other Southeast Asian country.240 Researchers from Chulalongkorn University in Thailand have also estimated that the country could cost effectively expand renewable energy supply from 1,750 MW in 2009 to at least 5,605 MW by 2022.241 Much of this potential is the result of Thailand\u2019s national feed-in tariff, coupled with the wide-ranging regulations and policy actions undertaken, as shown in table 18.242 Table 18 Major renewable-energy-related policies in Thailand Year Name Description 2012 10-Year Alternative Energy Development Plan 2012-2021 Targets increasing the share of alternative energy by 25 percent within the next 10 years, resulting in replacement of some planned conventional (using fossil fuels such as coal-fired or gas-fired based) power plants by renewable power plants. 2009 Corporate Income Tax Exemption for Sale of Certified Emission Reductions Sale of Certified Emissions Reductions exempt from corporate income tax. 2009 National feed-in tariff Replaces earlier tariff schemes and offers competitive rates for renewable energy depending on the type of technology utilized ranging from 0.30 baht/kWh for biomass/biogas projects, to 8.0 baht/kWh for solar energy. In addition, there will be an extra 1.00 baht (US$0.03) per kWh tariff (or 1.50 baht [US$0.04] per kWh tariff in the case of wind and solar) for projects that replace diesel consumption in power generation in the relevant areas of the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA).

Short term (2008-2011) emphasizes promoting commercial alternative energy technologies and high-potential energy sources such as biofuels, co- generation from biomass and biogas; Midterm (2012-2016) is focusing on the development of the alternative energy technology industry, encouraging R&D to achieve economic viability and the development of a sustainable \u201cgreen city\u201d model. Long term (2017-2022) should enhance new alternative energy technologies (such as hydrogen and bio- hydrogenated systems), extend green city models throughout Thai communities, and encourage exports of biofuels and alternative energy technologies in the ASEAN region. Various incentives include provision of pricing subsidies/feed- in tariffs through the Small and Very Small Power Producer programmes using renewable energy, co-generation and microhydropower projects for instance, and tax and non-tax incentives. 2007 Tenth National Economic and Social Development Plan (2007 to 2011) Thailand must increase efficiency and develop alternative energy sources to meet domestic demand. Thailand must maintain average elasticity of energy consumption no higher than 1:1 during the period of the Tenth Plan; increase renewable energy to 8 percent of total, and reduce the ratio of energy use to GDP. 2007 Thai Renewable Energy Development Plan Attempts to increase solar thermal energy by 5 ktoe from 2007 to 2011 and reach 10,000 cubic meters of solar collectors by 2011, and promotes municipal solid waste, biomass, and biogas. 2001 Small Power Producer and Very Small Power Producer Programme The Small Power Producer Programme allows private developers to build, own, and operate 10-90 MW power projects and to enter into power purchase agreements with EGAT. Solar energy projects originally received a subsidy of about $0.23 per kWh for 10 years from the start of commercial operations, which fell to about $0.19 at the end of 2009. The solar adder (feed-in) tariff has been hugely successful, with over 1,500 MW of signed power purchase agreements, and the government is no longer accepting new proposals. In the pilot round, about 300 MW of renewable power generation capacity is expected to be installed. Source: UNDP Country Energy Review for Thailand 2012. 91 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre 11 CoNCLUSIoNS Three key conclusions emerge from the analysis presented in this report. First, though all three goals enshrined within SE4ALL are important, energy access emerges as the urgent priority with providing access to the bottom of the pyramid through the Energy Plus approach, emphasizing energy access for productive purposes as the central element. Second, SE4ALL\u2019s \u201cbottom-up energy solutions\u201d, as documented throughout this report, can play crucial roles in enabling \u201cenergy empowerment\u201d\u2014enhancing the political, social, and educational strength of communities through the provision of modern energy services\u2014and in recognising gender roles, and providing their specific needs improving health, and protecting the environment. As such, energy should be included as a primary goal in any global post-2015 development agenda. In reaching this goal, however, it must be recognized that all countries are different and programmes and policies must accommodate the specificity of each country\u2019s SE4ALL needs and aspirations. Third, in order to achieve the aim of expanding access in a region as diverse and heterogeneous as the Asia-Pacific, a regional knowledge hub can play a valuable role in guiding SE4ALL country actions. This hub can be established as a partnership or network and can conduct research, build capacity, assist in monitoring and evaluation, promote collaborations, and disseminate best practices. 11.1 Recognize energy access as the most urgent Se4ALL goal The SE4ALL initiative encompasses three separate goals: universal access to modern energy services, energy efficiency, and renewable energy.

This dependence on traditional cooking devices and fuels produces more significant and severe immediate impacts such as millions of premature deaths, mostly among women and young children; \u2022\ufffd Expanding access to lighting, cooking and productive energy uses through decentralised systems is cheaper and involves technologies of a smaller scale compared to electrification through grid extension. This is not to say, however, that the other SE4ALL goals of renewable energy and energy efficiency are less important. Energy efficiency is equivalent to the \u201cfirst\u201d energy resource and cheaper as well as easier to achieve\u2014it will produce quicker results than investments in supply-side options such as new power plants or transmission and distribution lines. Efficiency is cumulative, meaning an investment made today in energy efficiency can last for the next few decades, and even centuries. Efficiency more easily enables other SE4ALL goals to be achieved, similar to access. For example, improving the types of lamps and bulbs for a solar lantern or SHSs from incandescent to CFLs or even LEDs means solar systems can be of smaller capacities to provide equivalent qualities of light. Moreover, implementing demand-side management programmes to cut utility load lowers the difficulty of meeting national targets for renewable energy since those targets are often based on projected load. Similarly, improving the thermal efficiency of a household by installing better windows, insulation, and lighting devices as well as passive lighting lessens the needed size of household devices such as solar panels. Investments in renewable energy and grid electrification can help attain the goals of access and efficiency. Electrification can eliminate the need for homes to rely on coNclUSioNS 92 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre burning solid fuels for cooking and heating; electric lighting and electric kettles and rice boilers are only one example of appliances that can displace candles, kerosene lamps and traditional cookstoves. Renewable energy systems such as solar PVs and microhydro dams, moreover, can operate more efficiently/economically than diesel generators in certain markets and/or sites. Furthermore, the importance of productive use of energy, as embodied in UNDP\u2019s \u201cEnergy Plus\u201d approach, emphasises that communities should use energy for productive purposes and that improving the capacity and skills of households/ communities, government leadership and support, reliable access to finance and commercial markets, and better access to equipment and technology are needed to enable these productive uses of energy.243 The Energy Plus Approach also sits at the intersection of the three SE4All goals. It often integrates energy access and renewable energy goals by using technology for generating off-grid electricity that is selected based on locally available resources such as wind, hydro or biomass rather than fossil fuels. Energy efficiency is also a primary concern because electricity supply is often comparatively costly for the poor and limited in areas that have distributed or off-grid power generation systems. Adopting efficient technologies such as agricultural pumps, domestic lighting and appliances can substantially extend the periods that they can be used for. Similarly, the efficiency of both domestic and commercial stoves can have dramatic beneficial impacts for users. Considering that SE4ALL is aiming to extend sustainable energy access to such a large proportion of the world that currently lacks it, the Energy Plus approach has a potentially vital role to play. The productive use of energy can help to ensure that those who gain energy access are able to afford and maintain it and do not fall back into energy poverty. Moreover, it will contribute to solutions which ensure that the carbon footprint of those who gain access in the coming years will be minimal. 11.2 Promote \u201cbottom-up energy solutions\u201d and recognize specific country needs \u201cBottom-up energy solutions\u201d\u2014off-grid, small-scale, decentralized and community- based energy technologies rather than grid-connected, larger-scale, centralized, and privately owned and operated technologies\u2014have the advantage of versatility, flexibility, and rapidity in terms of their introduction and dissemination within a given market, economy or community, as well as the benefit of responding to the immediate needs of end-users. They have further positive outcomes in terms of productive uses of energy, thus supporting income generation, health, agriculture, education, small business, and telecommunications. They should thus remain an elemental component of SE4ALL activities and programmes , targeting communities that are not served by the central grid or centralized distribution systems.244 The report has also shown that infrastructure investment solutions\u2014larger-scale, grid-connected technologies, and extensions of national electricity grids\u2014have a salient role to play as well, for they can often serve larger numbers of people at once.

The 93 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre best immediate energy development strategy for Bhutan, Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Nepal could be to focus on the encouragement of improved cookstoves and biomass gasifiers and digesters for household needs, and to harness microhydro and larger- scale hydroelectric dams to displace fossil fuels on the national grid. Indonesia and the Philippines should find ways to further tap their geothermal resources; Mongolia and Viet Nam their vast wind resources. For Fiji, the best option could be expanding upon the energy audits and retrofits being implemented and conducted at government offices and tourist hotels and resorts, starting an energy efficiency programme for commercial buildings, and promoting energy efficient lighting for households. In India, small hydropower and electricity from biomass and waste represent the cheapest technological solutions to be supplemented with the use of SHSs in areas remote from the grid where Figure 22 Energy access cost curve for Vanuatu Note: The vertical access of the figure shows the cost for various options in US cents per kWh, with some (below the dotted orange line) costing less than grid electricity already. Others (above the dotted orange line) cost more than the grid, but are all cheaper than grid extension, which is cost prohibitive at more than $1.20 per kWh. The horizontal access of the figure shows the number of people served by each option (i.e., the larger the size of the square, the wider the bar, the more people served)\u2014with improved cookstoves (about 2,500 people), batteries (1,900 people), and kerosene lamps (1,200 people) having the most potential, but only one of them\u2014cookstoves\u2014low costs of 3 to 4 cents per kWh, whereas solar lanterns cost about 5 cents per kWh, micro-grids vary from 40 to 58 cents per kWh, and biogas and microhydro units cost about 70 cents per kWh. Figure 22 does not show energy efficiency on the chart only because efficiency programmes are at a nascent stage of development in Vanuatu; if fully developed, they would likely fall competitively with the lowest cost energy access solutions. 94 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre they can compete favourably with diesel prices. Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand should continue to support grid-connected renewables with their feed-in tariffs and comparatively strong policy frameworks. In PNG, the most immediate concern could be enabling PPL to properly maintain their fleet of power plants. Samoa, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu may benefit from implementing biogas projects, find alternatives to fuelwood based cooking, and promote solar lighting. Indeed, it may be that entirely new tools need to be developed to assess the cost- effectiveness of SE4ALL options for particular countries. One novel tool developed in this report\u2014albeit in limited form\u2014is an energy access cost curve, a curve that shows household effectiveness for yearly investments in SE4ALL. Figure 22 presents such a curve for Vanuatu, and it illustrates that the total number of people that could be provided cost-effective energy access per year is 19,000. However, the figure reveals that the composition, configuration, cost, and number of people served by these measures vary, though it does suggest that the least costly four are improved cookstoves, solar lanterns, community woodlots, and diesel micro-grids.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68a0c55e-85fa-4b4d-ab35-74b25a8b2475": {"__data__": {"id_": "68a0c55e-85fa-4b4d-ab35-74b25a8b2475", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "28a281a1faf09ff976b9edf36609161532372bb98a7cb1ec533d739308d92f62"}, "2": {"node_id": "187822f6-1aa1-417a-8c9e-7c9290a2d2bc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c456555b808f2eb6d70d570349a93d17aab219fe2d26a7aaf9ca77b8b411f6e7"}}, "hash": "2c78ba655246c2ac06546ec984755254e8531677d318e60c8306bb696e18d46a", "text": "These examples, and the particular cost curve for Vanuatu, suggest that no \u201cone-size- fits-all\u201d approach exists for achieving SE4ALL by 2030.

The hub can be established as a partnership or network to serve as the center for coordination of country actions related to SE4ALL. It will communicate and encourage implementation of the initiatives of the Executive Committee and the Global Facilitation Team of SE4ALL, and ensure that at the country level, governments and all stakeholders have the means and knowledge necessary to implement their country action work plans and engage proactively in high impact actions to achieve the goals of SE4ALL. Development actors and stakeholders need not reinvent the wheel. Instead, countries can learn from each other, and good (and bad) practices certainly exist. Development partners can play a key role creating a knowledge network to facilitate cross regional and cross country exchanges, draw out new innovative approaches and work, and carry forward the SE4ALL initiative. The global SE4ALL Practitioner Network on Energy Access and the Asia Equitable Energy Access Network offer valuable resources on which a regional hub could engage. Apart from disseminating best practices, such a hub could also promote research. The specificity of country needs (second conclusion) implies that further research and tools are needed to help refine an understanding of both the energy requirements and cost-effective energy resources for reaching SE4ALL goals. The assessments initiated with the national Rapid Assessment and Gap Analyses and Country Energy Reviews could be supplemented, strengthened, and complemented with: \u2022\ufffd Robust guidelines outlining methods for development partners, private sector, and civil society to implement energy access programmes in line with an Energy Plus Approach; \u2022\ufffd Training and advising national actors in the design and provision of household surveys to generate basic data about energy use and consumption patterns, as well as the tools to conduct more rigorous resource assessments for renewable energy and energy efficiency; \u2022\ufffd The development of new and innovative tools such as the energy access cost curve shown above to help determine which investments generate the best return per dollar expended, especially for the poorest communities that continue to \u201cfall through the cracks\u201d; \u2022\ufffd The development of an incubator programme targeted at startups in the \u201cenergy access for productive use\u201d space, providing appropriate framework(s) for the scale up of various energy service delivery and business models, including pro-poor public-private partnerships; and, 95 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre \u2022\ufffd The facilitation of country level investor forums bringing together project proponents, developers, financiers, brokers and investors. The hub could also build on the idea of \u201cinvestment readiness\u201d presented in the draft SE4ALL \u201c2013-15 Strategic Work Programme\u201d, an attempt to identify the countries that are ready for private and international finance investments in sustainable energy. Though clearly a work in progress, the concept of \u201cinvestment readiness\u201d currently rests on a number of criteria including country track records of implementation capability, the existence of enabling policies and lead agencies, and a conducive \u201cmacro-economic environment,\u201d among others. A third task for the hub would be monitoring and evaluation. For example, the knowledge network of the hub could independently review and assess participating countries and partners in sustainable energy access programmes, in reaching the three SE4ALL objectives through nationally set targets and goals. Such evaluations are useful for not only informing countries if they are accomplishing their goals, but also for increasing interaction and feedback among policy makers and practitioners.245 A fourth and final task for the hub would be drawing on the High Impact Opportunities (HIOs) of the SE4All initiative. Work in this area could consider providing advisory support for scalable and sustainable business and financial models that promote renewable energy, energy efficiency and affordable access. It could provide guidance on the design of robust policies, and the necessary enabling environment. When these types of activities\u2014circulation of good practices, partnerships, research, capacity building, monitoring and evaluation, designing more sustainable and affordable models of \u2014are undertaken in a holistic manner, SE4ALL can become a reality. 97 Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre APPeNDIx I: Key teRmS AND ReSeARCH metHoDS Sources of information A majority of factual claims in the report come from two sources: the Rapid Assessment and Gap Analyses (RA/GA) that were available at the time of writing, and UNDP APRC Country Energy Reviews for countries which had not yet completed", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c2fa29de-81c9-4c59-b695-edbaca32b75f": {"__data__": {"id_": "c2fa29de-81c9-4c59-b695-edbaca32b75f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b27e3bb53c005bb4b301d81fefd4d7a08593f7ab15ffe288c03454750551505"}, "3": {"node_id": "b003d39d-11bc-47c1-a2ce-1949433e8975", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b4581413e6eef7447f0da77839e1e79fc54f0b881d86656f9b23b27cdc566d46"}}, "hash": "3236ccff1cdd8273939827d0ac5915b493b2a15cd377e6f719ac61d161a36c82", "text": "or initiated the RA/GA process or had not opted-in to participate in SE4ALL.

It also attempts to summarize progress, challenges, and opportunities vis-\u00e0-vis the three goals of SE4ALL and the major investments, policies, and enabling environments required to meet those goals.

The information presented here has been compiled for the purpose of continuing a discussion amongst governments and development partners in the region, focused on how to proceed towards these goals together using the framework established under SE4ALL. The report also seeks to assist with the implementation of the following three strategic approaches given the three goals of SE4ALL: \u2022\ufffd Support the development of a renewable energy roadmap to expand the rate of use of renewable energy systems and increase renewable energy-based capacities for energy security and energy self-sufficiency; \u2022\ufffd Support the local development, manufacture, assembly of quality renewable energy technologies and equipment and support systems for sustainability, including formulation of a renewable energy research and development agenda; and \u2022\ufffd Support towards climate-proofing, rehabilitating and improving energy systems and infrastructure, including assessment of local energy development plans. At the time of writing, many countries had opted-in to the initiative and had undertaken preliminary assessments of their energy sectors.

Grounded theory\u2014also called \u201cinterpretive tacking\u201d, \u201cgrounded reading in data\u201d, and \u201cthe discovery of theory from data\u201d\u2014enables researchers to draw conclusions from vast amounts of data when no clear theory or concept exists to guide interpretation. Basically, being \u201cgrounded\u201d means the research began without preformed hypotheses. Instead, the process forces researchers to develop a conceptual account from the \u201cground up\u201d, the analysis being \u201cgrounded\u201d in the data collected itself.246 A grounded approach works exceptionally well when few relevant theories yet exist to explain what is being studied, as was the situation with understanding the dynamics of SE4ALL in the Asia-Pacific. The process of \u201cgrounding\u201d and synthesizing data led the author to consider utilizing the social science systems approach, or socio-technical systems approach, to help guide the structuring of the section of the report on \u201cBarriers and Impediments\u201d. In his seminal Networks of Power: Electrification in Western Society, MIT historian Thomas P. Hughes argued that the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity occurs within a technological system that extends beyond the engineering realm. Such a system is understood to include a \u201cseamless web\u201d of considerations that can be categorized as economic, educational, legal, administrative, and technical.247 Hughes, and the socio-technical systems approach that he spawned, argues that large technological systems are simultaneously social and technical\u2014or socio-technical\u2014in at least two senses. First, systems require social institutions and technical hardware to function. The electric utility system, for example, contains social institutions such as regulatory bodies and financing firms. At the same time, it encompasses physical objects such as electric generators, transmission substations, and cooling towers. Secondly, systems possess both physical and immaterial components. The electric utility system refers not just to physical artifacts such as steam turbines and distribution wires, but also immaterial or epistemic elements, such as the knowledge needed to repair a broken generator or to construct a new transmission line. Hughes uses this epistemic element of the electric utility system to explain why such systems vary between geographic regions; the different socio-technical environments in Britain, Germany, and the US produced distinct types of electric utility networks.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "67d03fa9-f61f-4308-9ed3-05d6a93b57a9": {"__data__": {"id_": "67d03fa9-f61f-4308-9ed3-05d6a93b57a9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving Sustainable Energy for All in the Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ef9ca924eff61cf96cb39a0301cce35bd45b96b5d7657f3390db9dc13add97d7"}, "2": {"node_id": "72533930-e830-44a3-89c5-2467013a072d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-energy-all-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7fac5f420e8bba54726211a50a1e58b04e5423cc72b440dce362cef25abac375"}}, "hash": "05331eaf89e8b24cd54c052997a40a271e8287040eb96f717e78ab9797e60a50", "text": "Bringing this back to SE4ALL, the systems approach suggests that in order to reach commercial dissemination and consumer adoption, new technologies\u2014in this case, renewable energy, energy efficiency, rural electrification technologies, and improved cookstoves\u2014must simultaneously address technical, economic and financial, political and institutional, and social and cultural challenges.248 It thus explains why Chapter Nine on \u201cBarriers and Impediments\u201d follows this structuring. Review The contents of this report were distributed for peer review in order to gain feedback on three main aspects of this report: the accuracy of the data used, whether the energy resources and renewable technologies listed were correctly prioritized, and relevance of the main conclusions drawn from the regional analysis. Comments were sought from other UNDP offices, regional development partners, and government colleagues where possible.

No electricity is supplied during the peak hours (6-10 pm) in any of the surveyed villages and the voltage dips to as low as 110 V making it difficult to use any appliances when there is electricity during day hours (Palit and Chaurey, 2011). 86 Palit, D., and A.

CEDAW Law Reform Committee, an inter-departmental working group established by the Cook Islands Government, to work towards legislative consistency with Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). The Committee named marriage and family life and the safety and security of women and children as priorities for law reform. In order to work towards consistency with CEDAW in these areas, the Committee recommended the development of a comprehensive civil Family Law Bill to replace and modernize the disparate pieces of legislation that currently govern family law in the Cook Islands. It presents the results of a desk review commissioned by the UNDP Pacific Centre to identify good practice law reform options in six areas pertaining to family law in the Cook Islands. The publication does not recommend any particular approaches for the Cook Islands rather it identifies the range of different good practice approaches that could be adopted to achieve legislative consistency with CEDAW. It was developed to help inform a consultation held in Rarotonga in February 2010 in which local participants discussed and recommended the approaches best suited to the culture and context of the Cook Islands, and to inform the draft Family Law Bill that was subsequently developed for the Government of the Cook Islands. Family law in the Cook Islands is currently governed by a complex range of legislation that is now largely outdated including; the Marriage Act 1973, the Marriage Amendment Act 2007, the Cook Islands Act 1915, the Cook Islands Amendment Act 1994, the Infants Act 1908, the Prevention of Juvenile Crime 1968 and the Matrimonial Property Act 1976 (NZ). The Constitution of the Cook Islands 1965 guarantees men and women the equal protection of the law, but it does not guarantee them equal benefits or outcomes. The Constitution guarantees a range of fundamental rights and freedoms \u2018without discrimination on the grounds of sex\u2019 but it does not define discrimination to include direct and indirect discrimination. Further, the Constitution does not expressly bind actions of either private actors or public authorities and institutions, leaving the scope of the anti-discrimination provisions unclear. The drafting of a single, clearly articulated and contemporary Family Law Bill provides the Cook Islands with the opportunity to develop a legal framework that is reflective of the values and context of contemporary Cook Islander society, including national commitments to gender equality and the implementation of CEDAW. It will also provide the opportunity to replace and modernize the old laws, which reflect the norms and values of the former colonizing countries at the time they were adopted. Whilst there are a number of components that are universally required in a civil family law to reflect good modern practice and to be CEDAW compliant, the specific culture and context of the Cook Islands will provide the framework for considering which good practice approaches, including non- discriminatory customary practices, in each of the key areas are the most appropriate for the Cook 1. 2. 3. 4.

A modern CEDAW compliant Family Law Bill has the potential to improve the accessibility of family law to a wide range of parties and to provide an important contribution from the Cook Islands to good practices for other Pacific Island countries, and globally. The six areas reviewed in this paper are; i) marriage, ii) the end of marriage, iii) the care of children, iv) spousal and child support, v) domestic violence and vi) property division after marriage or relationship breakdown. For each of the six areas this policy paper identifies; the current relevant law in the Cook Islands (or where there are gaps in the current laws) and the range of components that are essential to a comprehensive, good practice and CEDAW compliant civil Family Law Bill. For each component, the policy paper identifies a range of good practice approaches (based on international conventions to which the Cook Islands is a party including CEDAW, the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), international declarations and commentary, relevant academic literature and government and non-government reports). Finally, the paper provides a range of good practice examples that illustrate how different countries have approached each particular component or issue in their respective law(s).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f56a4014-2265-4c6d-a032-885bfdd72c37": {"__data__": {"id_": "f56a4014-2265-4c6d-a032-885bfdd72c37", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing the Implementation of CEDAW in the Cook Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "741d49a72df5e9545fb46754d80e0d89a8777f9bfb5dc28c6009422cd65a97c1"}}, "hash": "741d49a72df5e9545fb46754d80e0d89a8777f9bfb5dc28c6009422cd65a97c1", "text": "Where possible examples from Oceania have been chosen (Pacific Island countries and territories, New Zealand and Australia) but this publication also provides international comparison by drawing on examples from around the world that represent aspects of good practice in various laws. The law of inheritance is an important aspect of family law in which serious discrimination against women occurs when law and practice do not treat females equally with men. Many legislative frameworks worldwide, including in the Cook Islands, continue to provide that male family members receive larger portions of an inheritance. This is often justified in part, by stereotypes about the roles that women and men should play within the family and the community, and stereotyped assumptions that women will marry and leave the family of origin. The complexity of the issues involved in inheritance in the Cook Islands context, and the national stakeholders\u2019 decision that there needs to be comprehensive consultations on these issues before proposals for inheritance law reform are pursued, has led to the exclusion of inheritance from this publication, and the drafting of the civil Family Law Bill that it accompanies. However, because of its importance, inheritance is an area which should be among the priorities for future law reform initiatives in the Cook Islands. Marriage Marriage is governed in the Cook Islands by the Marriage Act 1973 . Reform in this area would be best achieved through amendments to the Marriage Act. Marriage is limited by the Marriage Amendment Act 2007 to persons of opposite gender. A recognition that the principle of non-discrimination requires that marriage rights be available equally to all members of the community has led to the extension of marriage to same-sex couples or the establishment of domestic registered partnerships and civil unions in many countries throughout the world. In the Pacific region in 2009 the French collectivities of Wallis and Futuna and New 5. 6. 7. 8.

There are two situations in which a marriage is automatically void under the Marriage Act 1973. A void marriage is one where the marriage is not recognized as having ever existed in law. This is different from ending a legally recognized marriage through divorce. The first situation in which a marriage is automatically void is if the two people being married are within specified prohibited degrees of relationship (i.e. siblings and parents and children are not allowed to marry each other because of their close genetic relationship etc). The second reason for voiding a marriage is if one of the parties is still married to someone else. There is however, no active requirement for consent in the Act, nor a process for voiding a marriage if full and free consent was not obtained as is required by Article 16(1)(b) of CEDAW. Both of these necessary components should be incorporated into the Marriage Act 1973 in order for there to be compliance with CEDAW (as reflected in CEDAW legislative compliance indicator 16.2). The minimum age for marriage in the Cook Islands is currently 16. However, minors (which in the Cook Islands has been applied to include all persons between 16 and 21) cannot marry in the Cook Islands without the consent of both parents. The CEDAW and the CRC recommended minimum age of marriage is 18 for both women and men. The CEDAW Committee in its Concluding Comments to the Cook Islands in 2007 urged the Cook Islands \u2018to raise the minimum age of marriage for women to 18 years, in line with article 16(2) of the Convention, the Committee\u2019s General Recommendation 21 and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\u2019 The CEDAW Committee has explained that a low legal age of marriage may prevent girls from continuing their education, lead them to drop out of school early and may result in difficulties in their achievement of economic independence and empowerment. Raising the age of marriage to 18 would satisfy CEDAW legislative compliance indicator 16.3. The End of Marriage Separation is governed in the Cook Islands by the Cook Islands Amendment Act 1994 and divorce is governed by the Cook Islands Act 1915 and the Family Proceedings Act 1963 (NZ). Law reform in this area would best be achieved through the repeal of the applicable provisions in these existing laws and incorporation of the area into the new", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "635a4a12-5a04-43ed-a83c-6591e388ab61": {"__data__": {"id_": "635a4a12-5a04-43ed-a83c-6591e388ab61", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing the Implementation of CEDAW in the Cook Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a0955c5033f47646abb66dd43c200432bbca448d91c32952fddbf78b5589cf76"}}, "hash": "a0955c5033f47646abb66dd43c200432bbca448d91c32952fddbf78b5589cf76", "text": "Family Law Bill. In the Cook Islands, divorce procedures are still based on fault, which means proving a matrimonial offence (typically desertion, adultery or cruelty). Although divorce is often a difficult process for all involved, placing blame on one or both parties, by using fault as the legal basis for granting a divorce, is no longer appropriate. A fault-based approach is criticized for interfering with the autonomy and independence of both men and women and each person\u2019s right to choose when to enter and leave relationships. In addition, fault based divorce often exacerbates hostility and bitterness between the parties and this is often not in the best interests of any children. It can also make it difficult for women to leave violent relationships since the requirement to provide evidence of a specific matrimonial crime may force them to provide evidence of situations 9. 10. 11. 12. GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 12 that are humiliating, embarrassing or frightening. International obligations and contemporary good practice standards now specifically require that fault not be used as a requirement or prerequisite for obtaining a divorce. In response, modern separation and divorce laws have shifted and progressed from a reliance on finding one of the spouses at fault, towards neutral and non- adversarial systems of divorce. The introduction of a no-fault divorce procedure into Cook Islands law would satisfy CEDAW legislative compliance indicator 16.13. Two good practice no-fault approaches have been adopted in modern divorce law. The first and most popular approach is a requirement that the relationship has broken down in such a way it is \u2018irretrievable\u2019, without any need to show that a spouse is at fault. Whilst some countries require evidence or proof that the marriage has broken down this has proven difficult and often adds to the time and effort required to qualify for a divorce. Another means of establishing the marriage is irretrievable is to specifically set out in the law, a period of separation (usually one year) after which the marriage is automatically deemed irretrievable. Whilst this approach is morally neutral, simple and easily understood, it has been criticized because legally requiring a delay of a year in every case before a divorce can be granted, can cause significant personal and financial hardship for the parties (including in relation to those who may need to find alternate housing. Neither best practice approach precludes reconciliation between the parties but they do not require that the parties must attempt reconciliation. A second approach which is more consistent with international standards that require the recognition of the autonomy of both spouses as individuals, is to enable an immediate and unilateral termination of a marriage by either party at will. The rationale behind this approach is that marriage is the voluntary union of two persons and therefore a unilateral wish by one of the spouses to end the marriage should be enough to do so. Separation procedures in the Cook Islands are not currently fault-based. Instead, the parties can obtain a separation order if \u2018there is a state of disharmony between the parties to the marriage\u2019. However, the primary legal effect of the separation order is that the parties no longer have to live together. This does not resolve or determine the new relations between the parties. Both divorce and separation procedures must be linked to essential legal remedies such as; i) their duties and obligations relating to property that they own, ii) the responsibilities of either or both of them to provide spousal and child support, iii) determining who lives in the marital home, and iv) settling residence and contact arrangements for any children. Access to such legal remedies are central to good practice for both separation and divorce procedures in modern divorce law. The Care of Children The Cook Islands Act 1915 governs the law relating to children in the Cook Islands. The Act, almost 100 years old, contains very limited coverage of the issues discussed in this publication. Law reform in this area would be best achieved through the repeal of any applicable provisions in the Cook Islands Act 1915 and incorporation of the area into the new Family Law Bill.

Best Interests of the Child as Paramount Article (1)(d) of CEDAW states that \u2018in all cases the interests of the children shall be paramount.\u2019 Article 3(1) of the CRC states that in all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration. In response to these international obligations modern family law typically includes a clear statement in the legislation to the effect that the principle of the child\u2019s best interests in all matters relating to children is paramount. In the Cook Islands, there is a statement of the best interests of the child in relation to custody hearings. However, it is important that the principle extends to all proceedings relating to children. The inclusion of such a statement would satisfy CEDAW legislative compliance indicator 16.18. Additionally and importantly, to assist the court in determining the best interests of the child, good practice requires a list of factors of what may be considered the best interests of the child to be included in the legislation. Parental Responsibility Article 18(1) of the CRC obligates State parties to ensure that both parents have common responsibilities for the upbringing and development of the child. Accordingly, a good practice approach in the modern family law context is to include a legislative statement that parental responsibility is equal and shared and continues until the child is 18 regardless of other circumstances, such as a parent subsequently remarrying or entering into a de facto or other relationship. Parenting Orders The Cook Islands Act 1915 authorizes the court to make custody orders on the basis of what \u2018it thinks fit\u2019 in relation to the children of the marriage. The Infants Act 1908 provides that custody shall be determined on the basis of the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration. Access, according to the Infants Act shall be determined on the basis of the welfare of the infant and the conduct of the parents. Good practice requires a consolidation of the legislation and an explicit statement that the best interests of the child are paramount in all proceedings involving children. Additionally, modern family law legislation has moved away from the terminology of custody and access orders, which foster notions of ownership in children and focusing on the respective \u2018rights\u2019 of the parents. Instead, the new approach is an emphasis on parental agreement as the primary means of settling parenting arrangements including when parents do not live together, through the issuing of parenting orders. Parenting orders in modern family law legislation typically consist of a range of orders termed \u2018residence\u2019, \u2018contact\u2019 \u2018specific issues\u2019 and \u2018prohibited steps\u2019 orders. Each of these is discussed below. A residence order determines where a child is to live and who has the day to day care of the child. A contact order determines whether and in what circumstances a parent or other person shall have contact with a child. The reason for a contact order is to recognize and maintain the beneficial relationships already established between the child and other children in the family or other adults, to the maximum extent possible, in the light of changed family circumstances. Contact orders typically permit reasonable contact but may specify the times, frequency and location of visits and may include a variety of forms of contact such as emails, letters or 18. 19. 20. 21.

A contact order may also provide for specific protections, such as in a situation of abuse, where a condition might be imposed that an abusive partner can have contact with a child only if supervised. A specific issues order complements residence and contact orders. A specific issues order will detail who will make a particular decision or how a particular decision will be made. Examples of topics that might be included in a specific issues order include; who is to have responsibility for the day-to-day care, welfare and development of the child, and who is responsible for decisions about the child\u2019s medical treatment, holidays or religious education.

A prohibited steps order prevents a particular decision from being made without returning to the court for permission or, alternately, without permission from the other parent. A prohibited steps order can prohibit a parent from making specific major decisions in relation to the child, such as changing the surname of the child, removing the child from the country, changing the nationality or domicile of the child, or consent to the adoption process. The availability of a prohibited steps order provides a means of protecting the rights of the child in accordance with the CRC. Mandatory separate legal representation for the child is good practice in proceedings where there are extenuating circumstances such as abuse or neglect. Sometimes, there are differences of opinion between the parents and others, and/or a confict between the best interests of the child and the interest of (each) parent (or other adults). The role of the separate representative is to make submissions to the court on what is in the best interests of the child, including from the child\u2019s perspective, where appropriate, and is independent from the submission by the parent(s) on what they (each) argue is in the best interests of the child. In order to carry out this role, the separate representative may be authorized to seek information from relevant parties including; the child (particularly when the child is old enough to give information on what has happened in the past, as well as her/his wishes), the child\u2019s school, and other relevant agencies and to obtain an expert\u2019s report from appropriate persons such as a child psychologist. Such provisions, however, are dependant upon government funding and its inclusion in the legislative provisions must be accompanied by the necessary administration and financial commitments from the state. Parenting orders may not be necessary to settle arrangements about where and with whom the child(ren) will live (a residence order), and how each parent (or other relevant adults) are allowed to interact with the child (a contact order). A good practice approach is to explicitly provide that a court must not make a parenting order unless it considers that doing so would be better for the child than making no order at all. In this way, the court only intervenes in the child\u2019s life if there is a real problem in need of resolution and not simply as a matter of routine or because the court has the power to do so. A parenting plan is an agreement between the parents of the child that deals with issues such as residence, contact, child support or any other 22. 23. 24. 25. 26. GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 15 aspect of parental responsibility. To encourage divorcing or separating parents or parents who are not living together to take mutual responsibility for their children, some countries have included parenting plans in their family law legislation. A parenting plan can be registered with the court, if it accords with the welfare and best interests of the child, and enforced in the same manner as a court order. Parental responsibility provisions may enable a parent to be obstructive in the exercise of parenting orders. It is important therefore that the legislation clearly states that parental responsibility, especially to the extent that it involves any kind of \u2018authority\u2019 in relation to decision-making, is superseded by a parenting order. It is critically important that parenting orders can be enforced. The range of good practice approaches to enforcement include the following: i) expressly stating what the consequences of orders and contraventions are, ii) varying or discharging (ending) the parenting order (for example, by reducing or eliminating altogether the time in which the child is in the care of, or has contact with, the parent or other relevant person who is in contravention of the order), iii) punishing the parent or other relevant person who is in breach of the order with penalties such as fines, imprisonment or community service orders iv) requiring a deposit of a bond after the breach of a parenting order as an assurance that the order will not be breached again.

The Cook Islands is not yet a party to the Hague Convention although the removal of children from the Cook Islands may be a growing problem as freedom of movement between countries increases. Accession to the Convention would require the Cook Islands to set up a Central Authority to receive applications, collect relevant information and take the necessary steps to ensure that abducted or unlawfully retained children are returned to their resident country. In relation to children removed from the Cook Islands, a procedure must be established that provides evidence to the country to which the child has been removed that the child is \u2018habitually resident\u2019 in the Cook Islands and that the removal or keeping the child outside of the Cook Islands is wrongful. Wrongfulness is defined as a breach of the custody rights of another person or institution and although an order is not required this is the easiest process for its establishment. Care and Supervision Orders Article 20 of the CRC obligates States parties to provide to special protection and assistance including alternative care to a child that temporarily or permanently is unable to be in her or his family environment, or in whose own best interests cannot be allowed to remain in that environment. The first and best option if a child\u2019s safety is at risk in her or his home due to abuse or gross neglect is to remove the abuser (not the child) from the home.

GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 16 intervene to safeguard the welfare of the child. In the Cook Islands the Prevention of Juvenile Crime 1968 provides that a child can be taken into state care if it appears to the court the child is living in a place of \u2018ill-repute\u2019 or is likely to be ill-treated or neglected. However, no duty is placed upon the state to provide an appropriate level of care. The Act also provides for a supervision order but only if the child has committed an offence and the aim of the order is primarily punitive rather than to provide assistance for the welfare of the child. The approach adopted in modern family law legislation is to enable the state to take action through two forms of public orders; a care order and a supervision order. A care order allows the state to remove the child from the home and obligates the state to provide appropriate alternate services for the child such as placing the child in foster-care, with another relative or family friend or into institutionalized care, and in all cases ensure that an appropriate standard of care for the child is provided. A supervision order, which keeps the child in the home, allows the state to supervise, for example by undertaking regular scheduled visits or ensuring that the child attends school. The reason for having a supervision order is that it provides some state control over a family situation where a child might be at risk, but a care order (which means removing the child from their home) is not considered necessary or in the child\u2019s best interests. The statutory factors (which means a list of factors that are specifically contained in the law itself) for care and supervision orders are crucial since the result is either the compulsory removal of a child from their family or mandatory intervention in the family (through a supervision order). Using the best interests of the child as the only criteria for care and supervision orders is not always suitable because it could enable the removal of children from their homes on grounds where the child\u2019s safety is not at immediate risk through abuse or neglect. An alternate good practice approach is to have a two step process to ensure that removing the child is absolutely necessary for the child\u2019s safety. The first step requires establishing whether the child is at risk of significant harm due to either inadequate care provided by the parent or lack of parental control.

A family group conference (FGC) is a meeting of specified family members and other relevant persons to try to develop the best possible plan for a child who is the victim of neglect, abuse or is a juvenile offender, before turning to the court to grant care and/or supervision orders. Family group conferencing originated in New Zealand in the late 1980\u2019s in situations of neglect and abuse as a response to the removal of Maori children by the state and their placement with \u2018cultural strangers\u2019 or in state institutions and in light of evidence that it is better for children to remain in their families, including their extended families, rather than being taken into state care. Family group conferences represent a collaborative, rather than an adversarial approach to assist families to address the neglect and/or abuse of a child. A core principle of family group conferencing is the involvement of extended families, a principle very relevant to the Cook Islands where extended families are often involved 32. 33. 34. 35. 36. GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 17 in all aspects of the parenting process. Whilst family group conferencing can represent an important alternative approach to resolving arrangements in relation to children in need of care and protection, it is important to introduce safeguards. First, appropriate chairpersons to convene and facilitate family group conferences must be selected, and trained in managing family dynamics, gender equality and the issues relating to children in need of care and protection. Chairpersons could be selected and trained from church groups, NGOs and other relevant community groups. Second, the legislation must prohibit family group conferences in situations of domestic violence, to ensure that no victim of domestic violence, child or adult, is forced to face or reach agreement with an offender or family members that are supportive of the offender. Finally, because different factors may come into play in some family dynamics, which may affect the decisions or plans agreed to during family conferencing, it is important to ensure that the court retains the authority to make final determinations on the basis of the welfare and best interests of the child. Adoption of Children Adoption ends the legal status of a birth family and gives a new, permanent home for a child. It replaces, in law, one family with another. The adoptive parent or parents become legally responsible for all aspects of parenthood, and the child is legally treated as a member of the adoptive family. In the Cook Islands adoption is governed by the Cook Islands Act 1915 which provides separately and differently for \u2018Native adoption\u2019 and \u2018European adoption\u2019. Cook Islanders are prohibited from adopting non-indigenous children whilst \u2018Europeans\u2019 can adopt any child including Cook Islander children. These provisions were enacted in the context of early twentieth century colonization and require modernizing to meet international standards and obligations under CEDAW and the CRC. The primary purpose of an adoption process is to place a child in a stable, secure and loving environment. This can be provided in a range of family forms including by grandparents, aunts and uncles, married and de facto couples, both opposite sex and same-sex, and by individuals. Good practice requires therefore that the emphasis in adoption law should be on what is in the child\u2019s best interests in light of the abilities and capabilities of the prospective adoptive parent or parents. The law should not limit who can apply to adopt and instead, should consider their suitability as adoptive parent[s] on the basis of criteria used to determine whether they are capable of providing a stable and secure environment for the child and what in the circumstances is in the best interests of the child. The criteria should be the same for all potential adoptive parents (whether single or a couple). The Cook Islands Act 1915 requires that biological parents give their consent to all adoptions unless \u2018the child has been deserted by that parent, or that parent unfit to have the care and custody of the child, or if the Court for any other reason whatsoever considers that the consent of that parent should be dispensed with\u2019.

Other good practice factors that should be included in the law as reasons for not requiring the consent of both biological parents for adoption are; if the child is the result of the rape of the mother, if the parent has failed to discharge her or his parental duties, or if it is in the best interests of the child to do so. A requirement for the consent of the child has been incorporated into some modern adoption law however this requirement has been criticized by some on the basis that it amounts to asking the child to reject her or his birth parents. Young people and people with impaired intellectual ability may be vulnerable to pressure to agree to adoption and may provide consent that is not full and free. The CRPD specifically requires that \u2018States Parties shall render appropriate assistance to persons with disabilities in the performance of their child- rearing responsibilities.\u2019 A good practice approach requires safeguards in the legislation to ensure that their rights are protected. Such safeguards could include a requirement for a report that confirms that the person is capable of understanding the consent to adoption, a requirement that the person has received legal advice, the inclusion of a revocation period so that the birth parent can change their mind during a designated period of time and finally a requirement that all the options for care and services are explored fully. Article 21 of the CRC obligates states parties to ensure that the principle of the best interests of the child is the most important consideration in adoption determinations. In the Cook Islands the grounds for both European and Cook Islander adoption are that \u2018the applicant is a fit and proper person to have the care and custody of the child and of sufficient ability to maintain the child, and the adoption will not be contrary to the welfare and interests of the child.\u2019 Uniformly, the approach of modern adoption law is to incorporate the best interests of the child as the (or a) primary consideration and also that the person who is applying for the adoption is fit and proper and of sufficient ability to provide the day-to-day care for the child. The adoption process has historically been kept closed and secret. A more open and inclusive system of adoption may be appropriate in the modern context, particularly in communities (such as the Cook Islands) where kinship networks are important, broad and enduring, and advances the right of the child (reflected in the CRC) to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis, except if it is contrary to the child\u2019s best interests. An \u201copen\u201d adoption process is where the child, in some circumstances, maintains ongoing contact with her or his birth parents and/or other extended family members. Contact may range from regular meetings between the birth parents and the adoptive family, and / or to intermittent ongoing contact. The aims of this contact are to ensure that the child feels as psychologically secure as possible and to mitigate any sense of loss she or he might experience. Whilst open adoption is recommended by many experts it has not yet been incorporated into many adoption law regimes. Spousal and Child Support Child and spousal support is currently governed in the Cook Islands by the Cook Islands Act 1915 and requires modernization to meet good standard 42. 43. 44. 45.

Although the recognition of same-sex relationships has not yet been explicitly addressed by the CEDAW Committee, many consider there is sufficient support in CEDAW and the CRC (and in the growing international jurisprudence and in its acceptance within many societies) that terms such as family, and discrimination on the grounds of sex or marital status should be interpreted to obligate States parties to provide equal rights and protections for those in same-sex relationships. Such recognition would also satisfy CEDAW legislative compliance indicator 16.20. The recognition of de facto relationships for the purpose of spousal support requires a definition in the law of a de facto relationship. Two different approaches are used in contemporary family law to establish the existence of a de facto relationship. The first is to designate a time period that the parties must have lived together continuously, which is usually 2 years. The second approach is to provide a range of factors, which can include (but is not limited to) factors such as whether they have children, the level of financial interdependence and public recognition of their relationship. In this approach, the duration of a relationship may also be among the determining factors but the period of time required is not specified in the law. The Cook Islands Act 1915 provides for spousal support on the basis of reasonableness. However, in contemporary family law, a right to spousal support and the amount to be awarded (if there is such a right) is now uniformly decided on the basis of what is \u2018just\u2019 or \u2018fair\u2019 coupled with a mandatory consideration of a range of factors. The inclusion of a specific list of factors in the law, which can include both the duration of the marriage or relationship and the effects on earning capacity of the division of functions within the marriage or relationship while parties lived together, ensure that courts take into account the discriminatory effects that marriage and relationships can have upon the earning capacity of one partner (usually the female partner) especially if there are children and one party has given up education and/or paid employment or employment advancements to be able to provide domestic and child care for the family. Article 16(1)(d) of CEDAW makes both parents equally responsible for a child whether or not they are legally married. The costs of medical attention and other costs associated with pregnancy and childbirth should therefore be shared equally by both biological parents and the legislation should expressly provide for the payment of such expenses. The provision in the legislation of child-bearing expenses to be paid by the biological father to the birth mother would satisfy CEDAW legislative indicator 16.23. 46. 47. 48. 49. GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 20 Child Support The CEDAW Committee states in General Recommendation 21(19) that after separation and divorce many fathers fail to share the responsibility of care, protection and maintenance of their children and has urged States parties to \u2018put in place adequate legislative measures, including the review and amendment of existing laws, to guarantee that women obtain child support.\u2019 The payment of child support after relationship breakdown and divorce ensures that fathers take responsibility for the costs of child rearing and at the same time recognizes the reduced earning power of many mothers and the costs that women bear in the raising of children. It is important however that the provisions are gender neutral to ensure that in cases where fathers do have the day-to-day care of their child, they can also obtain child support. The inclusion of access to child support on the basis of the needs of the child would satisfy CEDAW legislative indicators 16.10 & 16.24. There are two main approaches in contemporary family law to child support. The first, adopted in many common law countries including New Zealand, England and Australia, is the establishment of state-run child support schemes which assess and collect monies (from the parent who has been ordered to make financial contributions) through automatic payment systems. This approach, which has proven effective, requires state commitment to its administration and the related costs.

The Cook Islands Act 1915 provides for the court to issue a child support order for a child born either within a marriage or outside. Contemporary family law simply requires that the child is under 18 years old and not financially independent. The Cook Islands Act 1915 does not explicitly state who may apply for a child support order but the language implies that it is limited to a mother or a father. In contemporary society where there is a range of family forms and situations where care for children is provided, good practice now requires that anyone who is providing the day-to-day care of a child should also be able to apply for child support. Traditionally, the biological parents of a child, or an adoptive parent have been the only people that have had child support orders issued against them. The Cook Islands Act 1915 provides for the issuance of a child support order against the mother or the father of a child. While the question of whether and to what extent step-parents should also be liable is controversial, most contemporary family law provides, that where a parental relationship of some sort as formed, even if the adult is not the biological or adoptive parent, then a support order can also be made against this person. The reason for this is that the step-parent has voluntarily assumed that role and it is not in the best interests of children that they be permitted to abandon it simply because the adult relationship has ended. The Cook Islands Act 1915 provides for the provision of child support on the basis of what the court thinks reasonable. Good practice in contemporary family law is to provide in the law a list of factors that courts must take into account when determining the appropriate contribution by the liable parent. This child centered approach ensures that courts take into account the variety of needs that a child may have, and shifts the primary focus away from the liable person or the applicant. 50. 51. 52. 53. 54. GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 21 Variation, Form of Payment and Enforcement Usually modern family law specifically allows for the variation of child support orders if the circumstances of the liable party, the recipient, or the child changes. Additionally, although a child support order might ordinarily end when a child reaches 18 years, a modern and good practice approach requires that financial support be continued if children are over 18 years of age but are still in full-time education, or are mentally or physically handicapped and therefore required long-term support. The Cook Island Act 1915 provides only for periodical payments of money for both spousal and child maintenance orders. Contemporary family laws have moved towards more flexible approaches to payment of support orders including lump sum payments, the provision of goods (in the Cook Islands this could include fish, meat, taro and livestock such as pigs, goats and chicken etc.) the provision of services, and the transfer or usage of property or assets. A system of enforcement is crucial to ensuring that spousal and child support payments are made. Mechanisms that have been used in other countries include deductions through the tax system, ordering the employer (if the liable parent is working) to deduct a certain amount from her or his salary to meet the support payments, garnisheeing bank accounts, forcing the sale of assets or property, fines and imprisonment in accordance with the law. Determination of Parentage The determination of who is a parent, (usually the father) of a child, is important because of the parental obligations to provide child support and child-bearing expenses. The Cook Islands Act 1915 limits applications for paternity to \u2018an unmarried woman who is the mother of an illegitimate child or who is with child.\u2019 Modern family law typically allows a child or either parent, and any other party if they have \u2018a proper interest in the result\u2019 to apply. Other parties might include grandparents or other relatives, social workers, government agencies, trustees and executors. The inclusion of appropriate procedures for determining parentage would satisfy CEDAW legislative compliance indicator 16.22.

If the child is 6 years or older, no application can be made unless the prospective father has either contributed to child support during that six years, or has cohabited with the mother in a de facto relationship, in which case any application must be made within two years of either the financial contribution or the cohabitation. Such limitations are arbitrary and do not accord with modern good practice. In modern family law presumptions of paternity are typically made in certain circumstances. These include if the father is the husband or de facto partner of the mother at the time of the birth, or at the time of conception, or if the father\u2019s name is registered on the birth certificate. In the Cook Islands other presumptions that could be included might include; whether the father bought items for the baby, visited the mother in hospital or any other kind of traditional acknowledgement of the child. Where there is no presumption, paternity is typically based on evidentiary submissions. 55. 56. 57. 58. 59. 60. GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 22 Discriminatory assumptions about women\u2019s dishonesty in reproductive matters were historically relied on in many jurisdictions to develop a discriminatory requirement that a woman\u2019s testimony in relation to paternity must be corroborated. A requirement for corroboration (independent evidence that supports the claim of paternity) is discriminatory because it is not required in other matters. In addition, it implies that a woman\u2019s word is inherently worth less than that of the prospective or presumed father even though there is no evidence that mothers should be viewed as a particularly unreliable class of witness. The Cook Islands Act 1915 provides that whilst the evidence of the mother is not necessary for the making of a paternity order, no order can be made upon the evidence of a pregnant woman unless it is corroborated. Good practice requires a specific statement in the law that corroboration is not required in any circumstances. DNA testing now enables paternity (or maternity) to be established conclusively. This is most commonly done by taking a buccal or blood sample from father and child, although it can be done on any number of other body parts such as hair follicles. Generally however genetic testing without the consent of the person being tested is controversial since taking any sample is an intrusion on bodily integrity, dignity and privacy. Two approaches to DNA testing have been taken in modern family law. The first is that the court can recommend parentage testing and if this is refused then the court can use the prospective father\u2019s refusal to be tested as evidence of paternity. In the same way if the mother refuses to give consent to the testing of the child (if requested by the father or the court) this can be used as evidence that the man in question is not the father. The second approach is to empower the court to order mandatory testing. The reason behind this approach is that it is in the best interests of the child, her or his parents and the general public that parentage determinations are made on the basis of accurate DNA parentage testing. Domestic Violence Domestic violence has been increasingly recognized in the Cook Islands as a growing and substantial problem, which impacts on the physical and mental health of victims and also upon families and communities. The importance of a strong, effective and comprehensive legal response to domestic violence has been recognized worldwide as public recognition of domestic violence as a social problem has increased. This publication focuses on reforming the civil law aspects of domestic violence. A comprehsive approach to domestic violence includes both civil and criminal law protections, which serve different but complementary purposes. There are two good practice approaches to domestic violence legislation to achieve this. The first is to enact one comprehensive criminal and civil domestic violence law that incorporates both criminal offences to enable the prosecution of offenders, and civil law protection orders that prohibit the abuser from any further act of domestic and/or enables victims to remain in the family home to the exclusion of the abuser. The second approach, which has been adopted by the Cook Islands, is to keep these aspects separate but to make the relevant reforms to both the criminal law, and the civil law (rather than to enact one law covering both", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fade6c26-9608-4838-a1ee-a324a3b8aa20": {"__data__": {"id_": "fade6c26-9608-4838-a1ee-a324a3b8aa20", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing the Implementation of CEDAW in the Cook Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0de6f685b7d639db733689a9916a23c3f7083049b3d9e8fbea7c7a34951737d4"}}, "hash": "0de6f685b7d639db733689a9916a23c3f7083049b3d9e8fbea7c7a34951737d4", "text": "criminal and civil aspects). 61. 62. 63.

The aims of domestic violence civil law provisions are, broadly, to prevent domestic violence, to ensure the safety of all persons who experience domestic violence, to provide victims with effective and accessible remedies, and to promote nonviolence as a fundamental social value. The Cook Islands Amendment Act 1994 provides access to occupation orders and non-molestation orders for victims of domestic violence. However, these orders provide protection only to a limited range of persons, and only for protection from a limited range of behaviours, in a limited range of circumstances. Therefore, in this area, in many regards, the Act does not meet international good practice standards. Law reform in this area would be best achieved through the repeal of any applicable provisions in the Cook Islands Amendment Act 1994 and either the incorporation of the area into the new Family Law Bill or the development of a separate Domestic Violence Bill. It is critical to have a good practice definition of domestic violence in the civil law (and in the criminal law) that reflects its breadth and complexity. Domestic violence occurs in many forms, including physical violence, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, intimidation, harassment, stalking, economic deprivation, property damage, causing a child to witness domestic violence, animal abuse or threats of any of the above. It is particularly important that both physical and non- physical forms of abuse are explicitly recognized and identified in the legislation. Non-physical forms of domestic violence should specifically be included as they are often not perceived by the community as \u2018real\u2019 violence, despite research consistently showing they may be the cause of severe and ongoing harm. Domestic violence occurs in many contexts and between persons in a range of personal relationships where there are power imbalances. Good practice requires that the full range of people who experience or are at risk of experiencing domestic violence should be able to access protection orders. However, pursuant to the Cook Islands Amendment Act 1994 occupation orders are only available to married persons. Whilst the legislation extends access to non- molestation (protection) orders to de facto (opposite sex) couples and gives the court the discretion to issue a protection order for the protection of any \u2018other person\u2019 it does not explicitly extend protection to all persons at risk. The approach adopted by contemporary good practice domestic violence law is to explicitly extend the range of protected persons beyond \u2018traditional concepts of family\u2019 to include spouses, persons in a \u2018marriage-like\u2019 relationship (either opposite or same-sex), persons in close personal relationships, relatives, those in a care relationship, any child who resides with the abuser and in some countries, a person who is or has been a member of the other person\u2019s household. Protection Orders Protection orders are a civil remedy typically issued by a court, the police or other authorized person to prevent a person from making contact with, harming or harassing another person. The CEDAW Committee has stated that the availability of protection orders is an \u2018essential component of a comprehensive legal framework designed to protect women in situations 64. 65. 66. 67. 68.

In contemporary domestic violence legislation, the range of people who can apply for a protection order typically includes an adult protected person (as defined in the legislation), a child protected person who is a mature minor (who understands the nature and the consequences of the proceedings) a parent of a child protected person on behalf of the child, and any person with a residence order in relation to a protected child. In some circumstances it may be difficult for a protected person to apply for an order and therefore a good practice approach is to enable applications to be made by \u2018any other person on behalf of the aggrieved person.

Protection orders should be available for all persons at risk, and not just after an act of domestic violence has occurred. The Cook Islands Amendment Act 1994 recognizes this in part, by not requiring an act of violence to have occurred and instead enabling the court to issue a non-molestation order if the court is satisfied it is \u2018necessary for the protection\u2019 of the applicant. A good practice approach goes further and simply requires that the victim has a reasonable apprehension of an act of domestic violence. An alternate approach requires that the victim has an actual fear of an act of domestic violence (whether \u2018reasonable\u2019 or not). This ensures that a person living in fear (and who may be very aware of the signs of impending danger of domestic violence), does not have to meet any standard of \u2018reasonableness\u2019 before being given protection. Emergency Protection Order An emergency (or interim) protection order is a protection order that is immediately and easily available. It is essential that domestic violence victims be provided with access to protection orders when they do not have immediate access to a court. This is particularly crucial given that domestic violence often occurs after 5pm, during the week and on weekends, or in areas (such as outer islands or rural areas) where there is no formal court. If a domestic violence victim seeks protection from the legal system during a crisis outside of standard court hours, or where a court is not readily accessible, the system must be able to respond and offer an appropriate level of protection. In order to provide immediate protection an emergency protection order must be accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, be available without the testimony of the abuser, and there must be persons authorized and available to issue an order at all times. Occupation Order An occupation order enables the protected person to remain in any home that she or he shares with the abuser regardless of the abuser\u2019s legal or equitable rights in the property. Requiring the violent party (rather than the one at risk of violence) to leave the home reinforces the message that domestic violence is unacceptable and that abusers will be held accountable in a range of ways. Inclusion of a provision enabling victims of domestic violence to occupy the shared residence would satisfy CEDAW legislative compliance indicator 16.11. Good practice in contemporary family law is to provide a list of factors in the law that courts must take into account when determining whether to make an occupation order. Such factors include; 69. 70. 71. 72. 73. GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 25 i) the impact on the safety and protection of the protected person and any children who live at the residence if an occupation order is not made, ii) the desirability of minimizing disruption to the protected person and any child living with the protected person and iii) the importance of maintaining social networks and support and ensuring continuity in childcare, education, training and employment for protected persons and children who live with them. Access to personal property may be a significant issue for all parties when there is an occupation order in place. The party that is excluded from the home will need access to their personal effects in order to take up residence elsewhere. In practice, orders allowing a respondent to return to the premises from which they are excluded to collect their belongings may need to be tightly controlled in order to ensure that protected person(s) are not intimidated, influenced or put at risk of any kind of violence. Equally, if an occupation order enables a protected person and/or any children to remain in the home, it may be important to prevent the excluded party from removing necessary items from the premises (i.e. all the food or furniture). The former UN Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women has recommended that States parties should provide for the removal of the abuser from the shared home and allow the victim- survivor to retain her present housing, at least until formal and final separation is achieved. Good practice requires that the courts are directed to start from the position that the interests of the protected person and their children would be best served by them remaining in their home.

Some jurisdictions have made it mandatory that the police must apply for a protection order when domestic violence has or is likely to occur, regardless of whether the protected person consents. In other jurisdictions a lesser obligation is placed upon police officers. For example, if an application is not made, the police must record the reasons they did not make the application. Such provisions provide clear direction to police officers of their responsibilities in relation to domestic violence. It also sends a message to the community and the perpetrator; that domestic violence is unacceptable, that the police will act, it increases the likelihood of an order being made, it lessens the burden on the victim, can deflect blame from the victim where the application is seen as a police matter and out of the victim\u2019s hands, and increases the likelihood that a woman will pursue an application when she knows she will be supported by the police. Enforcement of Orders A strong system of enforcement is crucial to ensuring the protection order scheme is effective in protecting domestic violence victims. If police or the courts do not respond adequately to breaches of orders, they will be viewed as ineffectual by victims and perpetrators alike. It will also give victims a false sense of safety and security, heightening their danger if a perpetrator behaves violently. To be effective, a breach of a protection order must be a criminal offence. 74. 75. 76. 77. GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 26 Contemporary domestic violence legislation typically has fines and/or imprisonment as the penalty for breaches of protection orders. Some jurisdictions have harsher penalties for second offences. Another approach to enforcement is to require the abuser to attend a rehabilitation program. Such a measure, is however reliant on the existence of a well-resourced programs for the court to refer the offender to. Good practice requires that the police are empowered to immediately arrest and detain an offender as soon as there is any breach of a protection order. In the Cook Islands the Criminal Procedure Act 1965 provides that a police officer may arrest or take into custody without a warrant a person \u2018he finds committing, or whom he has good cause to suspect of having committed, any offence punishable by death or imprisonment for life or for three months or more.\u2019 This law will be sufficient in the Cook Islands to enable the arrest of any person who breaches a protection order if the penalty for a breach is a term of 3 months imprisonment. In General Recommendation 19(24)(i), the CEDAW Committee states that compensation should be provided for victims of gender-based violence. Compensation provides \u2018therapeutic\u2019 benefits in assisting the recovery of victims from the medical, psychological, cultural, vocational and relational consequences of domestic violence. Although victims of domestic violence can sue for damages in the civil law in common law jurisdictions including the Cook Islands, this is usually an expensive and ineffective avenue. Good practice approaches to compensation now include state- funded criminal injuries compensation schemes, compensation provisions in either criminal or civil law legislation which enable the court to award damages to the victim which are payable by the perpetrator and the establishment of a support fund for domestic violence victims administered by the state. It is important that the legislation specifically states that any compensation paid under custom may be taken into consideration in determining the amount of compensation to be paid to the victim (i.e. amounts paid to the victim following a customary compensation arrangement could be deducted from the total amount of compensation payable to the victim under the FLA), but does not of itself extinquish a right to compensation under the Act. Property Division after Relationship Breakdown Property division when a marriage ends is governed in the Cook Islands by the Matrimonial Property Act 1976 (NZ). The Act is CEDAW compliant in many respects and law reform could be achieved through amendments to the Act. However, a better approach would be the repeal of the Act and incorporation of the area into the new Family Law Bill. This would enable the process of property division to be linked to spousal and child support and for the development of a clearer and more straightforward framework.

GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 27 Comments in 2007 called upon the Cook Islands \u2018to establish a system of equitable division of marital property upon dissolution of de facto marriages.\u2019 The Matrimonial Property Act 1976 (NZ) divides property into \u2018matrimonial\u2019 property and \u2018separate\u2019 property. Matrimonial property includes the family home and chattels (regardless of whether it was acquired before or after the marriage) and all other property including businesses, investment, benefits and superannuation acquired during or directly before the marriage. Separate property is all property that is not matrimonial property and generally consists of property held by the parties at the commencement of the marriage. This approach to the categorization of marital property is consistent with good practice. The Matrimonial Property Act (NZ) provides that the matrimonial home and family chattels shall be divided equally. The rationale for equal sharing, which is a good practice approach, is that marriage is a joint cooperative venture in which equal sharing of the couple\u2019s assets is fair and appropriate. There are three exceptions to equal sharing; i) if the marriage is of short duration, which the Act defines as less than 3 years, and if the contribution of one spouse has clearly been \u2018disproportionately greater\u2019 then a contributions approach will be applied, ii) if there are extraordinary circumstances that render equal sharing \u2018repugnant to justice\u2019, then the matrimonial home and family chattels shall be determined on the basis of contributions, iii) matrimonial property other than the family home and chattels such as a business, second homes and other property, shares, insurance and superannuation are to be divided equally unless one spouse\u2019s contribution to the partnership is \u2018clearly been greater\u2019 than the other. The major criticisms of the exceptions are i) the arbitrariness of the 3 years rule and, ii) that the major portion of matrimonial property is determined on the basis of contributions rather than on the principle of equal sharing. Such an approach typically disadvantages women and good practice therefore requires the principle of equality to apply to all matrimonial property, a measure introduced by New Zealand in 2001. Such an amendment to current Cook Islands law would represent full compliance with CEDAW legislative indicator 16.15. If one of the three exceptions apply then the individual contributions are measured (rather than a presumption of equality) to determine how property should be divided. A good practice approach to the determination of contributions is to include a mandatory list of factors in the law for the court to consider. In addition, it is also important that the legislation explicitly states that non-financial contributions should be given equal weight with financial contributions. In General Recommendation 21(32) the CEDAW Committee states that in relation to the division of marital property \u2018financial and non-financial contributions should be accorded the same weight\u2019. The Committee explains that non- financial contributions during a marriage such as raising children, caring for elderly relatives, and discharging household duties enable a husband to earn an income and increase the assets of the marital relationship. 83. 84. 85. 86.

The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)2 came into force on 2 September 1990 and as at 15 March 2010, 194 countries are states parties to the Convention. The Convention sets out the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of children with the four core guiding principles of non-discrimination, devotion to the best interests of the child, the right to life, survival and development, and respect for the views of the child. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)3 came into force on 3 May 2008 and as at 15 March 2010, 82 countries are parties to the Convention. The Convention provides a comprehensive framework of the rights of persons with disabilities and the obligations of State parties to promote, protect, and ensure those rights. A good practice approach to a Family Law Bill is to incorporate in the \u2018purposes\u2019 section a commitment to enact provisions and interpret the legislation in accordance with the most relevant human rights conventions and the Act can include a specific reference to those conventions (i.e. CEDAW, CRC and CRPD). The purposes section of legislation is included by drafters as a guide to the interpretation of the Act and to provide an overall guiding framework for the legislation. Additionally, in some Pacific Island countries where custom is given constitutional status, it is important that the legislation specifically states that it takes precedence over any traditional or customary practices.

However, the Cook Islands acceded to CEDAW in its own right in 2006 and to the Optional Protocol to CEDAW on 27 November 2007 and also furnished its initial report to the CEDAW Committee in that same year. The Cook Islands became a party to the CRC in 1997 and acceded to the CRPD on May 8, 2009. Accession obligates the Cook Islands to work towards the modification of its constitution and legislation to accord with the articles of CEDAW, the CRC and the CRPD. Additionally, through its relationship of free association with New Zealand the Cook Islands, although internally and externally fully self-governing, is obliged to uphold a \u2018standard of values generally acceptable to New Zealanders in its law-making and policies\u2019. Whilst compliance with CEDAW is the primary focus of this paper, the relevant norms and standards contained in the CRC, the recently adopted CRPD and those of other core international human rights treaties are also referred to, as together, they form the comprehensive framework of international human rights norms and standards to guide the Cook Islands in the development of the proposed comprehensive civil family law Bill. CEDAW Implementation in the Cook Islands The Cook Islands government has taken a number of positive steps towards the implementation of CEDAW in recent years. In 2005 it commissioned a report which recommended a range of law reform steps to be taken by the Cook Islands legislature to achieve legislative compliance with CEDAW.4 The report was later endorsed by Cabinet. In 2006 the Cook Islands government submitted its initial report to the CEDAW Committee and a group of Cook Islands NGOs prepared and submitted a shadow report. In 2007, the Cook Islands delegation engaged in constructive dialogue in New York with the CEDAW Committee. The Concluding Comments to the Cook Islands issued by the CEDAW Committee were subsequently tabled in Parliament. In response to the Concluding Comments the Cook Islands government established the CEDAW Law Reform Committee, an inter-departmental working group, to work towards legislative consistency with CEDAW.

The completed country compliance reviews provide an important road map for each Pacific Island country to use in developing its short term and longer term national plan for legislative reform as part of implementation of CEDAW. 4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 5 GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 30 legislation of the Cook Islands. The resulting publication Translating CEDAW into Law: CEDAW Legislative Compliance in the Cook Islands was launched in Rarotonga in May 2008. The review provided, through the application of the indicators, a thorough analysis of the legislation of the Cook Islands and assessed its legislative compliance with CEDAW. It revealed a range of areas in which law reform was required for compliance with the convention. The Cook Islands CEDAW Law Reform Committee subsequently named marriage and family life and the safety and security of women and children as important priorities for law reform. In order to achieve law reform in these areas, the working group recommended the development of a comprehensive civil Family Law Bill to fill the gaps, and, where necessary, replace and modernize the disparate pieces of legislation that currently govern family law in the Cook Islands. In order to begin the process of development of a Family Law Bill, the UNDP Pacific Centre, in response to a request from the Cook Islands Government, prepared this publication to explain in plain language the key elements of a CEDAW, CRC and CPRD compliant civil Family Law Bill. The publication includes an examination of the current relevant law in the Cook Islands alongside simple explanations of the key components required to meet international good practice standards, as well as a range of examples of provisions drawn from legislation in other countries that reflect a range of global and Pacific good practices and approaches in various laws. In February 2010 a consultation was held in Rarotonga, Cook Islands, to provide the foundations for the approach of the Family Law Bill that would be developed. The findings of the draft of this policy publication were presented and the consultation group, which included representatives from various government departments, including Crown Law, Internal Affairs, and Probation, local lawyers practicing in family law, educators, a Pastor, a representative from the House of Ariki as well as non-government representatives, considered which of the good practice approaches to each of the core issues were best suited to the context and culture of the Cook Islands. The recommendations of the consultation group are included at the end of each Chapter of this publication. Benefits of a CEDAW Compliant Family Law Bill Family law in the Cook Islands is currently governed by a number of pieces of legislation including the Marriage Act 1973, the Marriage Amendment Act 2000, the Marriage Amendment Act 2007, the Cook Islands Act 1915, the Cook Islands Amendment Act 1994, the Infants Act 1908, the Prevention of Juvenile Crime 1968 and the Matrimonial Property Act 1976 (NZ). In large part this legislation was adopted from New Zealand during colonization and reflects neither local values nor contemporary international norms but rather the mid-twentieth century values of England and New Zealand. The drafting of a Family Law Bill provides the opportunity to develop a legal framework that is reflective of the values and context of contemporary Cook Islander society, including the national commitments to gender equality and the implementation of CEDAW, to replace the old laws which reflect the norms and values of the colonizing countries when they were developed.

The development of a civil Family Law Bill is intended to consolidate the multiple pieces of family law legislation into a single, clearly articulated and contemporary Bill. The Bill will improve the accessibility of the law in this area, particularly to the general public. Family law is a complex area however the development of a single piece of civil legislation in simple language will facilitate access to the law to a wide range of parties. It will also provide the opportunity to ensure that all family law legislation is in compliance with the international instruments to which the Cook Islands is a party. In addition, the development of a CEDAW, CRC and CRPD compliant Family Law Bill will also provide an important contribution by the Cook Islands to good practices that can be relied on both by other Pacific Island countries, and globally. Whilst the civil Family Law Bill will not incorporate targeted domestic violence criminal law offences this is an important area for future law reform. Methodology This paper considers law reform options in six areas pertaining to family law in the Cook Islands. The six areas are; i) marriage, ii) the end of marriage, iii) the care of children, iv) spousal and child support, v) domestic violence and vi) property division after marriage or relationship breakdown, For each of the six areas this policy paper identifies the range of components that are essential to good practice and CEDAW, CRC and CRPD compliant legislation. For each of these components this paper provides a simple definition and an explanation of the rational that underlies its inclusion. It also provides an overview of the law in the Cook Islands, where relevant, in relation to each component. After an overview of the relevant law, the policy paper provides a statement on what constitutes good practice (based on international conventions to which the Cook Islands is a party, international declarations and commentary, relevant academic literature and government and non-government reports). The paper also includes a range of good practice examples that illustrate how different jurisdictions have approached each particular component. Where possible, examples from Oceania have been chosen (the Pacific Islands and Territories, New Zealand and Australia) but this paper also provides international comparison by drawing on examples from around the world that represent good practice. The policy paper does not cover the area of inheritance although this is an important aspect of family law in which serious discrimination against women occurs when law and practice do not treat females equally with males. The CEDAW Committee in General Recommendation 21(34) directs States parties to implement the Economic and Social Council Resolution (884) which requires States parties to ensure that \u2018men and women in the same degree of relationship to a deceased are entitled to equal shares in the estate and to equal rank in the order of succession.\u20196 Further, the Beijing Platform recommends that governments \u2018enact and strictly enforce legislation that guarantees equal rights to 1.13 1.14 1.15 6 General Recommendation 21, Equality in Marriage and Family Relations, 1994, 13th Session (UN Doc A/49/38) at para [34].

Currently, marriage is governed in the Cook Islands by the Marriage Act 1973 and reform in this area would be best achieved through amendments to that legislation. Many of the existing provisions of the Marriage Act 1973 are already CEDAW compliant. Therefore this chapter identifies and discusses only three areas that are currently non-compliant with CEDAW for consideration. These include, first, considering whether to raise the minimum marriageable age, which is currently 16, to the CEDAW and the CRC recommended age of 18. It also requires considering whether to remove the requirement placed on \u2018minors\u2019 (which in the Cook Islands has been applied to include those persons between the ages of 16 and 21) to obtain consent from both parents before marriage can take place. Such a provision denies the autonomy of those over the age of 18 to choose if and when to marry (which legally does not depend on whether or not the person still resides with her/ his parents). Second, marriage in the Cook Islands is limited to persons of opposite sex. Same-sex marriage is still controversial for many in the Pacific and this is reflected in the decision of the participants at the Cook Islands consultation on the Family Law Bill not to include same-sex marriage in the new reforms. There is however a growing worldwide recognition that the principle of non-discrimination implies that marriage rights should be available equally to all members of the community. This has led to the extension of marriage to same-sex couples or the establishment of domestic registered partnerships and civil unions throughout the world. Although there is not yet a direct enforceable obligation under international law to extend marriage to same- sex couples, increasingly countries are amending their laws to do so. In the Pacific region, in 2009, the French collectivities of Wallis and Futuna and New Caledonia, introduced civil unions for same- sex couples providing a basis for similar reform in other Pacific Island countries. Finally, a marriage is automatically void under the Marriage Act 1973 if the parties are within specified prohibited degrees of relationship (which means the two people are either too closely related or are related in a way that makes marriage unacceptable and inappropriate such as two siblings) or if one of the parties is already married. The Act does not however require the consent of the parties before a marriage can proceed and there is no process for voiding a marriage if full and free consent was not obtained as required by Article 16(1)(b) of CEDAW. Marriageable Age The Cook Islands Marriage Act 1973, s 17(1) designates 16 as the minimum age of marriage for both males and females. In General Recommendation 21(36) the CEDAW Committee states that international standards require that the minimum age of marriage for both men and women be set at 18 years since marriage carries with it important responsibilities which require maturity 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 34 and capacity to act.8 The CEDAW Committee in its Concluding Comments to the Cook Islands in 2007 urged the Cook Islands \u2018to raise the minimum age of marriage for women to 18 years, in line with article 16(2) of the Convention, the Committee\u2019s general recommendation 21 and the Convention on the Rights of the Child\u2019.9 Raising the marriageable age to 18 would also satisfy CEDAW legislative compliance indicator 16.3.10 The Committee has explained that \u2018a low legal age of marriage may prevent girls from continuing their education, lead them to drop out of school early and may result in difficulties in their achievement of economic autonomy and empowerment.\u201911 An early marriage can have negative effects on their \u2018enjoyment of their human rights, especially their rights to health and education\u201912 in part because of the increased likelihood of early motherhood and the associated health risks including an increased risk", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1e487c2d-fa70-49d1-9170-07f378233fe6": {"__data__": {"id_": "1e487c2d-fa70-49d1-9170-07f378233fe6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing the Implementation of CEDAW in the Cook Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d818fdd89fc81fd3a8271629952880025c25466a36df7bf73a391d30a8467c3b"}, "3": {"node_id": "1b44bfb8-767b-48e8-9b64-c1fdb64f63cd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "05c5b0b98340004152602e61b5126c77d22126cfc4b68d0df1e4de42706a0a00"}}, "hash": "9ae613b331cc60d73c786d3e37a4b11bf53511da7f122feb8adcf2e0dd7e7d8e", "text": "of HIV/AIDs.13 Minors (which in the Cook Islands has been applied to include those persons between the ages of 16 and 21) those children and persons between the ages of 16 and 21), must obtain consent from both parents before they can marry. This is not in line with international standards as it denies the autonomy of those over the age of 18 to choose if and when to marry. Who Can Marry? In the Cook Islands the Marriage Amendment Act 2000 amended the Marriage Act 1973 with the insertion \u2018A man may not marry another man and a woman may not marry another\u2019. In 2007 that Act was repealed by the Marriage Amendment Act 2007, which prohibits marriage between persons of same gender. The two Acts provide a clear statement on the position of the Cook Islands in relation to legalizing same-sex unions, which contradicts the growing worldwide trend to legalize either same- sex marriage or to introduce either same-sex civil unions or registered domestic partnerships (in addition to repealing other related laws such as colonial era anti-sodomy laws).14 An increasing number of countries agree with human rights experts that there is sufficient support in CEDAW In General Recommendation 21 the CEDAW Committee notes that in the CRC a \u2018child\u2019 means any human being below the age of 18 unless majority is attained earlier under national law.

(b) both parties shall, as regards age, mental capacity and otherwise, be capable of contracting a valid marriage. EXAMPLE Voiding of Marriage The Marriage Act 1973 provides for the voiding of marriage in two situations. The first situation in which a marriage is automatically void is if the two people being married are within specified prohibited degrees of relationship (i.e. siblings are not allowed to marry each other because of their close genetic relationship). The second reason for voiding a marriage is if one of the parties is still legally married to someone else. However, the Act does not yet provide for the voiding of marriage if consent has been obtained through duress, fraud, misrepresentation or mistaken identity, intoxication or if one of the parties is incapable of understanding the nature of the consent (as illustrated in the example of Australia below). The inclusion of a provision that explicitly voids marriages not obtained with full and free consent would also satisfy CEDAW legislative compliance indicator 16.2. 20 Duress can occur when a party is incapable of refusing a marriage due to coercion or threats (usually against the woman or her loved ones). Fraud can occur if someone is deceived as to the reason for the marriage, for example if someone is induced to marry ostensibly for love but in fact the real aim of one party is to gain residence.21 Misrepresentation can occur if the person does not understand the nature of the ceremony, for example, an English speaking woman in India thought she was facilitating marriage for a friend but in fact was signing the marriage register on her own behalf.22 Mental incapacity and intoxication are relevant when they result in the party not understanding the nature and effect of the marriage ceremony. 2.9 2.10 20 See Translating CEDAW into Law note 4 at 37.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "def11230-79e3-4f56-9d67-751215b96fb7": {"__data__": {"id_": "def11230-79e3-4f56-9d67-751215b96fb7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing the Implementation of CEDAW in the Cook Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9b37b5e974e40984902561210f63d6062d17af31f6e5a9e90160432984842390"}, "2": {"node_id": "148dc916-ea42-473f-a22d-04ebe37a1bd2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "988b0421db66472cec43d6f72f67954ca595e1a8642e5a213838a8464128089e"}}, "hash": "0bc183a255c3a346d75d6bfd376da23b216e66e5dfe28c1ceba9774c5c6de9c5", "text": "21 A Dickey, Family Law (Sydney: Lawbook Company 4th ed, 2002) at 167. 22 Mehta (orse.Kohn) v Mehta [1945] 2 All ER 690.

EXAMPLE Recommendations of the Cook Islands Consultation - Marriage 1. To raise the marriageable age to 18. 2. To remove from the Marriage Act 1973 the requirement for minors (those between the age of 16 and 21) to obtain consent of both parents before they can marry. 3. To insert a requirement for \u2018full and free consent\u2019 into the Marriage Act 1973. 4. To insert a provision into the Marriage Act 1973 that voids a marriage not obtained with full and free consent. 5. The consultation believed that the Cook Islands was not yet ready to legalise same-sex marriage or civil unions and therefore decided not to incorporate same-sex marriage into the family law reforms. The group acknowledged that this was discriminatory and not in accord with international obligations and that it would require further discussion over time. GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 38 Chapter 3 THE END OF MARRIAGE Introduction This chapter considers law reform issues relating to separation and divorce. Currently, separation is governed in the Cook Islands by the Cook Islands Amendment Act 1994 and divorce is governed by the Cook Islands Act 1915 and the Family Proceedings Act 1963 (NZ). Law reform in this area would be best achieved through the repeal of the applicable provisions and incorporation of these areas into the new Family Law Bill. The significance of both separation and divorce law is primarily in the legal determination of the new relations between the parties, including their duties and obligations relating to property that they own, the responsibilities of either or both of them to provide spousal and child support, determining occupation of the marital home, and settling residence and contact arrangements for any children. These topics are individually considered in the chapters that follow. Therefore, this chapter focuses instead on the grounds on which separation orders and divorce are granted, and their respective immediate legal effects. This chapter identifies and discusses two key aspects of the law in the Cook Islands relating to the end of marriage that are currently non-compliant with CEDAW and contemporary good practices in family law. First, the current divorce procedures in the Cook Islands are still based on fault. This is contrary to international obligations, which expressly require the abolition of fault-based divorce.23 Modern separation and divorce laws have progressed and shifted from a reliance on the establishment of fault, which requires proof of a matrimonial offence (typically desertion, adultery or cruelty) towards a non-fault based, neutral and non-adversarial system of divorce. Fault-based separation and divorce provisions were originally introduced into many legal systems based on a religious belief that divorce is a sin, and that accordingly the rules of divorce should punish the matrimonial crime24 freeing an \u2018innocent spouse from the contractual obligation of a lifelong marriage to a guilty spouse.\u201925 However, this approach is no longer considered consistent with the demographics of changing family forms whereby marriages breakdown has dramatically increased and can no longer be regarded as a lifetime union. Fault-based systems have been further criticized for several reasons, including; because they interfere with the autonomy of both men and women and each persons\u2019 right to choose when to enter and leave relationships,26 and for exacerbating hostility and bitterness between the parties and therefore operating in opposition to the interests of any children. Fault based systems can also make it more difficult for women to leave violent relationships because the requirement to provide evidence of a matrimonial crime may force them to provide evidence of situations that are humiliating, embarrassing, frightening27 and finally the futile and often difficult nature of allocating blame. 3.1 3.2 3.3 23 Concluding Comments of the CEDAW Committee: Luxembourg (2008) 40th Session at para [34] (UN Doc CEDAW/C/LUX/CO/5). 24 M Antoloskaia, \u201cThe Search for a Common Core of Divorce Law: State Intervention Versus Spouses Autonomy\u201d in M Martin-Casals (ed) The Role of Self-Determination in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "45f56a58-6a4e-44c2-bdba-456b33a39218": {"__data__": {"id_": "45f56a58-6a4e-44c2-bdba-456b33a39218", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing the Implementation of CEDAW in the Cook Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "47c62c757283b8c32c69c84a93f278ce24e836147606b02cf47a027f24297f69"}, "3": {"node_id": "139ff8df-0dd5-43d0-8cb4-ff2d6a316434", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7e860d4f6f610e18b89f5a6777ee41dc6daeaa61b98610a0f95eda89d9e1a72a"}}, "hash": "bfa1a2e12ce8cd3f2c60eef0991e60a605b45c960ba3629a4594426cd7c9b0e4", "text": "the Modernisation of Family Law in Europe (Girona: Documenta Universitaria, 2006) at 36. 25 H Kay, \u201cNo-Fault Divorce and Child Custody: Chilling out the Gender Wars\u201d (2002-2003) 16 Family Law Quarterly 27 at 30. 26 J Herring, Family Law: Issues, Debates, Policy (Devon: Willan Publishing, 2001) at 34. 27 S Thistle, From Marriage to the Market: The Transformation of Women\u2019s Lives and Work (Los Angeles: University of California Press, 2006) at 49.

The order does not resolve and determine the new legal relationship between the parties. Application for Divorce Current Cook Islands Law A divorce order ends the legal status of marriage between the parties and the legal rights and duties associated with marriage. Divorce is primarily governed in the Cook Islands by the Family Proceedings Act 1963 (NZ) and requires the application of fault-based criteria by the High Court. Most of the grounds included are now widely regarded as outdated and inappropriate. These grounds include: adultery; artificial insemination of the respondent wife without the husband\u2019s consent; desertion for three years; habitual drunkenness for three years, with failure to support or neglect of domestic duties (as the case may be), or cruelty; conviction for murder or certain attempted murders; insanity and confinement for this reason for certain periods without likelihood of recovery; non-compliance for three years with a decree for restitution of conjugal rights; separation by Court order or agreement for three years; living apart for seven years without likelihood of reconciliation; conviction for certain offences of violence or sexual offences; rape, sodomy, or bestiality (wife\u2019s petition). Although these grounds also still remain in the laws of other Pacific Island countries such an approach is out of step with modern divorce laws which have minimized or removed the involvement of courts, removed the requirement that fault be found and instead relying on the wishes of one or both of the spouses to divorce. Introducing a no-fault system of divorce would also satisfy CEDAW legislative compliance indicator 16.13.28 Approaches to Divorce Two identifiable approaches to no-fault frameworks of divorce, which facilitate the dissolution of marriage through simple procedures, have been adopted in contemporary family laws. The most popular approach is a requirement that the relationship has broken down that in such a way that it is \u2018irreconcilable\u2019, \u2018irremediable\u2019 or \u2018irretrievable\u2019, without reference to spousal conduct and typically upon the request of one spouse.29 Some jurisdictions require evidence or proof that the marriage has broken down \u2018irretrievably\u2019 but this has proven to be a considerable burden, takes longer, and is not considered good practice. An alternate approach, as illustrated in the example of Australia below, is that once a specified period of separation has elapsed, typically one year, the marriage is automatically designated as irretrievable. Whilst this approach is morally neutral, simple and easily understood, it has been criticized because it creates a delay of a year before divorce can be granted.30 The delay can pose significant financial hardship for the parties who, for example, may need to find alternate housing for one party until financial settlement upon divorce. Australia has approached this difficulty by not requiring the parties to live apart during the one year separation. However, if the relationship between the parties is acrimonious this may not be possible or desirable. If this approach is adopted it is important to have clear separation procedures (discussed below) 3.4 3.5 3.6 28 V Jivan & C Forster, Translating CEDAW into Law: CEDAW Legislative Compliance in the Cook Islands (Suva: UNDP Pacific Centre, 2008) at 39. 29 C Starnes, \u201cOne More Time: Alimony, Intuition and the Remarriage -Termination Rule\u201d (2006) 81 Indiana Law Journal 971 at 987. 30 The CEDAW Committee in its constructive dialogue with Fiji in July 2010 criticized the one year period of separation provided by the Fiji Family Law Act 2003.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "139ff8df-0dd5-43d0-8cb4-ff2d6a316434": {"__data__": {"id_": "139ff8df-0dd5-43d0-8cb4-ff2d6a316434", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing the Implementation of CEDAW in the Cook Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "47c62c757283b8c32c69c84a93f278ce24e836147606b02cf47a027f24297f69"}, "2": {"node_id": "45f56a58-6a4e-44c2-bdba-456b33a39218", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bfa1a2e12ce8cd3f2c60eef0991e60a605b45c960ba3629a4594426cd7c9b0e4"}}, "hash": "7e860d4f6f610e18b89f5a6777ee41dc6daeaa61b98610a0f95eda89d9e1a72a", "text": "See also S Cretney & J Mason, Principles of Family Law (London: Sweet & Maxwell, 1997) at 322.

The rationale behind this approach is that marriage is the voluntary union of two persons and therefore a unilateral wish of one party to end the union should be seen as sufficient to terminate the marriage. Proponents argue that whilst marriage provides a statement of intent that the relationship will be long-lasting, it is however a legal bond which either spouse should be able to enter or leave with relative (or absolute) freedom. The state cannot require people to live together or continue a relationship and it does not have a legitimate role in attempting to delay or prevent divorce. Instead, it should provide the means to resolve the important legal questions relating to financial settlement, the division of property and the care of children. Sweden has adopted this approach however it has imposed some limitations as illustrated below. If both spouses agree that their marriage should be dissolved they have a right to an immediate divorce (except where there is a child under sixteen years of that provides for either spouse to apply for support, property division or adjustment, occupation of the marital home and residence orders in relation to any children. There must be processes available to immediately resolve these issues so they are not delayed until the divorce is granted. This approach can be coupled with a procedure that converts a separation order into a divorce order automatically without any requirement to proceed to a hearing or to file further documents. Neither best practice approach precludes reconciliation between the parties but they do not require that the parties must attempt reconciliation. 3.7 3.8 Grounds for Divorce: \u201cIrretrievable Breakdown\u201d Family Law Act 1975, s 48, s 49 (Australia) S 48(1) An application under this Act for a divorce order in relation to a marriage shall be based on the ground that the marriage has broken down irretrievably. S 48(2) In a proceeding instituted by such an application, the ground shall be held to have been established, and the divorce order shall be made, if, and only if, the court is satisfied that the parties separated and thereafter lived separately and apart for a continuous period of not less than 12 months immediately preceding the date of the filing of the application for the divorce order. S 49(1) The parties to a marriage may be held to have separated notwithstanding that the cohabitation was brought to an end by the action or conduct of one only of the parties. S 49(2) The parties to a marriage may be held to have separated and to have lived separately and apart notwithstanding that they have continued to reside in the same residence or that either party has rendered some household services to the other. EXAMPLE GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 41 Separation Procedures Legal Effects of Separation The main legal significance of a separation procedure is, like divorce, to enable the court to; award spousal and child support to either of the parties, to determine a property adjustment in lieu of a final property settlement, to settle the occupation of the marital home and to resolve issues in relation to any children. It is crucial that the legislation explicitly provides the authority for the determination of these matters during any period of separation, regardless of which divorce process is adopted. If there is a mandatory separation period or even if an immediate unilateral divorce process is applied (since the parties may choose not to proceed immediately to divorce) access to the relevant legal remedies must be facilitated by the separation process.

If the other spouse does not consent to divorce, a reconsideration period (of six months) must precede the divorce.

This however is no longer considered sufficient or appropriate in modern divorce laws. It is not enforceable, and is irrelevant to and has no role in determining the important legal issues that must be resolved when a relationship breaks down. A separation order issued under the Act therefore has little legal impact because currently the important legal issues that typically arise after separation that need to be determined, are governed by other legislation which can be accessed with or without a separation order. For example, the Cook Islands Act 1915 provides for spousal support if there is \u2018reasonable cause\u2019 for a wife or a child to live apart from their father or husband. Provision is made for interim property division or adjustment in the Matrimonial Property Act 1976 (NZ) upon separation and for an occupation order to determine who has the right to occupy the matrimonial home on the basis of what the court thinks \u2018fit\u2019. Issues relating to children, such as who will provide day- to-day care, are determined by the Cook Islands Act 1915 and the Infants Act 1908 on the basis of the best interests of the child. Approaches to Separation Two approachs have been taken to separation procedures in modern divorce law. The first and most straightforward, as illustrated in the example of Sweden below, is to expressly allow either party to apply for spousal and child support from the other and for occupation of the marital home upon separation. This approach does not require either party to establish that the marriage is \u2018irretrievable\u2019 merely that separation has occurred at the request of either party. Additionally, it does not require a separation order and is therefore administratively efficient. The second approach is to establish a procedure for obtaining a separation order. The legal effect of the separation order is to enable either party to: apply for spousal and child support, to determine who will occupy the marital home, and to also enable either party to apply for residence and contact orders if necessary. This approach is administratively much less efficient than the first, and should be adopted only if the parties are required to provide a reason for separation rather than merely enabling access to the relevant legal remedies once separation has, in fact, occurred. A good practice procedure in this model should mirror the divorce procedure adopted, and not require the finding of any fault by either party in order for a separation order to be applied for or granted. 3.10 3.11 GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 43 Separation procedures The Marriage Code (\u00c4ktenskapsbalken) 1987, Chapter 5 (Sweden) Section 7 In a divorce case, the court may, with respect to the period prior to the determination of the question by a judgment that has become non appealable, on the application of either spouse, (1) determine which of the spouse is entitled", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe0d4736-7d8f-4c9a-820d-f21aa026c4ae": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe0d4736-7d8f-4c9a-820d-f21aa026c4ae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing the Implementation of CEDAW in the Cook Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "82076b12ba13aa0495da6e42bb135d929331a3c2ba8ecf89c2de2979ddc894e6"}}, "hash": "82076b12ba13aa0495da6e42bb135d929331a3c2ba8ecf89c2de2979ddc894e6", "text": "to continue to reside on the spouses\u2019 joint dwelling; how ever, this shall be for no longer than until such time as property division has taken place; (2) Order that one spouse be obliged to contribute towards the maintenance of the other spouse.

No procedure for obtaining a separation order shall be included in the Bill as this serves no purpose in the divorce procedure adopted. 3. Separation shall begin when either of the parties applies for a divorce, when the parties cease to cohabit, or when either party determines that separation has begun even if the parties are still cohabiting. 4. Upon separation either party can apply for spousal and child support, occupation of the joint residence, property division and residence and contact orders in relation to any children. EXAMPLE GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 44 Chapter 4 THE CARE OF CHILDREN Introduction This chapter considers law reform issues relating to children. In particular this chapter considers; i) the responsibilities of parents in relation to the care of their children until they reach 18, ii) the various kinds of arrangements required for children when parents do not live together, including the resolution of disputes in relation to those arrangements and the basis on which those disputes are to be resolved, iii) the circumstances in which state care and/or supervision can and should be invoked and, lastly, iv) adoption. In the Cook Islands the Cook Islands Act 1915, the Infants Act 1908, and the Juvenile Crimes Act 1968 govern the law relating to children. However, the three Acts contains very limited coverage of the issues discussed in this chapter. Law reform in this area would best be achieved through the repeal of any applicable provisions in the three Acts and incorporation of the area into the new Family Law Bill. In relation to the legal issues relevant to the care of children, a paradigm shift in thinking has occurred in recent years, away from a focus on parental rights and authority, towards a focus instead on the combination of parental responsibilities and the rights of the child. This shift reflects the tenor of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) to which the Cook Islands became a party in 1997. It also reflects many changes in the demographic structure and make-up of family forms in recent years in many countries including the Cook Islands. The Explanatory Note to the New Zealand Care of Children Act 2004 which came into effect in 2005, with the aim of modernizing the law in relation to the care of children articulated this as follows: \u201cFamily and ethnic demographics in New Zealand have changed considerably since the 1968 Act was enacted. The 1968 Act is premised upon a traditional nuclear family model that does not reflect the diversity of family arrangements that now exist in New Zealand. More modern legislation must provide a framework that recognises and supports all types of family units that care for children, for example, single-parent households, extended families, reconstituted families, and de facto relationships (including those of the same sex).\u201d32 In the majority of cases in the Cook Islands, after the breakdown of a relationship or when the parents do not live together, the parties reach agreement on what arrangements should be made for children without court intervention. This can often be in the children\u2019s best interests. Agreement in such situations is achieved either through personal mutual compromise or solicitor-negotiated settlement. The standards represented in the law can provide a strong basis for the decisions and agreement reached. Protections must be in place, however for those circumstances where agreement cannot be reached or agreement is not in the best interests of the child. 4.1 4.2 4.3 32 Care of Children Bill 2003 (NZ) No 54-1, Explanatory Note, General Policy Statement, at 1.

The Principle of the Best Interests of the Child Legislative Definition Article(1)(d) of CEDAW states that \u2018in all cases the interests of the children shall be paramount.\u2019 Article 3(1) of the CRC states that in all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration. In response to these international obligations, modern family law typically includes a clear statement in the legislation that the principle of the child\u2019s best interests in relation to all matters pertaining to children is paramount, as illustrated below in the example of England. The inclusion of a list of statutory factors to be used to determine what is the best interests of the child is discussed below in paragraph [4.6]. A legislative statement confirming the paramountcy of the best interests of the child in all proceedings concerning children would also represent compliance with CEDAW legislative indicator 16.18.33 Currently, in the Cook Islands the Infants Act 1908 provides that in any proceedings relating to \u2018the custody or upbringing of an infant\u2019 (defined as a person uner 18)34 the court \u2018shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration\u2019. The Cook Islands Act 1915 states that the the High Court may \u2018in and by any decree for the dissolution of marriage, or at any time and from time to time thereafter, make such order as it thinks fit as to the custody of the children of the marriage.\u201935 There are some difficulties in determining how these two Acts were originally meant to interact, as well as with the current interpretations and practices however, the case law suggests that judges do apply the principle of the best interests of the child. It is important however that there is a clear statement in the legislation that explicitly states that the principle of the best interest of the child is to be applied in all proceedings relating to the care of children to ensure the principle is consistently applied in every case. 33 See V Jivan & C Forster, Translating CEDAW into Law: CEDAW Legislative Compliance in the Cook Islands (Suva: UNDP Pacific Centre, 2008) at 41. 34 Infants Amendment Act 2009, s 3. 35 Cook Islands Act 1915, s 538. 4.4 4.5 GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 46 Best Interests of the Child Paramount Care of Children Act 2004, s 4 (1) (New Zealand) The welfare and best interests of the child must be the first and paramount consideration\u2014 (a) in the administration and application of this Act, for example, in proceedings under this Act; and (b) in any other proceedings involving the guardianship of, or the role of providing day to day care for, or contact with, a child. Statutory Checklist of Factors The trend in modern family law is to provide a statutory checklist (which means a specific checklist of factors is included in the law itself) to guide the court in determining what is in the child\u2019s best interests in family law proceedings. The arguments in favor of including such a checklist in the law, are that; it provides clarity and therefore enables a more consistent and systematic approach to decision-making by all judges, it enables judges to clearly identify the reasons for their decisions, simplifies the judicial process, it gives parents and children a greater understanding of the basis of the judge\u2019s decision, and it assists professionals when they prepare reports for the court to ensure that all aspects of the best interests of the child are covered. Finally, including a checklist also provides guidance for settling issues in relation to children outside of the court setting. Conversely, some argue against the use of a statutory checklist on the basis that; it may lengthen proceedings, judges may come to take a mechanical approach to decision-making relying solely on the checklist and that the best interests of the child principle is all-encompassing", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "37e16e73-35b8-4fd0-85fc-2e665abb52b5": {"__data__": {"id_": "37e16e73-35b8-4fd0-85fc-2e665abb52b5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing the Implementation of CEDAW in the Cook Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e40f1d0961044e1b9e8a370073f5d7854d53cdf2b2d7e1de5bb44d32f31547a4"}}, "hash": "e40f1d0961044e1b9e8a370073f5d7854d53cdf2b2d7e1de5bb44d32f31547a4", "text": "and does not require explicit guidance.36 Most modern family law legislation does however contain a checklist including, in the Oceanic region, Australia, Fiji, and New Zealand.

This factor requires the court to consider the relationship of the child with her or his parents, siblings or any other person with whom the child normally resides (including for example grandparents) recognising the potential impact on the child, of any change in such arrangements. This factor recognises the importance of maintaining existing relationships, emotional bonds and physical environment and in particular that siblings should, wherever possible, be brought up together in the same household so that they can be of emotional support to each other.

GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 49 Parental Responsibility The Progression from Parental Authority to Parental Responsibility The role of parents in relation to their children has been, in many common law countries, historically conceptualized in terms of their rights and authority over a child, rather than in terms of their responsibility for the child\u2019s welfare and best interests. In contrast to this approach, Article 18(1) of the CRC obligates state parties to use their best efforts to ensure recognition of the primary role of parents in protecting the interests of children and states that both parents have common responsibilities for the upbringing and development of the child. Accordingly, a number of countries (including Fiji) have in recent years shifted from the parent-focused \u2018parental rights and authority\u2019 approach towards the more child-focused concept of \u2018parental responsibility\u2019. The inclusion of a provision defining parental responsibility accords with the CRC and good practice in the modern family law context. Legislative Definition of Parental Responsibility Two approaches have been taken in modern family laws to defining parental responsibility. The first approach is to include a detailed description of the particular responsibilities expected of both parents (as seen in the example of Scotland below). The second approach is to include a short generic provision that does not detail the responsibilities but instead leaves it to the discretion of the judges (as seen in the example of Fiji below). The inclusion of a detailed list of responsibilities could be seen by some as too restrictive and directive. On the other hand, the generic approach, such as the one taken by Fiji, could be viewed as failing to give appropriate guidance to parents and the judges in determining parental responsibility. This may result in differing and uneven interpretations and applications of the law. The more detailed approach adopted by Scotland accords more closely with the obligations under the CRC. Article 6 states that the \u2018responsibilities, rights and duties\u2019 of parents to provide, appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise by the child of the rights recognized in the present Convention. Article 9 states that a child who is separated from one or both parents has the right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis, except if it is contrary to the child\u2019s best interests. Who has Parental Responsibility? Article 16(1)(d) of CEDAW obligates States parties to ensure \u2018on a basis of equality of men and women the same rights and responsibilities as parents, irrespective of their marital status, in matters relating to their children.\u2019 Historically, in many common law countries biological fathers had sole parental rights in relation to their children born within marriage whilst mothers were primarily left with responsibilities for children born outside of marriage. The obligation to place the child\u2019s interests as paramount and the contemporary view that \u2018the burdens and pleasures of child rearing\u2019 should be shared by both parents, has resulted in a shift in modern family law towards equal parental responsibility. As well as a clear statement of equal and shared parental responsibility, some countries have included in the legislation a provision stating that parental responsibility continues until the child is 18 regardless of other circumstances such as a parent re-partnering. This approach is reflected in the good practice examples of Fiji and England below. 4.8 4.9 4.10 GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a249d08d-dacb-4789-9612-c67ce20001e9": {"__data__": {"id_": "a249d08d-dacb-4789-9612-c67ce20001e9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing the Implementation of CEDAW in the Cook Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1bbc27a31370e5495690d396d7a30fa49a4dbfab623770be6295e4960ba079e2"}}, "hash": "1bbc27a31370e5495690d396d7a30fa49a4dbfab623770be6295e4960ba079e2", "text": "0 1 0 50 Definition of Parental Responsibility Children (Scotland) Act 1995, s 1 (Scotland) A parent has in relation to [her or] his child the responsibility: (a) to safeguard and promote the child\u2019s health, development and best interests; and (b) to provide, in a manner appropriate to the stage of development of the child: (i) direction and (ii) guidance to the child; and (c) if the child is not living with the parent, to maintain personal relations and direct contact with the child on a regular basis; and (d) to act as the child\u2019s legal representative Family Law Act 2003, s 45.

EXAMPLES EXAMPLES GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 51 The Age At Which Parental Responsibility Legally Ends The age at which legal parental responsibility ceases differs in modern family law with some countries opting for when the child turn 18 years old, some opting for 16 years old and some 16 and 18 depending on the particular responsibilities in question. In Scotland all parental responsibilities, except the responsibility to provide guidance which lasts until the child is 18, cease when the child reaches 16 years of age.37 In Fiji all aspects of parental responsibility continue until the child is 1838 and this approach most closely aligns to Article 1 of the CRC which defines a child as a \u2018human being below the age of 18 years unless, under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier.\u2019 Parenting Orders Definition of Parenting Orders The Cook Islands Act 1915 authorizes the High Court to make custody orders on the basis of what \u2018it thinks fit\u2019 in relation to the children of the marriage.39 The Infants Act 1908 however provides for custody to be determined on the basis of the \u2018welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration\u2019. Whilst the Cook Islands Act 1915 only applies to children whose parents are married to each other, it is unclear whether the Infants Act 1908 applies to unmarried parents. The Infants Act 1908 also provides for access orders, to be determined on the basis of the welfare of the infant and the conduct of the parents. Good practice requires a consolidation of the legislation, an explicit statement that the best interests of the child are paramount in all proceedings involving children, and the removal of any reference to parental conduct or to any relationship that either parent may have with another person. Modern family law legislation has moved away from the terminology of custody and access orders, which foster notions of ownership in children by focusing on the respective \u2018rights\u2019 of the parents, and on which parent has been granted \u2018possession\u2019 of the child to the exclusion of the other. Instead, the new approach emphasizes parental agreement as the primary means of settling parenting arrangements when parents do not live together, and the issuing of parenting orders. When parents are not living together, parenting orders are made to settle arrangements in respect of; the child\u2019s residence, to enable continuing contact with both parents, or with other important adults in the child\u2019s life, provided this is in the best interests of the child, and to determine the process for making important decisions in relation to the child. Parenting orders in modern family law typically consist of a range of orders termed \u2018residence\u2019, \u2018contact\u2019 \u2018specific issues\u2019 and \u2018prohibited steps\u2019 orders.

In modern family law contact orders replace access orders. Access orders were historically adult-centered, permitting another person to visit the child for the benefit of the adult. In contrast, a contact order is child-centered, requiring the person with whom the child lives to allow contact with the other parent or other person named in the order, if it is in the best interests of the child. It signals a move away from approaching contact with the child as a parental right, to viewing it instead as the child\u2019s right and part of the range of responsibilities that parents have for their children. The rationale underscoring a contact order is therefore to recognize and maintain the beneficial relationships already established between the child and other children in the family or other adults to the maximum extent possible in the light of changed family circumstances. Contact orders typically permit \u2018custody\u201940 however in the Cook Islands the law specifically states that neither the father nor the mother has a \u2018superior\u2019 claim to the other.41 In the Cook Islands, currently the law gives the custodial parent virtually all rights concerning the upbringing of the child.42 A residence order is conceptually different from a custody order because it gives one parent the day-to-day care and responsibility for the child but does not remove the responsibility of the other parent to participate in parenting as much as is practicable. 4.15 40 For example in Tuvalu paternal presumption applies to a child over 2 years of age.

Contact Order Care of Children Act 2004, s 3 (New Zealand) A parenting order determining that a person may have contact with the child may specify any of the following: (a) the nature of that contact (for example, whether it is direct (that is, face to face) contact or some form of indirect contact (for example, contact by way of letters, telephone calls, or email)): (b) the duration and timing of that contact: (c) any arrangements that are necessary or desirable to facilitate that contact Children (Scotland) Act 1995, s 11(2)(d) (Scotland) An order regulating the arrangements for maintaining personal relations and direct contact between a child under that age and a person with whom the child is not, or will not be, living.

A specific issues order can detail who will make a particular decision and/or how a particular decision will be made.

A prohibited steps order is typically issued to prohibit major decisions in relation to the child such as changing the surname of the child, removing the child from the country, changing the nationality or domicile of the child, or consent to the adoption process. The availability of a prohibited steps order provides a means of protecting the rights of the child in accordance with the CRC. 4.17 EXAMPLES Specific Issues Order Children Act 1989, s 8 (England) A specific issue order means an order giving directions for the purpose of determining a specific question which has arisen, or which may arise, in connection with any aspect of parental responsibility for a child. EXAMPLES Prohibited Steps Order Children Act 1989, s 8(1) (England) A prohibited steps order is an order that no step which could be taken by a parent in meeting her or his parental responsibilities or her or his parental rights for a child, and which is of a kind specified in the order, shall be taken by any person without the consent of the court. Application for Parenting Orders Persons Who Can Apply The trend in modern family law is to enable a wide range of potentially interested parties to apply for a parenting order. In Australia (and Fiji which has replicated the Australian provisions), an application for a parenting order may be made by a representative of the child, by either or both parents, or any other person concerned with the care, welfare or development of the child.43 This is a good practice approach. 4.18 43 Family Law Act, 1975, s 65C (Australia); Family Law Act 2003, s 65 (Fiji).

Mandatory representation is however dependent upon state funding and its inclusion in the legislative provisions must be accompanied by a commitment to funding separate representation. 4.19 GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 56 The Principle of Non-Intervention If there is a dispute between the parties, an order may be required in the child\u2019s best interests in order to; give stability to the existing arrangements, to clarify the respective roles of the parents, or to reassure the parent with whom the children will be living that such arrangements have in fact been made. However, orders are not always necessary to settle arrangements in relation to residence and contact. A good practice approach is to explicitly provide in the legislation that a court must not make an order unless it considers that doing so would be better for the child than making no order at all. This measure ensures that the court only intervenes in the child\u2019s life where there is a real problem in need of resolution and not simply as a matter of routine (because it can). The rationale underscoring this approach is that if parents are prepared to co-operate between themselves or through a mediation process to ensure suitable continuing arrangements for their children, not making an order would be in the best interests of the children, and this would enhance and support the parents\u2019 future relationship. Primacy of Court Orders Over Parental Responsibility The inclusion of parental responsibility provisions in the law may enable a parent to be obstructive in the exercise of parenting orders. In the Australian context, a review of the provisions on parental responsibility (introduced into the Family Law Act 1975) revealed that \u2018the meaning of joint parental responsibility, and how joint parental responsibility should be exercised after the making of court orders, was not clearly stated in the legislation and was not well enough understood by the legal profession and the public\u2019.44 It is important therefore that the legislation clearly states that parental responsibility, especially to the extent that it involves any kind of \u2018authority\u2019 in relation to decision-making, are superseded by any court order as illustrated in the example of England below. 4.20 4.21 EXAMPLES Primacy of Parenting Orders Children Act 1989, s 2(8) (England) The fact that a person has parental responsibility for a child shall not entitle her or him to act in any way which would be incompatible with any order made with respect to the child under this Act. 44 H Rhoades, R Graycar and M Harrison, The Family Law Reform Act 1995: The First Three Years (Dec 2000, University of Sydney and Family Court of Australia).

A parenting plan is an agreement made between the parents of the child that deals with issues such as residence, contact, child support or any other aspect of parental responsibility. The parenting plan can then be registered with the court and subject to enforcement in the same way as any court order. The rationale underscoring parenting plans is that they encourage parents and those caring for children to make their own arrangements and to honor them by providing the parties with a legal means of enforcing those arrangements. It is important that safeguards are included to ensure that no parenting plan can be registered unless it is accords with the welfare and best interests of the child and to ensure that no pressure was exerted on either party to agree to the plan.

The approaches that various countries have adopted to ensure that orders are enforced and that those who contravene them are sanctioned include the following: \u2022 expressly spelling out the consequences of orders and contraventions; \u2022 varying or discharging the parenting order (for example, by reducing the time in which the child is in the care of, or has contact with the party that contravenes the order); \u2022 requiring the deposit of a bond to the court as an assurance that the parenting order will not be contravened again; \u2022 punishing the party in breach of the order with penalties such as fines, imprisonment or community service orders. The Abduction of Children Overseas The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction 198045 (The Hague Convention) aims at securing the prompt and safe return of children who have been wrongfully removed from one Convention country to another, and to ensure that rights of residence and contact under the law of one country are effectively respected in other countries that are party to the Convention.46 A specific issues order (discussed previously) can prohibit the removal of children without the permission of the court and/or the other parent and linked to passport control. However, if a child is removed either in the absence of such an order, contrary to the order, or is removed legitimately for a holiday or some other purpose and not returned, then the Hague Convention can be used to facilitate the child\u2019s return if the child is resident in a country that is also party to the Convention. The Cook Islands is not yet a party to the Hague Convention, although the removal of children from the Cook Islands may be a growing problem 4.22 4.23 45 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, 25 October 1980, Hague XXVIII, available at: http://www. unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3ae6b3951c.html hereinafter the \u2018Hague Convention\u2019. 46 Hong Kong Law Reform Commission, International Parental Child Abduction (Apr 2002), at para [1.5]. 4.24 4.25 GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 58 as freedom of movement increases between countries. A party to the Hague Convention has dual obligations. On the one hand, if it becomes a state party, the Cook Islands would be required to set up a Central Authority to receive applications, collect relevant information and institute the necessary action for the return of abducted or unlawfully retained children from the Cook Islands to that of their resident country. This role includes discovering the whereabouts of the child, preventing any or further harm, securing voluntary return, initiating proceedings and making administrative arrangements for the child\u2019s return.47 On the other hand, in relation to children removed from the Cook Islands, a procedure must be established that provides evidence to the country to which the child has been removed that the child is \u2018habitually resident\u2019 in the Cook Islands and that the removal or retention of the child outside of the Cook Islands is wrongful. Wrongfulness is defined as a breach of the \u201ccustody rights\u201d of another person or institution and although an order is not required this is the easiest process for its establishment. The approach taken in the Family Law Act 2003 in Fiji, as illustrated in the example below, which is also not a party to the Hague Convention, provides a good practice example for the Cook Islands. The legislation authorizes the future enactment of relevant provisions to facilitate the return of abducted children should Fiji become a party to the Hague Convention at a later date. The worldwide situation for the return of children can only be improved by further ratifications to the Convention, which is recommended by numerous commentators. 48 4.26 EXAMPLES Hague Convention of International Child Abduction Family Law Act 2003, s 200(1) (Fiji) The regulations may make such provision as is necessary to enable the performance of the obligations of the State, or to obtain for the State any advantage or benefit, under the Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction signed at The Hague on 25 October 1980 (the Convention) but any such regulations must not come into operation until the day on which that Convention enters into force for the Fiji Islands. 47 See S Cretney & J Masson, Principles of Family Law (London: Sweet & Maxwell, 1997) at 757. 48 H Slota, \u201cPreventing and Responding to International Child Abduction\u201d (2009) 23(2) American", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "11c14e60-462a-41a5-838d-660975747ce0": {"__data__": {"id_": "11c14e60-462a-41a5-838d-660975747ce0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing the Implementation of CEDAW in the Cook Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "18dc335a8286eee33cca54edf425e010e34469261a549619da69c4df80b684d6"}}, "hash": "18dc335a8286eee33cca54edf425e010e34469261a549619da69c4df80b684d6", "text": "Journal of Family Law 73; J Caldwell, \u201cChild Abduction Cases: Evaluating Risks to the Child and the Convention.\u201d (2008) 23(2) New Zealand Universities Law Review 161. GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 59 Public Orders: Care and Supervision State Obligations to Protect Children Article 19 of the CRC obligates States parties to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse, while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child. Article 20 obligates the state to provide to special protection and assistance, including alternative care, to a child temporarily or permanently deprived of his or her family environment, or in whose own best interests cannot be allowed to remain in that environment. Article 23 of the CRC also specifically requires recognition of the rights of children with disabilities and the CRPD prohibits discrimination against children with disabilities. The CRPD further states that under no circumstances is the disability of a child and either or both parents to be used as the reason to remove a child from the family.49 Additionally, if the immediate family cannot care for a child with a disability, \u201cStates Parties shall\u2026 undertake every effort to provide alternative care within the wider family, and failing that, within the community in a family setting.\u201d50 The international obligations of a State party are therefore to ensure that children are protected from abuse and/or neglect. Definition of Care and Supervision Orders The first and most desirable option if a child\u2019s safety is at risk in her or his home due to abuse or gross neglect is the removal of the abuser (rather than the child). In some circumstances this may not be possible, for example, if both parents are involved in the abuse or if the abuser is the sole parent or caregiver. In such circumstances, although regarded \u2018as an option of last resort\u2019, the state may need to intervene to safeguard the welfare of the child by removing her or him. In such circumstances the state must ensure the highest standard of care possible in accord with Article 20 of the CRC. In the Cook Islands the Prevention of Juvenile Crime 1968 provides for the removal of children from their \u2018surroundings\u2019 if the child \u2018is living in a place of ill- repute, or is likely to be ill-treated or neglected or for any other reason\u2019. 51 There is no duty however placed upon the state to provide appropriate care to the child and the provisions are primarily aimed at punitive measures against the parents rather than ensuring the welfare of the child. The Act also provides for supervision orders but these are available only if a child commits an offence and are punitive in their intent rather than aimed at the care and protection of the child.52 The approach adopted in modern family law legislation is to enable state intervention through two forms of public orders. The first, a care order, authorizes the state to remove the child from the home and obligates them to provide appropriate alternate services for the child such as placing the child in foster-care, with another relative or family friend or into institutionalized care. The second is a supervision order whereby the child remains in the home but the state plays a supervisory role, for example, by undertaking regular scheduled visits 4.30 4.31 4.27 4.28 4.29 49 CRPD, Article 23(4). 50 CRPD, Article 23(5). 51 Prevention of Juvenile Crime 1968, s 22. 52 Prevention of Juvenile Crime 1968, s 27.

The rationale underscoring a supervision order is that it provides some state control over a family situation where a child might be at risk but a care order (and the removal of the child from their home) is not considered necessary or in the child\u2019s best interests.

Grounds for Application The statutory grounds for care and supervision orders are crucial since the order will result in either the compulsory removal of a child from the family in the case of a care order, or mandatory intervention in the family through a supervision order. The application of the principle of the best interests of the child as the sole criteria is unsuitable for care and supervision orders because it could enable the removal of children from their homes when the child\u2019s safety is not at immediate risk through abuse or neglect. An alternative approach, adopted by England as illustrated below, is to use a two step process. A threshold requirement establishes whether the child is at risk of significant harm due to either inadequate care provided by the parent or lack of parental control. If this is satisfied than the principle of the best interests of the child, which applies to all proceedings under the Act, is then applied to establish whether an order is the best option in the circumstances of the case. 4.32 4.33 Grounds for Care and Supervision Order Children Act 1989, s 31(2) (England) A court may only make a care order or supervision order if it is satisfied\u2014 (a) that the child concerned is suffering, or is likely to suffer, significant harm; and (b) that the harm, or likelihood of harm, is attributable to\u2014 the care given to the child, or likely to be given to him if the order were not made, not being what it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give to him; or the child being beyond parental control (i) (ii) GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 61 Legal Effects of Care Orders The legal effect of a care order is typically as follows. A care order obligates the state to receive the child into its care, provide an appropriate standard of care and gives parental responsibility to the state (and specifically the person or agency designated to represent the state, i.e. social welfare services). Typically it does not mean that the parents no longer have parental responsibility but prevents them from exercising it in a way that is incompatible with the care order. The state authority must share parental responsibility with the parent and facilitate contact, if it is in the child\u2019s best interests. The legislation might also impose restrictions on making major decisions such as changing the child\u2019s surname or agreeing to adoption. Legal Effects of Supervision Orders Supervision orders differ fundamentally from care orders because (unlike care orders) they do not give parental responsibility to the state and the parents remain responsible for the child\u2019s safety and welfare. The purpose of a supervision order is to enable the state to oversee a child at risk without removing the child from the home. It thus provides a lesser form of state intervention than a care order. The approach taken in many countries is to appoint a supervisor who is then given responsibilities and duties. This may include monitoring the care given to the child, introducing participation activities to improve the socialization of the child, or ensuring that the child is attending school. 4.34 4.35 EXAMPLES Legal Effect of a Care Order Children Act 1989, s 33(1) (England) (1) Where a care order is made with respect to a child it shall be the duty of the local authority designated by the order to receive the child into their care and to keep [her or] him in their care while the order remains in force. (3) While a care order is in force with respect to a child, the local authority designated by the order shall\u2014 (a) have parental responsibility for the child; and (b) have the power (subject to the following provisions of this section) to determine the extent to which a parent or guardian of the child may meet his parental responsibility for [her or] him.

Family group conferencing originated New Zealand in the late 1980\u2019s in situations of neglect and abuse where the state was poised to remove a child from a family. FGC was a response to; i) the removal of Maori children by the state and their placement with \u2018cultural strangers\u2019 or in state institutions, ii) evidence that children have been, and continue to be, abused in the child welfare \u2018substitute\u2019 care system, and iii) evidence that it is better for children to remain in their families, including their extended families, rather than being taken into state care. FGC has subsequently been applied in New Zealand to youth justice (delinquency) cases. Since the development of FGC in New Zealand,53 it has been implemented in 17 countries including Canada,54 throughout Scandinavia,55 the United Kingdom,56 Ireland57 the USA58 and Australia.59 Procedure of Family Group Conferences A FGC is typically called prior to any care and protection court hearing by the social welfare services, the court or other person authorized by the legislation to request a conference. Although the New Zealand model does not offer such protection in no circumstances should a family group conference be convened if there is domestic violence, a suspicion of domestic violence or any likelihood of domestic violence occurring in the future. Once a conference is requested a chairperson is appointed by the registrar of the court (or other authorized person). Although this is not a feature of family group conferencing in New Zealand it is important that the chairperson receive specialized training to ensure they are skilled at facilitating family dynamics and to ensure they have an understanding of cultural or social traditions that may allow for men to dominate and are equipped with skills to prevent this and to ensure an equal and participatory forum. Family group conferences in New Zealand and in other countries where they have been adopted typically occur in four stages as follows. The first stage of the conference is the introduction, where the chairperson welcomes all participants and describes the course of action and the purpose of the conference. This is done in a manner that is consistent with the family\u2019s cultural and social tradition including a choice of language and the choice to include prayer and/or food.

The aim of this stage of the FGC is to arrive at agreement. The aim of the agreement is to determine i) whether the child is in need of care and protection, and if so ii) to formulate a plan that will address the care and protection of the child. Whilst in the New Zealand model the family is free to set their own procedures and conduct this part of the FGC as formally or informally as they wish, good practice requires that safeguards are introduced to ensure that discussion and negotiations proceed in a way that furthers the welfare and the best interests of the child and to ensure that participants have an equal ability to contribute. For a conference agreement to proceed to the court for consideration it is necessary that all participants agree. To ensure that agreement is full and free safeguards may be required to ensure that no pressure is exerted on any of the participants.60 For the fourth and final stage of the FGC, the professionals rejoin the family and the final plan is determined. The professionals help the family fine tune the plan in order to reach one that is acceptable to all participants. A number of participants, namely the parents, social workers, care and protection coordinator, and the child\u2019s lawyer are given veto power, which helps ensure that the participants involved in the FGC agree with the decision reached. Whilst in the New Zealand model a decision reached by the FGC is given legal effect this approach has not been adopted in Australia, where either the courts or the relevant government department must endorse any plans or recommendations before they can take effect.61 This approach represents a more desirable model of FGC and good practice requires that any agreement reached can only be given legal effect if the court considers the plan furthers the welfare and the best interests of the child. The court should be given authority to modify or remove any part of the plan which does not accord with the welfare and best interests of the child. Family Group Conferencing in the Cook Islands Context Collaborative rather than adversarial Family group conferences represent a collaborative, rather than an adversarial, approach to resolving a problem. The focus is on agreement rather than placing the parties in opposition to each other through the court system and to enable a solution to be reached without the stress of a long, expensive court proceeding.

However, as noted above it is important that the conference provides a forum in which all participants are able to participate equally and that protections are introduced to ensure that no participant dominates the proceedings and that the process and outcome is always centered around the best interests of the child, and not the interests of any of the participating family members as these may not always be the same. 62 Including extended family members A core principle of family group conferencing is that the \u2018family\u2019 consists of more than just the nuclear family. This principle is very relevant to the Cook Islands where extended families are often involved in all aspects of the parenting process. Additionally, FGC views child welfare as a responsibility shared by many entities including government agencies, communities and families. After nearly two decades in New Zealand, FGC is considered to be one of the \u201cplausible, realistic methods for merging the needs and interests of children and families and the protection concerns of public child welfare agencies, the courts, and the community.

FGC also takes the view that children are best cared for within their extended kin network and in situations of neglect or abuse extended families can create the sort of therapeutic conditions necessary for the rebuilding of damaged lives. It views families, no matter how imperfect, as important to a child\u2019s upbringing. By enabling the extended family to devise a plan for the care of the abused or neglected child, with the approval and oversight of the court, the family is placed at the centre of the welfare proceeding thereby building and repairing the family\u2019s ability to care for and protect the child. Welfare and best interests of child must be paramount The inclusion of family group conferences into the family law framework must ensure that the benefits of encouraging parents, other involved adults and the child to reach agreement do not compromise the best interests of the child. In the New Zealand model the actual decision-makers are the extended families. Conferences have the power to decide, if there is unanimous agreement, whether or not a child is in need of care and protection, as well as how this need can best be addressed. The intention of this process is to transfer the power and authority of decision-making for children into the hands of the people who have a life-long connection with them and who have to live with the outcome of the decisions made. However, if the plan formulated by the conference is not in accord with the principle of the best interests of the child then an important good practice protection is to compel the court to 4.42 4.43 4.44 S Holland & M Rivett, \u201cEveryone Started Shouting\u2019: Making Connections Between the Process of Family Group Conferences and Family Therapy Practice\u201d (2008) 38(1) British Journal of Social Work 21. 62 GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 65 modify or reject the plan and recommendations of the FGC so that it accords with the CRC principle of the paramount role of the welfare and the best interests of the child. Domestic Violence Although the New Zealand model does not prevent the convening of a family group conference in a situation of domestic violence, suspected domestic violence or potential domestic violence good practice requires that FGCs are prohibited in such circumstances. No victim of domestic violence, or person that is in fear of domestic violence either an adult or a child should be placed in a family group conference situation with an offender or a member of the offender\u2019s family. 63 Adoption of Children Purpose of adoption Adoption ends the legal status of a birth family or a parent and provides a new permanent home for a child replacing, in law, one family or parent with another. The adoptive parent or parents take on the legal attributes of parenthood and the child is treated by law as a member of the adoptive family or a child of the adoptive parent.64 Historically, adoption focused on adult needs. When first introduced in England it served the dual purpose of offering a discreet exit from stigma and economic hardship for unmarried mothers and, at the same time, met the needs of childless parents. Modern adoption law is, by contrast, in accord with Article 21 of the CRC a child focused process centred on a means of finding a family for a child rather than a child for a family, and recognizing the legal role and responsibilities of a new parent.65 Adoption typically falls within three scenarios. The first is when a person or couple adopts a child that is orphaned or given up for adoption by the birth mother (or parents). The second is when a step- parent adopts a child that she or he is parenting, and the third is when the state has care of a child and seeks a permanent parent or parents for the child. In the Cook Islands adoption is currently regulated by the Cook Islands Act 1915 providing separately and differently for \u2018Native adoption\u2019 and \u2018European adoption\u2019. These provisions were enacted in the context of early twentieth century colonisation and, in many aspects, require modernizing to meet international standards and obligations imposed by CEDAW and the CRC.

It can also be made by an individual unmarried person provided they are at least 30 years older than the child.67 This adoption regime requires modernization to meet the good practice standards in contemporary adoption law. The primary purpose of an adoption process is to place a child in a stable, secure and loving environment. Research suggests that this can be provided in a range of family forms including extended family forms such as grandparents, aunts and uncles, married and de facto couples, both opposite sex and same-sex, and by individuals.68 Good practice requires, therefore, that the emphasis in adoption law should be on what is in the child\u2019s best interests in light of the abilities and capabilities of the prospective adoptive parent or parents in accord with Article 21 of the CRC. Accordingly, the law should not limit who can apply to adopt but rather determine their suitability as adoptive parent[s] on the basis of criteria which focuses on their capacity to provide a stable and secure environment for the child and the best interests of the child, rather than other, often discriminatory criteria that has no bearing on the applicant\u2019s ability to parent a specific child. England introduced such a regime in 2002 enabling anyone over 21 to adopt, including same-sex and opposite sex couples who are \u2018living as partners in an enduring family relationship.\u201969 Such an approach prevents unfounded prejudices and discrimination against particular groups in the community (such as de facto couples and persons not in relationships) and is compliant with the anti-discrimination provisions in both CEDAW and the CRC. At the same time, the legislation prevents adoption by any person that has been convicted for specified offences such as child abuse. Who can be Adopted? The Cook Islands provides differently for indigenous Cook Islander adoption and European adoption. The Cook Islands Act 1915 states \u2018No person other than a Native or the descendent of a Native (whether legitimate or illegitimate) shall be capable of being adopted by a Native.\u201970 In relation to European adoption the Act states \u2018any child, whether Native or European, and whether legitimate or illegitimate, and whether domiciled in the Cook Islands or not, shall be capable of being adopted\u2019.71 Whilst the purpose of prohibiting indigenous Cook Islanders from adopting non-indigenous children was (and is) to prevent non indigenous Cook Islanders from obtaining succession rights to native land, these provisions are discriminatory. Modern adoption law usually enables any child under 18 to be adopted by all eligible persons in accord with good practice.

GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 69 Grounds for Determining Adoption Article 21 of the CRC obligates States parties to ensure that the principle of the best interests of the child is the paramount consideration in adoption determinations. In the Cook Islands the grounds for both European and Cook Islander adoption are that \u2018the applicant is a fit and proper person to have the care and custody of the child and of sufficient ability to maintain the child, and the adoption will not be contrary to the welfare and interests of the child.\u201976 Uniformly, the approach of modern adoption law is to incorporate the best interests of the child as the (or a) primary consideration and also that the person who is applying for the adoption is fit and proper and of sufficient ability to provide the day-to-day care for the child. However, a range of other criteria has also been included such as; the prospective parent[s] willingness to comply with religious beliefs of the parents (as in the example of New Zealand below), respecting the racial origin and cultural background of the child, the wishes of the child (as in the example of New Zealand below), the likely effect on the child of ceasing to be a member of the original family and becoming an adopted person, the likelihood of relationships with the original (including extended) family continuing and the value to the child of the continuation of such relationships. EXAMPLES (1) Consent to a child\u2019s adoption is not effective unless it is: (a) informed consent, and (b) given in accordance with this Act. (2) Consent given by a person (other than a child under 18 years of age) is not effective if it appears to the Court that: (a) it was not given in accordance with this Act, or (b) it was obtained by fraud, duress or other improper means, or (c) the instrument of consent has been altered in a material particular without authority, or (d) the person giving or purporting to give the consent was not, at the time the instrument of consent was signed, in a fit condition to give the consent. (3) Consent is not effective if it is revoked during the time allowed by section 73. (4) Consent given by a birth parent who is less than 18 years of age is not effective if it appears to the Court that the birth parent did not have the benefit of independent legal advice concerning the adoption before the instrument of consent was signed by the birth parent.

This can become an important consideration in relation to the temporary and permanent removal of indigenous children from their families and/or communities, and in the case of adoption. The best option is to place indigenous children in a culturally similar home, but where this is not possible, alternative caregivers should encourage children to continue to practice their own culture and to be educated in their own culture and language. However, this should not amount to a specific prohibition on the adoption of indigenous children by non-indigenous individuals. C169 Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989.

Grounds for Determining Adoption Adoption Act 1955, s 35(1) (New Zealand) 4.54 The Legal Effects of Adoption Adoption fundamentally affects the legal status of the child. The adoptive parent[s] gain parental responsibility for the child including the obligation to provide day-to-day care for the child and to make decisions regarding the education, medical care and upbringing of the child. In the situation where a step-parent adopts the child the adoptive parent gains the responsibility of sharing the day-to- day care and decision making in relation to the child. The child\u2019s natural parent(s) gives up her or his (or their) parental rights and responsibilities in respect of the child (unless there is an agreement between the birth parents and the adoptive parents as part of an open adoption process as described below in 4.57). 4.55 GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 71 NZ Law Reform Commission, Adoption and its Alternatives: A Different Approach and a New Framework, 2000 at 67. See Adoption and its Alternatives note 40 at 33. C Smith & J Logan, After Adoption: Direct Contact and Relationships (New York: Routledge, 2004) at 33. 79 80 81 All legal agreements such as child support orders or residence and contact orders are terminated. Additionally, legal relationships with the child\u2019s previous wider family are severed and the child no longer has rights in relation to inheritance or citizenship in respect of her or his former family. This does not mean that emotional relationships with the child\u2019s former family need also be ended. In an open adoption regime as described below in 4.41 the parties can agree that such relationships can continue. The adoption process has been historically kept closed and secret. Research has indicated however that the secrecy of closed regimes of adoption have caused both serious psychological trauma including feelings of rejection, confusion, or of being unwanted to some adopted children, and in some instances, lifetime bereavement to the birth family.79 Experts have recommended therefore a more open and inclusive system of adoption as appropriate in the modern context, particularly in communities (such as the Cook Islands) where kinship networks are broad and enduring.80 It is also consistent with the CRC which provides the child with the right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis, except if it is contrary to the child\u2019s best interests. An \u2018open\u2019 adoption process enables the child, in some circumstances, to maintain ongoing contact with her or his birth parents. The goal of an open adoption process is to ensure that the child feels as psychologically secure as possible and lessen any sense of loss she or he might experience. Research suggests that whether contact is direct or indirect by way of an annual report or photograph it is potentially important for the child\u2019s sense of identity and knowledge of family background.81 Additionally, it provides a means for a child\u2019s cultural heritage and ethnicity to be furthered. Further, there is no secrecy about where the child comes from or who their birth family is. Open adoptions are not shared parenting arrangements as both birth and adoptive parent/s have their own separate and distinctive roles. Whilst open adoption is favored it has not yet been incorporated into many adoption law regimes. New South Wales (Australia) however, as illustrated in the example below, has adopted an \u2018open adoption\u2019 procedure whereby birth parents and adopting parents can formulate a plan that details post adoption contact. Contact may range from regular meetings between the birth parents and adoptive family, to intermittent ongoing contact. 4.56 GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 72 EXAMPLES (1) An \u201cadoption plan\u201d is a plan agreed to by", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c9b4cf03-ac23-434d-8318-cee4b20beb30": {"__data__": {"id_": "c9b4cf03-ac23-434d-8318-cee4b20beb30", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing the Implementation of CEDAW in the Cook Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1675620ccaa07d62cb7f717feed83780ae8d1c6086a6c1bdf2f6ee05dc3618c5"}}, "hash": "1675620ccaa07d62cb7f717feed83780ae8d1c6086a6c1bdf2f6ee05dc3618c5", "text": "two or more of the parties to the adoption of a child that includes provisions relating to: the making of arrangements for the exchange of information between the parties in relation to any one or more of the following: (i) the child\u2019s medical background or condition, (ii) the child\u2019s development and important events in the child\u2019s life, (iii) the means and nature of contact between the parties and the child, and any other matter relating to the adoption of the child.

GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 74 Chapter 5 CHILD AND SPOUSAL SUPPORT Introduction This chapter considers law reform issues relating to child and spousal support. In this chapter support refers to the requirement of one person to provide financial support for a spouse or a child in the form of a lump sum, periodic monetary payment, the transfer of valuable goods (such as crops, livestock and other food resources) or the provision of services. Child and spousal support is governed in the Cook Islands by the Cook Islands Act 1915 and requires modernization to meet good standard practices and to comply with CEDAW and the CRC. Reform in this area would best be achieved through the repeal of any applicable provisions in that Act and incorporation of the area into the new Family Law Bill. This chapter identifies and discusses a range of issues relating to spousal and child support in the Cook Islands which are currently non-compliant with CEDAW. First, access to spousal support is currently limited by the Cook Islands Act 1915 to married persons. However, the CEDAW Committee has stated that those in de facto unions should have the same protections as if they were married. International obligations suggest that same-sex unions should also be provided with the same protections as marriage. Reform in this area should reflect changes in the form of family units, which include cohabitation between couples in intimate relationships whether opposite-sex or same-sex. Second, a right to spousal support and the determination of the appropriate amount of support is currently determined in the Cook Islands on the basis of what the court thinks \u2018fit\u2019 and \u2018reasonable\u2019. However, contemporary good practice in family law is to provide a checklist of statutory factors that ensure the discriminatory effects that marriage and relationships can have on the financial situation and earning capacity of one partner are taken into account in the determination of the support award. Third, the Cook Islands currently does not require a biological father to contribute to child-bearing costs however this is contrary to Article 16(1)(d) of CEDAW which states that both parents are equally responsible for a child. Fourth, in relation to child support, the Cook Islands limits child support applications to biological parents. Article 27(4) of the CRC and good practice in contemporary law enables anyone caring for a child to apply for child support from either or both biological parents and social parents in certain circumstances. A child support order is awarded in the Cook Islands on the basis of reasonableness. However, instead of relying on \u201creasonableness\u201d, a good practice approach includes a statutory checklist of factors to ensure that the needs of the child are paramount. Finally, parentage testing is important for the determination of liability for child support and child-bearing expenses.

However, this formal equality approach to spousal support often resulted in discrimination against women because it did not take into account systemic discrimination against women which results in women being unequally positioned financially after a marriage or a relationship breakdown. Many families organize their lives during marriage and de facto relationships on the basis of continuing reciprocity. In other words, one spouse, typically the woman, forgoes employment opportunities or advancements to focus on and further the welfare of the family, whilst the other spouse, typically the man, works, for financial gain. The result is that one party to the relationship, typically the woman, is at a huge financial disadvantage after separation and often for many years thereafter (in terms of future employment opportunities and related earning potential).82 Provision for spousal support taking into account systemic discrimination is therefore an important component of modern family law and, additionally, satisfies CEDAW legislative compliance indicators 16.10 and 16.17.83 The Definition of a Spouse The Cook Islands Act 1915 limits the definition of spouse, and therefore who is entitled to spousal support, to married couples only. It provides that a maintenance order can be made against a husband in favor of his wife upon separation and upon the dissolution of marriage as long as she remains unmarried. Upon separation, but not divorce, the court can make an order against a married woman in favor of her husband. The Cook Islands legislation reflects a historical view that was and is still also found in many common law countries that, first, a marriage is the only relationship that should give rise to an obligation to pay spousal support and, second, that only a wife was entitled to receive support from a husband upon divorce. This position has been reversed in recent times by many countries, both in response to the demographic reality that many people are choosing to live in de facto relationships, including same-sex relationship,84 and in addition, because international obligations have increasingly M Gray & B Chapman, \u201cRelationship Breakdown and the Economic Welfare of Australian Mothers and Their Children\u201d (2007) 10(4) Australian Journal of Labour Economics 253; T Oldham, \u201cChanges in the Economic Consequences of Divorces, 1958-2008 ](2008) 42(3) Family Law Quarterly 419.

The recognition of de facto relationships for the purpose of spousal support requires a definition in the law of what constitutes a de facto relationship. Two different approaches have been taken in contemporary family law to establishing the existence of a de facto relationship. The first is to identify a time period (which is usually 2 years) during which the parties must have lived together continuously. The second approach, as illustrated in the example of Scotland below, is to provide a range of factors, which typically include duration (but do not specify how long the relationship has to have lasted), for the court to use in determining whether a de facto relationship existed. Other factors usually included are the nature of the relationship during that period and the nature and extent of joint financial arrangements during that period.

However, the Cook Islands Act 1915 provides for spousal support to be awarded upon separation only if the court is satisfied that the husband has \u2018failed or intends to fail to provide his wife with adequate maintenance\u2019. However, if the husband does not have \u2018sufficient ability to contribute\u2019 no order can be made unless the wife is destitute. Upon divorce the court can award spousal support \u2018if it thinks fit\u2019. In both instances the amount is determined on the basis of reasonableness. The inclusion of a list of factors in the law to be used in determining when spousal support must be paid, and in what amounts, ensures that courts take into account the discriminatory effects that marriage and relationships can have upon the earning capacity of one partner (usually the female partner). This is especially important if there are children and one party has forgone or reduced education and/or paid employment to provide domestic and child care for the family. Additionally, after divorce one party (usually the woman) will retain the custody and day-to-day care of children, further disadvantaging them in relation to their current and future ability to earn.87 The failure to award any or adequate spousal support after separation and divorce is discriminatory because, as the CEDAW Committee states in General Recommendation 21(21), \u2018the responsibilities that women have in bearing and raising children affect M McKeever and N Wolfinger, \u201cReexamining the Costs of Marital Disruption\u201d (2001) 82 Social Science Quarterly 2002 at 215; P Erera, Family Diversity: Continuity and Change in the Contemporary Family (Oxford: Sage, 2002) at 104 5.10 5.11 87 EXAMPLES \u201cCohabitant\u201d means either member of a couple consisting of a man and a woman who are (or were) living together as if they were husband and wife; or two persons of the same sex who are (or were) living together as if they were civil partners.

At the same time, it also recognizes the reduced earning power of many mothers and the costs that women bear in the raising of children.90 The provisions should however be gender-neutral to recognize that in some instances a father may be providing the day-to-day care of the child and needs to seek support from the mother. The inclusion of child support provisions based on the needs of the child represents compliance with CEDAW legislative indicator 16.16 & 16.24.91 There are two main approaches in contemporary family law to child support. The first, adopted in many developed common law countries including New Zealand, England and Australia, is the establishment state-run child support schemes which assess and collect moneys through automatic payment systems. This approach, which has proven effective, requires state commitment to its administration and the related costs. The second is to adopt the same procedures utilized to determine spousal support with an application procedure for a child support order. State-Run Child Support Schemes In many jurisdictions including New Zealand, Australia and England a poor record in payment of child support (usually by fathers) has resulted in the establishment of registration schemes and the collection of monies through state-run automatic payment systems. Such schemes rely on a state funded administration unit that receives applications from parents or carers. A statutory formula is applied to assess the amount required to be paid. The formula is typically based on a percentage of the liable person\u2019s income after a deduction has been made for their own basic living expenses.

The Cook Islands Act 1915 provides for the issuance of a child maintenance order against the mother or the father of a child. The question of whether and to what extent step-parents should also be liable is controversial for some. However, most contemporary family law provides that if a parental relationship has been formed, then support obligations should follow. The rationale that underscores this position is that the step-parent has voluntarily assumed that role and it is not in the best interests of children that he or she be permitted to abandon it because the marriage or relationship has ended. 93 whether born within a marriage or outside. Good practice family law simply requires the child to be under 19 and not financially independent. Eligible Applicants The Cook Islands Act 1915 does not explicitly state who may apply for a child support order but the language implies that it is limited to a mother or a father. In contemporary society the wider range of family forms and situations where care for children is provided is now reflected in good practice which requires that anyone with the responsibility of caring for a child should be legally able to apply for child support. The Fiji Family Law Act 2003 in a good practice example provides that a parent, anyone with a residence order or any other person concerned with the care, welfare or development of the child can apply for a support order.92 Additionally, although a child support order might ordinarily end when a child reaches 18 years of age, good practice requires, as illustrated in the example of Fiji below, provision for orders for the financial provision and maintenance of children who are over 18 but are still in full-time education, or are mentally or physically handicapped and therefore require longer-term support. 5.17 5.18 C Rogerson, \u201cThe Child Support Obligations of Step-Parents\u201d (2001) 18 Canadian Journal of Family Law 9. 93 EXAMPLES A court must not make a child maintenance order in relation to a child who is aged 18 or over unless the court is satisfied that the provision of the maintenance is necessary (a) to enable the child to complete his or her education; or (b) because of a mental or physical disability of the child.

Form of Support The Cook Island Act 1915 provides only for periodic payments of money for both spousal and child support orders.94 Contemporary family law legislation has moved towards more flexible approaches to the payment of support orders including lump sum payments, the provision of goods such as crops and livestock (which could be appropriate in the goods based \u2013 rather than cash based - economy of parts of the Cook Islands), the provision of services, and the transfer or usage of property or assets. Generally, periodic payments are preferred over a lump sum since this allows for a more accurate calculation of the needs of the recipient. Enforcement of Support Orders A system of enforcement is crucial to ensure that spousal and child support payments are made. Enforcement mechanisms that can be employed include utilizing the tax system (New Zealand), ordering the employer (if the liable partner is working) to deduct a certain amount from her or his salary to meet the support payments, garnisheeing accounts, forcing the sale of assets or property, fines and imprisonment. An absconding debtor order could also be introduced which can prevent a person who has support obligations from leaving the country. Determination of Parentage Reasons for Parentage Determination The law must specify who can apply to determine the biological parent(s) of a child and for what reasons, testing can be ordered. The determination of parentage, typically paternity, is important Checklist Factors for Child Support Orders The need to provide suitable accommodation for the child. The age and health of the child including any special needs of the child. The educational or training needs of the child The financial circumstances of the child. The availability and cost of suitable child-care facilities or services. The needs and resources of the parties The commitments of the parties to support any other child or person. 5.20 5.21 5.22 Cook Islands Act 1915, s 564(1). 94 GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 86 for the determination of child support and child- bearing expenses. Other reasons for seeking parentage tests include allocation of parental responsibilities, amendment of birth certificates, inheritance, immigration applications, identification of human remains, civil proceeding for adoption, medical reasons, to ensure ties and inclusion within extended families and communities, and personal interest. Uncertainty about who the father is might arise if a biological mother does not know who the biological father is, or does not want to reveal who the father is (which may occur for many reasons, including if the pregnancy is a result of a rape, or if the identity of the father will result in problems for the mother or the child within the family or community), or if a prospective biological father either does not acknowledge paternity or wishes to establish paternity.

The Cook Islands Act 1915 limits applications for paternity to \u2018an unmarried woman who is the mother of an illegitimate child or who is with child.\u2019 96 The purpose of the application is solely for child support. In the contemporary context the three parties most likely to request a parentage order are mothers, prospective or presumed biological fathers, and children. Modern family law typically provides for application by those three parties and any other party if they have \u201ca proper interest in the result\u201d. Other parties might include grandparents or other relatives, social workers, government agencies, trustees and executors. However, there must be protections in place to ensure that parentage tests cannot be applied for in any circumstances. Such protections are to ensure that identifying a parent (particularly the father) is not used for discriminatory or improper purposes (i.e. to try to force a marriage of the mother and father). Determining Parentage The Cook Islands Act 1915 provides the High Court with the authority to make a determination of paternity however no formula for that determination is provided. Further, no application can be made if the child is 12 or over. If the child is 6 or older, no application can be made unless the prospective father has contributed to child support during that six years, or cohabited with the mother in a de facto relationship, in which case any application must be within two years of either the financial contribution or the cohabitation. Such limitations are inappropriate and do not accord with good practice. In modern family law presumptions of paternity are typically made in certain circumstances. These include if the father is the husband or de facto partner of the mother at the time of the birth, or at the time of conception, or if the father\u2019s name is registered on the birth certificate. In the absence of a presumption, paternity is typically based on evidentiary submissions. In the Cook Islands other presumptions that could be included are whether the father bought items for the baby, visited the mother in hospital or any other kind of traditional acknowledgement of the child. 5.23 5.24 5.25 See Translating CEDAW into Law note 44 at 42.

In addition, it implies that a woman\u2019s word is inherently worth less than that of the prospective or presumed father, even though there is no evidence that mothers should be viewed as a particularly unreliable class of witness. The Cook Islands Act 1915 provides that whilst the evidence of the mother is not necessary for the making of a paternity order, no order can be made upon the evidence of a pregnant woman unless it is corroborated.98 Good practice requires a legislative statement that corroboration is not required, as demonstrated in the example of New Zealand below. 5.26 A Didick & F Kaganas, Family Law, Gender and the State: Text, Cases and Materials (London: Hart Publishing, 2006) at 155.

Such an approach has been adopted in Fiji as illustrated in the example below (adopted from the Family Law Act, 1975 Australia). The New Zealand Law Reform Commission has recommended that mandatory orders should be incorporated but with the threshold requirement that the court must consider whether there is a \u2018reasonable possibility that a person recognized as a parent is not the genetic parent or that a person not recognized as a parent is the genetic parent\u2019. If this threshold is satisfied, the next consideration focuses on \u2018why it would not be in the interests of justice, including the best interests of the child\u2019 to issue an order for DNA testing.99 The rationale that underscores this approach is that it is in the best interests of the child, her and his parents and the general public that parentage determinations are made on the basis of accurate DNA parentage testing.

There are two good practice approaches to law reform in the area of domestic violence. The first is to amend and repeal existing civil and criminal law to incorporate domestic violence and the second is the enactment of a separate Domestic Violence Bill. Either approach can be used to advance legislative compliance with CEDAW. Whilst the enactment of a separate Domestic Violence Bill has the potential to incorporate both civil and criminal provisions the Cook Islands has elected to incorporate civil domestic violence provisions into the Family Law Bill and, in a parallel process, to separately pursue law reform in the criminal law. This chapter does not therefore consider domestic violence offences in the criminal law. In particular, this chapter focuses on the establishment of a good practice legal framework for protection orders. The importance of a strong, effective and comprehensive legal response to domestic violence has been recognized worldwide as public recognition of domestic violence as a social problem has increased.100 Further, a burgeoning body of research about the broad nature, dynamics, effects and costs of domestic violence has emerged.101 Domestic violence can be differentiated from generic violence (where there is no pre-existing relationship between the parties) by the existence of a relationship characterized by intimacy, familial ties or a shared household. It is this bond that renders domestic violence particularly serious because it exacerbates the impact of the violence and complicates the legal measures required, since victims need protection in the (often hidden) privacy of their homes and from someone with whom they share(d) an intimate or familial relationship.102 In Pacific Island countries, including the Cook Islands, domestic violence has been increasingly recognized as a growing and substantial problem, which impacts on the physical and mental health of victims and also upon families and communities.103 Violence against women, children, elderly and persons with intellectual and physical disabilities within domestic relationships is a fundamental violation of human rights. The CEDAW Committee has stated: \u201cFamily violence is one of the most insidious forms of violence against women. It is prevalent in all societies.

Lack of economic independence forces many women to stay in violent relationships. \u2026 The effect of such violence on the physical and mental integrity of women is to deprive them [of] the equal enjoyment, exercise and knowledge of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\u201d104 A number of international human rights instruments, to which the Cook Islands is a party, require states parties to take effective measures to prevent and eradicate such violence.105 The former UN Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women has stated that in order to meet such obligations states parties should introduce targeted domestic violence legislation \u2018rather than making marginal amendments to existing penal and civil laws\u2019.106 A recent global trend towards the introduction of targeted domestic violence legislation, both civil and criminal, marks how seriously the world community views domestic violence. This publication does not consider good practice in domestic violence criminal law provisions as it is beyond the scope of the proposed civil Family Law Bill in the Cook Islands. A civil Family Law Bill does not however remove the need for a strong framework of criminal law domestic violence offences as it is important to incorporate both civil and criminal laws dealing with domestic violence as they serve different but complementary purposes.107 The criminal law focuses primarily on determining the innocence or guilt of those accused of domestic violence, and the administering of appropriate punishment of offenders within the criminal law system, and in the modern context, the rehabilitation of the offender where possible. Criminal offences send a message to all members of society that domestic violence is a crime and unacceptable.108 The complementary aims of civil law domestic violence provisions are, broadly, to prevent domestic violence, to ensure the safety of all persons who experience domestic violence, to provide victims with effective and accessible remedies, and to promote non-violence as a fundamental social value. Specifically, civil law initiatives focus on the protection of persons \u2018exposed or potentially exposed to violence in a domestic setting\u2019109 with the establishment of various orders that prohibit the offender from any further acts of domestic violence and/or to enable victims to remain in the family home from which the offender is excluded. In the Oceanic region New Zealand and all Australian states have targeted civil laws providing a range of protection orders for victims of domestic violence.

The Cook Islands in 1994 introduced both occupation orders and non-molestation (protection) orders.111 However, these orders provide protection to a limited range of persons, from a limited range of behaviours, in a limited range of circumstances and do not meet international good practice standards. Therefore, this chapter identifies and considers a range of good practice approaches to the following key components of a fully CEDAW compliant civil law response to domestic violence. First, an appropriate and comprehensive definition of domestic violence must be developed, one that draws on a range of good practice examples which encompass physical violence, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, intimidation, harassment, stalking, economic deprivation, property damage, animal abuse or threats of any of the above. Second, a good practice domestic violence civil law should provide protection to any person who experiences or is at risk of experiencing domestic violence. Third, a system of protection orders, emergency protection orders and occupation orders, with an extensive range of potential conditions should be established. Fourth and fifth, there must be an obligation on the police and other state actors to apply for and enforce orders and a comprehensive mechanism for the enforcement of orders. Finally, domestic violence law should enable the provision of compensation to victims of domestic violence. This can be incorporated into the civil or the criminal law or both. The Definition of an Act of Domestic Violence Domestic violence occurs in many forms, including physical violence, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, intimidation, harassment, stalking, economic deprivation, property damage, animal abuse (particularly of domestic pets as this is intended to scare or hurt the person(s) who care for them), or threats of any of the above and it is important that domestic violence legislation contains a definition that reflects its breadth and complexity. The Cook Islands Amendment Act 1994, which enables the court to issue occupation orders and non- molestation (protection) orders, does not contain a definition of domestic violence. A comprehensive definition of domestic violence which clearly articulates the range of behaviors which can give rise to an act of domestic violence is, however, an essential component of good practice domestic violence law. The former Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women has urged the adoption of the \u2018broadest possible definitions of acts of violence\u2019 in domestic violence legislation.112 The same comprehensive definition of domestic violence should be reflected in both civil and criminal domestic violence laws. 6.6 6.7 GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 93 It is important that both physical and non-physical forms of abuse are explicitly recognized and identified in the legislation. Non-physical forms of domestic violence are often not perceived by the community as \u2018real\u2019 violence, despite research consistently showing they may be the cause of severe and ongoing harm.113 Contemporary good practice domestic violence legislation uniformly contains comprehensive definitions of domestic violence and the differences between the models largely lie in the range of factors which they include within their definition of domestic violence, and the fullness of the definitions of the different factors. A fuller definition has the advantage of clearly articulating the range of behaviors which the legislation contemplates as falling within the scope of domestic violence. Good Practice Definition (New Zealand) The example of New Zealand below provides a good practice \u2018starting point\u2019 for the region although, as discussed in the subsections below, other jurisdictions have included additional factors within the definition of domestic violence, which should also be considered for inclusion. The New Zealand example is notable for its inclusion of non- physical abuse and additionally, the unique and important inclusion of a person causing a child to witness domestic violence. This is an important recognition that, even if a child has not been the specific target of violence, indirect exposure to domestic violence is so harmful that it may constitute a form of child", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "06fb1e36-237d-4164-9548-a58f0481a28f": {"__data__": {"id_": "06fb1e36-237d-4164-9548-a58f0481a28f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing the Implementation of CEDAW in the Cook Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a04ad1720ccfdf03400e754a61ab0fc9fce96cedb63c6d0c6cb64ad4f641f151"}, "3": {"node_id": "fd633160-14ff-4230-8e02-b0416c0da5e2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2301171bca57a63e767c614640011225dc059d13556a2ca2ae2d8330ef1f1038"}}, "hash": "9aa029cff05a2e108de951906e58128bc41fc91e6542367291f0e1d57979be57", "text": "abuse in its own right.114 Factors not included in the New Zealand definition and discussed below, that should be considered for inclusion are economic abuse, animal abuse, and the inclusion of a discretionary category to encompass any other behavior that results in the apprehension of fear in the protected person.

Economic abuse is the unequal control of money or finances in a relationship or domestic situation and can manifest in different ways. It may involve one person having complete control of money and income, preventing family members from accessing their own money or bank accounts, paying bills or buying necessities, having unrealistic expectations of spending patterns and budgeting, controlling how other family members spend their income forcefully taking money from family members or threatening family members for money. 6.10 EXAMPLES (2) In this section, domestic violence means (a) Physical abuse: (b) Sexual abuse: (c) Psychological abuse, including, but not limited to - (i) Intimidation: (ii) Harassment: (iii) Damage to property: (iv) Threats of physical abuse, sexual abuse, or psychological abuse: (v) In relation to a child, abuse of the kind set out in subsection (3) of this section.

Thus, the killing or injuring of favorite pets or threats of animal abuse should be incorporated as a form of domestic violence in the legislation since without explicit inclusion the court is unlikely to recognize such behavior. Discretionary open-ended factor The definition of domestic violence should be non- exhaustive to ensure that behaviors not included in the specific list which cause \u2018apprehension\u2019 or \u2018fear\u2019 can be included on a case by case basis at the discretion of the court. Thus for example in the Australian state of South Australia, domestic violence includes any \u2018other conduct, so as to reasonably arouse in a family member apprehension or fear of personal injury or damage to property or any significant apprehension or fear\u2019.116 The Inclusion of Comprehensive Definitions of Factors Physical and Sexual Abuse A comprehensive definition of what constitutes physical and sexual abuse provides clear direction to the court in their determination of whether an act of domestic violence has occurred. In particular, the inclusion of \u2018forcibly detaining the protected person or withholding the necessities of life\u2019 as in the example of Namibia below may encompass situations where money to buy food or medical treatment is withheld or where the victim is prevented from having friends or to talking to or being with others. 6.12 6.13 EXAMPLE An act of domestic violence is causing or threatening to cause the death of, or injury to, an animal, even if the animal is not the protected person\u2019s property Animal Abuse Model Domestic Violence Laws 1999, s 3(1)(c). 116 Domestic Violence Act 1994, s 4(vi).

Domestic violence can occur in many contexts and between persons in an array of personal relationships where there are power imbalances and it is important that the range of persons protected by the legislation includes anyone who experiences or is at risk of experiencing domestic violence. The Cook Islands currently limits access to occupation orders to married persons which does not meet international standards which require that protection be afforded to all persons at risk. The legislation does however extend non-molestation (protection) orders to de facto (opposite sex) couples and gives the court the discretion to issue an order for the protection of any \u2018other person\u2019.

The term relative can be defined prescriptively with a list of those who come within the category or alternately it can be more broadly defined to encompass extended or \u2018non-traditional\u2019 family groupings. Whether prescriptive or broadly defined contemporary family law legislation has typically left some discretion for the judge to encompass extended family relationships. Example A Domestic and Family Violence Protection Act 1989, s 12B (Queensland) A relative includes \u2018someone reasonable to regard as a relative Example B Domestic Violence Act, 1998, s 1(vii)(f) (South Africa) They are family members related by consanguinity, affinity or adoption.

Possible Protected Persons Commentary and Good Practice Examples Definition of Protection Orders Protection orders (including emergency orders and occupation orders) are a civil remedy typically issued by a court, the police or other authorized person to prevent a person from making contact, harming or harassing another person or alternately to enable a victim of domestic violence to remain in the family home. The CEDAW Committee states in General Recommendation 19(24)(r) that civil remedies in cases of domestic violence are required to overcome family violence and in particular has called upon States parties to ensure that victims of domestic violence have immediate means of protection by way of protection orders issued by courts and/or the police.119 It has additionally stated that the availability of protection orders is an \u2018essential component of a comprehensive legal framework designed to protect women in situations of domestic or sexual violence\u2019 and that a failure to provide for protection orders \u2018amounted to discrimination under Article 1 of the Convention.\u2019120 Types of Protection Orders 1. Protection Order Who can Apply for an Order? Protection orders should be easily accessible to anyone at risk of domestic violence. The range of persons who can apply for a protection order in contemporary domestic violence legislation typically includes an adult protected person (as defined in the legislation), a child protected person who is a mature minor over 14 (who understands the nature and the consequences of the proceedings) a parent of a child that is a protected person, any person with a residence order in relation to a protected child, or any person if a child is in immediate danger. In some circumstances it may be difficult for a protected person to apply for an order and therefore a good practice approach is 6.18 6.19 GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 105 to enable applications to be made by \u2018any other person on behalf of the aggrieved person\u2019.121 Some jurisdictions have authorized applications to be made without the consent of the protected person including police officers or a person appointed by the court. The rationale for this is similar to that of \u2018no drop\u2019 criminal law procedures that require, for many reasons, including power imbalances, that if there is evidence of domestic violence, the police must proceed with criminal charges even if the victim (usually a woman) does not request that charges be laid or even if the victim requests that charges be dropped. For some, however, this is controversial on the basis that it denies the autonomy of the protected person to decide for herself if she wants an order.122 The example of Namibia below reflects this approach allowing authorised others to apply for an order only with the consent of the protected person except in exceptional circumstances.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2662ee0b-bdc6-45ae-84d0-7397a331a305": {"__data__": {"id_": "2662ee0b-bdc6-45ae-84d0-7397a331a305", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing the Implementation of CEDAW in the Cook Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dae0880d9ea31cb5c7b5a011ddc6921267b2062ee54d2ab12e411bc1c61bf88d"}, "2": {"node_id": "869a811d-9678-41b7-a5c1-6cb3370989f2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fb86f50e8fa37532e0c6a48844f1085ac4fa158840ff358479ddcdc35eed418c"}}, "hash": "cad1d836c02d6e07c19191b5d003a0244534adf90d15c0791c40bbb1754a82e2", "text": "Who can Issue an Order?

GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 106 The Criteria for Issuing an Order Protection orders should be available in all situations where there is a risk of domestic violence and not just after an act of domestic violence has occurred. The Cook Islands Amendment Act 1994 recognizes this in part by not requiring an act of violence to have occurred and instead enables the court to issue a non-molestation order if the court is satisfied it is \u2018necessary for the protection\u2019 of the applicant. A good practice approach is to simply require that the victim (or an authorized other) has a reasonable apprehension of an act of domestic violence. An alternate approach is require that the victim has an actual fear of an act of domestic violence (whether \u2018reasonable\u2019 or not) so as a person living in fear, and who may be very aware of the signs of impending danger of domestic violence, should not have to meet any standard of reasonableness before being afforded protection.123 Another, but somewhat weaker approach, as in the examples of India and Tasmania, Australia and Vanuatu below is to require that an act of domestic violence is \u2018likely\u2019 to occur. 6.21 123 Partnerships against Domestic Violence, Model Domestic Violence Laws, Canberra, 1999 at 63.

There are two approaches in contemporary family laws that determine the conditions of an order. The first approach is to leave it to the discretion of the court to make the order entirely based on the circumstances of the case. However, typically the law includes a list of \u2018directions, restrictions and prohibitions\u2019 that can be imposed as illustrated in the example of South Africa below. The second approach is to impose mandatory conditions for every protection order with discretion for the judge to attach extra conditions based on the circumstances of each individual case. If there are mandatory conditions these should correspond to the definition of an act of domestic violence that is included in the legislation. The advantage of a mandatory approach is that important protections, such as illustrated in the example of New Zealand, below, are not left to the judge\u2019s discretion. 6.22 EXAMPLE (1) The court may prohibit the respondent from committing (a) any act of domestic violence; (b) enlisting the help of another person to commit any such act; (c) entering a residence shared by the complainant and the respondent: (d) entering a specified part of such a shared residence; (e) entering the complainant\u2019s residence; (f) entering the complainant\u2019s place of employment; (g) preventing the complainant who ordinarily lives or lived in a shared residence as contemplated in subparagraph (c) from entering or remaining in the shared residence or a specified part of the shared residence; or (h) committing any other act as specified in the protection order. (2) The court may impose any additional conditions which it deems reasonably necessary to protect and provide for the safety, health or wellbeing of the complainant.

Emergency Protection Order An emergency (or interim) protection order is a protection order that is immediately and easily available. It is essential that domestic violence victims be provided with access to protection orders when they do not have immediate access to a court. This is particularly crucial given that domestic violence often occurs after 5pm during the week and on weekends. Additionally in specific areas (i.e. remote outer islands) where there are no courts it is important that there are trained magistrates or Justices of the Peace, or other persons who can be nominated as authorized to issue emergency orders. If a domestic violence victim seeks protection from the legal system during a crisis outside of standard court hours, the system must be able to respond and EXAMPLES (1) It is a condition of every protection order that the respondent must not\u2014 (a) Physically or sexually abuse the protected person; or (b) Threaten to physically or sexually abuse the protected person; or (c) Damage, or threaten to damage, property of the protected person; or (d) Engage, or threaten to engage, in other behaviour, including intimidation or harassment, which amounts to psychological abuse of the protected person; or (e) Encourage any person to engage in behaviour against a protected person, where the behaviour, if engaged in by the respondent, would be prohibited by the order. (2) It is a condition of every protection order that at any time other than when the protected person and the respondent are, with the express consent of the protected person, living in the same dwelling house, the respondent must not,\u2014 (a) Watch, loiter near, or prevent or hinder access to or from, the protected person\u2019s place of residence, business, employment, educational institution, or any other place that the protected person visits often; or (b) Follow the protected person about or stop or accost the protected person in any place; or (c) Without the protected person\u2019s express consent, enter or remain on any land or building occupied by the protected person; or (d) Where the protected person is present on any land or building, enter or remain on that land or building circumstances that constitute a trespass; or (e) Make any other contact with the protected person (whether by telephone, correspondence, or otherwise).

Authorized Persons Family Protection Act 2008, s7 (Vanuatu) Typically an emergency protection order is issued for a short period of time pending a court hearing for a protection order. The length of time stipulated should depend on the expected waiting time for the court hearing and should not expire before the hearing.

Requiring the violent party to leave the home (including before the violence has taken place) reinforces the message that violence is wrong and that perpetrators of domestic violence will be held accountable in a range of ways. The inclusion of an occupation order represents compliance with CEDAW legislative compliance indicator 16.11.125 There are two approaches to the provision of occupation orders in contemporary family law legislation. The first approach is to make this a possible condition of an emergency protection order or a protection order, as illustrated in the example of Nova Scotia below. In some jurisdictions when a court is making a protection order or an emergency protection order it is mandatory to consider whether the respondent should be excluded from the home. If a court decides that it is appropriate to so exclude an (adult) respondent, and the protected person does not oppose this then the court must do so.126 The second approach is to have a separate and distinct order as illustrated in the example of India below. The advantage of a separate order is that it enables a protected person to apply for an occupation order and not a protection order which might be all that is required in certain circumstances. EXAMPLES An emergency protection order may do any or all of the following : (a) grant the victim or other family members exclusive occupation of the victim\u2019s residence for a defined period regardless of any legal rights of possession or ownership; (b) direct a peace officer to remove the respondent from the victim\u2019s residence immediately or within a specified time; (c) direct a peace officer to accompany a specified person, within a specified time, to the victim\u2019s residence to supervise the removal of personal belongings.

The advantage of a statutory list of factors is that it focuses the attention of the court on what an occupation order will achieve in terms of the safety and best interests of the parties. 6.25 GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 113 Ancillary Orders that Facilitate Access to Personal Property Access to personal property may be a significant issue for all parties when an occupation order is in force. The party that is excluded from the home will need access to their personal effects in order to take up residence elsewhere. In practice, orders allowing a respondent to return to the premises from which they are excluded to collect their belongings may need to be tightly controlled in order to ensure that protected person(s) are not put at risk of further intimidation or any other forms of violence. Equally, if an occupation order enables a protected person and/or any children to remain in the home, it may be necessary to prevent the excluded party from removing necessary items from the premises (i.e. taking all the food or furniture etc., from the home). In some cases, prescriptive and detailed terms may be required in the order setting out what items are to be left at the premises for the use of the protected person and her or his children. For example, in New Zealand if a person applies for an occupation order, a court may also make an ancillary furniture order granting to the applicant the use of all or any of the furniture, household appliances, and household effects in the dwelling house specified in the occupation order. 6.26 The impact on the safety and protection of the protected person and any children who live at the residence (even if the children are not protected persons) if an exclusion order is not made.

Research suggests that it is safer and in the best interests for any children of the relationship to remain in their own home and area, without the need to change schools.127 Additionally, studies have found that women and children are severely economically, educationally and socially disadvantaged if they are forced to leave their homes due to family violence, and that there is a high risk they will become homeless or, with no other options, will return to the abusive environment.128 Accordingly, the former UN Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women has recommended that all States should \u2018provide for the removal of the abuser from the shared home and allow the victim-survivor to retain her present housing, at least until formal and final separation is achieved\u2019.129 6.27 EXAMPLE (1) This section applies if: (a) the defendant and protected person normally live in the same home with a child (whether or not the child is also a protected person); and (b) in deciding the conditions of a DVO [Domestic Violence Order], the issuing authority imposes a restraint on the defendant having contact with the protected person or child.

Historically, the police response to domestic violence has been inadequate, with violence in the home seen as a private matter, not serious or worthy of police attention.130 In many countries in response to such historical discrimination, a range of obligations have been placed upon police officers. Some countries have placed a mandatory obligation on police to apply for a protection order when domestic violence has or is likely to occur regardless of whether the protected person consents. In New South Wales (Australia) for example, police must apply for an order where they suspect or believe that a family violence, stalking, intimidation, or child abuse has recently been committed, is imminent or is likely to be committed against a family member.131 Such an approach provides clear direction to police officers of their responsibilities in relation to domestic violence. It also sends a message to the community and the abuser that domestic violence is unacceptable and obligates the police to act, it increases the likelihood of an order being made, lessens the burden on the victim and can deflect blame from the victim where the application is seen as a police matter and out of the victim\u2019s hands. Finally, it increases the likelihood that a woman will pursue an application when she is supported by the police.132 In other countries a lesser obligation is placed upon police officers such as in the examples below. In the example of the Model Laws if an application is not made by the police, the reasons for not making the application must be recorded. In the example of India an obligation is placed on a range of persons including the police to inform victims of their right to apply for an order. 6.28 6.29 130 See Victorian Law Reform Commission, Review of Family Violence Laws, 2005, Melbourne at 116. 131 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) s 562C(3). 132 Victorian Law Reform Commission, Review of Family Violence Laws, Melbourne, 2000 at 146.

Police Obligations to Apply for Protection Orders Model Domestic Violence Laws 1999, s 8 Domestic Violence Act 2005, s 8(5) (India) Duration of Order A range of approaches have been taken to how long the protection order should be in place. The first approach is to have designated periods (typically ranging from 6 months to two years) if no time period is stipulated in the order. A second approach is for the order to be in effect for an indefinite period and discharged only upon application by the protected person or the perpetrator as in the example of New Zealand below. A third approach is to leave the protection period to the discretion of the court on the basis of what is \u2018necessary to protect a person\u2019133 or what is \u2018necessary to ensure the safety and interests of the person for whose benefit the order is made.\u2019134 The Precedence of Protection Orders over Parenting Orders Research in Australia and internationally has demonstrated that the period immediately following separation from a violent relationship is the time of greatest risk of an escalation of violence. A recent NSW study found that a significant proportion of the post-separation abuse was linked to child contact, 6.30 6.31 133 Family Protection Act 2008, s 37(3) (Vanuatu). 134 Family Violence Act 2004, s 19(a) (Tasmania, Australia). GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 117 particularly where the contact or negotiations for contact gave the ex-partner some level of access to the mother.135 Research from England and Denmark has similarly demonstrated that most post-separation violence committed against mothers is linked in some way to child contact. Substantial commentary has also been written in recent years on how the child\u2019s presumed right to maintain contact with both parents has resulted in courts favoring contact between the absent parent and the child, regardless, at times, of the concerns of the mother or the past history of violence by one parent towards to other (or between the partners).137 This is contrary to Article 9 of the CRC which supports contact with both parents \u2018except if is contrary to the child\u2019s best interests.\u2019 Such findings have resulted in legislative statements in many countries that protection orders override contact orders. Enforcement of Orders A strong system of enforcement is crucial to ensuring the protection order system is effective in protecting domestic violence victims. If the police or the courts do not respond adequately to breaches of orders, they will be perceived as ineffectual by victims and abusers alike. It will also give victims a false sense of safety and security, heightening their danger if an abuser behaves violently. To be effective a breach of a protection order must be a criminal offence.138 Penalties Contemporary domestic violence legislation typically has fines and/or imprisonment as the penalty for breaches of protection orders. Some jurisdictions have harsher penalties for second offences with some imposing only imprisonment for a second offence. In the Oceanic region the penalties for a breach of an order are as follows. All impose terms of imprisonment or fines. In Vanuatu the penalty is up to 2 years imprisonment, a fine of 50,000 vatu or both, in New Zealand the penalty is up to 6 months imprisonment or a fine not exceeding $5,000, in Australia the penalties range from in the state of Victoria for a first offence a fine of up to $24,000 or 1 years imprisonment and for a subsequent offence up to 2 years imprisonment.

In Western Australia the penalties range from 6 months imprisonment to 18 months imprisonment and a fine of $2,000 to $6,000 depending on whether it is an emergency order or a final protection order.

Mandatory Attendance at Rehabilitation and Educational Programmes Another approach to enforcement is to require the abuser to attend a rehabilitation programme. In New Zealand a magistrate making a civil protection order must direct the abuser to attend such a programme. Such a measure, aimed at rehabilitation of the abuser and supported by research which indicates that such programmes can have positive outcomes, is however reliant on the existence of a well-resourced programmes for the court to refer the offender to. Unfortunately, in many Pacific Island countries, such programmes do not exist, and are unlikely to be available in the rural areas or outer islands. Police Powers to Arrest The police should be empowered to arrest and detain a perpetrator immediately upon any breach. In the Cook Islands the Criminal Procedure Act 1965 provides that a police officer may arrest or take into custody without a warrant a person \u2018he finds committing, or whom he has good cause to suspect of having committed, any offence punishable by death or imprisonment for life or for three months or more.\u2019 This may be sufficient in the Cook Islands if a penalty of over 3 months imprisonment is imposed for breaches of protection orders. In countries where no arrest can occur without a warrant two approaches have been typically adopted. The first, as illustrated in the example of South Africa below, is to issue an arrest warrant at the time of issuing the protection order to enable the immediate arrest of perpetrator should any breach occur. As well as providing an expedient means of immediate response to any breach such a procedure signifies the importance and seriousness placed on the protection order. Alternatively the second approach, as illustrated in the example of the Model Domestic Violence Law below, the authority for arrest without a warrant can be explicitly provided in the legislation. 6.34 6.35 EXAMPLES (1)Whenever a court issues a protection order, the court must make an order- (a) authorising the issue of a warrant for the arrest of the respondent, in the prescribed form; and suspending the execution of such warrant subject to compliance with any prohibition, condition, obligation or order imposed in terms of section 7. (b) The warrant referred to in subsection (l)(a) remains in force unless the protection order is set aside, or it is cancelled after execution.

Some countries require that before any revocation or variation of order can be considered, there must have been a substantial change in the relevant circumstances since the order was made or last varied.140 Typically, the court is required to consider specific grounds in deciding whether or not to vary or revoke an order. These include the applicant\u2019s reasons for the variation or revocation, the safety of the protected person, the wishes of the protected person and whether or not the applicant is legally represented.

GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 123 Chapter 7 DIVISION OF PROPERTY AFTER MARRIAGE OR RELATIONSHIP BREAKDOWN Introduction This chapter considers the law reform issues relating to property division after separation, divorce or the breakdown of a relationship. The CEDAW Committee has called upon States parties to ensure that women receive \u2018equal rights to property accumulated during marriage after dissolution.\u2019147 Property division after the end of marriage is governed in the Cook Islands by the Matrimonial Property Act 1976 (NZ). The Act, which was adopted from New Zealand,148 is CEDAW compliant in many respects and for the most part provides a good practice framework. The property regime it creates is generally referred to as a deferred community property regime. This means that all property acquired during the course of the marriage by either party, with certain exceptions, is deemed on the breakdown of the marriage, to be the property of both parties regardless of legal title. The Act provides for equal sharing of the matrimonial home and chattels. The rest of the matrimonial property is to be shared equally unless one party\u2019s contribution is \u2018clearly greater than the other\u2019. In such circumstances, when the decision about how to divide property is based on a consideration of the contributions of each rather than being based on a presumption of equality, the Act recognizes equally both financial and non-financial contributions in accord with good practice. In this way, marriage is acknowledged as a partnership with both parties contributing equally but differently to the relationship and the family. The major aspect of the legal framework governing property division in the Cook Islands that is currently non-compliant with CEDAW is the failure to extend protection to de facto couples. The CEDAW Committee in its Concluding Comments in 2007 called upon the Cook Islands \u2018to establish a system of equitable division of marital property upon dissolution of de facto marriages.\u2019 A second area that is non-compliant with CEDAW for consideration is that whilst the principle of equality is applied to the matrimonial home and chattels, the rest of the matrimonial property (which can include businesses, investments and any other property, and can be a substantial component of the matrimonial property) will not be determined on the basis of equality if one party\u2019s contribution to the partnership has \u2018clearly been greater\u2019 than the other. Such an approach has been shown to disadvantage the party whose contribution is non-financial and good practice requires that the principle of equality applies to all matrimonial property. Although the Matrimonial Property Act 1976 is largely CEDAW compliant and could be amended to achieve compliance, law reform in this area would be best achieved through the repeal of the Act and incorporation of the area into the new Family Law Bill. This would enable property division to be linked to spousal and child support and for the development of a clearer and more straightforward framework. 7.1 7.2 147 Concluding Comments of the CEDAW Committee: Malawi (2010) 45th Session at para [43] (UN Doc CEDAW/C/MWI/CO/6); Lebanon (2008) 40th Session at para [45] (UN Doc CEDAW/C/LBN/CO/3). 148 Adopted as Cook Islands law by the Matrimonial Property Act 1991-1992, s 3.

The provision of a statutory regime based on the equal sharing of property for de facto couples is of particular significance, since it is common for property and other assets to be in one partner\u2019s name (typically the male). The recognition of de facto relationships for the purpose of property division requires a legislative definition of a de facto relationship. An example of a good practice legislative definition of de facto relationship was provided previously at para [5.6]. What Property is Part of the Settlement? The Matrimonial Property Act 1976 divides property into \u2018matrimonial\u2019 property and \u2018separate\u2019 property. Only property defined as matrimonial property is deemed part of the settlement process. As illustrated in the example of New Zealand below (where property is divided on the same basis as the Matrimonial Property Act 1976, but is named \u2018relationship\u2019 property and \u2018separate\u2019 property instead), this provides a good practice approach. Relationship property includes the family home and chattels regardless of whether it was acquired before or after the marriage or union, and all other property including benefits and superannuation acquired during or directly before the marriage or union. Separate property is all property that is not relationship property and generally consists of property held by the parties at the commencement of the cohabitation/marriage. 7.3 7.4 149 Property (Relationships) Act 1976 (New Zealand).

These include any asset owned wholly or substantially by one spouse at the date of the marriage, or any asset that has been inherited or received by one partner as a gift. These assets will be divided on the basis of contributions discussed below at para [7.9]. Additionally, if the contribution of one spouse has clearly been \u2018disproportionately greater\u2019 than the other then the division is also determined on the basis of the contributions of the parties. The major criticism of allowing an exemption based on the short duration of the relationship is the arbitrariness of the 3 years rule (which is especially apparent in light of the reality that many children are conceived or born during the first 3 years of a relationship or marriage). The second exception relates to where there are extraordinary circumstances that would make equal sharing \u2018repugnant to justice\u2019. In such circumstances the matrimonial home and family chattels is determined on the basis of contributions. A good practice approach would be to discard the 3 year rule and retain the exception of the \u2018repugnant to justice\u2019 which could exclude a marriage or a relationship of short duration if equal sharing appeared unjust in the circumstances. The third exception is that that the balance of matrimonial property (ie other than the matrimonial home and chattels) which might include a business, a second home and other property, shares, insurance and superannuation is to be divided equally unless one spouse\u2019s contribution to the partnership has been \u2018clearly greater\u2019 than the other. A major criticism of this approach is that the exception is easily established and that the major portion of the matrimonial property is typically therefore determined on the basis of contributions (to the disadvantage of the non-earning partner) rather than on the principle of equal sharing. The CEDAW Committee has specifically criticized this approach.152 In 2001 New Zealand reformed the original Act that the Cook Islands Act is based on, and as is illustrated below, in a good practice measure has now designated all relationship property to be shared equally. 7.5 7.6 7.7 7.8 150 L Tee, \u201cDivision of Property Upon Relationship Breakdown\u201d in Family Law: Issues, Debates Policy (ed) J Herring (Devon: Willan Publishing, 2001) 45 at 71. 151 UK Law Reform Commission, Cohabitation: The Financial Consequences of Relationship Breakdown.

GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 127 EXAMPLE On the division of relationship property under this Act, each of the spouses or partners is entitled to share equally in\u2014 (a) the family home; and (b) the family chattels; and (c) any other relationship property. Equal Division of Property Property (Relationships) Act 1976, s 11(1) (New Zealand) Determining Contributions In the Cook Islands, as in many modern property division frameworks, there are circumstances when property division is determined on the basis of contributions rather than equality of division. In the Cook islands, as discussed above, a contributions approach is adopted if equal division would be \u2018repugnant to justice\u2019, if the marriage is less than 3 years duration, and in relation to all matrimonial (or \u2018relationship\u2019) property other than the matrimonial home and chattels. A contributions approach requires the assessment of the contributions of the two parties to the marriage or partnership. A good practice approach to deciding how the contributions of each partner should affect how property is to be divided is to include a mandatory statutory list of factors for the court to consider, as detailed below. It is additionally important that the legislation explicitly states that non-financial contributions should be given equal weight with financial contributions.153 In General Recommendation 21(32) the CEDAW Committee states that in relation to the division of marital property \u2018financial and non-financial contributions should be accorded the same weight\u2019.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d45c6fdf-b425-4b4f-9723-04b9a8f21b12": {"__data__": {"id_": "d45c6fdf-b425-4b4f-9723-04b9a8f21b12", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing the Implementation of CEDAW in the Cook Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b9cc66e9fda17a4416aa268697583ab92cf0001312788b577768e3d4a0d3518e"}, "2": {"node_id": "bb178476-f82c-48f1-a44c-84999c129ab8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "51a570ec9c15ff7142f671981885f8ddae65d213214833bd7b6bc22cdd1a2c1e"}}, "hash": "20d10badc92014e7392c230f4dd901a7abb48aaed873678332ddf5b3497d7d8f", "text": "The Committee explains that non-financial contributions during a marriage such as raising children, caring for elderly relatives, and discharging household duties \u2018enable a husband to earn an income and increase the assets of the marital relationship\u2019. 7.9 153 UK Law Reform Commission, Cohabitation: The Financial Consequences of Relationship Breakdown.

Budgeting in Penang Being offered for the very first time in Viet Nam, training courses on gender and economic policy making have received enormous success. Cours- es, based on the UNDP\u2019s training modules on Gender Economic Policy Management, were customized to respond to the needs of the Gov- ernment of Viet Nam. Two participatory training courses were held back-to-back in Hanoi to accommodate a huge demand. The first training programme \u201cGender Responsive Economics and Social Protection\u201d was delivered to 23 researchers of the Institute of Family and Gender Studies (IFGS), a leading research institute based in Hanoi, on February 10-15, 2014. Social protection plays a funda- mental role in creating inclusive and sustainable development. It helps in tackling multiple di- mensions of poverty and deprivation through the provision of decent work, education, health care, food and income security. It can therefore be a powerful tool in the battle against poverty and inequality. Women are the poorest of the poor and the ones to suffer the most due to lack of social security nets and access thereof. In the absence of adequate social protection they are subjected to increased risks of sinking below the poverty line or remaining trapped in pov- erty for generations.

This ground-breaking event brought together an impressive range of speakers, chairs and facilitators from across the region and indeed around the world, including from Austria, Ger- many, and Portugal. Presentations were made to over 300 participants and importantly in- cluded attendees from the two local municipal councils in Penang. The presentations and discussions over the two days centred on the current role and impact of Gender Responsive Budg- eting (GRB) within national, state/ provincial and local government institu- tions, and how it is increasingly being linked to opening up the processes of budgeting to more directly include and empower women and men in local communities. This framed a discussion of two aspects. Firstly, certain sessions focused on the changing nature of budget planning and nar- rated practical examples of how the collection and use of data is providing a series of oppor- tunities for GRB. Secondly, there was focus also on the relationship between GRB and par- ticipatory budgeting, and the extent to which empowerment of communities is, can or should be a central concern of GRB. As the discussions unfolded, it became clear that national and local governments across the region have been changing their budgeting processes in ways that [continued on page 3] Gender and Economic Policy Making Training in Viet Nam YB Chong Eng, Chair of the Penang Women\u2019s Development Corporation (PWDC) and Penang State Exco for Youth and Sports, Women, Family and Community Development, speaking at the Conference.

This participatory course was designed for academics, lecturers, researchers and those working in govern- ment or civil society. The main purpose of the course was to provide participants with the skills and knowledge to lead this course in their own organizations or to mainstream a gender equality perspec- tive in their day-to-day work. It also aimed at encouraging more research in the area of gender, policy making and economics in relation to development in Viet Nam by imparting skills and knowledge on topics such as gender and macroeconomics, the role of unpaid care work in the economy, and gender- responsive policy making. Over 50 professionals applied to take the UNDP course of which 30 were selected. The selected fellows were professors and lecturers from the Ho Chi Minh Academy (HCMA) of Politics and the Institute of Labour, policy advisors from the MOFA, Women\u2019s Union and the Ministry of Trade and researchers with Development and Policies Research Center and Oxfam. The training workshop is an opportunity to learn about how gender responsive economic policies can make a difference and contribute to Viet Nam\u2019s economic and social development. Participants ap- preciated the participatory teaching method and the interactions with col- leagues during group work. They have requested that the remaining modules be part of a follow-up course in August. As well, the HCMA is organizing a follow-up training on gender and economics for senior members of the Party. The purpose of the training was to in- crease the technical knowledge of the participants on concepts and theories in the area of gender economics, provide skills in using tools and frameworks of gender-responsive economic analysis and demonstrate linkages between gender economics and social protection pro- grams. On the final day of the training, the par- ticipants were able to prepare and pre- sent their ideas on developing gender- responsive social protection policy briefs based upon the subjects covered during the training course. The potentially- interesting research areas that could be undertaken are, for example, piloting cash transfers to females, linking micro- finance to social insurance schemes, re- forming educational curricula to reflect gender equality, and improving data col- lection mechanisms. The participants thereby demonstrated strong abilities in distinguishing between labour market programs, social insurance programs, and social assistance programs, as the princi- pal domains of gender-responsive social protection. The training was organized by the UN Women Programme on Economic Liveli- hoods and Social Protection in Viet Nam, supported by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Australia. UN Wom- en shall partner with IFGS in the second year of its programme to take forward some of these research pieces to further strengthen and contribute to the social protection system in Viet Nam. Post the success of this programme, UN Women recognizes the appetite, need and value for conducting and hosting similar trainings in Viet Nam with other research agencies, key government min- istries and line departments. The subject area of gender and economics coupled with social protection is urgent and time- ly as the Government of Vietnam is cur- rently in the process of improving and strengthening its social protection system through the investment support of inter- national donors.

The workshop aims at an understanding of how a gendered ap- proach to research enhances our under- standing of how society works. It also offers practical insights into doing social research, as well as a platform for discus- sion on issue such as gender as an im- portant perspective in social research and how do gender analyses lead to change. The speakers in this workshop are noted academics and advocates of gender stud- ies in Malaysia and elsewhere.

It was pointed out, among other things, that \u2018participation\u2019 in and of itself does not automatically lead to any change in gen- der power relations, either within or out- side institutions. A lot more has to hap- pen. And there is always the possibility that \u2018participation\u2019 does not necessarily mean \u2018empowerment\u2019 (let alone of wom- en), but is just another box to tick. These are still early days in the regional narrative, and yet it was inspiring that there is already so much to be shared. The lively break-out sessions which chart- ed ways forward at regional, national and local levels were full of ideas and possibil- ities \u2013 and cognizant too of the many challenges. There is still a long road to follow, and perhaps one missing narrative was to hear directly from women and men in communities about what exactly has been the impact of GRB in its various guises on their lives. That needs to be heard to come. In the meantime the Pe- nang Women's Development Corpora- tion, together with the Penang State Gov- ernment, the two municipal councils of Penang, and UN Women, are to be com- mended for collectively organizing a timely, thought-provoking, refreshing event, which sets a great stage for future follow-ups.

Association for Women\u2019s Rights in Devel- opment (AWID) and the International Association for Feminist Economics (IAFFE) posted the feminist economists\u2019 response to the Note. Contributing economists welcomed the fact that the IMF, which has credibility and influence with finance ministers and central bankers, acknowledged that wom- en\u2019s lower participation in labour market and lower wages than men\u2019s and flagged women\u2019s unpaid work. However, the Note hasn\u2019t addressed the role of the IMF -type macroeconomic policies in perpetu- ating gender inequalities. As a result, there is no policy discussions on how the IMF changes its own programmes to- wards gender equality and women\u2019s eco- nomic empowerment. They also concerns of the Note\u2019s policy suggestion to reform the child support and other social benefits. The Note ar- gues when it is too high, such support can be disincentive for women to enter the labour market, especially those with low earnings capacity (p. 14). They argue that women\u2019s movement into low-paid, inse- cure jobs is unlikely to help improving women\u2019s as well as their children\u2019s well- being. In many societies, women actually can benefit from greater expenditure on social welfare in order to increase their availability for productive work, increase the profitability of their businesses, and free them from the drudgery of over- work. Other comments include the policy framework has over emphasis on formal labour market. The argument may be appropriate for the OECD countries but may have limited appeal in developing countries where the majority are in the informal and subsistence economies. In fact, the Note didn\u2019t explore the issue of unpaid work although women\u2019s responsi- bility for unpaid work is often an obsta- cles for them to participate in paid work outside of their home.

There is a dedicated chapter on gender inequality. Evidence shows that a signifi- cant narrowing of gaps in critical capabili- ties like education and health has not translated for women into equivalent reductions of inequality in other domains such as access to livelihoods and political participation. Gender wage gaps and job segregation remain persistent. It would therefore appear that women have achieved greater access to employment by replacing men in more vulnerable and lower-quality jobs. Gender inequality in livelihoods and earnings determines women\u2019s fallback positions in the house- hold, thus, women\u2019s ability to negotiate resources within the household. The analysis in this Report argues that inequalities in outcomes and opportuni- ties are interlinked and cannot be treated as separate issues.

The 2014 Conference theme is Marginality, Inclusiveness and Social Justice: Contem- porary Challenges in Researching Wom- en, Men and Gender. The context of the discussion is the current globalising trends that have led to widening social and economic disparities, and increasing human insecurity, uncertainty and risk. Not only has the gap between richer and poorer countries been difficult to bridge, the societies in many countries grow in- creasingly polarised. While some layers of society have benefitted from the rapid changes, others have been left behind and marginalised, i.e. systematically ex- cluded from accessing the rights, oppor- tunities and resources in society. Papers may be prepared to fit into the following sub-themes: Culture, religion and gender; entrepreneurship, micro- Call for Papers/ Call for Applications enterprise and empowerment; gender in culture, communication, language and the arts; globalization, transnationalism and migration; healthcare, social entitle- ments and social justice; law, policy and gender; patriarchy, the family and femi- nist discourses; sexuality, masculinity and identity politics; sustainable development and environmental issues; violence against women; and women, leadership and the political process. Postgraduate students and young schol- ars who have obtained their Master\u2019s or PhD degrees within two years prior to the date of the conference are welcome to submit abstracts (450 words) at kanita.kpicgs@gmail.com by March 31, 2014. Interested individuals who do not submit papers may also attend as partici- pants. Malaysian Ringgit (RM) 80 for partici- pants affiliated with local institutions and USD40 otherwise apply for registration before May 31, 2014. Registration fee will be increased to RM 100 and USD 50 re- spectively after June 1. Fees will cover all meals and materials during the Confer- ence.

This is done through two complementary approaches: i) gender mainstreaming, and ii) promoting women\u2019s empowerment. The development of capacity (both of country stakeholders and in-house staff) to integrate gender concerns in core areas of development work is a vital element of successfully engendering UNDP\u2019s agenda. The UNDP 2008\u20132011 Strategic Plan likewise emphasizes that capacity development is UNDP\u2019s \u2018overarching contribution\u2019 to global human development efforts. Thus, gender responsiveness in capacity development interventions is a critical element for overall development effectiveness. It is in this sense that the two cross-cutting areas of UNDP\u2019s mandate work in a mutually reinforcing manner. The Netherlands Development Organization (SNV) is a Netherlands-based international NGO that delivers capacity development advisory services to over 2,000 clients in 32 countries worldwide. In Asia, SNV provides capacity development services to government, non- government and private-sector organizations in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Nepal and Viet Nam, as well as to a number of regional networks. SNV\u2019s 140 advisors in Asia work with local capacity builders and local actors \u2013 primarily those who operate at national and meso levels \u2013 in strengthening their capacity to effectively realize poverty reduction and good governance.

Knowledge and experiences, both from within as well as outside Indonesia can help us learn lessons and ensure that our future interventions can respond better to realities on the ground. This report provides some important insights into the kinds of gender responsive capacity development programmes that have been initiated in Indonesia as well assessing which of these have worked and why. Jointly with other country studies, this report will form a baseline of trends in local capacity development in the region and support efforts to advocate for increased, and more effective, investments in capacity development. This study was funded by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Asia Pacific Gender Mainstreaming Programme and builds on the objectives and work taking place under the UNDP-Netherlands Development Organization (SNV) partnership, which has provided three years of important local capacity development advocacy, research, evidence gathering and programme support in the region. I welcome this collaboration between the Gender and the Capacity Development Teams at the UNDP Regional Center in Bangkok. I am pleased, too, by the partnership between SNV, UNDP Regional Centre Bangkok and UNDP Indonesia. This study is an important contribution to the body of knowledge already available on this subject. Yet the recommendations contained within these pages are also a call to action \u2013 for government and donors alike \u2013 and the ultimate contribution of this study will be an increase in the kind of gender responsive capacity development programmes that improve overall development effectiveness in Indonesia.

IntroductIon 1.1 The development context in Indonesia Since the 1997 economic crisis, Indonesia\u2019s macroeconomy has regained stability. The country ranked 111th out of 182 countries in the 2009 Human Development Index (HDI), which is about average when compared to other middle-income countries. The Gender-Related Development Index (GDI) ranks Indonesia 93rd out of 155 countries. In the 2009 national elections, 101 women, representing 18 percent of all parliamentarians, were elected to parliament.1 While these figures indicate an increase in female representation of over 6 percent from the results of the previous election, in some regional areas the rates of participation are much lower (5.8 percent in Aceh, 7.2 percent in Nusa Tenggara Timur). Women are still under-represented at senior official levels of government, with females constituting approximately only 9 percent of Echelon 1 officials.2 Despite gaps in income between sexes in both the formal and informal sectors, and inadequate input and support for training and skills development, women contribute significantly to the growth of agriculture and rural-sector development.3 Notwithstanding this important contribution, sex disparity in the labour sector remains a significant challenge.4 Indonesia has made solid progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), with indicators such as literacy rates, enrolment rates for elementary school, and infant mortality rates performing positively (see Annex 2). However, Indonesia continues to face major obstacles in closing disparities between geographical areas, income groups, and sexes. While the MDG target of 7.5\u201312 percent of the poor living on less than $1 a day5 was met by 2006, nearly half of Indonesia\u2019s population is still either poor or near poor, living on a per-capita income of below $2. The Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) pointed out that other poverty indicators, including the absolute number of poor people and the number of children out of school, were worsening due, in part, to price increases for certain major commodities including fuel, rice and food. 1 This figure excludes the 132 representatives elected to the Regional Council (DPD), for which no sex disaggregated data is available.

Development stakeholders have recognized that inadequate country capacity is a critical missing factor in current efforts to meet the MDGs.9 What is required to achieve the MDGs in a decentralized Indonesia, therefore, is significant investment in, and effective approaches to, capacity development that responds to localized needs across Indonesia and to the different needs of communities, the poor, women and men, girls and boys, and disadvantaged groups. The United Nations considers CD, particularly for local governments, as an overarching goal of its work in Indonesia: \u201cThe United Nations will work in a more integrative approach, introducing not only knowledge building (education, training, and learning) but also address institutional arrangements and incentives mechanisms, leadership development, and accountability and voice mechanism.10\u201d With the Jakarta Commitments as a translated mechanism of the Paris Declaration, the United Nations\u2019 new framework for capacity development will need to be more systematic in supporting government- led CD in the context of Indonesia\u2019s human development vision and the MDGs. 6 Government of Indonesia; UNDP, \u20182006\u20132010 Country Programme Mid-Term Review\u2019, January 2009, p15. 7 This has been underlined in studies, prepared by the National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS), that have been used for drafting the upcoming 2010\u20132014 \u2018Mid-Term National Development Plan Document\u2019 (RPJMN).

Thus, CD extends beyond strengthening individual knowledge and skills to improving \u2018the enabling environment\u2019, meaning the quality of organizations and power structures within the system, including effective incentive mechanisms and sustainability. Slow improvement of the enabling environment (public sector management and institutions) is an indication of a lack of capacity.13 Using this approach, CD covers \u201cthe process through which individuals, organizations and societies obtain, strengthen, adapt and maintain their own development objectives over time\u201d14. Thus, CD is about skills and procedures as well as incentives and governance.15 1.2.2 Gender-responsive capacity development UNDP considers mainstreaming a gender perspective as a process of assessing the implication for women and men of any planned action \u2013 including legislation, policies or programmes \u2013 in all areas and at all levels. Consistent with this, gender-responsive programmes will consider women\u2019s and men\u2019s concerns as an integral dimension of the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation (of policies and programmes) in all political, economic and social spheres.16 Four types of programmes can be considered as gender-responsive programming:17 a) programmes that respond to the different needs of women and men, and boys and girls; b) women\u2019s targeted components in programmes; c) programmes for women only; and d) gender training. 11 OECD, \u2018The Challenge of Capacity Development: Working Towards Good Practice\u2019, 2006. 12 Ibid. 13 Ibid. 14 UNDP, \u2018Supporting Capacity Development: the UNDP Approach\u2019, Capacity Development Group, Bureau for Development Policy, New York, 2009. 15 Ibid. 16 UNDP, \u2018Empowered and Equal\u2019, Gender Equality Strategy 2008\u20132011, Bureau for Development Policy, New York, 2008.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b06dffe7-644d-4aae-ae0a-3f71a11e09cb": {"__data__": {"id_": "b06dffe7-644d-4aae-ae0a-3f71a11e09cb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-gender-responsive-local-capacity-development-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing gender responsive local capacity development in Indonesia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-gender-responsive-local-capacity-development-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "065d91d9a1027e376b0bd3e02de733a013cef3a54e090403b0b392989790b32f"}, "2": {"node_id": "e00f4552-7101-4ac7-ba2f-b38809575f17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-gender-responsive-local-capacity-development-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "285b305914411c3db2177226574d059428b2f2f24264b0fcdfda91eb4b0f2452"}}, "hash": "b7e062be0c4ece7540bf4f4bc937677bad3c95f666a35ded6bdf5c52302ddd9c", "text": "17 The Philippines\u2019 National Statistic Coordination Board (NSCB); Gender-responsive definition. 4 2. gender-responsIve locAl cApAcIty development For AccelerAtIng the mdgs In A dIverse IndonesIA 2.1 Indonesia\u2019s capacity development context Despite acknowledgement by the Indonesian government of the importance of CD in the country\u2019s agenda, the national CD system is limited.
