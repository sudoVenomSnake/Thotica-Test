 Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, 12 February 2009, A/ HRC/10/12, para. 65. 106 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions The third person to hold this mandate, Michel Forst, has continued the focus of his two predecessors on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex defenders.455 He recommended in his first annual report to the Human Rights Council that States should: Pay particular attention to the most exposed groups: \u2026 defenders of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex rights \u2026456 The Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of highest attainable standard of physical and mental health was established in 2002 and last renewed in 2013.457 In his first annual report the Special Rapporteur adopted the view of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on prohibited grounds of discrimination: According to CESCR, ICESCR \u201cproscribes any discrimination in access to health care and underlying determinants of health, as well as to means and entitlements for their procurement, on the grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, physical or mental disability, health status (including HIV/AIDS), sexual orientation and civil, political, social or other status, which has the intention or effect of nullifying or impairing the equal enjoyment or exercise of the right to health\u201d.458 He commented in his 2004 report on the links between sexual orientation and gender identity and the enjoyment of the right to health: \u2026 discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation is impermissible under international human rights law. The legal prohibition of same-sex relations in many countries, in conjunction with a widespread lack of support or protection for sexual minorities against violence and discrimination, impedes the enjoyment of sexual and reproductive health by many people with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender identities or conduct.459 He also spoke more directly about sexual rights as human rights and their link to sexual orientation: \u2026 the Special Rapporteur has no doubt that the correct understanding of fundamental human rights principles, as well as existing human rights norms, leads ineluctably to the recognition of sexual rights as human rights. Sexual rights include the right of all persons to express their sexual orientation, with due regard for the well- being and rights of others, without fear of persecution, denial of liberty or social interference.460 The 2010 report considers at some length \u201cissues relating to the criminalization of private, consensual sexual behaviour between adults, and the impact of such criminalization on the enjoyment of the right to health\u201d. Introducing the discussion the Special Rapporteur says: The Special Rapporteur believes that the criminalization of private, consensual sexual interaction between adults represents a significant impediment to the realization of the right to health of all persons, particularly those against whom the law is directed. He emphasizes that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated. The criminalization of private, consensual sexual conduct between adults infringes on not only the right to health, but also various other human rights, including the rights to privacy and equality. In turn, infringement of these human rights impacts indirectly on the right to health. \u2026 455 Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, 29 December 2014, A/HRC/28/63. 456 Ibid, para 124(f). 457 Respectively Commission on Human Rights resolution 2002/31, E/CN.4/RES/2002/31; and Human Rights Council resolution 24/6, A/HRC/RES/24/6.

The health related impact of discrimination based on sexual conduct and orientation is far-reaching, and prevents affected individuals from gaining access to other economic, social and cultural rights. In turn, the infringement of other human rights impacts on the realization of the right to health, such as by impeding access to employment or housing. These infringements ultimately undermine the inherent dignity of persons upon which the international human rights framework is based. Denying the dignity of individuals through the criminalization of certain conducts substantially diminishes their self-worth and, in doing so, prevents the realization of the right to health. The decriminalization of such conduct is necessary to address the disempowerment that affected individuals and communities face, and to enable full realization of the right to health.461 These comments on criminalisation are applicable beyond sexual relationships. Transgender people can encounter criminal penalties for expressing their gender identity; for example, cross-dressing. They can also be punished through the unfair application of other criminal laws, such as public order laws. This has consequences in broader discrimination and denial of rights. The Special Rapporteur made reference to this in the report of a visit to Malaysia in 2014. He highlighted a number of issues of concern for transgender persons, including: \u2022 criminalisation of \u2018cross-dressing\u2019 that forces transgender persons underground \u2022 religious prohibition of transgender surgery that makes such surgery difficult to obtain \u2022 refusal to permit changes to gender on identity cards \u2022 barriers to health care \u2022 negative social attitudes \u2022 discrimination \u2022 forced HIV/AIDS testing.462 461 Report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to health, 27 April 2010, A/HRC/14/20, paras. 2, 6 and 7. 462 Report of the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, Addendum Visit to Malaysia (19 November\u20132 December 2014), May 2015, A/HRC/29/33/Add.1, paras 83-90. Photo by UNDP/W. Field. 108 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions The Special Rapporteur on the right to health is one of the few special procedures to make specific reference to issues relating to sex characteristics. In his 2009 report on informed consent and the right to health, he stressed: \u2026 the importance of safeguarding informed consent of sexual minorities. Health-care providers must be cognizant of and adapt to the specific needs of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons. Such elements of vulnerability significantly overlap and exacerbate inequalities \u2026463 He also discussed the situation of intersex children specifically: Health-care providers should strive to postpone non-emergency invasive and irreversible interventions until the child is sufficiently mature to provide informed consent. [This is particularly problematic in the case of intersex genital surgery, which is a painful and high-risk procedure with no proven medical benefits\u2026]464 The Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment has also discussed human rights issues affecting intersex people. In his 2013 report on abuse in health care settings, he identified lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons as marginalised groups at particular risk of this abuse. He discussed the particular situation of intersex children: Children who are born with atypical sex characteristics are often subject to irreversible sex assignment, involuntary sterilization, involuntary genital normalizing surgery, performed without their informed consent, or that of their parents, \u201cin an attempt to fix their sex\u201d, leaving them with permanent, irreversible infertility and causing severe mental suffering.465 The Special Rapporteur, in the same report, also made comments specific to gender identity in the context of abuse in health care settings: In many countries transgender persons are required to undergo often unwanted sterilization surgeries as a prerequisite to enjoy legal recognition of their preferred gender. \u2026 Some domestic courts have found that not only does enforced surgery result in permanent sterility and irreversible changes to the body, and interfere in family and reproductive life, it also amounts to a severe and irreversible intrusion into a person\u2019s physical integrity.466 463 Report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to health, 10 August 2009, ,A/64/272, para. 46. 464 Ibid, para. 49.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c9bd47bf-8144-42e2-999c-e4e2c9f6e02d": {"__data__": {"id_": "c9bd47bf-8144-42e2-999c-e4e2c9f6e02d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "936cc8b58a0cd7d58e98064aef1b787e0bd2721455236e5a0ec4f2ce64b51d28"}, "2": {"node_id": "eb8f3ea0-6184-4789-a057-7ccf32b527d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0f51d76f3a40223c7f38f2ecf484857af735470f54e12f7517ac64f56c84c4cd"}}, "hash": "122593aaf9fb69ab80c7e576e45f33d23bb67c08c1165b171ffaaf4f50ed9ef7", "text": "46. 464 Ibid, para. 49. 465 Report of the Special Rapporteur on torture, 1 February 2013, A/HRC/22/53, para. 77. 466 Ibid, para. 78.

He also calls upon them to outlaw forced or coerced sterilization in all circumstances and provide special protection to individuals belonging to marginalized groups.467 This remains one of the few recommendations from a special procedure that refers specifically to the treatment of transgender and intersex people. One special procedure, the Independent Expert on minority issues, has referred to gender expression specifically. In her 2006 report the Independent Expert said: Finally, the independent expert recognizes that some individuals within ethnic, religious, linguistic or national minority groups may experience multiple forms of discrimination because of other factors including gender, gender expression, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, age or health status. This means that, within minority communities, some individuals who are already struggling against intolerable levels of generalized exclusion also face compounded forms of discrimination or violence based on their gender, personal identity or expression. As a result, the independent expert intends to consider the compounded and often negatively reinforcing nature of multiple forms of exclusion as she undertakes her work, while also highlighting the importance of protecting diverse forms of personal expression.468 While this discussion has focused particularly on three special procedures in particular, many others have been very active on human rights issues affecting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people. The Special Rapporteur on the right to adequate housing has reported repeatedly on these issues within the housing area.469 The Special Rapporteur on violence against women has also been very active.470 The special procedures generally are now far more conscious of the experience and risk of human violations based on sexual orientation, gender identity and, to a lesser extent, sex characteristics. Many have been vocal in asserting repeatedly and consistently that international human rights law extends to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people and that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people are entitled to the protection and promotion of their human rights. Nonetheless, some special procedures have still not recognised the significance of these human rights issues and the need for their mandates to address these issues. 467 Ibid, para. 88. 468 Report of the Independent Expert on Minority Issues, 2006, E/CN.4/2006/74, para. 28. 469 See, for example, Report of the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living and on the right to non-discrimination in this context, 26 December 2011, A/HRC/19/53;

SEXUAL ORIENTATION, GENDER IDENTITY AND SEX CHARACTERISTICS IN UN POLITICAL FORUMS For two decades, legal experts in the international human rights system \u2013 the treaty monitoring bodies and the special procedures \u2013 have recognised and responded to human rights violations based on sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics. The UN\u2019s political bodies \u2013 the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council \u2013 have, however, been far slower to accept that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people have human rights and experience violations of those rights. In these forums, the members are States, not human rights or legal experts, and votes are taken, at times, on the basis of international and domestic political ideologies, not international law. Harmful traditional cultural beliefs and practices are often built on ignorance and prejudice. That has been evident historically in many areas of human rights concern, including in relation to women and children. It is especially evident today in relation to the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people. Nonetheless, even the UN\u2019s political forums are now recognising these human rights issues. The leadership of the UN Secretary General and the High Commissioners for Human Rights has been important in securing advances in these political forums. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has spoken repeatedly of human rights as extending to everyone, including to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people. On Human Rights Day in 2010, he said: As men and women of conscience, we reject discrimination in general, and in particular discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. When individuals are attacked, abused or imprisoned because of their sexual orientation, we must speak out. We cannot stand by. We cannot be silent. \u2026 homosexuality is considered a crime in more than 70 countries. This is not right.471 In 2014 the Secretary General has made his position very clear: I strongly support equal rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people everywhere.472 Successive High Commissioners for Human Rights have also repeatedly called for recognition of and respect for the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people. In 2008, Navi Pillay told the General Assembly: No human being should be denied their human rights, simply because of their perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. No human being should be subject to discrimination, violence, criminal sanctions, or abuse, simply because of their perceived sexual orientation or gender identity\u2026 The protection of the rights of those who identify as lesbian, gay or bisexual, and those who are transgender, transsexual or intersex, has attracted extremities of thought and passions\u2026 My response is that such a position is untenable in legal terms, which is confirmed by the evolving jurisprudence. The principle of universality admits no exception. Human rights truly are the birthright of all human beings.473 471 See www.un.org/press/en/2010/sgsm13311.doc.htm. 472 \u2018UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon Message to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) Core Group Ministerial Event\u2019 25 September 2014, New York; at www.un.org/sg/statements/index.asp?nid=8055. 473 See http://arc-international.net/global-advocacy/sogi-statements/hc-ga-200.

UN international conferences The first forums in which human rights issues in relation to sexual orientation were raised were UN international conferences. These forums are far more open than the official UN bodies and there are more opportunities for statements to canvass relevant issues widely.474 The first international human rights forum in which human rights issued relating to sexual orientation were raised is thought to have been the Third World Conference on Women, in Nairobi, Kenya, in 1985. At that conference, a junior minister in the Netherlands Government called for recognition of the rights of lesbians.475 There was substantially more discussion of sexual orientation at the Second World Conference on Human Rights, in Vienna, Austria, in 1993.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8ec1e209-4b7e-4ce7-8438-d2915a06b157": {"__data__": {"id_": "8ec1e209-4b7e-4ce7-8438-d2915a06b157", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "218f84f9937fcc1d41c72e341cc350da8ecae09f1686b56371624a081675a1e4"}, "2": {"node_id": "30f730df-802b-452b-b0a4-61d454b8d461", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eb1070509f6a9c39eb621da696af98df339faf4bee3778a1e165b5da37c4b825"}}, "hash": "6068321005b684319b8a1c71d4e894fefcb31debdd499a0d50003915cc094ceb", "text": "It was the first at which there was a significant presence of lesbian and gay human rights defenders.

Singapore was the only state to make a negative comment \u2026 The draft final conference statement had an equality paragraph condemning discrimination on listed grounds. In the drafting committee Canada proposed adding \u201csexual orientation\u201d to the list. In response the paragraph was quickly rewritten as a general, open-ended prohibition of discrimination, without a list. Sexual orientation was not to be named.476 At the Fourth World Conference on Women, in Beijing, China, in 1995, there were 11 accredited lesbian or lesbian and gay NGOs. The Conference\u2019s drafting committee also had the first substantive debate on sexual orientation. In preparatory meetings leading up to the Conference, several delegations, including South Africa, Canada, Israel and the EU proposed wording that referred to \u201csexual orientation.\u201d One proposal addressed discrimination against women on multiple grounds, such as sex and race, sex and disability, sex and sexual orientation. The four references to \u201csexual orientation\u201d in the draft Platform of Action were considered together in a drafting committee meeting that stretched into the early morning of the final day, Friday, September 15th, ending after 4 a.m. After an hour of debate on sexual orientation, the chair, Ms Patricia Licuanan of the Philippines, commented that this had been the first substantive discussion of the subject in any United Nations forum. She said it required much more discussion, but given the division, the references would be omitted. Thirty-three States indicated their support for the references. Twenty States indicated opposition. The diplomatic preference for consensus decision making prevailed. A fight on the floor during the closing plenary was avoided.477 474 D. Sanders, Out at the UN, 2010.

A UN General Assembly Special Session in 2000, five years after the Beijing Women\u2019s Conference, repeated the debate in Beijing about the inclusion of reference to sexual orientation in the concluding statement. Again, in the interest of consensus, the reference was not included.478 The following year, at another UN General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS, a further attempt was made to include specific reference to sexual orientation but again it failed. While at the time these must have seemed like permanent obstacles, in fact the tide was turning. 5.5.2. The Human Rights Council and its predecessor, the Commission on Human Rights The Commission on Human Rights was established in 1946 as the pre-eminent UN forum with specialised responsibility for human rights. It was succeeded by the Human Rights Council in 2006, pursuant to a resolution of the UN General Assembly.479 The Commission on Human Rights first acknowledged sexual orientation in a resolution in 2000, in relation to extra-judicial, summary and arbitrary executions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e35faad-bde4-4fe1-b4b1-48a60fc1aa29": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e35faad-bde4-4fe1-b4b1-48a60fc1aa29", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "78c5964318aef8589d95e6c640a80ea6e0bb7e071c89d0e2be5ed1e20e3da4c5"}, "2": {"node_id": "abb0faf0-5795-451d-b1c9-ad0e0f7165f9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1ac10c902866515a4426fc29b090e44c54ab927b078b25b033e26ea28e77807c"}}, "hash": "c31b71b77ca4e6f08df01bbc64772de52e8c855c1e97f93f4a558685eaf2600b", "text": "The Commission noted: \u2026 with concern the large number of cases in various parts of the world of \u2026 persons killed because of their sexual orientation \u2026 and calls upon Governments concerned to investigate such killings promptly and thoroughly, to bring those responsible to justice and to ensure that such killings are neither condoned nor sanctioned by government officials or personnel.480 Resolutions of the Commission relating to extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions in subsequent years always referred to \u201call killings committed for any discriminatory reason, including sexual orientation\u201d.481 The Human Rights Council has not passed general resolutions on extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions but it has renewed the Special Rapporteur\u2019s mandate as required.

Chapter 5: International and regional developments in human rights law | 113 Part II International human rights law In spite of the failure of this first attempt to have sexual orientation addressed, there could be no turning back. About 50 gay and lesbian activists attended the 2004 session of the Commission on Human Rights, their first strong presence in Geneva, for the anticipated debate on the postponed Brazilian proposed resolution.489 They were disappointed when the debate was again postponed but they remained committed to pursuing these issues in the Commission. Late in 2004, an international NGO, ARC International, convened a forum in Geneva with gay and lesbian, and some transgender and intersex, activists and generalist international human rights NGOs to discuss ways forward. The strategies adopted then were pursued successfully over the following years. First, State support for the protection and promotion of the human rights of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people was progressively built. This growing support was reflected in a series of joint statements at sessions of the Commission on Human Rights and then its successor, the Human Rights Council: 31 States joined the first statement in 2005, 54 States the next in 2006, then 67 States in a joint statement to the General Assembly in 2008.490 In 2011, 85 States joined the joint statement in the Human Rights Council.491 The first joint statement, led by New Zealand, provided the basic argument of these statements for many years: Sexual orientation is a fundamental aspect of every individual\u2019s identity and an immutable part of self.

Second, support for a resolution on human rights and sexual orientation and gender identity was progressively built.

The resolution began with a re-affirmation of the universality of all human rights. It expressed \u201cgrave concern at acts of violence and discrimination, in all regions of the world, committed against individuals because of their sexual orientation and gender identity\u201d.496 It decided on specific actions to ensure Human Rights Council and general UN engagement on the issues, including a study and report by the High Commissioner for Human Rights on violence and discrimination affecting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and a special panel discussion at a later session of the Council. 489 D.

The blocking tactic on this occasion was to move seven sets of amendments to the proposed resolution.501 Each set of amendments was voted on individually, resulting in each being defeated. The unamended proposed resolution was then put to the vote and adopted by 25 to 14 votes with 7 abstentions.502 The 2014 resolution continued the path charted by the first resolution in 2011, reiterating the main themes of the earlier resolution. It also asked the High Commissioner for Human Rights to update the 2011 report \u201cwith a view to sharing good practices and ways to overcome violence and discrimination, in application of existing international human rights law and standards\u201d.503 The High Commissioner published the updated report in 2015.504 Regrettably the resolutions passed to date do not deal with human rights issues in relation to sex characteristics. The former High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, did, however, incorporate some issues in her reports responding to the resolutions, along with issues relating to gender identity. Her 2011 report noted: In many countries, transgender persons face particular difficulties in their access to health care. Gender reassignment therapy, where available, is often prohibitively expensive and State funding or insurance coverage is rarely available. Health-care professionals are often insensitive to the needs of transgender persons and lack necessary professional training. In addition, intersex children, who are born with atypical sex characteristics, are often subjected to discrimination and medically unnecessary surgery, performed without their informed consent, or that of their parents, in an attempt to fix their sex.505 The 2015 report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has a much fuller discussion of issues relating to sex characteristics, even though the resolution requesting the report referred only to sexual orientation and gender identity. Early in the report the High Commissioner indicates: References are also included to violations against intersex persons, who may have any sexual orientation or gender identity.506 The report refers throughout to \u201cLGBT and intersex persons\u201d.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "731bd138-25ac-46a4-83aa-c67c129b5810": {"__data__": {"id_": "731bd138-25ac-46a4-83aa-c67c129b5810", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "daecac85e747a632d607b04f1284fbcb3ef1f9dd1827e5985d33f3767f992f61"}, "2": {"node_id": "6c2d5054-da3e-43a1-8409-b7d748771201", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "382c6005687badad9472757205d65c0ab3d0b7588f09f96cefc24c4cb8ddb58b"}}, "hash": "b7f61994234700fb67d1a268d0fab3d43422f68ab86a0389da524d89d7259fa7", "text": "It also raises issues specific to intersex people, including \u201cmedically unnecessary surgery and treatment performed on intersex children\u201d.507 497 Ibid. 498 High Commissioner for Human Rights, Discriminatory Laws and Practices and Acts of Violence against Individuals Based on their Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, 17 November 2011, A/HRC/19/41. 499 Report of the Human Rights Council on its 19th session, A/HRC/19/2, paras. 101-106.

Chapter 5: International and regional developments in human rights law | 115 Part II International human rights law Many intersex children, born with atypical sex characteristics, are subjected to medically unnecessary surgery and treatment in an attempt to force their physical appearance to align with binary sex stereotypes. Such procedures are typically irreversible and can cause severe, long-term physical and psychological suffering.508 The High Commissioner recommended that States address violence by \u201c[p]rohibiting medically unnecessary procedures on intersex children\u201d.509 NGOs have also begun to address the inclusion of intersex status issues in contributions to the Human Rights Council and advocate for their inclusion in Council and UN activities. Throughout these years of progress in the Human Rights Council, NGOs and, to a lesser extent, NHRIs have been active in support of the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and, more recently, intersex people. In fact, the developments of these years would not have been possible without their active participation, strategising and advocacy. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex advocates have attended all Council sessions in Geneva since 2003 and do so in large numbers. They receive the support of even larger numbers of organisations and individuals unable to travel to Geneva. At the 29th session of the Council in June 2015, a joint statement by NGOs on human rights and sexual orientation, gender identity and intersex was endorsed by 417 NGOs from 105 countries.510 NHRIs have also been active on these issues, including by pursuing them in the Human Rights Council. Since the 16th session of the Council in March 2011, a large number of NHRIs have made an annual joint statement to the Council on sexual orientation and gender identity: 19 NHRIs in 2011, 12 in 2012, 29 in 2013 and 22 in 2014.511 The most substantive statement was that of 2013.512 It expressed concern for the systemic and continuing human rights violations on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity and intersex status in all regions. It also stressed that NHRIs play a crucial role in protecting and promoting the rights of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and intersex people. The statement at the 27th session in September 2014 was made in the context of the proposed resolution on human rights and sexual orientation and gender identity.513 It urged the Council to pass a second resolution on the subject. 508 Ibid, para. 53. 509 Ibid, para. 78(h). 510 The statement is at http://arc-international.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Item-8-Ngo-Joint-Statement-Hrc29.pdf.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6f226f2b-08bd-488f-af00-e9d3e263f077": {"__data__": {"id_": "6f226f2b-08bd-488f-af00-e9d3e263f077", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f45b7232412776a76e2a3a20ae2e98efcbc9cbb64bfb00b5adddf8690b377a70"}, "2": {"node_id": "786ad0b0-cbe6-4902-9997-6a408cbf138e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e74d7f68bb9ecb9c32f6881bafa971b26fb80fb31dc027af88148d2b78317438"}}, "hash": "c4fd9f646330b4af6b10eb4aa693d4a62fc601dbeb5276000ea0c7294951d6e5", "text": "511 All four statements are on the APF website at www.asiapacificforum.net/resources/joint-nhri-statement-un-hrc-2011/, www. asiapacificforum.net/resources/joint-nhri-statement-un-hrc-2012/, www.asiapacificforum.net/resources/joint-nhri-statement-un- hrc-2013/ and www.asiapacificforum.net/resources/joint-nhri-statement-un-hrc-2014/.

By the end of the period, all 193 member States will have been reviewed. The review is based on: \u2022 the UN Charter \u2022 the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \u2022 human rights instruments to which the State is party \u2022 voluntary pledges and commitments made by the State. In addition, given the complementary and mutually interrelated nature of international human rights law and international humanitarian law, the review takes into account applicable international humanitarian law.516 The process involves: \u2022 the collection of reports and information from the State under review, UN agencies and other stakeholders, including NHRIs and NGOs \u2022 an interactive dialogue with the State under review in a working group consisting of all Human Rights Council member States, during which other States can ask questions and make recommendations to the State under review \u2022 a report on the dialogue in the working group, including all recommendations made to the State under review \u2022 the adoption of the report in a plenary session of the Human Rights Council, during which \u201cA status\u201d NHRIs and accredited NGOs can comment on the report \u2022 a response from the State under review, indicating which recommendations in the report it accepts fully or partly and which it rejects.517 The UPR report on a State contains every recommendation made by other States. The recommendations are recommendations of individual States and not of the Human Rights Council itself. The State under review can accept a recommendation fully or partly, it can keep it \u2018under consideration\u2019 or it can reject it. By the end of 2015, the UPR process had resulted in 1,110 recommendations to States on issues of human rights in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity \u2013 502 in the first cycle and 608 already in the second cycle with 39 States \u2013 more than 20 per cent of the total number \u2013 still to be reviewed. 514 General Assembly resolution 60/251, 15 March 2006, A/RES/60/251, para. 5(e). 515 The first cycle was four years, from 2008 till 2011. 516 Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, section 1 A, \u2018Basis of the review\u2019, 18 June 2007.

Chapter 5: International and regional developments in human rights law | 117 Part II International human rights law Over both cycles to the end of 2015, 159 States had received recommendations on these issues.518 All the recommendations concerned sexual orientation. Many also raised issues of gender identity but none raised issues related to sex characteristics. The comments, questions and recommendations have commonly dealt with: \u2022 criminalisation of sexual conduct between consenting adults of the same sex \u2022 other criminal penalties directly related to sexual orientation or gender identity \u2022 acts of violence and discrimination against persons based on their sexual orientation or gender identity \u2022 freedom of expression, assembly and association for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons \u2022 the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health \u2022 recognition of same-sex relationships \u2022 recognition of transgender people\u2019s gender identity in official documents \u2022 homophobic vilification and hate speech.519 518 All statistics in relation to the UPR are drawn from the UPR Info database, at www.upr-info.org/database/statistics/. UPR Info, a non-government organisation based in Geneva, has the most comprehensive database concerning the UPR and is a very useful source of information across all issues. 519 The website of ARC International provides information on all references to issues of sexual orientation and gender identity in UPR reviews on a country-by-country basis.

Human rights issues arising from sex characteristics, however, remain largely unknown in the UPR process. This significant gap in the human rights coverage of the UPR remains to be filled. 5.5.4. The General Assembly The General Assembly is yet to pass a resolution dealing specifically and comprehensively with human rights in relation to sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics. It lags behind developments in the Human Rights Council. But it has not been entirely silent on these issues. For many years now, one resolution \u2013 the resolution on extra-judicial, summary and arbitrary executions \u2013 has included specific reference to sexual orientation. In 2012, it added reference to gender identity for the first time.520 In 2014, the General Assembly adopted the resolution with 122 States in favour, none against and 66 abstentions.521 The inclusion of sexual orientation and, more recently, gender identity has not been unanimously accepted. On the contrary, each time the resolution is proposed an attempt is made in the General Assembly\u2019s Third Committee to delete the reference. That attempt is defeated each time but it has significant support nonetheless.522 In 2008, following the strategy adopted in the Human Rights Council, 66 States made the first joint statement in the General Assembly on human rights and sexual orientation and gender identity.523 The statement affirmed the universality of all human rights, the right of everyone to the enjoyment of all human rights without distinction and the principle of non-discrimination.524 It expressed concern at violations of human rights, in particular \u201cviolence, harassment, discrimination, exclusion, stigmatisation and prejudice \u2026 directed against persons in all countries in the world because of sexual orientation or gender identity\u201d. 520 General Assembly resolution 67/168, 20 December 2012, A/RES/67/168. 521 General Assembly resolution 69/182, 18 December 2014, A/RES/69/182. 522 In 2012, the amendment to delete reference to sexual orientation attracted 44 States in favour, 86 against and 31 abstentions. In 2014 the amendment attracted stronger support, 53 States in favour, 82 against and 24 abstentions.

The session was called by the United States and Chile. Thirteen of the 15 members of the Security Council, including all five permanent members, attended the session; Angola and Chad did not attend. In her opening remarks, the co-chair of the Security Council meeting, US Ambassador Samantha Power, said: This year we mark seventy years since the creation of the United Nations.

It is impossible not to see individuals like Adnan and Subhi as having the same inherent dignity and worth. And it is impossible not to take up the struggle for their rights as our own, as we have other great human rights struggles over the last seven decades. Today, we take a small but important step in assuming that work. It must not be our last step.527 The meeting was an important, though limited, first step that the Security Council needs to follow up formally, both specifically in relation to Daesh controlled territory and generally in relation to all persecution based on sexual orientation, gender identity or intersex status. The Commission on the Status of Women has a longer history of discussing issues affecting lesbians and transgender people. Lesbian and transgender activists have been active in the Commission for many years, consistently raising their issues in sessions of the Commission. However, the concluding statements of the Commission have not made any reference to sexual orientation, gender identity or sex characteristics. There is much work to be done to achieve an appropriate statement by the Commission on lesbian, transgender and intersex issues. Great difficulty remains in having international bodies and forums recognise and respond to human rights in relation to sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics. Certainly many UN agencies, including UNDP, OHCHR and UNAIDS, give attention to these issues in their programs and work. The jurisdictions of other bodies too certainly cover these issues. For example, the International Criminal Court could and should be active in pursuing crimes against humanity and war crimes that are based on sexual orientation, gender identity or sex characteristics. There is a great deal of room for improvement in the responsiveness of the international system. 525 \u201cThe \u201cArria-formula meetings\u201d are very informal, confidential gatherings which enable Security Council members to have a frank and private exchange of views, within a flexible procedural framework, with persons whom the inviting member or members of the Council (who also act as the facilitators or convenors) believe it would be beneficial to hear and/or to whom they may wish to convey a message.\u201d See www.un.org/en/sc/about/methods/bgarriaformula.shtml. 526 Daesh is also known as Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) or Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) or Islamic State (IS). 527 See http://usun.state.gov/remarks/6799. 120 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions 528 528 UN General Assembly resolution 70/1 25, September 2015, A/RES/70/1.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ecc0a95-8818-455f-a9d6-5719a1cc3e14": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ecc0a95-8818-455f-a9d6-5719a1cc3e14", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3a4b517085585a1508e65295543c532c8d9eb6780c50e1b9c6887d65f1069268"}, "2": {"node_id": "15055d0a-451a-4a57-863d-d0ca68ff0dd4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ef7ea7fc98749f7195f15d2d3cddcc7caddb2549986b69b57e22f1789921ba0b"}}, "hash": "12f327eb26898eae6d1f69c7b4ec571d43885c3d94221d1008b818b5687f487f", "text": "THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION, GENDER IDENTITY AND SEX CHARACTERISTICS On 25 September 2015, the UN General Assembly adopted the following 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with targets to be achieved by 2030, as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.528 Goal 1 End poverty in all its forms everywhere Goal 2 End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture Goal 3 Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages Goal 4 Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all Goal 5 Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls Goal 6 Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all Goal 7 Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all Goal 8 Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all Goal 9 Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation Goal 10 Reduce inequality within and among countries Goal 11 Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable Goal 12 Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns Goal 13 Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts Goal 14 Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development Goal 15 Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss Goal 16 Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels Goal 17 Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development States committed to implement the SDGs but the SDGs do not constitute binding obligations.

We emphasize the responsibilities of all States, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations, to respect, protect and promote human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction of any kind as to race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, disability or other status.\u201d530 The language of this paragraph incorporates the language of the foundation human rights treaties and so the interpretation is the same. It is now well established that \u201cother status\u201d includes sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics. The SGDs apply for the benefit of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people as much as for anyone else. Goals 10 (the equality goal) and 16 (the inclusion goal) are especially relevant but are not the only relevant goals. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people have interests and concerns in relation to all the SDGs because they experience: \u201c \u2026 social exclusion of populations on the basis of SOGIE in seven development priority areas: (1) poverty; (2) health; (3) education; (4) gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment; (5) economic growth and opportunity; (6) safe, resilient and sustainable cities and human settlements; and (7) justice and accountability.\u201d531 The SGDs offer opportunities for education and advocacy in relation to the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people. They also provide a framework for accountability for State performance of human rights obligations towards lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people.

REGIONAL PERSPECTIVES ON LAW Regional human rights systems have taken up the human rights issues associated with sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics to varying degrees, from region to region and from issue to issue. The European system has been the most active on these issues over the longest period of time but there have also been extensive responses in the inter-American system. The African system is also now beginning to address them. All regional systems have faced significant sensitivity in dealing with human rights in relation to sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics.

Both treaties have broad statements of human rights of general, inclusive application. The Convention does not specifically mention sexual orientation, gender identity or sex characteristics. The Charter specifically forbids discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation but makes no specific mention of gender identity or sex characteristics.533 The Council of Europe is a political body of representatives of all 47 European States. It is the institution through which the European Convention and other Europe-wide human rights instruments were developed. It supports the European Court of Human Rights and, in addition, has an independent Human Rights Commissioner. The European Court of Human Rights is established under the European Convention on Human Rights.534 It gave its first decision on a case involving sexual orientation in 1981, Dudgeon v United Kingdom.535 That case involved the criminalisation of adult consenting sexual relations. The Court found for the applicant, ruling that a law criminalising same-sex relations was a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights: \u2026 the maintenance in force of the impugned legislation constitutes a continuing interference with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his private life (which includes his sexual life) ... In the personal circumstances of the applicant, the very existence of this legislation continuously and directly affects his private life \u2026 either he respects the law and refrains from engaging \u2013 even in private with consenting male partners \u2013 in prohibited sexual acts to which he is disposed by reason of his homosexual tendencies, or he commits such acts and thereby becomes liable to criminal prosecution.536 532 Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, section 9(3). 533 Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, article 21.1. 534 European Convention on Human Rights, article 19. 535 Dudgeon v.

Chapter 5: International and regional developments in human rights law | 123 Part II International human rights law The first decision of the European Court of Human Rights to deal with gender identity came more than a decade after Dudgeon.537 In B v France, the applicant had had gender surgery and demonstrated a manifest determination to abandon her original sex. The Court held that the State\u2019s refusal to issue new identity documents showing the new gender was a violation of the right to private life.538 In Goodwin and I v UK, the Court held that the denial of legal recognition of the post-operative gender of transgender persons violated their right to private life. Further, the failure to permit a person to marry in accordance with post-operative gender violated the right to marry.539 Since Dudgeon, the European Court of Human Rights has decided cases concerning sexual orientation or gender identity on more than 30 occasions.540 Many of these cases concern the balance required between the rights to freedom of religion and freedom of conscience, on the one hand, and the rights of lesbian and gay persons to equality and not to experience discrimination, on the other hand. The European Court has tended to avoid definitive statements on striking the correct balance, preferring to leave that difficult task to consideration at the national level in national parliaments and courts.541 The Human Rights Commissioner of the Council of Europe has identified the human rights issues affecting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons as a priority area of concern.542 In 2011, the Commissioner released a report on discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity in Europe.543 He published issue papers on human rights and gender identity in 2009544 and on human rights and intersex people in 2015.545 The Human Rights Commissioner has been one of the first international or regional independent human rights mechanisms to addresses human rights issues relating to sex characteristics specifically and comprehensively. In May 2014, the Commissioner published a Human Rights Comment \u2013 A boy or a girl or a person \u2013 intersex people lack recognition in Europe \u2013 that highlighted the human rights challenges faced by intersex people. In 2015, he published the issues paper Human rights and intersex people.546 The issues paper discusses human rights in terms of universality: In spite of the fact that no specific provision currently refers to intersex people, the rights contained in international human rights treaties apply to all people, and thus to intersex people through the conventions\u2019 open-ended non-discrimination clauses.547 The issues paper identifies four \u201ckey human rights at stake\u201d: the right to life, the prohibition", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e825c56-fb14-4448-ac1a-909f7c8aa8ef": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e825c56-fb14-4448-ac1a-909f7c8aa8ef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4a448be7fae8147a119090b8d21938e9f8135c5e909084f64468e6d2188c6502"}, "3": {"node_id": "57497852-771c-4d4d-abc4-41889df3facc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "deadb064d621ce166217ee50f2dae7f31a4774acde370a5aab74bb69c206be73"}}, "hash": "5bffd76ca50d75466ff1087755fbb156331952b73b7571841774a1aba38e4732", "text": "of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment, the right to respect for private life, and the right to health.

Sex assignment treatment should be available to intersex individuals at an age when they can express their free and fully informed consent. Intersex persons\u2019 right not to undergo sex assignment treatment must be respected.548 Member states should facilitate the recognition of intersex individuals before the law through the expeditious provision of birth certificates, civil registration documents, identity papers, passports and other official personal documentation while respecting intersex persons\u2019 right to self-determination. Flexible procedures should be observed in assigning and reassigning sex/gender in official documents while also providing for the possibility of not choosing a specified male or female gender marker. Member states should consider the proportionality of requiring gender markers in official documents.549 The work of the Human Rights Commissioner and the decisions of the European Court for Human Rights have promoted strong commitment in the Council of Europe to the human rights of lesbian, gay and bisexual people and, more recently, transgender and intersex people.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "57497852-771c-4d4d-abc4-41889df3facc": {"__data__": {"id_": "57497852-771c-4d4d-abc4-41889df3facc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4a448be7fae8147a119090b8d21938e9f8135c5e909084f64468e6d2188c6502"}, "2": {"node_id": "5e825c56-fb14-4448-ac1a-909f7c8aa8ef", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5bffd76ca50d75466ff1087755fbb156331952b73b7571841774a1aba38e4732"}}, "hash": "deadb064d621ce166217ee50f2dae7f31a4774acde370a5aab74bb69c206be73", "text": "In 2010, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted a recommendation to member States on \u201cmeasures to combat discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity\u201d.550 The recommendation is based on the principle of universality of all human rights: \u2026 human rights are universal and shall apply to all individuals, and stressing therefore its commitment to guarantee the equal dignity of all human beings and the enjoyment of rights and freedoms of all individuals without discrimination on any ground.551 The recommendation recognises that: \u2026 lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons have been for centuries and are still subjected to homophobia, transphobia and other forms of intolerance and discrimination even within their family \u2013 including criminalisation, marginalisation, social exclusion and violence \u2013 on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity, and that specific action is required in order to ensure the full enjoyment of the human rights of these persons.552 It made four substantive recommendations to Council of Europe member States: 1. Examine existing legislative and other measures, keep them under review, and collect and analyse relevant data, in order to monitor and redress any direct or indirect discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity; 2. Ensure that legislative and other measures are adopted and effectively implemented to combat discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity, to ensure respect for the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons and to promote tolerance towards them; 3. Ensure that victims of discrimination are aware of and have access to effective legal remedies before a national authority, and that measures to combat discrimination include, where appropriate, sanctions for infringements and the provision of adequate reparation for victims of discrimination; 4.

The Americas Both the political body and the legal body of the inter-American system \u2013 respectively, the Organisation of American States (OAS) and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) \u2013 have addressed human rights issues associated with sexual orientation, gender identity and body diversity, that is, sex characteristics. In 2008, the General Assembly of the Organisation of American States adopted a resolution on human rights and sexual orientation and gender identity.559 The resolution affirmed \u201cthe principles of universality, indivisibility, and interdependence of human rights\u201d and expressed \u201cconcern about acts of violence and related human rights violations committed against individuals because of their sexual orientation and gender identity\u201d. It placed the issue on the agenda for relevant bodies of the OAS and has been followed by similar resolutions in each subsequent year. In 2013, the OAS adopted a new Inter-American Convention against All Forms of Discrimination and Intolerance.560 However, of the 35 member States of the OAS, by October 2015, only eight had signed the Convention and none had ratified or acceded to it.561 The Convention includes sexual orientation and gender identity and expression among the specifically listed grounds of prohibited discrimination.562 The IACHR has given priority to issues of sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics for some years, responding to its identification of widespread violations of human rights based on these grounds. Importantly, the IACHR\u2019s work has included the distinct issues affecting transgender and intersex people. The IACHR states that: Gay, lesbian, bisexuals, trans and intersex persons have historically been discriminated against on the basis of their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, and body diversity, and continue to be victims of discrimination, violence, persecution and other abuses; which infringes on their human rights protected by international and inter-American instruments.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6531941a-0842-457f-b3df-564c0e3d1ec4": {"__data__": {"id_": "6531941a-0842-457f-b3df-564c0e3d1ec4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "db7f33f97684aba0d12def36ff9da9c578507f4723f43d90f5c40d89c9a16130"}, "2": {"node_id": "68407e2f-b6a0-4f95-8958-42a23b56dcdd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "18aec871c095f2db57a06bb984bfeff16fad797a8f7f30c106f04a207906f58f"}}, "hash": "329094863cebcc555773051dbd23d63fdeda9035aaacd3259e16f8e0091ec51b", "text": "In performing its mission, particularly during onsite visits to countries and through public hearings, the Commission has received ample information on the situation of the rights of gay, lesbian, bisexuals, trans and intersex persons in the Americas, and in particular, the serious discrimination and violence these persons face on the basis of their sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression.563 In 2011, the IACHR adopted an action plan on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex rights as part of its strategic plan for 2011 to 2015.564 Under this Plan of Action, the IACHR will develop reports on sexual identity-derived human rights problems in the American States. The reports will focus on de jure and de facto discrimination and give visibility to the problems faced by LGTBI communities at the regional and international level. They will include recommendations for change in the realms of public policy, legislation and judicial interpretation and may be part of a hemispheric \u201cReport on the State of LGTBI Rights in the Americas\u201d issued at the end of the 24 months process. As a second element of the Plan of Action, cases alleging of discrimination based on sexual orientation will be prioritized and processed. The Commission will consider and decide cases based on draft reports. The resolution of the cases will provide access to the system for a largely ignored group of victims and, through measures of non-repetition, will promote systemic change.

Chapter 5: International and regional developments in human rights law | 127 Part II International human rights law Third, building on the OAS General Assembly resolutions since 2008 concerning human rights and sexual orientation, the Commission \u201cas consultative organ of the Organization\u201d will formulate and provide specialized technical advice in relation to the annual resolution, providing comments and recommendations to the political bodies in the process of the preparation and negotiation of the said resolution and its follow-up.565 Pursuant to the action plan, the IACHR established within its secretariat a specialised unit on the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people. In 2012\u201313, the unit focused on four areas of work: (i) preparing thematic, regional or country reports on the situation of LGBTI persons in the Americas; (ii) developing standards on the interpretation of the Inter-American human rights instruments with respect to sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and body diversity through the individual petition and case system; (iii) providing technical advice and input to states and political bodies of the Organization of American States; and (iv) monitoring the human rights situation of LGBTI persons and promoting the visibility of violations against their human rights.566 Then in 2014, the IACHR established the position of Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Persons, \u201creflect[ing] the IACHR\u2019s commitment to strengthen and reinforce its work in protecting, promoting and monitoring the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex persons\u201d.567 The IACHR Special Rapporteur is the first, and still only, specialised mechanism on the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people in any international or regional human rights system. The role of the Special Rapporteur is to: \u2022 process petitions, alleging human rights violations against all 35 OAS Member States, and requests for precautionary measures \u2022 provide specialized technical assistance to Member States and OAS political organs \u2022 prepare regional and thematic reports on the human rights of LGBTI persons, and \u2022 monitor and promote visibility of human rights violations of LGBTI persons.568 5.6.3. Africa Consciousness of human rights violations based on sexual orientation, gender identity and intersex status has developed slowly within the African regional human rights system, more slowly than in other regional systems. Nonetheless, there is clear acknowledgement of the universality of human rights and the entitlement of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people to their enjoyment. There has been no specific reference to intersex people\u2019s human rights issues. At its 55th ordinary session in April-May 2014, the African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights (ACHPR) adopted the Resolution on Protection against Violence and other Human Rights Violations against Persons on the basis of their real or imputed Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity.569 The resolution followed some years of reflection of human rights issues affecting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and strong submissions from African and international NGOs.

The ACHPR\u2019s Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders, Commissioner Reine Alapini Gansou, has been especially vocal in defence of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender defenders by: \u2022 issuing public statements expressing concern for these defenders, for example, in relation to the Same Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Act 2013 in Nigeria572 and the Anti-Homosexuality Act 2014 in Uganda573 \u2022 speaking at international regional meetings on human rights defenders and on human rights and sexual orientation and gender identity574 \u2022 highlighting issues in relation to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender defenders at the NGO Forum before the sessions of the African Commission. 5.6.4. Asia Pacific Uniquely among the world\u2019s regions, the Asia Pacific has no regional human rights treaty, court or protection system that people can turn to when their human rights are violated. In the ASEAN sub-region, the ASEAN Inter-Governmental Commission on Human Rights (AICHR) was established in 2009. The AICHR is a \u201cconsultative intergovernmental body\u201d that works to promote human rights within the region, including through enhanced regional cooperation.575 However, it is not comparable to the regional human rights institutions in other regions as it is not an independent body and it is not based on an underlying treaty. It therefore has no function or power to enforce specific rights and obligations, apart from a commitment to upholding universal human rights standards. Its terms of reference require it to \u201cengage in dialogue and consultation\u201d with a range of stakeholders, including 570 Ibid. 571 Ibid. 572 See www.achpr.org/press/2014/02/d190/. 573 See www.achpr.org/press/2014/03/d196/. 574 See www.achpr.org/files/sessions/56th/inter-act-reps/220/56os_intersession_report_comm_gansou_en.pdf. 575 Terms of reference, article 3; at http://aichr.org/about/.

NGOs and NHRIs.576 To date, very little collaboration has taken place. The AICHR has not said or done anything directly relevant to the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people. The AICHR drafted an ASEAN Human Rights Declaration, adopted by ASEAN Heads of State and Government on 18 November 2012.577 The Declaration does not refer specifically to sexual orientation, gender identity or sex characteristics but it has the same universalist and inclusive approach found in international human rights law and its language largely mirrors the language in international human rights instruments. It provides, for example: Every person is entitled to the rights and freedoms set forth herein, without distinction of any kind, such as race, gender, age, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, economic status, birth, disability or other status.578 In doing so, it inevitably invites interpretation through existing international jurisprudence, including the interpretation of \u201cother status\u201d as including sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics. In this regional context, the APF makes a unique contribution. The APF is a coalition of NHRIs from all corners of the Asia and Pacific region. A fundamental goal of the APF is to support the establishment of independent NHRIs in the region and to strengthen its members to do the work of promoting and protecting human rights. The APF brings its members together and builds partnerships with others to tackle some of the most serious and complex human rights challenges facing our region. The APF has played a leadership role in the Asia Pacific in recognising and addressing human rights issues associated with sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics. The APF\u2019s work on human rights issues of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people is discussed in Chapter 7 of this manual. 576 Ibid, article 4.8.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "36820dcd-0850-4843-b00b-dd1dff995db4": {"__data__": {"id_": "36820dcd-0850-4843-b00b-dd1dff995db4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3997e9de2d83101c40a2fae8c0d93606b624be123a332cad7966c146ecf59b7b"}, "2": {"node_id": "8cb3bb02-a82b-432c-8fbf-77cbb685910b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3bc565d8aad94e3af1af47b4400c51bf63ce27afd9075a53946c5ad32dc41af1"}}, "hash": "fc8479f931dec3933a21c640c6a1efdf703a4d67266df28c58bed57565e6b904", "text": "576 Ibid, article 4.8. 577 See www.asean.org/storage/images/resources/ASEAN%20Publication/2013%20(7.%20Jul)%20-%20ASEAN%20Human%20 Rights%20Declaration%20(AHRD)%20and%20Its%20Translation.pdf. 578 ASEAN Human Rights Declaration, article 2. 130 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions KEY POINTS: CHAPTER 5 \u2022 In all countries in all regions people experience human rights violations based on their sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics. \u2022 Although there is no specific reference to sexual orientation, gender identity or sex characteristics in international human rights instruments, there can no longer be any doubt that the provisions of international human rights law extend in full to all people, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people.

Chapter 6: The Yogyakarta Principles | 131 Part II International human rights law Chapter 6: The Yogyakarta Principles 6.1. INTRODUCTION The Principles on the Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (the Yogyakarta Principles) are the most authoritative statement of what international human rights law obliges States to do and not do in promoting and protecting the rights of persons of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities.579 They are also relevant for persons of diverse sex characteristics as they are based on the principle of the universality of all human rights for everyone, everywhere. They have particular significance for NHRIs. The Yogyakarta Principles reflect existing international legal obligations under international human rights law.580 They are not an aspirational statement of what the law should be but a legal statement of what the law is. For that reason there are some issues that the Yogyakarta Principles do not cover because, in 2006, international law itself did not deal with those issues.581 The Principles recognise that international law continues to develop and that, as a result, the Principles: \u2026 will require revision on a regular basis in order to take account of developments in that law and its application to the particular lives and experiences of persons of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities over time and in diverse regions and countries.582 6.1.1. Why develop principles? In 2005, representatives of a number of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender NGOs and of a few generalist international human rights NGOs discussed strategies to build international support for better promotion and protection for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. A very small number of intersex people also participated and contributed. All those involved were concerned that 579 The Yogyakarta Principles are set out in full in Appendix 4. They are available in all six UN languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Spanish and Russian) at www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/. Unofficial translations are available in other languages, including Catalan, Dutch, Euskara (Basque), Filipino, German, Hungarian, Indonesian, Lithuanian, Nepali, Persian (Farsi), Portuguese, Sinhala, Slovak and Tamil. These translations are all accessible at www.ypinaction.org/content/Principles_Unofficial_Translatio. There may be other unofficial translations too. An activists\u2019 guide to the Yogyakarta Principles, 2010, available in English, French, German and Spanish, is at www.ypinaction.org/content/activists_guide. 580 See M. O\u2019Flaherty and J. Fisher, \u2018Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and International Human Rights Law: Contextualising the Yogyakarta Principles\u2019 in Human Rights Law Review 8:2, 2008, pp. 207-248. 581 One example is same-sex marriage. The Yogyakarta Experts in 2006 considered that international law did not deal with this issue and so it is not incorporated in the Principles. Some issues relating to equal treatment of relationships are dealt with, however, because the Experts considered that those aspects were covered by existing international law at the time; see Principle 24. 582 Preambular Paragraph 9.

It was proposed that the Principles have a tri-partite function. In the first place they should constitute a \u2018mapping\u2019 of the experiences of human rights violations experienced by people of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities. This exercise should be as inclusive and wide ranging as possible, taking account of the distinct ways in which human rights violations may be experienced in different regions of the world. Second, the application of international human rights law to such experiences should be articulated in as clear and precise a manner as possible. Finally, the Principles should spell out in some detail the nature of the obligation on States for effective implementation of each of the human rights obligations.583 The International Service for Human Rights (ISHR), a generalist international human rights NGO, agreed to lead and coordinate the project, with the support of the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), another generalist international human rights NGO. The Experts\u2019 Group was co-chaired by Sonia Onufer Correa of Brazil and Professor Vitit Muntarbhorn of Thailand. The rapporteur was Professor Michael O\u2019Flaherty of Ireland. In their introduction to the Yogyakarta Principles the co-chairs presented the basis for the development of the Principles. [H]uman rights violations targeted toward persons because of their actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity constitute a global and entrenched pattern of serious concern. They include extra-judicial killings, torture and ill-treatment, sexual assault and rape, invasions of privacy, arbitrary detention, denial of employment and education opportunities, and serious discrimination in relation to the enjoyment of other human rights. These violations are often compounded by experiences of other forms of violence, hatred, discrimination and exclusion, such as those based on race, age, religion, disability, or economic, social or other status. Many States and societies impose gender and sexual orientation norms on individuals through custom, law and violence and seek to control how they experience personal relationships and how they identify themselves. The policing of sexuality remains a major force behind continuing gender-based violence and gender inequality. \u2026 the international response to human rights violations based on sexual orientation and gender identity has been fragmented and inconsistent. To address these deficiencies a consistent understanding of the comprehensive regime of international human rights law and its application to issues of sexual orientation and gender identity is necessary. It is critical to collate and clarify State obligations under existing international human rights law, in order to promote and protect all human rights for all persons on the basis of equality and without discrimination.584 6.1.2. The Yogyakarta Experts\u2019 Group The Experts\u2019 Group included both legal expertise and expertise in lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender experiences. It had 29 members: lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender activists and advocates, one intersex activist, UN special procedures and treaty monitoring body members, judges, academics and 583 M.

Of the 29 members of the Experts\u2019 Group, 17 were women. The group met at Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, from 6-9 November 2006. They had worked on a draft of the Principles prior to the meeting, discussed the draft and developed it further over the four days of the meeting, and then refined it and finalised it afterwards.

The notions of sexual orientation and gender identity are fluid. Requiring a person to subscribe to a particular identity group would only perpetuate the oppression that the rights are seeking to combat. None of the rights in the Principles can be considered particular or unique to one group, but rather are enjoyed by all.586 The Yogyakarta Experts\u2019 Group thought it necessary to define clearly what they meant by \u2018sexual orientation\u2019 and \u2018gender identity\u2019. These terms had not previously been defined in international law. There had been many comments in international forums, such as the UN Commission on Human Rights, that the terms were unclear and so should not be used in international resolutions and other official documents. However, States making such comments did so more to obstruct reference to sexual orientation and gender identity than to seek to clarify the terms. The Experts therefore thought it necessary to end this argument by providing definitions. In the Preamble they say that they understand: \u2026 \u2018sexual orientation\u2019 to refer to each person\u2019s capacity for profound emotional, affectional and sexual attraction to, and intimate and sexual relations with, individuals of a different gender or the same gender or more than one gender587 \u2026 \u2018gender identity\u2019 to refer to each person\u2019s deeply felt internal and individual experience of gender, which may or may not correspond with the sex assigned at birth, including the personal sense of the body (which may involve, if freely chosen, modification of bodily appearance or function by medical, surgical or other means) and other expressions of gender, including dress, speech and mannerisms.588 The definition of gender identity is wide enough to include gender expression. In fact, it specifically includes \u201cexpressions of gender, including dress, speech and mannerisms\u201d.589 The Yogyakarta Principles do not specifically distinguish intersex status or sex characteristics in their application. They do not deal with the full range of human rights issues affecting intersex people. 585 The full list of the 29 members of the Experts\u2019 Group is at Appendix 5. 586 An activists\u2019 guide to the Yogyakarta Principles, 2010, p. 23; at www.ypinaction.org/content/activists_guide. 587 Preambular Paragraph 4. 588 Preambular Paragraph 5. 589 Ibid. 134 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions 6.2.

They were ground-breaking in that this had not been attempted previously. However, they did not seek to make new law or to assert what the law should be. 6.2.2. The 29 principles The 29 principles can be grouped into eight broad areas of human rights. Rights to universal enjoyment of human rights, non-discrimination and recognition before the law: Principles 1 to 3 set out the principles of the universality of human rights and their application to all persons without discrimination, as well as the right of all people to recognition before the law. Rights to human and personal security: Principles 4 to 11 address fundamental rights to life, freedom from violence and torture, privacy, access to justice and freedom from arbitrary detention. Economic, social and cultural rights: Principles 12 to 18 set out the importance of non- discrimination in the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights, including employment, accommodation, social security, education and health. Rights to expression, opinion and association: Principles 19 to 21 emphasise the importance of the freedom to express oneself, one\u2019s identity and one\u2019s sexuality, without State interference based on sexual orientation or gender identity, including the rights to participate peacefully in public assemblies and events and otherwise associate in community with others. Freedom of movement and asylum: Principles 22 and 23 highlight the rights of persons to seek asylum from persecution based on sexual orientation or gender identity. 590 Preambular Paragraph 1. 591 Preambular Paragraph 2. 592 Preambular Paragraph 3. 593 Preambular Paragraphs 4 and 5. 594 Preambular Paragraph 6. 595 Preambular Paragraph 7. 596 Preambular Paragraphs 8 and 9. 136 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions Rights of participation in cultural and family life: Principles 24 to 26 address the rights of persons to participate in family life, public affairs and the cultural life of their community, without discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Rights of human rights defenders: Principle 27 recognises the right to defend and promote human rights without discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, and the obligation of States to ensure the protection of human rights defenders working in these areas. Rights of redress and accountability: Principles 28 and 29 affirm the importance of holding rights violators accountable and ensuring appropriate redress for those who face rights violations.597 Each principle takes a common form. Principle 3, which expresses the right to recognition before the law, provides an example of this common form. First, each principle expresses the relevant international human rights law. In doing so, it expresses the law in terms of its application in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity. Through its universality and inclusiveness, each principle also applies to intersex persons. Principle 3 begins with a general statement of the right to recognition before the law as found in international human rights law. Everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law.598 Second, each principle describes how this right applies in relation to relevant issues of sexual orientation and gender identity. Principle 3 says, in relation to the right to recognition before the law: Persons of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities shall enjoy legal capacity in all aspects of life. Each person\u2019s self-defined sexual orientation and gender identity is integral to their personality and is one of the most basic aspects of self-determination, dignity and freedom. No one shall be forced to undergo medical procedures, including sex reassignment surgery, sterilisation or hormonal therapy, as a requirement for legal recognition of their gender identity. No status, such as marriage or parenthood, may be invoked as such to prevent the legal recognition of a person\u2019s gender identity.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "13ab0aae-2ee3-49cb-b8c3-ec7bb3b4272b": {"__data__": {"id_": "13ab0aae-2ee3-49cb-b8c3-ec7bb3b4272b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b525ccbbe287536805c225a098359672473bdfd1c06eea919ac833fee523d34a"}, "2": {"node_id": "853689a8-2031-484b-bc1f-b58cf5c9baae", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "db9d8e8403646edef94cf9b983bdcde17198e94ea7d451bb629163e961582f8d"}}, "hash": "f6131b1a18fd32056ff501a0cb26348a3f2d9dfd07060d6743ac79220fce2068", "text": "No one shall be subjected to pressure to conceal, suppress or deny their sexual orientation or gender identity.599 Third, each principle sets out the obligations of States in respect of that aspect of international human rights law.

Some parts of international law impose obligations on individuals or actors that are not States but, predominantly, international law imposes obligations on States. Principle 3 lists six State obligations relating to the right to recognition before the law. States shall: A. Ensure that all persons are accorded legal capacity in civil matters, without discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, and the opportunity to exercise that capacity, including equal rights to conclude contracts, and to administer, own, acquire (including through inheritance), manage, enjoy and dispose of property; B. Take all necessary legislative, administrative and other measures to fully respect and legally recognise each person\u2019s self-defined gender identity; C. Take all necessary legislative, administrative and other measures to ensure that procedures exist whereby all State-issued identity papers which indicate a person\u2019s gender/sex \u2013 including birth certificates, passports, electoral records and other documents \u2013 reflect the person\u2019s profound self-defined gender identity; 597 The Yogyakarta Principles \u2013 an overview; at www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/principles_en.htm. 598 Principle 3. 599 Ibid. Chapter 6: The Yogyakarta Principles | 137 Part II International human rights law D. Ensure that such procedures are efficient, fair and non-discriminatory, and respect the dignity and privacy of the person concerned; E. Ensure that changes to identity documents will be recognised in all contexts where the identification or disaggregation of persons by gender is required by law or policy; F. Undertake targeted programmes to provide social support for all persons experiencing gender transitioning or reassignment.600 6.2.3. The additional recommendations Having recognised the obligations of States as the principal duty bearers in international human rights law, the Yogyakarta Experts assert: All members of society and of the international community have responsibilities regarding the realisation of human rights.601 Therefore, after setting out the 29 principles, they make 16 \u2018additional recommendations\u2019 directed to these other actors: \u2022 United Nations officials, agencies and mechanisms, including the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Human Rights Council, the special procedures, the Economic and Social Council, the treaty monitoring bodies, the World Health Organization, UNAIDS and the High Commissioner for Refugees \u2022 regional and sub-regional inter-governmental organisations, human rights treaty bodies and courts \u2022 human rights NGOs \u2022 humanitarian organisations \u2022 NHRIs \u2022 professional and commercial organisations \u2022 mass media \u2022 governmental and private funders.602 In addressing NHRIs, the Yogyakarta Experts recommend that: National human rights institutions promote respect for these Principles by State and non-State actors, and integrate into their work the promotion and protection of the human rights of persons of diverse sexual orientations or gender identities.603 6.3. WHAT THE YOGYAKARTA PRINCIPLES DO NOT SAY The Yogyakarta Principles are not the last word on human rights in relation to sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics. On the contrary, there were gaps and deficiencies in their coverage at the time; for example, in the absence of proper discussion of human rights issues affecting intersex people. The Principles themselves acknowledge too that international law is still developing. They reflect the state of the law when they were drafted and adopted in late 2006. As a result, the Yogyakarta Principles: 600 Ibid. 601 Additional Recommendations. 602 Ibid. 603 Ibid, para L. 138 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions \u2026 will require revision on a regular basis in order to take account of developments in that law and its application to the particular lives and experiences of persons of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities over time and in diverse regions and countries.604 6.3.1.

Terminology today is more likely to refer to \u201cunnecessary surgical and other procedures for the purpose of trying to make their appearance conform to binary sex stereotypes\u201d, rather than to \u201cmedical procedures \u2026 to impose a gender identity\u201d.607 These inclusions reflect the fact that, at the time of drafting the Yogyakarta Principles, the Experts saw the Principles as covering intersex people. The terminology used was sexual orientation and gender identity but gender identity was defined broadly, to include \u201ceach person\u2019s deeply felt internal and individual experience of gender\u201d, a person\u2019s \u201cpersonal sense of the body\u201d and \u201cother expressions of gender\u201d.608 Arguably this was an attempt, however inadequate, to incorporate human rights violations beyond those experienced by transgender and transsexual people. Understanding, and consequently terminology, has evolved since the Yogyakarta Principles were drafted. It is clearer today that the human rights issues that intersex people face are distinct from those experienced by transgender people. While there are some overlaps, being intersex is about physical, bodily difference, not gender identity. Similarly, the jurisprudence of human rights treaty monitoring bodies and the UN special procedures has evolved since the Yogyakarta Principles were drafted.609 There is now more material to draw on to articulate the most pressing human rights violations affecting intersex people. These include violations of the right to physical integrity, freedom from torture and ill- treatment, and the right to live free from harmful practices. The framework of universality ensures that human rights apply to all people and that the Yogyakarta Principles have important application to intersex people, in addition to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. However, the inadequacy of the Yogyakarta Principles for intersex people requires that more work be done to address the application of human rights law in relation to sex characteristics. 604 Preambular Paragraph 9. 605 Preambular Paragraph 3. 606 Principle 18(b). 607 OHCHR Factsheet Intersex, 2015, p. 1. 608 Preambular Paragraph 5. 609 See Chapter 4 of this manual. Chapter 6: The Yogyakarta Principles | 139 Part II International human rights law 6.3.2. Gender identity An academic review refers to the success of the Yogyakarta Principles in securing international legal recognition of gender identity, which, it said, \u2018might well be the greatest success of the Yogyakarta Principles\u2019. Before the Yogyakarta Principles\u2019 launch, there was not a single mention of the term in any soft law instrument or treaty body opinion. Interpretation of regional instruments was limited to Europe. Since the launch of the Yogyakarta Principles, international lawmakers have referenced gender identity with greater frequency. For example, every UN agency handbook containing a reference to gender identity cites the Principles. The term gender identity was added to the Draft OAS Convention against Racism and all Forms of Discrimination and Intolerance at the behest of Brazil, after it adopted the Principles as part of its Brazil Without Homophobia campaign. The Principles may have been an impetus for the recent OAS Declaration on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation, and Gender Identity, as well as a statement read at the UN General Assembly in December by the Argentine ambassador on behalf of sixty-six nations, both of which contain references to gender identity. Since the launch of the Yogyakarta Principles, gender identity has also appeared for the first time in a national constitution, a supreme court decision, and national human rights policies. The addition of gender identity into the international human rights lexicon may prove, with time, to have been the Yogyakarta Principles\u2019 greatest accomplishment.610 However, the Yogyakarta Principles do not provide comprehensive, specific coverage of human rights in relation to all aspects of gender identity as they define it.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4b74ca9c-0230-4a29-96b2-37365c7ce83f": {"__data__": {"id_": "4b74ca9c-0230-4a29-96b2-37365c7ce83f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d2cdf83ca7c94fe36c776db7a599938495408c9e7a717a8382410d3ed2c181b7"}, "2": {"node_id": "93790599-548f-4203-a93e-f5e351ec19a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "940f97ac23f70e9e4fd680cfa3f1ca238071eaa1f7e7bdcac243b1c7b6a3d0a2"}}, "hash": "2dfb139ce64b031f28194888c646ee562fb11c66f498494f55d61fb3993ed439", "text": "There is recognition of issues relating to gender expression, for example, but comprehensive discussion remains to be done. 6.3.3.

Thoughts and stories of being Being LGBTI by Being LGBTI in Asia. 140 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions Principle 24 first affirms the right to found a family, without discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. It reflects and affirms the diversity of family forms and says that States must act to recognise and protect families in all that diversity.612 It makes a number of specific statements on the obligations of States, including in relation to adoption and access to assisted procreation.613 It acknowledges, consistent with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, that, in all actions and decisions affecting children, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.614 The statements on family diversity tend to be non-specific. There is no specific reference, for example, to families consisting of a same-sex couple with or without children, or of the particular issues affecting families in which one or both adults are transgender or intersex. Although the provision is very inclusive, more specific treatment of the diversity of family forms would assist better understanding and application of international law in this area. Principle 24 makes three statements on the obligations of States concerning same sex relationships: e) Take all necessary legislative, administrative and other measures to ensure that in States that recognise same-sex marriages or registered partnerships, any entitlement, privilege, obligation or benefit available to different-sex married or registered partners is equally available to same-sex married or registered partners; f) Take all necessary legislative, administrative and other measures to ensure that any obligation, entitlement, privilege or benefit available to different-sex unmarried partners is equally available to same-sex unmarried partners; g) Ensure that marriages and other legally-recognised partnerships may be entered into only with the free and full consent of the intending spouses or partners. The statements are based on jurisprudence at the time.615 Principle 24 does not assert a right to marriage for same-sex couples. Rather, it says that, where a same-sex relationship is granted some form of State recognition, then the couple should have the same entitlements as a different-sex couple in the same kind of relationship. That is, the same kind of recognised relationship should give the same kind of entitlements. This means that: \u2022 if a State recognises same-sex marriage, then a married same-sex couple must have the same entitlements as a married different-sex couple \u2022 if a State recognises same-sex registered partnership, then a registered same-sex couple must have the same entitlements as a registered different-sex couple \u2022 if a State grants entitlements to an unmarried different-sex couple, then it must grant the same entitlements to an unmarried same-sex couple. Since the Yogyakarta Principles were adopted, the application of the principle of equality and non- discrimination in relation to same-sex relationships has been considered frequently, especially in national courts. There is now substantial jurisprudence holding that human rights law, in particular the principle of equality and non-discrimination, requires the recognition of marriage between two persons of the same sex. There were early decisions in the Constitutional Court of South Africa and in superior courts in Canada.616 In 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States also held that laws denying same-sex marriage were unconstitutional because they infringed the guarantee of equality.617 612 Principle 24(b). 613 Principle 24(a). 614 Principle 24(c). 615 See for example Human Rights Committee, X v.

Non-State actors The Yogyakarta Principles also need to be updated to reflect developments in international law on the human rights obligations of non-State actors. International law predominantly concerns State responsibility and the Yogyakarta Principles reflect that. The 29 principles are all addressed to State obligations. Nonetheless, the Yogyakarta Principles also contain 16 \u2018additional recommendations\u2019 addressed to a variety of international organisations and agencies and non-State actors. Only one of the \u2018additional recommendations\u2019 was addressed to business. Its scope is very limited, directed principally towards the workforce: Commercial organisations acknowledge and act upon the important role they have in both ensuring respect for these Principles with regard to their own workforces and in promoting these Principles nationally and internationally.618 618 Additional Recommendation N. Photo by Fibonacci Blue, reproduced under a CC BY 2.0 license. 142 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions In the ten years since the Yogyakarta Principles were adopted, international law has articulated more effective provisions on the human rights responsibilities of business. In 2011, the Human Rights Council adopted the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights for implementing the UN \u201cProtect, Respect and Remedy\u201d Framework.619 The Framework provides ample opportunity for business to be active implementers and advocates of human rights in relation to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people. The additional recommendations are similarly limited in scope in addressing other actors. The one recommendation addressed to NGOs says: Non-governmental organisations working on human rights at the national, regional and international levels promote respect for these Principles within the framework of their specific mandates.620 Principle 16, on the right to education, lists state obligations but does not address schools directly. Pointing to these gaps and deficiencies does not detract in any way from the significance of the Yogyakarta Principles. They remain the most important and the most authoritative statement of the application of international human rights law in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity and, by extension, in relation to sex characteristics. But they are not the last word on the subject. 6.4. THE YOGYAKARTA PRINCIPLES SINCE YOGYAKARTA The Yogyakarta Principles were adopted almost ten years ago. Since then, they have been cited frequently by human rights treaty monitoring bodies, UN special procedures, senior UN officials, regional human rights mechanisms and national courts. Many States have made public policy statements of acceptance of the Yogyakarta Principles and have referred to them in statements to the Human Rights Council and in other international human rights forums. Most importantly, there has been no expert legal challenge to their accuracy as a statement of the applicable international human rights law in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity. However, the Yogyakarta Principles have not yet been referred to specifically in resolutions of any UN political forum, such as the Human Rights Council or the General Assembly. 6.4.1. References by international human rights mechanisms The first significant reference to the Yogyakarta Principles came in 2009, only two years after their release, when the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights adopted the definitions of sexual orientation and gender identity in the Yogyakarta Principles for the purposes of its General Comment 20 on non-discrimination in economic, social and cultural rights.621 Soon after, they were cited in annual reports of the special procedures on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism,622 on the right to health,623 on the right to education,624 and on torture.625 These special procedures referred approvingly to specific provisions in the Yogyakarta Principles in support of the points they were making in their reports. They expressly endorsed specific principles relevant to their own mandates.

Chapter 6: The Yogyakarta Principles | 143 Part II International human rights law A very important contribution to thinking in this area was made by the 2006 Yogyakarta Principles on the application of international human rights law in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity. The Special Rapporteur fully endorses the precepts of Principle 16, referring specifically to the right to education.626 In 2011, the Committee against Torture referred to the Yogyakarta Principles for the first time in its concluding observations on State reports and made recommendations to States relating to compliance with provisions of the Yogyakarta Principles. In reviewing Finland, the Committee recommended that Finland: \u2026 consider using the Yogyakarta Principles on the application of international human rights law in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity as a guide to assist in the development of its policies.627 The Committee against Torture also recommended to Mongolia: The State party should ensure the protection of vulnerable groups such as sexual minorities, persons living with HIV/AIDS, and some foreigners. The State party should establish effective policing, enforcement and complaints mechanisms with a view to ensuring prompt, thorough and impartial investigations into allegations of attacks against persons on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity in line with the Yogyakarta Principles on the Application of International Human Rights Law in Relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity.628 6.4.2. References at regional and national levels The Yogyakarta Principles have also been cited positively in decisions of national courts, including, in the Asia Pacific region, those of Australia,629 India630 and Nepal.631 The High Commissioner for Human Rights commented in 2011 that: Some States, including Brazil, Ecuador, Germany, the Netherlands and Uruguay, have used the Yogyakarta Principles to help guide policy responses to incidents of violence and discrimination.632 626 Special Rapporteur on the right to education, 23 July 2010, A/65/162, para. 23. 627 Committee against Torture, Concluding Observations: Finland, 30 May 2011, CAT/C/FIN/CO/5-6 2011, para. 24. 628 Committee against Torture, Concluding Observations: Mongolia, 20 January 2011, CAT/C/MNG/CO/1, para. 25. 629 In re Alex, Family Court of Australia, 6 May 2009. 630 Naz Foundation v.

However, within the framework of the universality of all human rights, they apply for the benefit of intersex people. \u2022 The Yogyakarta Principles contain nine preambular paragraphs and 29 principles, as well as additional recommendations addressed to many human rights actors, including NHRIs. \u2022 The Yogyakarta Principles were quickly accepted and cited by international human rights mechanisms, senior UN officials, regional human rights mechanisms and many States, NHRIs and NGOs. They have not yet been officially recognised in resolutions of UN political forums. \u2022 Asia Pacific NHRIs and the APF have responded quickly to the recommendation in the Yogyakarta Principles addressed to them. Their activities are increasing in number and scope.

INTRODUCTION The Yogyakarta Principles addressed one recommendation specifically to NHRIs. The recommendation was that: [n]ational human rights institutions promote respect for these Principles by State and non-State actors, and integrate into their work the promotion and protection of the human rights of persons of diverse sexual orientations or gender identities.643 NHRIs in the Asia Pacific region and the APF have responded positively to this recommendation. Human rights issues relating to sexual orientation and gender identity had first been raised in an APF forum at the 11th Annual Meeting in 2006 in Fiji. In 2008, at the 13th Annual Meeting, APF Forum Councillors agreed to include sexual orientation and gender identity in the APF work plan, beginning with a regional workshop. Since then, the APF and its member NHRIs have been active in addressing human rights issues in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity. More recently they have begun to address issues relating to sex characteristics. These activities of the APF and its member NHRIs are consistent with the recommendation of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in 2015 that: \u2026 national human rights institutions address violence and discrimination against LGBT and intersex persons in the context of their respective mandates to promote and monitor effective implementation of international human rights standards at the national level.644 643 Additional Principles para L. 644 High Commissioner for Human Rights, Discrimination and violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity, 4 May 2015, A/HRC/29/23, para. 80.

The program The workshop had the benefit of significant presentations from the invited experts. Ms Correa and Professors Muntarbhorn and O\u2019Flaherty guided the participants through the Yogyakarta Principles and discussed what they meant for NHRIs. Ibu Musdah Mulia presented a challenging paper on \u2018Understanding sexuality in Islam \u2013 promoting the appreciation of human dignity\u2019.648 Mr Fisher and Ms Correa spoke about western and Latin American experiences of human rights in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity. Professor Muntarbhorn also spoke about Asian culture and issues of sexual orientation and gender identity. Bapak Marzuki addressed issues associated with ASEAN politics. Individual NHRIs reported on their work on these issues.649 They also discussed the sensitivity of the issues in many societies and the difficulties they faced in raising and responding to human rights violations based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Some NHRIs described a broad program of activities on the issues, while others said that they could do little at that stage. The participants did not ignore these difficulties but grappled with them openly and honestly. 7.2.4. The Conclusions The participants adopted Conclusions at the end of the workshop. The Conclusions began by affirming the universality of all human rights and condemning \u201cstereotyping, exclusion, stigmatisation, prejudice, intolerance, discrimination and violence\u201d.650 They described the mandate of NHRIs and said this mandate \u201cextends to those who suffer human rights violations based on their actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity\u201d. They recognised the frequent experience of serious human rights violations in the Asia Pacific region on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. They realistically accepted the limitations of the NHRIs\u2019 responses to date and the sensitivities in dealing with the issues.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "42817470-bbac-4e0e-98c6-5b3ff866ede7": {"__data__": {"id_": "42817470-bbac-4e0e-98c6-5b3ff866ede7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1a6037f794ef96aa447737c058dd83dc0a900b3525d27866979d84aa4815806a"}, "2": {"node_id": "10c5d407-ac8d-492c-a57e-35585f1027fa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "958a8beabf7fd0d3b6eb2d2d624aef7ce92542453776ef17158320f1ae1c49d3"}}, "hash": "fede2dc03c7a956e7a7bc95faa7e337cbd36644f0dcbb965f85471d7ef2f2da9", "text": "The workshop recognised that this was the first occasion on which some national human rights institutions had discussed these issues ...

THE APF ADVISORY COUNCIL OF JURISTS ADVISORY OPINION, 2010 7.3.1. Introduction The Advisory Council of Jurists (ACJ) was established by the APF at its 3rd Annual Meeting in 1998.656 The establishment of the ACJ reflects our recognition of the need for access to independent, authoritative advice on international human rights issues and to develop regional jurisprudence relating to the interpretation and application of international human rights standards.657 The ACJ consists of one eminent jurist \u2013 a serving or retired senior judge or senior academic \u2013 from each full (or A status) APF member\u2019s country, nominated by that member for election by the APF Annual Meeting. It therefore brings together the breadth of jurisprudence from legal systems in the Asia Pacific region, with their divergent traditions and cultures. It undertakes studies and research and develops conclusions and recommendations on references from the APF Annual Meeting. It proceeds by consensus. Acting on the recommendation of the APF Yogyakarta Workshop on human rights in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity, the 9th Annual Meeting in 2009 provided a reference to the ACJ to report, in relation to each State of a member institution of the APF, on: (i) Whether, and in what respects, that State\u2019s criminal law is consistent with international human rights law in its application to and effect on persons on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity; (ii) Whether, and in what respects, that State\u2019s anti-discrimination law applies to protect the human rights of persons on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity and the adequacy of that protection; 654 The report of the New Zealand Human Rights Commission made reference specifically to human rights issues affecting intersex people in New Zealand and to the Commission\u2019s work on these issues. See www.asiapacificforum.net/resources/new-zealand- 2009-yogyakarta-principles-workshop/. 655 See Chapter 1. 656 Statement of conclusions, Third APF Annual Meeting, 7-9 September 1998, Jakarta, Indonesia, p. 2; at www.asiapacificforum. net/resources/apf-3-concluding-statement/. 657 See www.asiapacificforum.net/support/advice-and-expertise/acj/. Chapter 7: The APF\u2019s response to the Yogyakarta Principles | 153 Part III What national human rights institutions can do (iii) Whether, and in what respects, that State\u2019s laws enable the official recognition of changes of gender identity from that assigned to a person at birth and the consistency of those laws with international human rights law; (iv) Whether, in the course of undertaking the reference, the ACJ has identified other laws, policies, acts or practices that impact adversely persons on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, and, if so, the extent to which those laws, policies, acts or practices are inconsistent with international human rights law and the nature of the inconsistency; and (v) Whether the law, policy and practice in a State is adequate to ensure the protection of the rights of persons and organisations that defend the human rights of persons of diverse sexual orientation and gender identity.658 The ACJ provided an initial report on its reference at the Annual Meeting in August 2009, where the draft report was discussed by ACJ members and with the APF Forum Council. It issued its final report in December 2010.659 7.3.2. Findings The ACJ reported: The interpretations by UN Treaty Bodies, Special Procedures and regional human rights mechanisms evince a clear acknowledgment that sexual orientation and gender identity are among the grounds of discrimination proscribed by international human rights law. The authoritative pronouncements of the HRC demonstrate how anti-sodomy laws violate Article 17 of the ICCPR, are a violation of the prohibition against discrimination in Article 2 and are in violation of the equality requirements in Article 26.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3ee9317c-75f9-4a49-a80b-fc12730021ca": {"__data__": {"id_": "3ee9317c-75f9-4a49-a80b-fc12730021ca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6d4905c1c278666dc6c941d07a67d9393b94f57f691c9bd28b79a3a79c577bd1"}, "2": {"node_id": "aa2de63b-ca1a-4e82-abbe-7b029ffb495e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "72fe9ac2b2a01ca03c45ac25b0cdc5d789ccb8d8882a6df29c51b135045ba68f"}}, "hash": "cc807fde27c63d50a9d229a2b0e521454acfdbf74f74f4453ffdec9e855d81a0", "text": "Conversely, their pronouncements clearly reject the assertion that sexual orientation or gender identity cannot be protected simply because sexual orientation and gender identity are not \u2018expressly\u2019 mentioned in the grounds of discrimination enumerated in international human rights treaties. \u2026 This approach has begun to find favour in the domestic courts of the Asia Pacific region, with the judiciary a pro-active force in ensuring that universal human rights apply to persons of diverse sexual orientation and gender identity.

The ACJ examined each of its terms of reference in turn. It began with the criminal law and with the criminalisation of same-sex relations. Perhaps the most egregious violation of international human rights law with regard to persons of diverse sexual orientation and gender is the existence of laws criminalising same sex sexual conduct between consenting adults. \u2026 658 APF, ACJ Report: Human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity, 2010, p. 7; at www.asiapacificforum.net/resources/acj- report-sogi/. 659 Ibid. 660 Ibid, pp. 17-18. Footnotes deleted. 154 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions The ACJ is of the view that such laws are an invasion of the rights of privacy, non-discrimination and to freedom of expression. Such laws also express a profound contempt for the fundamental right to equality before, and protection of, the law. Equally, such laws often serve to stigmatise persons of diverse sexual orientation and gender identity by referring to same sex sexual conduct as \u2018unnatural carnal intercourse\u2019, \u2018intercourse against the order of nature\u2019, \u2018unnatural desire\u2019, \u2018gross indecency\u2019 etcetera.661 It identified other criminal laws applied unfairly against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. In addition to laws directly criminalising same sex sexual conduct between consenting adults, a range of other laws containing criminal sanctions have been used to target people of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities. These include laws relating to: vagrancy, public nuisance, national security, public morality, obscenity, indecency and public order. The existence of some such laws, or their discriminatory application, breach rights to equality and non-discrimination.662 The second term of reference looked at the existence and effectiveness of anti-discrimination laws to protect the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. The ACJ recognised that, in most countries, these laws do not include sexual orientation and gender identity specifically as prohibited grounds of discrimination, leaving lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people \u201cstrangers to the guarantees of equality\u201d.663 It commented positively that some States have specific constitutional or statutory provisions that apply to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and that courts in many States have \u201cmade favourable determinations based on the principle of non-discrimination and equality\u201d.664 [T]he ACJ is of the view that fundamental to any improvement in the human rights situation of persons of diverse sexual orientation and gender identity is the implementation of strong anti-discrimination and anti-vilification legislation which, in order to remove any doubt, should include specific reference to non- discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity.665 The third term of reference dealt with recognition of change of gender identity. The ACJ is of the view that the denial of recognition of changes to one\u2019s gender identity is in breach of international human rights law.666 In relation to other laws, policies and practices, the fourth term of reference, the ACJ reported that: \u2026 a wide range of laws, policies and practices continue to undermine the capacity of persons of diverse sexual orientation and gender identity to enjoy the full range of human rights.667 The last term of reference addressed the protection of the rights of those who defend the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. It focused principally on the rights to freedom of assembly association and expression. The ACJ referred to: \u2026 a litany of human rights violations directed at the defenders of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons. These include: being subjected to threats of violence and death threats; the arbitrary invasion of their privacy by raiding houses and offices; physical violence; torture; sexual abuse; and murder.668 The ACJ did not refer specifically to the situation of children but noted: 661 Ibid, p. 19. 662 Ibid, p. 20. 663 Ibid, p. 21. 664 Ibid, p. 22. 665 Ibid, p. 22. 666 Ibid, p. 23. 667 Ibid, p. 25. 668 Ibid, p. 30.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9ab68044-8c47-4439-bb56-4fc9ab0c2506": {"__data__": {"id_": "9ab68044-8c47-4439-bb56-4fc9ab0c2506", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "65e650080fe5f23504126e7417e42709583bf3108662851da2bf5c1f8bf80803"}, "2": {"node_id": "e0fea643-12ef-49c9-bc11-a62ee7d460b9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0319d0ba29a68eff3c48ec4afddfc4346bcd64e0c3c9bb425a55ba7568bf52dd"}}, "hash": "84ac8e994d47e48a1d1153548f0e166bab4d2f52cfcb27a56b723648a410ecb8", "text": "667 Ibid, p. 25. 668 Ibid, p. 30.

The listing covers each of the countries of the then 17 APF member NHRIs. The ACJ\u2019s findings of widespread human rights violations based on sexual orientation and gender identity were not surprising. Its response was a series of strong statements that establish that all international human rights law applies to all persons of diverse sexual orientation and gender identity and that the obligations of States under international human rights law to promote and protect all human rights of all people extends to the rights of people of diverse sexual orientation and gender identity. The universality of human rights that the ACJ asserted and promoted applies equally to intersex people. 7.3.3. Recommendations The ACJ was asked not only to make findings but to develop recommendations. The report makes 54 recommendations addressed to NHRIs individually and six recommendations addressed to the APF. It states generally that the recommendations should be implemented through processes that include consultation and participation. The recommendations to NHRIs, arranged functionally, address: \u2022 capacity building \u2022 research \u2022 monitor and document violations \u2022 education \u2022 promotion \u2022 dialogue \u2022 advocacy \u2022 reform of law and law enforcement. 669 Ibid, p. 30. 670 Ibid, p. 31. The Yogyakarta Principles refer to how such medical procedures attempt to impose a gender identity on a child. As a 2015 fact sheet from the OHCHR describes, this is better understood today as attempts to make an intersex child\u2019s appearance conform to binary sex stereotypes. See OHCHR, Fact sheet: Intersex, 2015. Thoughts and stories of being Being LGBTI by Being LGBTI in Asia. 156 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions They provided a comprehensive framework for NHRI action to promote and protect the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people. The six recommendations to the APF encouraged the continuation of APF work in facilitating the exchange of information, expertise and experiences among APF members and with NHRIs outside the Asia Pacific region. The ACJ also requested the APF to review the progress of the implementation of the recommendations at regular intervals. There is no doubt that the ACJ report has had a substantial effect on the work of NHRIs. In the years following the Yogyakarta Principles and the ACJ Report, we have seen a growing number of initiatives from NHRIs in Asia to tackle the rights violations and discrimination faced by people of diverse [sexual orientation and gender identity].671 7.4. ACJ-INITIATED PROJECTS, 2011 In 2010, in response to the ACJ recommendations, the APF secured funding to support four member NHRIs to implement projects to raise awareness and strengthen protection for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. The projects were completed in 2011. The Australian Human Rights Commission held consultations and prepared a report for the Australian Government on developing specific legal protection against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, as well as ensuring that the Government\u2019s Human Rights Framework leads to greater equality for people of all sexual orientations and gender identities.672 The National Human Rights Commission of Mongolia undertook an analysis of the national legal framework to identify discriminatory elements, as well as helped raise awareness among the estimated 80,000 lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in the country of their rights, the Yogyakarta Principles and existing mechanisms to address human rights violations.673 It also translated the Yogyakarta Principles into Mongolian. The New Zealand Human Rights Commission supported a major regional human rights workshop in March 2011 as part of the 2nd Asia Pacific OutGames, to draw attention to the role that NHRIs can play in promoting the Yogyakarta Principles.674 Several other APF members participated in the workshop. The Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines established partnerships with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender groups, examined and assessed existing national laws and policies, advocated on the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and developed a human rights education module for local government and community groups which, following a formal evaluation, could be delivered in a broader range of settings.675 Separately the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia (SUHAKAM) completed a study on the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c69f9ea-dfa7-4020-909a-81a05aee280b": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c69f9ea-dfa7-4020-909a-81a05aee280b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8eb43d33d546efff18cfa3fd5186b01225f991701a2b0a7a42348799d0e70df7"}, "2": {"node_id": "0b3427fb-01ee-4b7e-a111-39971161d774", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "845acdc0f5ed31aa006eb102f4e3ffccbe64e588e8d962b8db8f73081585ec15"}}, "hash": "ca6894a310558b01bd03a769ce6fb5d6a27c39dd95a6067487cbe607fa742bad", "text": "The study included consultations with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender groups, religious groups and others to understand the range of perspectives that exist.676 These activities are not an exhaustive list of the work that these institutions have undertaken in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "847f87ac-25b3-4874-b95d-70c2851bedc5": {"__data__": {"id_": "847f87ac-25b3-4874-b95d-70c2851bedc5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8d886d7c19f2f48dcc819b0980d8d382e3a00a94622ed224d027ca7b2af7ab2c"}, "3": {"node_id": "e49eeb49-b0e5-40fe-93f2-05167d78b6fa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aae2b46d94fe7d3f7cd238cb7afa7715f7ce61bd3b5b187f0ccd6749677940cc"}}, "hash": "4d682d0a118487a10f838f843380e44e5893dd40346cbdcce1ab429dd5807873", "text": "They are rather the activities directly connected to the ACJ report. 671 APF, UNDP and IDLO, Regional Report: The Capacity of National Human Rights Institutions to Address Human Rights in Relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and HIV, 2013, p. 37;

THE IDLO-UNDP-APF NHRI SOGI PROJECT, 2012\u201313 In 2012\u201313 the APF, the International Development Law Organization (IDLO), UNDP and SAARCLAW (the legal apex body of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) worked with NHRIs in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nepal, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Timor Leste to document their capacity to address human rights in relation to sexual orientation, gender identity and HIV.677 It was proposed that, at the end of the project, NHRIs and NHRI staff would have: \u2022 strengthened appreciation and understanding of the rights and vulnerabilities of people of diverse sexual orientation and gender identity \u2022 identified institutional capacity and mechanisms, and institutional strengths, weaknesses and opportunities to effectively address rights issues faced by people of diverse sexual orientation and gender identity \u2022 enhanced networks and partnerships with communities of people of diverse sexual orientation and gender identity.678 The project\u2019s final report commented on the sensitivities NHRIs encounter in working to promote and protect the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.679 It also identified common factors of NHRIs with well-developed capacity to address these human rights issues, which include: \u2022 strong and open leadership to mobilise institutional will and build institutional capacity on sexual orientation and gender identity \u2022 an institutional focal point on sexual orientation and gender identity \u2022 an institutional commitment to engage and communicate with civil society.680 The project also looked for factors outside the NHRI and found: A final and critical factor for catalyzing change is the role of the community of people of diverse SOGI. The experiences of this Project indicate that community unity and leadership, combined with diplomatic and persistent advocacy on LGBTI rights, gives rise to productive relationships with NHRIs, and fosters ongoing collaboration and partnership. The impact and importance of the efforts of the LGBTI community: lobbying and advocating on not only rights, but stigma, social and cultural issues, cannot be understated.681 The final report of the project indicated that: As a result of this Project, NHRIs and NHRI staff have a greater appreciation and understanding of the rights and vulnerabilities of people of diverse SOGI. Through the National Report process and community engagement, participating NHRIs successfully documented their engagement on SOGI and utilized their involvement in the Project to identify institutional capacity and institutional mechanisms through which they could address SOGI-related rights. In Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, Indonesia, the Philippines and Timor- Leste, Project consultations and dialogues also enhanced networks and partnerships between NHRIs and communities of people of diverse SOGI.682 677 This project resulted in a regional report and individual reports on each participating NHRI.

The program The program of the workshop gave a central place to reports from the participating NHRIs on their work on human rights in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity. Each representative had prepared a report in advance and presented it during the sessions.689 NHRI representatives were also invited to lead discussions on specific functional areas, including research, education and promotion, monitoring and advocacy. The reports demonstrated a high level of commitment to these issues, often in spite of very difficult cultural and traditional contexts in which the NHRIs were working. The workshop also heard the experiences of other official or semi-official organisations and other regions, including the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights and SAARCLaw. NGO representatives spoke about their work, especially in association with NHRIs. 688 The 16 NHRIs represented were those of Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, Samoa, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Timor-Leste.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "deb0579e-14a3-4157-9010-95762ee68b4d": {"__data__": {"id_": "deb0579e-14a3-4157-9010-95762ee68b4d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "356ef53a469ef4a57104899ea199126de3d133633dbd02f25c6d90fae38a8383"}, "2": {"node_id": "a3a59f78-d92f-4b5f-9edb-8fd976a76075", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "96a4afa409dff1b95eb0aa8ee7bb98b7c214f33d6cdfbfd65a7f3f71ffb4c993"}}, "hash": "07176d319e63a44c172fc97b3ff96a5d700b5fe98cde1041678ef8a1d4aa9391", "text": "689 APF and UNDP, Report of the workshop on the role of National Human Rights Institutions in promoting and protecting the rights, including health, of LGBTI people in Asia and the Pacific, 2015, pp. 12-16.

Establish focal points within NHRIs for sexual orientation and gender identity and establish clear work plans for them 3. Build relationships with civil society organizations (CSOs) and networks in order to inform the work of the NHRI and to ensure effective communication outreach to communities of diverse sexual orientation and gender identity.691 APF member institutions will be invited to report annually, beginning in 2016, on their progress in implementing the recommendations addressed to them. The Programme of Action and Support addressed four recommendations to the APF: 33. Engage with regional and sub-regional SOGI CSOs to seek their contributions to (i) an APF manual on the role of NHRIs in promoting and protecting the rights of LGBTI and (ii) further develop a pilot blended learning programme (comprising of online and face-to-face adult learning) for APF members on the role of NHRIs in promoting and protecting the rights of people of diverse SOGI. This will be undertaken in the next APF strategic cycle of 2015\u20132020. 34. Organize meetings for South\u2013South sharing of best practices, lessons learned and research by NHRIs in promoting and protecting the human rights of people of diverse SOGI. 35. Continue to cooperate with UN and other stakeholders to promote the role of NHRIs in promoting and protecting the human rights of people of diverse SOGI. 36. Distribute the workshop\u2019s Programme of Action and Support to the APF membership and post it to the APF website (www.asiapacificforum.net).692 The APF is already well advanced in implementing these recommendations. 690 See Appendix 6 of this manual.

It is the fruit of close consultation and cooperation among APF member institutions and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex activists and civil society orgnaistions.695 \u2022 The first APF blended learning course for APF member institutions on human rights in relation to sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics will be conducted in 2016.696 The Programme of Action and Support addressed one recommendation to UNDP: 37. Provide technical support and financial support, through \u2018Being LGBT in Asia\u2019 and through other related programmes, for implementation of the above actions.697 The partnership with APF will be one of the vehicles through which this is accomplished. Finally, the Programme of Action and Support asked NHRIs to: \u2026 report annually to the APF on the status and implementation of the above actions including where relevant the challenges and achievements in that implementation. The APF will include a consolidated report on implementation of the Programme of Action and Support through its annual reporting.698 The APF will seek these reports from its member institutions each year, commencing in 2016.

Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people report discrimination and human rights violations, including abuse by law enforcement officials, blackmail and violence due to their sexual orientation or gender identity. The National Human Rights Commission of Mongolia has sought to work closely with these communities to understand their human rights issues, to raise awareness and to promote legislation to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Since its establishment in 2001, the Commission has been a robust advocate for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. This work has expanded significantly since 2010, when the APF provided financial support to the Commission for a project to raise public awareness on the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in Mongolia. The project began with consultations with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people on their human rights concerns, experiences and needs. The Commission met with 80 participants from lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender organisations to discuss: \u2022 fundamental human rights \u2022 the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people \u2022 the Yogyakarta Principles \u2022 lodging complaints with the Commission and seeking remedies \u2022 how people can protect their human rights. At the end of the workshop, participants concluded that the main reason their rights were commonly violated was because of negative community attitudes, based on prejudice and stereotypes. They wanted to enlarge the target group for Commission activities to include their family members and young people. They identified the priorities as training and workshops for police officers and advocacy activities for the general public. The workshop both cemented the collaboration between the Commission and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender organisations and provided the framework for a program of activities in Mongolia. Since that time, Commission activities have included: \u2022 a workshop for 71 police officers on the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people \u2022 data collection on human rights violations experienced by lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, to analyse common forms of violations, identify frequent violators within the Mongolian context and develop stratgeies to resolve these issues \u2022 creating an information exchange point on the Commission\u2019s website for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, their family members, public officials and the general public \u2022 producing and distributing publicity materials on the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, including a brochure on lodging a complaint with the Commission, material on \u201cLGBT people: Common Prejudice and Reality\u201d and translation of the Yogyakarta Principles into Mongolian.

In addition, the Commission collaborated with the LGBT Centre in Ulaanbaatar in the observance of the International Day against Homophobia and Transphobia. With the support of the UNDP project, in 2012 the Commission and the LGBT Centre conducted a quantitative and qualitative survey on the implementation of the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "126c064a-1d3b-4e71-9216-816684a4fdf0": {"__data__": {"id_": "126c064a-1d3b-4e71-9216-816684a4fdf0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0e80b20739ebfb73b01c7e839edf13b1d81bdc7530dcd0301d3131ab64173d3c"}, "2": {"node_id": "690745fe-2709-4cbd-bd8c-cc386216f3d1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "32865fbe358d23b1602fdfe5e659eea93d080d609824607e09f758b88e20d12a"}}, "hash": "60b4601eff7acf24a8c7b865e5d9692a33138feebf8443bf28e695e95bbd85a9", "text": "The survey obtained the views of 138 persons from many of the 21 aimag (provinces) of Mongolia, including 60 lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender people.

As a result of that survey, the Commission\u2019s 2012 Annual Report on Status of Human Rights and Freedom in Mongolia included a chapter on the situation for the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in Mongolia.700 The report drew attention to serious violations of these human rights, including the right to non-discrimination; the right to found a family; the rights of children of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people; and the rights to employment, health services, education and personal security. The problem of security ranges from a lack of support from law enforcement after reporting a criminal offence to incidents of violence perpetrated in public against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons. This was the first time an official report on these human rights issues had been published in Mongolia and the first time they had been discussed in the parliament. Upon review of the report, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Legal Affairs passed Resolution No.13 (2013), which urged the Government to take effective measures to implement the recommendations by the UN Human Rights Council and the Committee against Torture related to the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.701 The Commission now regularly receives complaints related to violations of the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. In May 2015, for example, a transgender woman complained that police officers had breached the public service ethical code of conduct by discriminating against transgender people and abusing them verbally. Although the Commission did not find the complaint proved, it recommended that the Chief of the General Police Department organise training courses for police officers to raise awareness on the rights of sexual minorities. The recommendation was accepted and is being implemented. One of the 19 members of the Commission\u2019s Advisory Board is a representative of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community organisations, ensuring that those organisations have a formal channel through which they can contribute to the Commission\u2019s work, programs and policies.702 164 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions KEY POINTS: CHAPTER 7 \u2022 The Yogyakarta Principles recommended that NHRIs promote respect for the Principles by State and non-State actors and integrate into their work the promotion and protection of the human rights of persons of diverse sexual orientations or gender identities. \u2022 At the APF Yogyakarta Workshop in 2009, representatives of APF member institutions affirmed the universality of all human rights and declared that NHRI mandates extended to those who suffer human rights violations based on their actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. They agreed on a set of actions to promote and protect the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. They initiated the first APF program of work on these human rights issues. \u2022 The APF Advisory Council of Jurists reported in 2010 that sexual orientation and gender identity are among the grounds of discrimination proscribed by international human rights law. However, they found many national laws in the countries of APF member institutions violated the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. They set out a number of recommended actions that NHRIs should take, within their mandates, to address these violations. \u2022 Many NHRIs in the Asia Pacific region have been very active on human rights issues in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity. They are now beginning to recognise and work on human rights issues in relation to intersex status. They are becoming even more active. The work they have undertaken provides good examples of positive experiences and lessons learnt that can increase their own effectiveness and that of other NHRIs in the region. \u2022 The APF-UNDP Programme of Action and Support, developed and adopted at the Bangkok Workshop in 2015, provides a firm basis for both organisations and for individual NHRIs to develop this work further in coming years. It provides the basis of the APF work plan on human rights in relation to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people for the 2015\u201320 period.

Increasing numbers of others are taking up the issues for the first time. The APF-UNDP Programme of Action and Support provides a useful framework for future activity on these human rights issues.705 This chapter looks at what NHRIs can do. It draws on the recommendations of the Programme of Action and Support and how individual NHRIs can contribute to its implementation. It discusses seven functional areas of NHRI activities but first looks at recognition. In each area it provides a list of possible actions NHRIs can take, within their existing mandates, to protect and promote the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people. 703 Additional Recommendation L. The Yogyakarta Principles make only two specific references to intersex status but, under the framework of the universality of human rights affirmed by the Yogyakarta Principles, intersex people have the same entitlements to all human rights as all other human beings have. NHRIs can and should apply the Yogyakarta Principles for the benefit of intersex people, as well as gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people. 704 High Commissioner for Human Rights, Discrimination and violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity, 4 May 2015, A/HRC/29/23, para. 80. 705 See Appendix 6. KEY QUESTIONS \u2022 How can NHRIs ensure appropriate recognition for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people and their human rights? \u2022 How can this recognition be reflected in the activities of NHRIs under each functional area of NHRI responsibility? \u2022 What structures, programs and activities should NHRIs develop in order to meet the needs of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people for better promotion and protection of their human right? 166 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions 706 707 NHRIs work in very different contexts. In most societies, the human rights dimensions of sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics have come to public attention only in recent years. They can still be very sensitive issues. NHRIs in these societies may require support and assistance in raising and working on these human rights issues. Peer support, especially through associations such as the APF, will be very important to them. 706 National Human Rights Commission of Thailand, Reports on the Appraisal of Human Rights Situations in Thailand and on the Performance of NHRCT in the year 2013, p. 17; at www.nhrc.or.th/en/file/HumanRightsSituation_AnnualReport/hrsituation-and- performance-nhrct2013.pdf. 707 See The Malaysian Insider, 3 January 2016; at www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/were-turning-back-human-rights- clock-if-nsc-bill-becomes-law-says-hasmy. CASE STUDY: PROMOTING AWARENESS THROUGH ANNUAL REPORTS According to the 2013 Annual Report of the National Human Rights Commission of Thailand, Thai society has a growing understanding and acceptance of the rights, liberty and equality of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. However, there is still a need to drive concrete changes to promote and protect the human rights of the LGBT people in a range of areas, such as encouraging family members to have more understanding and acceptance of LGBT people, encouraging educational institutions to treat LGBT people with equality and non-discrimination, encouraging employers to respect the rights, freedom and equality of LGBT people without discrimination, advocating for legislation to to permit legal marriage for same sex couples, and advocating for legislation to allow a person to change their gender identity on official documents.706 CASE STUDY: PROMOTING THE RIGHTS OF GAY, LESBIAN, BISEXUAL AND TRANSGENDER PEOPLE IN CHALLENGING CONTEXTS Tan Sri Hasmy Agam, retiring Chairperson of the Human Rights Commission of

engagement and collaboration with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex communities and organisations is essential. These communities are diverse and the experiences and situations of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people are diverse. NHRIs should be conscious of this diversity. The human rights issues for them differ greatly from individual to individual and from group to group. NHRIs must be careful to identify those differences and respond to them. This issue is discussed later in this chapter in the context of cooperation and engagement. 8.2. RECOGNITION The first step is recognising that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people are entitled to the full range of human rights and that they experience human rights violations and are at risk of further violations on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or sex characteristics. Many political and cultural factors stand in the way of recognition. Many societies as a whole fail to extend recognition to the experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people or deny the legitimacy of these experiences. NHRIs often encounter social, cultural and political pressure, direct or indirect, in recognising the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people and in undertaking activities in relation to their human rights. 708 708 APF, \u2018National Human Rights Commission of Bangladesh (JAMAKON)\u2019 in Briefing document for the workshop on the role of National Human Rights Institutions in promoting and protecting the rights of LGBTI in Asia and the Pacific, 24-25 February 2015, pp. 7-9. CASE STUDY: RECOGNISING THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF GAY, LESBIAN, BISEXUAL AND TRANSGENDER PEOPLE In October 2012, the National Human Rights Commission of Bangladesh (JAMAKON) stated in its submission to the Human Rights Council\u2019s Universal Periodic Review of Bangladesh: \u201cExcluded groups (including Dalits and transgender) remain some of the poorest people in Bangladesh and face marginalization and discrimination. In addition the NHRC notes that the Government of Bangladesh did not respect the recommendation with respect to sexual minorities. The NHRC understands the need for the law to be in harmony with the cultural and social mores of the people. Nevertheless, the NHRC believes that it is now time to ensure that all groups, including those who are transgender, intersex or sexual minority, are protected from discrimination.\u201d In 2013, JAMAKON started receiving complaints of violations of human rights on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Due to its intervention, a victim who was sacked by his employer in 2014 because of his sexual orientation returned to his job and received monetary compensation. In 2014, JAMAKON, in collaboration with the Law Commission, drafted Bangladesh\u2019s first anti-discrimination law and submitted it to the Government for enactment. This law includes protection of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. JAMAKON\u2019s Strategic Plan for 2016\u20132020 includes a vision, mission, long- term goals, key strategies and focal areas to protect marginalised and vulnerable populations, including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. JAMAKON has successfully been engaged with NGOs and civil society organisations working with the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities.708 168 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions 709 710 711 8.3.

at www. asiapacificforum.net/resources/manual-on-nhris/. 713 Paris Principles, \u2018Competence and responsibilities\u2019, para. 3(a). POSSIBLE ACTIONS 1. Recognise lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people in the NHRI strategic plan as priority groups for NHRI programs and activities, because of their experience of violations and the risk of further violations. 2. Appoint a staff focal point on human rights issues affecting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people \u2013 if possible, with a Commissioner responsible for the area \u2013 and develop a clear work plan for the focal point under the institutional strategic plan.709 3. Build the institutional capacity of the NHRI, including its members and staff, to promote and protect the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people, especially through internal training and sensitisation programs and through the recruitment of staff who have had direct personal experience in human rights work for and on behalf of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex people.710 4. Build relationships with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex organisations and networks to inform the work of the NHRI and to ensure effective communication outreach to communities of people of diverse sexual orientations, gender identities and sex characteristics.711 Chapter 8: What more national human rights institutions can do | 169 Part III What national human rights institutions can do Other responsibilities listed in the Paris Principles have advisory dimensions.714 Publicising the NHRI\u2019s advice and views is important for reasons of transparency but it is also important strategically. It enables pressure to be brought to bear on those receiving the advice to consider it carefully and to accept it. Publicity encourages a response and in that way promotes accountability. These provisions apply as much to the NHRI\u2019s work on human rights in relation to sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics as to any other area of the NHRI\u2019s work. 714 For example, Paris Principles, \u2018Competence and responsibilities\u2019, paras. 3(b), (c) and (d). CASE STUDY: ADVISING ON LAW TO PROTECT THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL, TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE Many NHRIs in the Asia Pacific region have provided advice to governments and parliaments on the need for laws to ensure effective protection of the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people. These are some examples. \u2022 The Australian Human Rights Commission proposed the incorporation of sexual orientation, gender identity and intersex status as prohibited grounds of discrimination in national law and also proposed the removal of all legal provisions that discriminate against same-sex couples and their children. \u2022 The Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines has proposed national and local anti-discrimination laws that include coverage of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. \u2022 The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka has proposed amendments to laws concerning changing identity documents to reflect gender identity. \u2022 The National Human Rights Commission of Bangladesh (JAMAKON) has put forward a draft anti-discrimination law to provide protection from discrimination for all groups, including those who are transgender, intersex or sexual minority. \u2022 The Indonesian National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) has proposed a law on the treatment of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people as citizens of Indonesia. \u2022 The National Human Rights Commission of Korea has recommended the enactment of a comprehensive anti-discrimination law that includes sexual orientation and gender identity as prohibited grounds of discrimination and the removal of provisions in the Military Criminal Law that punish same-sex conduct. \u2022 The National Human Rights Commission of Thailand has recommended law reform to permit legal marriage for same-sex couples.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e6cda0cf-55f4-475e-a71a-dad4dde5d80a": {"__data__": {"id_": "e6cda0cf-55f4-475e-a71a-dad4dde5d80a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a1d806f9041eb9ca48eb54b5167d10c421bf04e02e3fd1848b2fd622df6b60cd"}, "2": {"node_id": "f5725e2b-8433-4bcf-a3a3-e7aa7579fa03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7934ec5b40a1eb12801296a0d59d7aa350ffc1575fa48f162e30dea0e85fe85d"}}, "hash": "d639653fa039fa5555e857363e8ebda9d1e6cf18db4967651055aa283c42fad9", "text": "\u2022 The New Zealand Human Rights Commission has recommended marriage equality laws and law reform to remove discrimination against same-sex couples. 170 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions Advisory work should be undertaken in consultation with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex organisations.715 These organisations often have greater knowledge and expertise in relation to the diverse experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people.

The expertise of the NHRI lies in its knowledge of international human rights law and the application of that law to the facts and circumstances in the country. A key component of advisory work is good research. In many areas associated with sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics, there may be little or no research at the national level that is relevant to developing human rights advice. This may be especially so in lesser known areas, such as sex characteristics. Research should then lead to the development of good advice and related services and support. For example, in 2013, the Council of Europe recommended that States: \u2026 undertake further research to increase knowledge about the specific situation of intersex people, ensure that no-one is subjected to unnecessary medical or surgical treatment that is cosmetic rather than vital for health during infancy or childhood, guarantee bodily integrity, autonomy and self-determination to persons concerned, and provide families with intersex children with adequate counselling and support.716 717 715 See also APF-UNDP Programme of Action and Support, Recommendation 6. 716 Council of Europe, Resolution 1952 (2013) on Children\u2019s Right to physical integrity, 1 October 2013; at www.assembly.coe.int/ nw/xml/XRef/X2H-Xref-ViewPDF.asp?FileID=20174&lang=en. 717 See also APF-UNDP Programme of Action and Support, Recommendation 8.

Publicise the results of the review of laws, policies and programs and seek to build support for reform in accordance with the NHRI\u2019s recommendations. 7. Undertake research on the specific situation of intersex people, leading to good advice, protection from unnecessary medical or surgical treatment and guarantees of physical integrity, autonomy and self-determination. 8. Undertake a study of the national situation of human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and prepare a report on that situation with recommendations to ensure better promotion and protection of their human rights. Chapter 8: What more national human rights institutions can do | 171 Part III What national human rights institutions can do 8.4. EDUCATION AND AWARENESS RAISING The Paris Principles list both education and awareness raising as among the responsibilities of NHRIs. They are required: \u2022 to assist in the formulation of programmes for the teaching of, and research into, human rights and to take part in their execution in schools, universities and professional circles \u2022 to publicize human rights and efforts to combat all forms of discrimination, in particular racial discrimination, by increasing public awareness, especially through information and education and by making use of all press organs.718 In this way, the Paris Principles distinguish between raising awareness about human rights and educating on human rights. They also provide that NHRIs shall: \u2026 [a]ddress public opinion directly or through any press organ, particularly in order to publicize its opinions and recommendations.719 The APF has published a manual on human rights education for NHRIs and has included human rights education in its manual on NHRIs.720 The three dimensions of human rights education drawn from the international instruments focus on: \u2022 knowledge: provision of information about human rights and mechanisms for their protection and building understanding of human rights through an analysis of situations of human rights violations and of what steps are required to address them \u2022 values, beliefs and attitudes: promotion of a human rights culture through the development of values and attitudes which uphold human rights \u2022 action: education which enables the individual to defend human rights and prevent human rights abuses within their context and community, including through the promotion of knowledge and understanding of human rights and of values, attitudes and action that build human rights cultures and societies.721 These three dimensions are very appropriate in human rights education for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people (especially the knowledge and action dimensions) and for the broader community about human rights issues in relation to sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics (especially the values, beliefs and attitudes dimension). 718 Paris Principles, \u2018Competence and responsibilities\u2019, paras. 3(f) and (g). 719 Paris Principles, \u2018Methods of operation\u2019, para.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "542d114f-0c24-4369-b2d4-e21218142a67": {"__data__": {"id_": "542d114f-0c24-4369-b2d4-e21218142a67", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eb0c4954a263f0ca8bb6aaa53684c9a56e8c543d52464e61c9ca16d1cac84920"}, "2": {"node_id": "e81fc03e-268c-4254-bb46-6d8196465373", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5671d7616638950e2a3d3bdcad26faf41ce92851de9e42c2f95571e13d2013f0"}}, "hash": "7b90c59b71694caee3024a25811685026cf124df808f8e27457fcba97c6bcebf", "text": "719 Paris Principles, \u2018Methods of operation\u2019, para.

CASE STUDY: ENGAGING WITH THE PUBLIC MEDIA TO RAISE AWARENESS In June 2015, the Chairperson of the Indonesian National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) Hafid Abbas called for an end to discrimination and stigma against the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community and urged the Government to issue more supportive regulations. \u201cThey have been marginalized, inflicted with violence, isolation. It cannot be justified. [...] We can\u2019t build this country with persistent stigmatization of and discrimination against the LGBT community\u201d. He also said the Government had a lot of work to do, one task of which was to have an operational regulation on the treatment of LGBT people as citizens of this country. \u201cThere should be a more technical procedure on the protection of the LGBT community because much of the violence they have suffered is inflicted by legal authorities\u201d. Komnas HAM has also called for a widespread public information campaign to build understanding that promoting and protecting the rights of LGBT people is the responsibility of the entire society and to provide programs for LGBT people to heal physical and psychological wounds suffered from past abuse.722 CASE STUDY: EDUCATION THROUGH SOGI\u2019S STORY The Australian Human Rights Commission prepared SOGI\u2019s Story on behalf of the Commonwealth Forum of National Human Rights Institutions. SOGI\u2019s Story is an educational resource on human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity. Its aim is to tackle discrimination and violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex persons in its various forms by addressing misinformation, dispelling harmful myths and stigmas and providing possible options for resolution and remedy. SOGI\u2019s Story has been designed in consultation with, and for use primarily by African national human rights institutions, civil society organisations and local community groups to encourage learning and awareness through interactive dialogue.723 Photo by the Australian Human Rights Commission. Chapter 8: What more national human rights institutions can do | 173 Part III What national human rights institutions can do 724 725 726 727 728 729 730 Because of cultural and political sensitivities associated with sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics, the APF-UNDP Programme of Action and Support gave priority to dialogue, particularly with religious and community leaders, in the NHRI\u2019s human rights education activities in relation to sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics. Education through increasing understanding, built on exchanges and dialogue, is an important and effective methodology for human rights education. Dialogue can break down stereotypes, raise awareness of actual experiences of human rights violations and build acceptance of people as people. At its most effective, it can lead to joint action to address and overcome the obstacles to full enjoyment of human rights. Certainly, engaging those who lead community opinion is critical in changing community opinion. 724 APF-UNDP Programme of Action and Support, Recommendation 16. 725 Ibid, Recommendation 13. 726 Ibid, Recommendation 14. 727 Ibid, Recommendation 15. 728 Ibid, Recommendation 17. 729 Ibid, Recommendation 18. 730 Ibid, Recommendation 19.

MONITORING 731 732 Monitoring is a process of continuing oversight and review.733 It has been defined as \u201cthe activity of observing, collecting, cataloguing and analysing data and reporting on a situation or event\u201d.734 Human rights monitoring commonly has two dimensions: \u2022 oversight of the human rights situation within the State, either generally or in relation to a particular category of rights; for example, under a specific human rights treaty \u2022 on-site inspection of places where the risk of human rights violation is high or at least relatively higher than elsewhere; for example, places where persons are detained or forced to reside. NHRIs have important roles in both dimensions of human rights monitoring. All NHRIs undertake monitoring functions, through research, investigation and reporting. On the basis of their monitoring, they provide information to international human rights mechanisms, including the UPR and treaty monitoring bodies.735 Some NHRIs have specific statutory obligations to prepare and submit to the Head of State or parliament an annual report on the human rights situation in their country. Some NHRIs have specific statutory responsibility for monitoring places of detention; for example, as designated National Preventive Mechanisms (NPMs) under the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and All Forms of Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment (OPCAT). In all cases, NHRI monitoring should include monitoring of the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people, taking account of their diversity and the diversity of their experiences and situations. As groups at particular risk of human rights violations, their rights require particular and specific attention. They experience human rights violations on the basis of their sexual orientation, gender identity or sex characteristics and so these factors need to be made explicit \u2013 recognised, identified and acknowledged. These factors should not be hidden or ignored. Reports to international human rights mechanisms should include specific discussion of the situations of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people. National \u2018state of human rights\u2019 reports should do the same. 731 Ibid, Recommendation 11. 732 Ibid, Recommendation 12. 733 See APF, Manual on National Human Rights Institutions, 2015, Chapter 14. 734 OHCHR, National Human Rights Institutions: History, Principles, Roles and Responsibilities, Professional Training Series No. 4 (Rev. 1), 2010, p. 113. 735 See APF, International Human Rights and the International Human Rights System: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions, 2012; at www.asiapacificforum.net/resources/manual-on-international-human-rights-system/. POSSIBLE ACTIONS 16. Provide a platform for persons of diverse sexual orientations, gender identities and sex characteristics to engage in dialogue with all relevant groups, including parliamentarians, the judiciary, the security/law enforcement sector, medical practitioners and community and religious leaders.731 17. Promote dialogue among community and religious leaders on the relationship between faith, religion, custom and tradition and sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics.732 Chapter 8: What more national human rights institutions can do | 175 Part III What national human rights institutions can do Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people in detention have particular needs and their situations require close monitoring, whether as part of the NHRI\u2019s general function of monitoring places of detention or as part of the NHRI\u2019s role as NPM where OPCAT has been ratified. The imposition of criminal penalties for many aspects of sexual orientation, gender identity and intersex activity \u2013 for example, same-sex relationships or cross dressing \u2013 results in people being imprisoned simply because they are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex. They may face particularly serious risks when in detention, including the risk of rape and other forms of assault, because of their sexual orientation, gender identity or sex characteristics. Trans women detained in male prisons are particularly vulnerable to abuse. Unless an NHRI ensures a specific focus on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex detainees, it may not see the human rights violations inflicted on them. 736 Monitoring other places of restricted or confined residence, such as hospitals and children\u2019s homes, is also important.

CASE STUDY: COMPLAINT ABOUT DISCRIMINATION BASED ON GENDER IDENTITY Lucy, a transgender woman, and her partner applied for life insurance when they took out a mortgage. Lucy\u2019s partner\u2019s application was approved almost immediately but Lucy had no response after six weeks. She suspected that her application was taking longer to process because she disclosed that she had had gender reassignment surgery. Lucy had experienced discrimination previously because of her gender identity and was concerned that it could be affecting such an important part of her life. Lucy approached the New Zealand Human Rights Commission for information about her human rights in relation to her life insurance application. She then received a letter from the insurance company stating that her application had been deferred for one year because it fell outside the level of risk that could be covered under the company\u2019s usual underwriting guidelines. Lucy was very upset about this. She discussed the matter with her doctor who was also distressed about the decision because there did not seem to be any good reason for deferring the application. Her insurance agent and her doctor requested that the insurance company reconsider its decision. The Commission intervened with the insurance company and, as a result, the company approved Lucy\u2019s insurance application. Lucy was happy with the result and said that being able to lodge a complaint with the Commission and discuss the situation with a Commission mediator had helped support her through the process.746 178 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions 747 748 749 747 A manual for gender and sexual minorities, 2015; at www.nhrc.org.bd/PDF/NHRC%20Manual%20(English)%20(1).pdf. 748 Ibid, p. 2. 749 Ibid, p. 5.

Their sexual orientation or gender identity or sex characteristics may not be well known and they might be exposed to many kinds of risks and dangers if it is revealed. They will not approach an NHRI unless they can be confident that their privacy will be protected and they can trust the NHRI to handle their complaint confidentially and sensitively. 750 750 See also APF-UNDP Programme of Action and Support, Recommendation 1 in Appendix 6. POSSIBLE ACTIONS 23. Train NHRI members and staff to be sensitive and responsive to the needs of victims of human rights violations on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or sex characteristics and ensure that these victims have access to members and staff who have undergone this training. 24. Identify an NHRI complaint handling officer who will be a liaison point for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex complainants and who will be responsible for reaching out to the diverse lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex communities through their organisations and through community and legal centres and other NGOs connected with the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex communities. 25. Provide an accessible and safe space for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people in all NHRI offices, where their rights are protected and promoted and their sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics are respected.750 26. Provide information, in accessible and understandable languages and formats, to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex individuals and organisations to assist victims of human rights violations to lodge complaints with the NHRI. 27. Ensure that the processes for complaint handling, including forms to be completed, are respectful of the particular circumstances of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex victims of human rights violations and are appropriate for them, including by permitting complainants to identify themselves as they wish. 28. Develop procedures to identify and act on its own initiative to investigate human rights violations based on sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics, through regular engagement with different lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex organisations and other civil society organisations. 29. Promote the appointment of a focal point on human rights issues in relation to sexual orientation, gender identity and intersex status in each government ministry, department or agency that has a significant number of complaints of human rights violations based on sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics, as a means of encouraging speedy resolution of complaints and action to prevent future violations. 30. Maintain a database of complaints of human rights violations based on sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics, with the ability to disaggregate the data according to different criteria, to enable the analysis and reporting of the human rights situation of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people generally and according to status. 180 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions 8.7. COURT INTERVENTIONS AND MONITORING Many NHRIs have the function of intervening in court proceedings, as a friend of the court, to present submissions on human rights law.751 In these interventions, the NHRI does not represent one of the parties or advocate the case of one of the parties but acts as adviser to the court. NHRIs are the pre-eminent national experts on human rights law and so it is appropriate that their expertise is made available to the courts. A number of NHRIs have used this intervention function to present human rights submissions in cases involving sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics. Often courts are not familiar at all with issues associated with sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics and they are completely unaware of the human rights dimensions of those issues. NHRIs have a very valuable role to play in bringing their expertise and experience to the court in these cases. 752 753 On other occasions NHRIs do not formally intervene in the court proceedings but they monitor them by attending and observing particular cases of concern. An NHRI\u2019s attendance indicates to the court hearing the case that the case raises important human rights questions. 751 See APF, Manual on National Human Rights Institutions, 2015, Chapter 16. 752 Military Criminal Law, article 92, s. 9. 753 APF, \u2018National Human Rights Commission of Korea\u2019 in Briefing document for the workshop on the role of National Human Rights Institutions in promoting and protecting the rights of LGBTI in Asia and the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "05b6c5b7-9eb2-4edb-ba54-c1a0df59c9d4": {"__data__": {"id_": "05b6c5b7-9eb2-4edb-ba54-c1a0df59c9d4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e92468253ab5dc861acdd0c76e7c124af4ae929ad168b58210893b2e290563a7"}, "3": {"node_id": "9f86ce5c-ff0d-4a3d-93b0-cb155e93ab35", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c6bc1e96dae1bc82873f59ee9628ab219cf030ada5bb20f90e2680261d7080c3"}}, "hash": "512e159abfb57f08a9d62e6e46be5c2722a0500a9e1e67b8d2cccb37b176da3f", "text": "Pacific 24-25 February 2015, p. 13. CASE STUDY: CHALLENGE TO MILITARY CRIMINAL LAW The National Human Rights Commission of Korea has provided opinions advocating inclusion and equality for the people with diverse sexual orientation to courts dealing with related pending cases. For example, in 2011 the Commission delivered an opinion to the Constitutional Court in a case challenging as unconstitutional a provision in the Military Criminal Law that defines sexual activities among persons of the same sex in the military as indecent sexual assault and criminalises them.752 The Constitutional Court upheld the provision on the basis of the \u201cdistinct characteristics of the military based on hierarchy and control\u201d, at the expense of the rights of sexual and gender minorities. However, the Commission in its own capacity was able to present arguments in accord with the international human rights laws and norms.753 Thoughts and stories of being Being LGBTI by Being LGBTI in Asia.

CASE STUDY: CASE CHALLENGING LAWS CRIMINALISING CROSS DRESSING AND GENDER IDENTITY The Syariah Criminal (Negeri Sembilan) Enactment 1992 of the Malaysian state of Negeri Sembilan criminalises any male person who wears women\u2019s clothing or \u201cposes as a woman\u201d.754 On 11 October 2012, the High Court of Seremban dismissed an application by Muhammad Juzaili Mohd Khamis and two other Muslim men for a declaration that the provision is invalid due to inconsistency in human rights and due process provisions in Malaysia\u2019s Federal Constitution.755 The applicants appealed and the Court of Appeal overturned the High Court\u2019s verdict and declared the provision unconstitutional. On 27 January 2015, the state of Negeri Sembilan applied for a leave to appeal to the Federal Court of Malaysia. The Human Rights Commission of Malaysia (SUHAKAM) attended the proceedings as observer, in accordance with its commitment that \u201call human beings, regardless of their sexual orientation, should be able to enjoy the full range of human rights without exception\u201d.756 The Federal Court granted leave to appeal and SUHAKAM continued to monitor the case and attended the hearing in August 2015 as an observer.757 On 8 October 2015, the Federal Court unanimously overturned the decision by the Court of Appeal on a technical ground, that the legal challenge to the constitutionality of any law has to be made directly to the Federal Court as the matter would involve an interpretation of the Federal Constitution. Therefore, the provision in the state law stands, unless new proceedings are initiated and the Federal Court can decide the substance of the case. POSSIBLE ACTIONS 31. Monitor cases coming before the courts that raise human rights issues concerning sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics and seek to intervene in appropriate cases where the NHRI\u2019s expertise would assist the court to understand the human rights issues and the requirements of human rights law. 182 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions 8.8.

The Commission, through its regional offices, works with local LGBT groups on the passage of local anti-discrimination ordinances. It participates in drafting ordinances, providing advice and building capability on human rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people.

CASE STUDY: ENCOURAGING DIALOGUE, UNDERSTANDING AND COOPERATION Given the sensitivities surrounding issues relating to LGBTI rights in Malaysia, the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia (SUHAKAM) has adopted a step- by-step approach in addressing these issues. SUHAKAM started engaging with various relevant stakeholders in 2010 in order to obtain their views and perspectives on LGBTI rights, as well as the issues and challenges faced. In August 2010, SUHAKAM organised a meeting with various Islamic groups with the objectives to gain better understanding of Islamic perspective of sexual orientation and gender identity and substantiate Islamic sensitivities and views regarding LGBTI actions, such as same-sex intercourse, cross dressing, imitation of the opposite gender and gender re-assignment. The application of the principles of non-discrimination under the Federal Constitution with regards to LGBT people was also discussed. The Commission took note of Islam\u2019s position in dealing with LGBT rights. In November 2010, SUHAKAM held a meeting with LGBTI individuals and organisations working with these communities and advocating for their rights. The objective of the meeting was to engage directly with the LGBTI groups and to hear the challenges and violations that they face. Following its meeting with the Islamic groups, SUHAKAM met with representatives of non-Muslim groups in February 2011 to discuss the rights of the sexual minorities. The views presented by both the Christians and Hindus were noted by the Commission. In October 2011, SUHAKAM and the Selangor Community Awareness Organisation (EMPOWER) organised a Roundtable Discussion on Gender Equality: Unaddressed Women\u2019s Rights Issues. During the discussion, participants raised some issues concerning the sexual minorities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c70209d-cb85-482a-8b68-e403f7b8c07e": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c70209d-cb85-482a-8b68-e403f7b8c07e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fb46bc863e07c2dbf6367c0c244810764996a3033c4a5d07f4ba9fb137d384fd"}, "2": {"node_id": "5461a0a9-e42d-4319-a872-866094046383", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d1ec5e873c0cb78045ccb51f423cbf43eacc391a6103ddb485cf98e46884fc6c"}}, "hash": "cad95be50cbbca6bb9ce6d7d5bf74233b91d2038bdf8e9ca4b979dceaeb273c7", "text": "During the discussion, participants raised some issues concerning the sexual minorities.

Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people have distinct voices and those voices should be heard through the different organisations to which they belong, not submerged into a broader movement. No one organisation can adequately express them all. Accordingly, NHRIs should not see one or a few NGOs as able to reflect the diversity of experiences and situations. They should seek the widest range of partnerships possible. 773 773 APF, \u2018Philippines Commission on Human Rights\u2019 in Briefing document for the workshop on the role of National Human Rights Institutions in promoting and protecting the rights of LGBTI in Asia and the Pacific, 24-25 February 2015, p. 25. CASE STUDY: COLLABORATION WITH LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL AND TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY ORGANISATIONS The Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines has developed close working relationships with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender NGOs at the national and local levels and undertakes many joint activities with them. It engages actively with them in the protection and promotion of LGBT rights. The Commission has a particularly productive relationship with Rainbow Rights, an NGO that promotes the human rights of LGBT people. The sharing of research and stories of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people enriches the appreciation of the Commission\u2019s officers as well as other stakeholders. It also strengthens the Commission\u2019s advocacy for the passage of the Anti-Discrimination Bill. For example, Rainbow Rights has presented the Commission and other stakeholders with the findings of its research Kwentong Bebot, documenting the violence experienced by lesbian, bisexual and transgender women. In an international forum sponsored by GALANG Philippines on the exclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in social protection policies, the Commission committed to work with various stakeholders and policy- makers to pursue the amendment of social protection policies, including the Family Code, to make them more inclusive of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.773 Photo by UNDP/W.

They can also engage with their regional association, the APF, and their international association, the ICC, to ensure that these associations contribute to advancing the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people. In particular, Asia Pacific NHRIs can participate in and contribute to the APF\u2019s program in support of the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people, including implementation of the APF-UNDP Programme of Action and Support. 8.10. NATIONAL INQUIRIES A national inquiry is an investigation into a systemic human rights problem in which the general public is invited to participate.779 Many NHRIs undertake national inquiries as part of their activities to fulfil their mandates. National inquiries are conducted in a transparent, public manner. They involve gathering public evidence from witnesses and experts, directed towards the investigation of systemic patterns of human rights violation and the identification of findings and recommendations. National inquiries require a wide range of expertise within the NHRI, including researchers, educators, investigators and people with experience in policy development. There are many different ways in which national inquiries can be conducted, according to the resources available to the NHRI. 779 See APF, Manual on Conducting a National Inquiry into Systemic Patterns of Human Rights Violation, 2012; at www. asiapacificforum.net/resources/manual-conducting-a-national-inquiry/. POSSIBLE ACTIONS 42. Include in parallel or shadow reports to the Universal Periodic Review, special procedures and treaty monitoring bodies information about the human rights situation of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people. 43. Make statements during debates before review bodies and the Human Rights Council on human rights relating to sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics. 44. Encourage country visits and reports by United Nations experts, including special procedure mandate holders, treaty monitoring bodies, fact-finding missions and commissions of inquiry, to include examination of human rights issues in relation to sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics. 45. Promote and monitor the implementation of recommendations from the international human rights system that deal with human rights in relation to sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics. 46. Implement recommendations of the APF-UNDP Programme of Action and Support and participate in other APF programs and activities concerning human rights in relation to sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics. 47. Share with other NHRIs in other regions, through the ICC and directly, the experience of NHRIs in the Asia Pacific in working to promote and protect the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people and encourage those other NHRIs to extend their own work on these issues. Chapter 8: What more national human rights institutions can do | 189 Part III What national human rights institutions can do A national inquiry results in the production of one or more reports that set out the evidence the inquiry received, its analysis of the situation, its findings of fact and its recommendations. The recommendations can be quite wide-ranging, addressed to many within a country with responsibilities in the particular area of human rights examined. They can be addressed to government, private sector corporations, NGOs, academic institutions and other civil society bodies. They can also be addressed to individuals who have significant parts to play within the community, including in relation to the particular issue. Because of their nature, national inquiries are unlike other functions undertaken by the NHRI, even if they include many of those functions. They involve investigation \u2013 but much of the investigation is conducted in a public forum and evidence is provided directly, usually in public, by victims and experts and possibly perpetrators.

CASE STUDY: \u201cSAME SEX, SAME ENTITLEMENTS\u201d NATIONAL INQUIRY The Australian Human Rights Commission commenced its \u201cSame-sex: same entitlements\u201d national inquiry in 2006 and reported in 2007. The inquiry sought to \u2022 identify the federal laws which discriminate against same-sex couples and their children in the context of financial and work-related benefits and entitlements \u2022 describe the impact of those discriminatory laws on same-sex couples and their children \u2022 make recommendations as to how to remove that discrimination. The inquiry focussed on the following areas when conducting its audit of federal laws: \u2022 employment \u2022 workers\u2019 compensation \u2022 tax \u2022 social security \u2022 veterans\u2019 entitlement \u2022 health care \u2022 family law \u2022 superannuation \u2022 aged care \u2022 migration. The inquiry held seven formal public hearings and convened 18 community forums. It received submissions from 680 individuals and organisations. The audit identified 58 federal laws that discriminate against same-sex couples and, in some cases, their children.780 The Commission\u2019s recommendations for amendment to the discriminatory laws were adopted by the Australian Government and enacted in 2008.781 190 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions The human rights situations of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people are usually the result of cultural, political and social traditions. They have long histories. They are systemic, often deeply embedded in the structures of a society. These situations, therefore, are often ideal for the national inquiry process. They are appropriately addressed through a process that combines public education and awareness raising, investigation, analysis and recommendations. It is also a process that involves engagement of key civil society organisations and external experts. It can strengthen relationships between the NHRI and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex communities and organisations. It can lead to a comprehensive set of recommendations to address the broad systemic nature of the situation. In undertaking any form of public inquiry into human rights issues relating to sexual orientation, gender identity or intersex status, NHRI should be careful to ensure adequate protection for witnesses and others making submissions. If necessary, their identities and any identifying information should be suppressed. Appearing in public before an official inquiry can be a frightening experience for some. It can be especially traumatic for victims who, through the process of telling what happened, will have to re-live the experience of violation. The inquiry team needs to prepare victims properly and sensitively for the hearings\u2026 The team should discuss with each victim ways in which some measure of protection can be provided. Most inquiries can take evidence in confidence if it is necessary for the safety of the witness or to protect the privacy of a witness. In other cases, the inquiry can suppress the name of the witness and all information that does or could lead to identification of the witness. The inquiry team should ascertain in advance whether a witness does not want to give public evidence or wants to give public evidence but with his or her identity kept confidential. Victims and other witnesses should be able to express any fear or concern they have and then seek an appropriate assurance from the inquiry that enables them to give their evidence with the least risk to themselves and their safety.782 782 APF Manual on Conducting a National Inquiry into Systemic Patterns of Human Rights Violation, 2012, p. 54 at www. asiapacificforum.net/resources/manual-conducting-a-national-inquiry/. POSSIBLE ACTIONS 48.

CASE STUDY: ADDRESSING HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES AFFECTING LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL, TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE Through its advocacy, research and advice work, complaint handling, inquiries and consultations, the Australian Human Rights Commission has addressed discrimination and other human rights issues on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics, commencing in the early 1990s.783 Its first advocacy work on these issues concerned the elimination of the ban on gay men and lesbians entering the Australian Defence Forces. Since then it has undertaken many very different but very significant projects in this area. The Commission\u2019s work has resulted in four reports over the past eight years that have led directly to fundamental changes in law, policy and practice in Australia. In particular, its advocacy resulted in the enactment of legislation in 2008 eliminating discrimination against same-sex couples and their children in federal laws, as well as legislation in 2013 prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity and intersex status. The \u201cSame-sex: same entitlements\u201d inquiry was commenced in 2006 and reported in 2007. It identified 58 federal laws that discriminate against same-sex couples and, in some cases, their children.784 The Commission\u2019s recommendations for amendment to the discriminatory laws were adopted by the Australian Government and enacted in 2008.785 The \u201cSex files\u201d project examined the legal recognition of sex in documents and government records, including identity documents such as passports and driving licences. The project began in 2008, consulting with sex and gender diverse people, through individual meetings, forums and online blogs, learning their experiences and most pressing human rights concerns. The consultation led to a focus on sex identification issues and publication of a report in 2009. The report found that Australia\u2019s identification systems largely operate on a binary basis where the only options available for sex identity are male or female. The systems needed to change to accommodate people who do not identify as male or female and who wish to have identity documentation that does not note their identity as either male or female.786 In 2010, the Commission began a broad consultation on discrimination based on sexual orientation or sex and/or gender identity. A report of the consultations was published the following year. Some of the key issues identified by participants included: \u2022 the importance of using appropriate, inclusive and empowering terminology \u2022 the benefits of having consistent and uniform laws across Australia \u2022 the benefits of having federal discrimination laws that would bind Commonwealth agencies 192 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions 787 788 789 790 787 Australian Human Rights Commission, Addressing sexual orientation and sex and/or gender discrimination: consultation report, 2011; at www.humanrights.gov.au/our-work/sexual-orientation-sex-gender-identity/publications/addressing-sexual-orientation- and-sex. 788 Australian Human Rights Commission, Resilient individuals: sexual orientation gender identity and intersex rights, 2015; at www. humanrights.gov.au/our-work/sexual-orientation-sex-gender-identity/publications/resilient-individuals-sexual. 789 Ibid, pp. 2-4. 790 Ibid, pp. 57-59. \u2022 the importance of including gender identity and gender expression as protected grounds of discrimination \u2022 the need for government action in other areas, such as health care, education, marriage equality, as well as reform of the requirements for changing a person\u2019s legal sex. The report raised issues of discrimination faced by people diverse sexual orientation and gender identity in accessing employment, participating in sports and in their access to facilities such as toilets and change rooms. It also provided accounts of vilification, discrimination and harassment experienced by individuals on the basis of sex and/or gender identity.787 In 2014, the Commission held a national human rights

The Commission has accepted and sought to resolve complaints of human rights violation, including discrimination, based on sexual orientation and gender identity since its establishment. Its jurisdiction was widened in 2013 to incorporate sexual orientation, gender identity and intersex status as specific grounds of prohibited discrimination under the Sex Discrimination Act 1984.791 In 2014\u201315, it received 34 complaints of discrimination based on sexual orientation, 55 based on gender identity and 2 based on intersex status.792 The Commission also has a role to intervene in court proceedings that involve human rights issues. It intervened in the High Court of Australia, Australia\u2019s highest court, in a case concerning legal requirements for transgender people to obtain a gender recognition certificate and be recognised as their affirmed gender. The law required extensive intrusive surgery to effect the gender change as a condition for the issue of the certificate. The High Court\u2019s finding, consistent with the Commission\u2019s submissions, was that a person\u2019s gender should be considered from a \u2018social perspective\u2019, that is, how they are perceived by other members of society and not by a detailed knowledge of the person\u2019s physical (bodily) state.793 The Commission has also engaged with the international human rights system, including the UN Human Rights Council and treaty monitoring bodies, on many human rights issues related to sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5eb9c0ea-34e8-4b66-ae83-d131df847ff9": {"__data__": {"id_": "5eb9c0ea-34e8-4b66-ae83-d131df847ff9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fae39962df9b1bf56d579a2c11cd1db75ee30fc2a924ba7bb0bd83eefb0c4393"}, "2": {"node_id": "8ba34909-5e59-4d19-8f53-eb27b34a1756", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3a9d33f92f50343a5bfc5bc7532febc2e7cc472f45dc7caed82ef2626c4b7d9e"}}, "hash": "75fd1e9be1dbc49f692e7a22d7e06acb09eebaa7c4c4fc6ae662ba9fc622ded6", "text": "In 2015, it included these issues in its report to the Human Rights Council\u2019s Universal Periodic Review of Australia.794 Among other things, it raised concerns that intersex people face non-essential medical interventions to erase intersex characteristics.795 Similarly, in its 2010 UPR submission, the Commission recommended that sex or gender diversity be included as grounds of discrimination in federal laws, and that the Sex files report be implemented.796 In 2009, the Commission included the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people in its report to the Committee on Economic, Cultural and Social Rights.797 In 2012, it included these rights in its report to the Human Rights Committee.798 It has also participated in the joint statements on sexual orientation and gender identity presented by NHRIs at the Human Rights Council in 2012, 2013 and 2014. 194 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions KEY POINTS: CHAPTER 8 \u2022 The Yogyakarta Principles urge NHRIs to \u201cintegrate into their work the promotion and protection of the human rights of persons of diverse sexual orientations or gender identities\u201d.

Summary | 195 Summary Chapter 1: Understanding sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics \u2022 Sexual orientation and gender identity are fundamental elements of a person\u2019s identity, while sex characteristics are intrinsic parts of a person\u2019s physical make-up. \u2022 These distinct concepts help to differentiate the impact of discrimination against lesbian, gay and bisexual people because of their sexual orientation, against transgender people because of their gender identity or against intersex people because of their sex characteristics. \u2022 Increasingly, the terms \u2018sexual orientation\u2019, \u2018gender identity\u2019 and \u2018sex characteristics\u2019 are being used by human rights bodies and civil society and listed explicitly as prohibited grounds of discrimination. \u2018Gender expression\u2019 is a separate, but related, term that refers to people\u2019s outward expression of masculinity and/or femininity. \u2022 Many regional identities combine elements of sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or, to a limited extent, sex characteristics. Using these concepts acknowledges both traditional and evolving identities in this region and the common and distinct human rights issues faced by lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people. \u2022 By understanding these concepts and how they apply to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people, NHRIs can choose the most appropriate individual and umbrella terms to use in specific pieces of work. \u2022 Being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex is not a medical illness. Viewing people this way (pathologisation) has increased stigma, discrimination and violence against people, including in medical settings, because of their sexual orientation, gender identity or sex characteristics, \u2022 Every person has the right to choose whether, when and how they disclose their sexual orientation, gender identity or intersex status. By enabling lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people to choose how much they disclose, NHRIs respect people\u2019s privacy and help to create an inclusive environment. Chapter 2: Being lesbian, gay and bisexual in the Asia Pacific \u2022 There may be 220 million lesbian, gay and bisexual people in the Asia Pacific region. \u2022 Lesbian, gay and bisexual people in the region have many common experiences. In addition, lesbians and bisexual women have distinct experiences, arising from their situation as women that must be taken into account in ensuring respect for their human rights. \u2022 Criminal laws targeting lesbian, gay and bisexual people have both direct and indirect effects on their enjoyment of their human rights. Whether enforced or not, they undermine the dignity of lesbian, gay and bisexual people. \u2022 Individually and as a group, lesbian, gay and bisexual people are marginalised and often targeted for violence on the basis of their sexual orientation. The State often fails to ensure their safety. \u2022 Discrimination based on sexual orientation is evident in all countries. It denies the equality of lesbian, gay and bisexual people. \u2022 Lesbian, gay and bisexual human rights defenders are often targeted because of their advocacy. They experience violations of their rights to expression, assembly and association. 196 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions Chapter 3: Being transgender in Asia and the Pacific \u2022 Transgender men, transgender women and those who identify as a third gender or as non-binary exist in all parts of the Asia Pacific region. \u2022 Direct and indirect discrimination affects transgender people in all aspects of their private and public lives and leads to social exclusion. This includes systemic bullying of transgender and gender diverse students at school and discrimination at all stages of the employment cycle. \u2022 Transgender women continue to be criminalised under laws that prohibit cross-dressing and are frequently targeted by laws criminalising homosexuality, even though they are not gay men. Public nuisance and vagrancy laws and criminalisation of sex work also disproportionately affect transgender women. \u2022 Transphobic violence is a form of gender-based violence directed against transgender people. The majority of transgender people killed because of their gender identity are transgender women. There is emerging evidence of high levels of sexual and physical violence against transgender men within their families or in intimate relationships. \u2022 Legal gender recognition is a fundamental civil and political right that", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "50213948-fe79-4a27-8827-d37057578896": {"__data__": {"id_": "50213948-fe79-4a27-8827-d37057578896", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "98c1257b71d266f3fdf05a286a7f3bc533c3048a0a2811acc6cb4c3fdda007de"}}, "hash": "98c1257b71d266f3fdf05a286a7f3bc533c3048a0a2811acc6cb4c3fdda007de", "text": "is necessary to realise other rights. Having the correct name and sex or gender identity on official documents enables transgender people to be recognised as a person before the law and to have legal protection. \u2022 Gender-affirming health services are medically necessary for many transgender people and are a component of the right to the highest attainable standard of health. Chapter 4: Being intersex in Asia and the Pacific \u2022 Intersex traits are relatively common and intersex people exist in all parts of the Asia Pacific region. Stigma has created an environment where their existence and the human rights violations against them have been largely ignored. \u2022 Intersex people often experience human rights violations because their bodies are different. These include so-called \u2018sex-normalising\u2019 surgeries or hormone treatment on infants and children, that are medically unnecessary and typically performed when a child is too young to be involved in the decision-making process. These practices violate the right to physical integrity and have been described by human rights bodies as forms of torture or ill-treatment and as harmful practices. \u2022 Fear and discrimination can never justify human rights abuses, including forced medical treatment. States have a duty to combat harmful stereotypes and discrimination against intersex people. \u2022 Typically, female genital mutilation laws do not apply to surgical interventions on intersex girls. Intersex NGOs have called for so-called \u2018sex-normalising\u2019 surgeries on intersex children to be recognised as genital mutilation. \u2022 Intersex people have the same rights as others to freedom from discrimination. There are very few countries in this region that have anti-discrimination laws that specifically prohibit discrimination against intersex people or that clearly state their rights protection under other prohibited grounds. This leaves intersex people vulnerable to discrimination. \u2022 It is good practice for intersex infants to be registered as either female or male at birth with the understanding that, like all people, they may grow up to identify with a different sex or gender. However, in this region, intersex people who have been issued a male or a female birth certificate do not always enjoy the same legal rights as others. Summary | 197 \u2022 Some intersex people seek to amend their sex or gender details on official documents because those details were either inaccurate at birth and/or no longer reflect their sex or gender identity. Many face barriers trying to amend these details, which also undermines their right to recognition before the law. Some laws in this region only allow intersex people to change their sex details on official documents if they have had so-called \u2018sex-normalising\u2019 surgeries. This erases bodily diversity and undermines intersex people\u2019s human rights. \u2022 Violations of intersex people\u2019s rights should be investigated and alleged perpetrators prosecuted. Intersex people should have access to effective remedies, including redress and compensation. They should be consulted in the development of laws and policies that impact on their rights. Chapter 5: International and regional developments in human rights law \u2022 In all countries in all regions people experience human rights violations based on their sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics. \u2022 Although there is no specific reference to sexual orientation, gender identity or sex characteristics in international human rights instruments, there can no longer be any doubt that the provisions of international human rights law extend in full to all people, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people. This is the unanimous view of international human rights experts, expressed by the jurisprudence, general comments and concluding observations of human rights treaty monitoring bodies, the reports of the UN special procedures, resolutions of the Human Rights Council, decisions of regional human rights courts and resolutions of regional human rights commissions and mechanisms. \u2022 The prohibition of discrimination on the basis of \u2018other status\u2019 in international human rights law is properly considered to include sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and sex characteristics. \u2022 Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people are as entitled as anyone else to the full protection of their human rights under international and national laws. As with all human rights, every State has legal obligations to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people. \u2022 There has been uneven but growing recognition of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people within UN human rights mechanisms and these mechanisms have called, with increasing frequency and strength, for the promotion and protection of their rights.

They are not an aspirational statement of what the law should be but a legal statement of what the law then was. \u2022 The Yogyakarta Principles refer specifically to both sexual orientation and gender identity. In fact, they represent one of the earliest statements recognising the separate human rights issues associated with gender identity. They do so, however, within the framework of universality, speaking about the rights of all people in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity, not the rights of particular groups of people. 198 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions \u2022 The Yogyakarta Principles refer specifically to human rights issues associated with sex characteristics on only two occasions. They do not deal with the full range of human rights issues affecting intersex people. However, within the framework of the universality of all human rights, they apply for the benefit of intersex people. \u2022 The Yogyakarta Principles contain nine preambular paragraphs and 29 principles, as well as additional recommendations addressed to many human rights actors, including NHRIs. \u2022 The Yogyakarta Principles were quickly accepted and cited by international human rights mechanisms, senior UN officials, regional human rights mechanisms and many States, NHRIs and NGOs. They have not yet been officially recognised in resolutions of UN political forums. \u2022 Asia Pacific NHRIs and the APF have responded quickly to the recommendation in the Yogyakarta Principles addressed to them. Their activities are increasing in number and scope. The APF-UNDP Programme of Action and Support adopted in February 2015 provides the framework for activities over the coming years. Chapter 7: The APF\u2019s response to the Yogyakarta Principles \u2022 The Yogyakarta Principles recommended that NHRIs promote respect for the Principles by State and non-State actors and integrate into their work the promotion and protection of the human rights of persons of diverse sexual orientations or gender identities. \u2022 At the APF Yogyakarta Workshop in 2009, representatives of APF member institutions affirmed the universality of all human rights and declared that NHRI mandates extended to those who suffer human rights violations based on their actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. They agreed on a set of actions to promote and protect the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. They initiated the first APF program of work on these human rights issues. \u2022 The APF Advisory Council of Jurists reported in 2010 that sexual orientation and gender identity are among the grounds of discrimination proscribed by international human rights law. However, they found many national laws in the countries of APF member institutions violated the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. They set out a number of recommended actions that NHRIs should take, within their mandates, to address these violations. \u2022 Many NHRIs in the Asia Pacific region have been very active on human rights issues in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity. They are now beginning to recognise and work on human rights issues in relation to intersex status. They are becoming even more active. The work they have undertaken provides good examples of positive experiences and lessons learnt that can increase their own effectiveness and that of other NHRIs in the region. \u2022 The APF-UNDP Programme of Action and Support, developed and adopted at the Bangkok Workshop in 2015, provides a firm basis for both organisations and for individual NHRIs to develop this work further in coming years. It provides the basis of the APF work plan on human rights in relation to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people for the 2015\u201320 period. Summary | 199 Chapter 8: What more national human rights institutions can do \u2022 The Yogyakarta Principles urge NHRIs to \u201cintegrate into their work the promotion and protection of the human rights of persons of diverse sexual orientations or gender identities\u201d. They also assert the principle of universality of all human rights, so that all human rights apply to all persons of diverse sexual orientations, gender identities (including diverse gender expressions) and sex characteristics. \u2022 The first step for NHRIs is to recognise that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people are entitled to the full range of human rights and that they experience human rights violations and are at risk of further", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "90014c5f-cf2d-46aa-b41b-4ba18f5c750d": {"__data__": {"id_": "90014c5f-cf2d-46aa-b41b-4ba18f5c750d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aafc63965f2f93c93c48e6f6916327b206d8a4d194753e0abb207b84154f8db0"}, "3": {"node_id": "73ac5886-f69f-479f-b110-224dc0caf3ad", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6133d8508e1023e5eaed749ff4b8f56b97a04cb59a8f6c09d2ca7d33527d0749"}}, "hash": "abb7dafbba49e7918591dfce4e9f2e9fd6a62de1af459a64a48d0afb46a44e3a", "text": "violations on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics. \u2022 NHRIs can respond to the human rights experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people and ensure better promotion and protection of their human rights through activities relating to each of the key functions of NHRIs: advice, education and awareness raising, monitoring, complaint handling, advocacy, and cooperation and engagement, domestically and internationally. \u2022 The national inquiry process can be a very effective mechanism by which NHRIs can address the systemic nature of human rights violations based on sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics, and ensure better promotion and protection of the human right of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people. 200 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions Photo by Diverse Voices and Action (DIVA) for Equality, Fiji.

We, as NHRIs accredited under the Paris Principles,799 are charged with the obligation to protect and promote human rights of all individuals without prejudice or discrimination. We recall the previous joint NHRI statement on discriminatory laws and practices and acts of violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity, presented at the 19th session of the Human Rights Council in 2012. Twenty years ago the international community unanimously adopted the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action. The Vienna Declaration and Program of Action reinforce the universality of human rights and reaffirm the principles of equality and non-discrimination. The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action recognise the importance of national and regional particularities and various historical, cultural and religious backgrounds, while noting that \u2018it is the duty of States, regardless of their political, economic and cultural systems, to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms.\u2019 799 Principles relating to the Status of National Institutions (The Paris Principles), adopted by UN General Assembly, National institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights, 20 December 1993, A/RES/48/134.

We welcome the ongoing commitment of the Secretary General, the Human Rights Council, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, special procedures, treaty bodies, civil society and human rights defenders worldwide to address the issue of violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity and against intersex persons. We recognise that there is a need to give equitable focus to human rights violations on the basis of gender identity, intersex status and sexual orientation. We commend the positive action taken by the Human Rights Council to highlight the violence, discrimination and human rights abuses faced by lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI)801 people around the world, by adopting the first UN resolution solely focused on the human rights of LGBTI people.802 We welcome the report by the High Commissioner for Human Rights803 and the panel discussion at the Human Rights Council804 that followed. We further welcome the joint statements made to the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly in 2011, 2008 and 2006.805 We support the findings in the High Commissioner for Human Rights\u2019 report, and note that on the basis of the information presented within the report \u2018a pattern of human rights violations emerges that demands a response.\u2019 We welcome the acknowledgement in the report of the important role that NHRIs play in addressing violence and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "78a6c8e8-5c32-44ff-ba4a-0cda5a00223c": {"__data__": {"id_": "78a6c8e8-5c32-44ff-ba4a-0cda5a00223c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3d38d1ea187b563df5e7c210c94692c0565d738995a63ccae889cb8355386a64"}, "2": {"node_id": "35d22609-1d55-4524-87b5-106a7ce7e1af", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3635201fc78d642320ab9ff2503f64a6fb85b9f9c39c3dd2b562bda70747b8f2"}}, "hash": "d3a5831948fd7b781368826ab1aa4512ab6135ce236a0c0df64956fc1976d190", "text": "We reflect on the outcomes of the regional seminars held in Paris, Kathmandu and Brasilia, the information gathered through civil society events in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a68ba4af-6768-4db6-9bff-f6fc8b22bbda": {"__data__": {"id_": "a68ba4af-6768-4db6-9bff-f6fc8b22bbda", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cd90cf8f2399c4f5e6e08091ab0f06e12bc4611271277b9217b8491ca37be3f6"}, "3": {"node_id": "4ce8451a-dde1-4d3b-9dc9-78fd419b03a8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b2db12a0840bc24d3dd25513bc12c9e4ae959af3716e5cdfbad84e013959126e"}}, "hash": "08c9ae45af8dc87bb54c11a95a3815380023bfa64ef1eb2cb7de8e065b9a91ff", "text": "Africa and the global dialogue in Oslo in 2013.806 We welcome the constructive approach taken by States and civil society during these consultations, and hope that the dialogue will pave the way for continuing engagement at the national, regional and international level. NHRIs play a crucial role in protecting and promoting the rights of LGBTI people. Functions and powers available to NHRIs include the ability to investigate complaints, review laws and policies, hold national inquiries and conduct public education. Given the important and unique role of NHRIs we call on States to ensure that NHRIs have the necessary resources to fulfil their mandates. We also encourage the Human Rights Council and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to work with NHRIs to strengthen their capacity to address issues affecting LGBTI persons and respond to violations. 800 Human Rights Council, National institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights: Report of the Secretary-General, 2 April 2013, A/HRC/23/27. 801 The terms lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex are abbreviated to LGBTI.

Outcomes of the International Conference and Regional Seminars available at: www.hrsogi.org/midleertidighome.cfm. 208 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions We affirm the High Commissioner\u2019s finding that a more comprehensive analysis of the human rights challenges facing LGBTI persons requires a more systematic study and regular reporting. We call on the Human Rights Council to encourage States to improve data collection concerning sexual orientation, gender identity and intersex to better inform the extent to which human rights are being realised by LGBTI persons. This data should be collected in accordance with human rights principles, and in consultation with LGBTI persons. We call on the Human Rights Council to encourage States to accept recommendations and implement commitments made through the Universal Periodic Review process related to sexual orientation and gender identity. We support the work of treaty bodies and special mechanisms and we reiterate our call for the continued mainstreaming of protection for individuals discriminated against because of their sexual orientation, gender identity or because they are intersex, through existing international and regional human rights systems. We call on the Human Rights Council to establish an appropriate mechanism to study, document and report to the Human Rights Council concerning human rights violations, barriers and challenges on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity and for intersex persons. This mechanism should operate in consultation with LGBTI persons to promote dialogue, identify best practice and provide guidance to States and other UN bodies on human rights. Whilst a resolution at this session would have been welcomed the decision to host two high level meetings is recognised as an important step towards sustained engagement on these issues. As NHRIs we look forward to participating in those discussions and to the report back of those meetings to the Human Rights Council. We further encourage all Member States to engage in open dialogue and work together constructively with NHRIs and civil society to ensure that a resolution is presented to the Human Rights Council at an upcoming session. As NHRIs we renew our commitment to promoting and protecting human rights for all, including the rights of LGBTI persons.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ce8451a-dde1-4d3b-9dc9-78fd419b03a8": {"__data__": {"id_": "4ce8451a-dde1-4d3b-9dc9-78fd419b03a8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cd90cf8f2399c4f5e6e08091ab0f06e12bc4611271277b9217b8491ca37be3f6"}, "2": {"node_id": "a68ba4af-6768-4db6-9bff-f6fc8b22bbda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "08c9ae45af8dc87bb54c11a95a3815380023bfa64ef1eb2cb7de8e065b9a91ff"}}, "hash": "b2db12a0840bc24d3dd25513bc12c9e4ae959af3716e5cdfbad84e013959126e", "text": "We will continue to work with States, civil society, the Human Rights Council and other international mechanisms to guarantee the ongoing visibility, protection and promotion of these rights and to ensure human rights violations against LGBTI persons are effectively addressed.

DISTURBED that violence, harassment, discrimination, exclusion, stigmatisation and prejudice are directed against persons in all regions of the world because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, that these experiences are compounded by discrimination on grounds including gender, race, age, religion, disability, health and economic status, and that such violence, harassment, discrimination, exclusion, stigmatisation and prejudice undermine the integrity and dignity of those subjected to these abuses, may weaken their sense of self-worth and belonging to their community, and lead many to conceal or suppress their identity and to live lives of fear and invisibility; AWARE that historically people have experienced these human rights violations because they are or are perceived to be lesbian, gay or bisexual, because of their consensual sexual conduct with persons of the same gender or because they are or are perceived to be transsexual, transgender or intersex or belong to social groups identified in particular societies by sexual orientation or gender identity;

Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity includes any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on sexual orientation or gender identity which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing equality before the law or the equal protection of the law, or the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal basis, of all human rights and fundamental freedoms. Discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity may be, and commonly is, compounded by discrimination on other grounds including gender, race, age, religion, disability, health and economic status. Appendix 4: The Yogyakarta Principles | 211 Appendices States shall: a) Embody the principles of equality and non-discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in their national constitutions or other appropriate legislation, if not yet incorporated therein, including by means of amendment and interpretation, and ensure the effective realisation of these principles; b) Repeal criminal and other legal provisions that prohibit or are, in effect, employed to prohibit consensual sexual activity among people of the same sex who are over the age of consent, and ensure that an equal age of consent applies to both same-sex and different-sex sexual activity; c) Adopt appropriate legislative and other measures to prohibit and eliminate discrimination in the public and private spheres on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity; d) Take appropriate measures to secure adequate advancement of persons of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities as may be necessary to ensure such groups or individuals equal enjoyment or exercise of human rights. Such measures shall not be deemed to be discriminatory; e) In all their responses to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, take account of the manner in which such discrimination may intersect with other forms of discrimination; f) Take all appropriate action, including programmes of education and training, with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudicial or discriminatory attitudes or behaviours which are related to the idea of the inferiority or the superiority of any sexual orientation or gender identity or gender expression. Principle 3: The right to recognition before the law Everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law. Persons of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities shall enjoy legal capacity in all aspects of life. Each person\u2019s self- defined sexual orientation and gender identity is integral to their personality and is one of the most basic aspects of self-determination, dignity and freedom. No one shall be forced to undergo medical procedures, including sex reassignment surgery, sterilisation or hormonal therapy, as a requirement for legal recognition of their gender identity. No status, such as marriage or parenthood, may be invoked as such to prevent the legal recognition of a person\u2019s gender identity. No one shall be subjected to pressure to conceal, suppress or deny their sexual orientation or gender identity. States shall: a) Ensure that all persons are accorded legal capacity in civil matters, without discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, and the opportunity to exercise that capacity, including equal rights to conclude contracts, and to administer, own, acquire (including through inheritance), manage, enjoy and dispose of property; b) Take all necessary legislative, administrative and other measures to fully respect and legally recognise each person\u2019s self-defined gender identity; c) Take all necessary legislative, administrative", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "531de21e-202e-4e20-9875-9f9d40981952": {"__data__": {"id_": "531de21e-202e-4e20-9875-9f9d40981952", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics: A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/promoting-and-protecting-human-rights-relation-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-and-sex-characteristics-manual-national", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "08d8e1737bc0a4eb9aa5611096ea36ed9950364fed93f3fd7d2ba80d89b28832"}}, "hash": "08d8e1737bc0a4eb9aa5611096ea36ed9950364fed93f3fd7d2ba80d89b28832", "text": "and other measures to ensure that procedures exist whereby all State-issued identity papers which indicate a person\u2019s gender/sex \u2013 including birth certificates, passports, electoral records and other documents \u2013 reflect the person\u2019s profound self-defined gender identity; d) Ensure that such procedures are efficient, fair and non-discriminatory, and respect the dignity and privacy of the person concerned; e) Ensure that changes to identity documents will be recognised in all contexts where the identification or disaggregation of persons by gender is required by law or policy; f) Undertake targeted programmes to provide social support for all persons experiencing gender transitioning or reassignment. 212 Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics A Manual for National Human Rights Institutions Principle 4: The right to life Everyone has the right to life.

Actions have also had broader impact in other areas crucial for inclusive and human rights-based development, particularly in reducing social inequalities, promoting gender equality, fulfilling rights in employment and education, and improving access to justice, thereby advancing progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and promoting human rights. In many countries, reviews and consultations have led to increased availability of data on legal and policy barriers to HIV responses, and mobilization and engagement of stakeholders to address barriers through partnerships and collaboration. However, much work remains to be done. Progress has been slow and inconsistent in the reform of criminal laws that deter key populations from accessing services (i.e. removal of penal code provisions relating to sex work, drug use, and same-sex sexual conduct). Significant work has occurred in raising awareness of the importance of expanding access to justice, however the vast majority of people living with HIV and key populations are still unable to access legal aid services. Key populations and women affected by HIV remain highly stigmatized, continue to face discrimination and high levels of violence that often goes unreported, and have limited access to justice. In some country contexts, the legal and policy environment for key populations has deteriorated significantly since 2012, presenting new barriers to accessing HIV services. It is critically important that countries maintain participatory national processes that focus on removing legal and policy obstacles to universal access to HIV services to ensure progress towards the Fast-Track targets including Zero Discrimination and the target set by SDG 3 (healthy lives and well-being) of ending AIDS by 2030. National and regional accountability mechanisms should proactively monitor progress of each country in developing and implementing action plans for removing legal and policy barriers. People living with HIV and key populations should play a central role in these accountability mechanisms. Countries preparing for the 2016 UN High-Level Meeting (HLM) on Ending AIDS are urged to be guided by the Secretary-General\u2019s HLM Report On the Fast-Track to End the AIDS Epidemic in using the SDGs and Member States\u2019 pledge to \u2018leave no-one behind\u2019 as entry points for advocacy and follow-up activities flowing from legal and policy reviews and consultations. Countries should grasp the opportunity of the HLM to strengthen intergovernmental commitments to address the specific issues and recommendations that were raised through the national consultations, reviews and follow- up actions to remove legal and policy barriers. Political leadership and engagement of people living with HIV, key populations, religious leaders and other civil society champions are crucial to preserve the policy gains that have been made, address complacency and resolve law reform bottlenecks. Introduction 1 The purpose of this report is to highlight progress, challenges and future priorities in addressing legal and policy barriers to achieving universal access to HIV services in Asia and the Pacific. It will inform country preparations for the United Nations General Assembly High-Level Meeting on Ending AIDS (HLM) to be convened in New York, 8-10 June 2016, as well as subsequent actions at regional and country level towards ending AIDS, protecting human rights and achieving the SDGs. At least 28 countries in Asia and the Pacific have conducted national legal and policy reviews of their HIV responses in the period 2012-2016.1 Most of these reviews were informed by extensive, participatory consultations engaging governments, civil society stakeholders, including people living with HIV and key populations, UN and development partners. The report draws from a desk review of data reported from countries on these legal and policy reviews and consultations, and related developments in the legal and policy environment for HIV responses in Asia and the Pacific. The main sources of information for this report were survey responses received by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) from countries in the period 2014-2016,2 and country and regional reports of legal and policy reviews and consultations conducted since 2012. Based on this information, the report highlights significant examples of progress of countries in removing legal and policy barriers to accessing HIV services since 2012. Background The 2011 UN Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS included the commitment to review laws and policies that adversely affect the delivery of HIV services as one of the actions towards advancing human rights to reduce stigma, discrimination and violence related to HIV.3 To support countries to meet this commitment, in 2012 Asia-Pacific countries attending an Intergovernmental Meeting on HIV and AIDS4 agreed to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cc993092-5fea-455e-bfe4-fd95c2ad8674": {"__data__": {"id_": "cc993092-5fea-455e-bfe4-fd95c2ad8674", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-country-progress-addressing-legal-and-policy-barriers-universal-access-hiv-services-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Review of country progress in addressing legal and policy barriers to universal access to HIV services in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-country-progress-addressing-legal-and-policy-barriers-universal-access-hiv-services-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "92086b5fa697cfd891a6cf96cfa15d3c8dc33f0f693975a2227608d1de4b8291"}, "3": {"node_id": "527bcc30-e561-43ce-a7ad-66273ac5e9ba", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-country-progress-addressing-legal-and-policy-barriers-universal-access-hiv-services-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a6d9e744f2470fd41e7633ae54b4a26ba1f173052389b002c7936573447f7d8e"}}, "hash": "ca38661d6bf4698c927a045531b88bd93eaf8e3a012dba18e359a1760f91590d", "text": "the Regional Framework for Action on HIV and AIDS to 2015, which required countries to organize multi-sectoral national reviews and consultations on removing policy and legal barriers to universal access, in accordance with ESCAP resolutions 66/10 and 67/9.5 In conducting their reviews and consultations, countries were encouraged to consider the recommendations made in the report of the Global Commission on HIV and the Law.6 The Global Commission found that the ability of governments to develop effective HIV responses has been restricted by stigma, discrimination and punitive legal and policy environments that are hostile to people living with HIV and key populations. The Commission\u2019s report included a comprehensive set of recommendations for creating legal environments that facilitate rather than hinder effective HIV responses. 1 Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Kiribati, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nauru, Nepal, Pakistan, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Samoa, Solomon Island, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, Viet Nam.

Beyond 2015: new frameworks, commitments and targets In 2015, progress of countries in conducting national legal and policy reviews was a prominent agenda item of the Asia-Pacific Intergovernmental Meeting on HIV and AIDS convened by ESCAP. Country representatives attending the Intergovernmental Meeting were provided with a background paper describing good practices in conducting national reviews and consultations drawn from country experiences.8 The background paper and discussions during the meeting itself confirmed that national reviews and consultations conducted since 2012 had been effective in galvanizing national interest in and ownership of actions to address legal issues that have sensitive cultural and political implications and are critical to successful HIV responses. They also recognized the added value of a regionally-supported framework for action and the associated supportive implementation mechanisms and platforms for exchange between countries in the region on models, progress and challenges. At this Intergovernmental Meeting, Asia-Pacific countries adopted a road map to ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030 (Regional Framework for Action on HIV and AIDS Beyond 2015), which included a commitment to continuing national reviews and multi-sectoral consultations on legal and policy barriers. It also contained two additional, inter-linked commitments, namely: \ufffd to undertake national stakeholder consultations to promote access to affordable medicines, diagnostics and vaccines; and \ufffd to develop evidence-based national HIV investment cases and plans to ensure sustainable financing of the AIDS response.9 Conducting national, multi-sectoral and participatory reviews and consultations to address legal and policy barriers enables countries to advance implementation of their obligations under international human rights law. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights requires States to respect, protect and fulfil the rights of all people to the highest attainable standard of health10 and provides that States must guarantee that people are able to enjoy the right to health and the other rights guaranteed by the Covenant without discrimination.11 Further, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights requires States to enact laws prohibiting discrimination and to guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination,12 and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) requires States to ensure access to health services throughout the lifecycle and prohibit all forms of discrimination against women.

Introduction 3 signed and/or ratified these international treaties.13 Implementation of International Labour Organization (ILO) Recommendation 200 on HIV and the World of Work is also advanced by these processes. The commitment to conduct reviews and consultations is also critically important to ensure countries achieve the UNAIDS Fast-Track targets as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Fast-Track targets relate to elimination of HIV-related discrimination,14 achieving the 90\u201390\u201390 treatment targets15 and the HIV prevention targets by 2020.16 These commitments support achievement of SDG target 3.3 (end the AIDS epidemic by 2030) and also support progress towards the SDGs relating to gender equality, reducing inequalities, peace and partnerships (further discussed below).

A consultation and action planning workshop for Pacific island countries involving Fiji, Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and Vanuatu was held in 2013. In most cases, national consultations included representatives of people living with HIV and key populations, government representatives (e.g. the national HIV/AIDS coordinating authority, ministries responsible for law and justice, social affairs, women, youth, police and public security), the national human rights institution (NHRI), legal aid providers, UN agencies, NGOs and development partners. In some countries, in-depth interviews were conducted with individual stakeholders and separate consultations or focus group discussions were held with the main stakeholder groups (i.e. government agencies, development partners, NGOs, people living with HIV and key populations) prior to the national consultation meeting (e.g. Cambodia, Lao PDR). In some countries, focused thematic consultations occurred where these were considered a priority. For example, China\u2019s Red Ribbon Forum convened separate national review meetings focused on laws and policies relating to people who use drugs (2013), female sex workers (2014) and MSM (2015), with participation from government, civil society, people living with HIV and key populations. Several countries conducted consultations on legal and policy barriers to access to medicines focusing on intellectual property and flexibilities under the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). In some countries, consultations on legal and policy issues occurred as part of national planning processes. For example, in Viet Nam, consultations were conducted with ministries, development partners and civil society organizations in the development of the Investment Case on Optimizing Viet Nam\u2019s HIV Response, which guides national policy development related to HIV. Parallel to country-level consultations and reviews, several initiatives have been implemented that engaged national stakeholders in regional processes focused on specific legal and policy themes with a view to further supporting countries to take forward reviews and consultations at country level in these areas (see 4.3, Box 3). In most of the countries that completed reviews and consultations in the period 2012-2015, a structured follow-up process has been established to support ongoing work on the legal and human rights aspects of the HIV response, including further reviews and consultations on specific priorities (see 4.1). 17 E.g.

Addressing the legal, policy and human rights aspects of HIV can contribute to a range of SDGs including on poverty elimination, health, gender equality, decent work, reducing inequalities, healthy cities, justice and inclusive institutions and partnerships. The SDGs reflect the need to take an integrated approach across the social, economic and environmental dimensions of development, and highlight the interconnection of human rights with efforts to improve health outcomes, eliminate inequalities and reduce poverty. The UN Secretary-General\u2019s report to the HLM (On the Fast-Track to End the AIDS Epidemic) calls on all partners to work together more coherently in all of these areas across political, cultural, religious and institutional divides. The Secretary-General\u2019s report and the UNAIDS 2016-2021 Strategy propose that countries give particular attention to the following five SDGs in organizing their responses. The legal reviews and consultations in many countries directly addressed several of the outcome areas described below, and in some cases have already resulted in progress: \ufffd SDG 3: Health and wellbeing Comprehensive laws and policies relating to HIV prevention, testing, treatment, care and support, with attention to accessibility, affordability and quality of services. Targets under SDG 3 include ending AIDS by 2030, universal health coverage, universal access to sexual and reproductive health services, and access to affordable medicines using TRIPS flexibilities. \ufffd SDG 5: Gender equality Addressing gender inequality in property and inheritance rights; protection against gender-based sexual and intimate partner violence; freedom from discrimination on grounds of sex, gender, gender identity and gender expression; promoting women\u2019s sexual and reproductive health rights and investing in women\u2019s leadership in HIV responses. \ufffd SDG 10: Reduce inequality Promoting the rights of all people to equally access HIV services and commodities (e.g. condoms, needles and syringes, essential medicines) without discrimination, with particular attention to key populations, women and young people; engaging these populations as a force for transformation in governing, designing and implementing accessible services. \ufffd SDG 16: Promote just, peaceful and inclusive societies Strengthening of laws and policies to protect against stigma, discrimination, violence and hate crimes; removal of punitive laws and policies including travel restrictions and mandatory HIV testing, and punitive laws related to HIV transmission, same-sex sexual relations, sex work and drug use; legal literacy programmes to empower people to know their rights; access to legal services; and sensitization of law makers, police and health-care workers. \ufffd SDG 17: Revitalize the partnership for sustainable development Policy responses and implementation plans built on principles of partnership and cross-sector collaboration, including partnerships and issue-based coalitions that engage governments, civil society, faith communities, the private sector, the scientific community, academia, foundations and local authorities. Achievement of this SDG is supported by policies relating to resource mobilization, human resources for health, technology transfer, engagement with the private sector, costed national plans and country-owned targets. Introduction 7 Box 1: Using the SDGs as entry points for legal and policy priorities Removing legal and policy obstacles to access to HIV services aligns with national health, poverty reduction, rule of law, governance, human rights and equality agendas. The following observations regarding the relevance to the SDGs of work to address legal and policy barriers that impede access to HIV services were made by UNDP and UNAIDS country offices in response to the survey completed with partners in 2016: In Cambodia, follow-up actions arising from the legal review will contribute to SDG 3 on health and well-being and SDG 10 on reduced inequality. Improving legal literacy and increasing access to legal services for key populations will contribute to SDG 16 on peace, justice and strong institutions.

All these SDGs address underlying factors that create HIV vulnerability. Papua New Guinea noted that decriminalization of sex work and sodomy and removal of travel restrictions will provide the legal basis for equal and accessible preventive measures for marginalized populations at greater risk of HIV. This will contribute to progress on SDG 3 (to ensure equality and universal coverage in HIV and health services for all), SDG 5 on gender equality; SDG 10 on reduced inequalities; SDG 16 on peace, justice and strong institutions; and SDG 17 on partnerships. HIV programming in Papua New Guinea is inextricably linked to all these issues. Viet Nam highlighted the inter-related nature of the SDGs on health, rights, gender equality and strong institutions. The UN will work in partnership with Government of Viet Nam to assure that the most vulnerable populations do not get left behind as the country strives to enhance prosperity, including through follow up to reviews and consultations on barriers to universal access to HIV services. 2. Overview of progress and emerging challenges 9 Areas of progress Reports from countries confirm that there has been solid progress in strengthening laws and policies supporting expanded availability of HIV treatment and prevention options, including antiretroviral therapy (ART) for treatment and prevention, condoms, needles and syringes, opioid substitution therapy (OST) and community-based HIV testing. Several countries have also introduced or strengthened legal protections for people living with HIV in the key areas of protections from discrimination, breach of confidentiality and rights to informed consent. Issues regarding sex work, drug use, sexual orientation, gender identity and gender equality remain sensitive in many countries. Achieving progress in relation to removal of punitive laws in these areas and introduction of laws that are protective of the human rights of key populations has been highly challenging in most countries. Nonetheless, as chapter 3 illustrates, much progress has been achieved. Multiple stakeholders across the region have engaged in a broad range of activities to advance the human rights of key populations. The significant progress that has occurred has been a result of engagement and leadership of communities, NHRIs, parliamentarians, service providers and government (particularly the justice and health sectors). Important measures have been taken that lay the foundations for ongoing improvements to the enabling legal environment, including: \ufffd community mobilization, advocacy and campaigning on legal and policy priorities; \ufffd systematic documentation of human rights violations, legal research and analysis; \ufffd dialogues on thematic issues engaging government and civil society in discussions of specific legislative options; \ufffd legislative drafting and introduction of legislative bills into parliament for debate; \ufffd use of justice systems for seeking justice and structural change; and \ufffd raising legal and policy reform proposals through UN human rights reporting mechanisms. Further, countries have made notable progress in sensitizing law enforcement bodies to HIV and the issues affecting key populations (3.3.2), and important steps have been made in providing people living with HIV and key populations with information about their rights and access to legal services (3.4.2). In a few countries, breakthroughs have been achieved of global significance, such as new constitutional protections in the area of sexual orientation and gender identity in Fiji and Nepal. Thailand has passed a gender equality law prohibiting discrimination on the ground of gender expression and India\u2019s Supreme Court issued a landmark judgment on the human rights of transgender people. In relation to sex work, Cambodia has paved the way for other countries in moving to a model of regulation based on a labour rights and public health approach, rather than criminalization. Myanmar\u2019s parliament acted quickly to decriminalize possession of needles and syringes in response to a recommendation of the national review. Mongolia has updated its national AIDS law to strengthen protections for people living with HIV and remove travel restrictions. Some of the most progressive examples of reform have occurred at provincial and local level, such as anti-discrimination ordinances introduced in the Philippines and establishment of state Welfare Boards for Transgender People in India. Continuing and emerging challenges Despite significant improvements to laws, policies and practices in many areas, in some countries leadership on these issues is faltering and there are examples of a return to punitive approaches that drive key populations underground and away from services. For example, developments of concern since 2012 that highlight the need for creating enabling legal and policy environments for access to services include: \ufffd In some localities, needle and syringe programmes (NSPs) have been suspended due to political pressure and lack of enabling legal frameworks. \ufffd Some countries or provinces have introduced", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c3fd7a1-c7a4-4785-923f-89be9e581961": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c3fd7a1-c7a4-4785-923f-89be9e581961", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-country-progress-addressing-legal-and-policy-barriers-universal-access-hiv-services-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Review of country progress in addressing legal and policy barriers to universal access to HIV services in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-country-progress-addressing-legal-and-policy-barriers-universal-access-hiv-services-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c67539eb2cbcd63c222e9ef3c4868ea3479dd11988f0288f3f5c2447ea461421"}, "3": {"node_id": "298fd29b-e563-4a81-8a7e-4195b142db40", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-country-progress-addressing-legal-and-policy-barriers-universal-access-hiv-services-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aeade837d92b631df9af352c8241c6ead61436d69fb702770bebc7ea580c3b09"}}, "hash": "2a87ae283a16a7a89b3cc067ed8bb97365f6e63d92c5b276ec8be8e3de97772f", "text": "corporal punishment for same-sex sexual relations and cross- dressing. Review of country progress in addressing legal and policy barriers to universal access to HIV services in Asia and the Pacific 10 \ufffd Some apex courts of countries in Asia have upheld penal code provisions that criminalize consensual sex between men. \ufffd The UN and others continue to document widespread physical and psychological violence and discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people in the region.20 \ufffd There have been reports that local government authorities in some countries have forcibly evicted thousands of sex workers from brothels in areas where sex work had previously been tolerated. \ufffd Incidents have been reported in several countries in which sex workers, people who use drugs, MSM and transgender people have been arbitrarily arrested and detained without legal basis. \ufffd Reports by many civil society organizations and networks across the region point to a shrinking of the space in which to conduct advocacy. There is a trend towards increased regulation of foreign organizations, local NGOs and community-based organizations including those active on human rights issues affecting key populations. \ufffd In some countries, national HIV bills that recognize and protect the rights of people living with and affected by HIV and provide clear remedies for violations of such rights have languished in the parliament without necessary political support to be passed into law. These developments underscore the importance of avoiding complacency and investing in leadership. They also reinforce the importance of a regional approach, since approaches taken in one country in the region can influence others. Leadership and political engagement are key to resolving law and policy reform bottlenecks. Political resistance to law and policy reform proposals often arises due to arguments based on morality, culture, religion and tradition and there is often pressure to avoid issues perceived as controversial. Therefore, continued progress in these areas will require sustained leadership. An area in which progress has been slow is strengthening legal and policy protections for key affected women and girls. In some cases, national reviews and consultations have not yet considered many of the legal and policy priorities affecting women and girls, such as inadequate protections from sexual and intimate partner violence, inequalities in property and inheritance rights, lack of access to post-exposure prophylaxis for rape survivors, stigma and discrimination in healthcare settings, especially for women who use drugs, and failure of health care services to address the sexual and reproductive health needs of women and girls living with HIV. To address these gaps, countries can consider convening specific consultations focused on key affected women and girls and integrating processes designed to assess national HIV responses from a gender perspective into general reviews and consultations. For example, guidance on integrating gender into assessments of HIV responses21 could be used to inform discussions on legal reviews and consultations. 20 See: Joint United Nations Statement, Ending violence and discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people, September 2015, available at: http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Discrimination/Joint_LGBTI_Statement_ENG.PDF 21 UNAIDS (2014).

Key country-level recommendations since 2012 13 3.1 Law and policy reform 3.1.1 Priorities recommended by reviews and consultations The law and policy reform priorities identified by reviews and consultations can be categorized under the following headings, as described below: i. Access to rights-based HIV treatment and prevention services. ii. Strengthening of protective laws and policies. iii. Removal of punitive laws. iv. Mobilizing public support for legal and policy reforms. HIV treatment and prevention Most national reviews and consultations generated recommendations on improving access, availability and quality of HIV treatment and prevention services. Legal and policy measures recommended by countries included: \ufffd Policies guaranteeing universal access to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) to eligible patients (Indonesia, Lao PDR, Myanmar) including for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT). \ufffd Adoption of the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO) on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and \u2018treatment as prevention\u2019 including access to ART immediately after diagnosis (Lao PDR) and community-led HIV testing and services (Nepal). \ufffd Integration of HIV services in primary care, sexual and reproductive health, maternal and child health services and health systems (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Malaysia, Fiji). \ufffd Laws and policies enabling access to ART for migrant workers (Lao PDR, Thailand).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "298fd29b-e563-4a81-8a7e-4195b142db40": {"__data__": {"id_": "298fd29b-e563-4a81-8a7e-4195b142db40", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-country-progress-addressing-legal-and-policy-barriers-universal-access-hiv-services-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Review of country progress in addressing legal and policy barriers to universal access to HIV services in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-country-progress-addressing-legal-and-policy-barriers-universal-access-hiv-services-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c67539eb2cbcd63c222e9ef3c4868ea3479dd11988f0288f3f5c2447ea461421"}, "2": {"node_id": "0c3fd7a1-c7a4-4785-923f-89be9e581961", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-country-progress-addressing-legal-and-policy-barriers-universal-access-hiv-services-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2a87ae283a16a7a89b3cc067ed8bb97365f6e63d92c5b276ec8be8e3de97772f"}}, "hash": "aeade837d92b631df9af352c8241c6ead61436d69fb702770bebc7ea580c3b09", "text": "\ufffd Laws and policies enabling access to ART for migrant workers (Lao PDR, Thailand). \ufffd Inclusion of HIV treatment services in national health insurance schemes (Indonesia, Thailand, Viet Nam). \ufffd Addressing institutional discrimination by providing HIV in general hospitals, rather than infectious disease hospitals (China), and ending segregation of patients living with HIV in hospital care (Myanmar). \ufffd Promoting access of adolescents to HIV testing, prevention and treatment services.

Review of country progress in addressing legal and policy barriers to universal access to HIV services in Asia and the Pacific 14 Recommendations of particular relevance to key affected women and girls included: \ufffd Develop policies on the reproductive rights of women and girls living with HIV. Laws and policies should prohibit coerced sterilization or abortion and denial of reproductive health care (Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar). \ufffd Remove restrictions on access to information on contraceptive services for unmarried women. Reduce the stigma that single women experience in accessing reproductive health services (Indonesia). \ufffd Development of policies on HIV services for women whose husbands or intimate partners are HIV-positive, including couples testing and counselling services and treatment as prevention options (Lao PDR). \ufffd Issue a national policy on post-exposure prophylaxis for survivors of sexual assaults (Cambodia). Some countries highlighted the need for amendment of patent laws to enable countries to apply the flexibilities of the TRIPS Agreement to expand availability of drugs for treatment of HIV and related conditions such as tuberculosis and hepatitis C (Cambodia, Indonesia and Myanmar). Some countries also recommended scrutiny of trade agreements to ensure they do not restrict access to generic drugs by preventing countries from exercising TRIPS flexibilities (Malaysia, Myanmar). Other countries did not consider these issues in the national reviews or consultations due to the need for a different group of stakeholders to be consulted for accurate assessment of barriers and development of recommendations. Several countries chose to further advance this agenda through separate thematic consultations. Strengthening of protective laws and policies National reviews and consultations recommended that a high priority be given to the enactment of protective laws and policies in the following areas: \ufffd Discrimination protections. Improving legal and policy responses to discrimination was a common theme across all countries. Recommendations included actions to address discrimination in a range of contexts including public and private sector activities in health care, education, employment, insurance, accommodation, prisons and other closed settings. Protection from discrimination was recommended for people living with HIV, their families and carers, as well as for key populations and women and girls affected by HIV. \ufffd Requirements for informed consent to HIV testing and treatment, and prohibition of any form of mandatory or compulsory HIV testing (including testing of migrants, pre-marital and pre-employment HIV testing) (Bangladesh, China, Malaysia, Myanmar). \ufffd Requirements relating to confidentiality of HIV status (Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal). \ufffd Legal recognition of transgender people (Bangladesh, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal). \ufffd Replace mandatory pre-marital HIV testing with voluntary confidential HIV testing and counselling and ensure sero-discordant couples retain the right to marriage (Malaysia). \ufffd Policies to ensure gender-sensitive HIV services including the rights of all women and girls (including those living with HIV) to access HIV services including PMTCT, family planning and reproductive health services (Myanmar). \ufffd Protections for all people from violence including sexual violence and hate crimes. Reviews stressed the importance of ensuring laws and policies respond to violence targeting key populations, taking into account reports of incidents of serious violence affecting MSM and transgender people (Bangladesh, Indonesia, Mongolia) and sex workers (Bangladesh, Malaysia, Myanmar, Pakistan, Viet Nam). Reviews also identified the need for comprehensive laws and policies relating to gender-based violence, given that sexual and intimate partner violence affecting women and girls increases the risk of acquiring HIV (Cambodia, Myanmar).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "115624f4-9ada-4a94-b41d-7b510f1fb69a": {"__data__": {"id_": "115624f4-9ada-4a94-b41d-7b510f1fb69a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-country-progress-addressing-legal-and-policy-barriers-universal-access-hiv-services-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Review of country progress in addressing legal and policy barriers to universal access to HIV services in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-country-progress-addressing-legal-and-policy-barriers-universal-access-hiv-services-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "30bb642f29cbce8a9c5ed748ce086a3738df5de9ef054987f105f58a7b26a13e"}, "2": {"node_id": "fcce7a18-92d8-4f99-bdac-7ac4b7be3e04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-country-progress-addressing-legal-and-policy-barriers-universal-access-hiv-services-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6c61065d70a2605e92cee2b2cf1f4e2d56d42115b8e7b44e99a7710dfc84c86c"}}, "hash": "24e45c4d06c84c80097e86b0e694154f85968afa70b061898b52f4134572d8bd", "text": "\ufffd Policies that allow for comprehensive sexuality education for school-age youth (Bangladesh, Mongolia). 3.

Implementation of this agreement remains challenging, as most people arrested on charges of drug use or possession are still imprisoned. Community stakeholders have made submissions to government calling for decriminalization of drug use and possession of drugs for personal use. \ufffd Lao PDR: Formal representations were made to the government\u2019s Penal Code drafting committee in 2015 calling for an amendment to the draft to prevent people from being criminalized for possession of small quantities of drugs for their personal use. \ufffd Myanmar: Consultations were conducted on a new Drugs Law in 2015.

The redrafted law is yet to be approved by parliament. \ufffd Thailand: In 2014, the Foundation for AIDS Rights prepared a draft code of laws to decriminalize drug use and enshrine harm reduction in national law.

Reasons for weak enforcement of protective laws include lack of knowledge about the law and the process for seeking redress among law enforcement agencies and the community. Punitive laws against certain behaviours were also reported to interfere with access to legal protections technically available to all. Most countries included recommendations relating to sensitization and education of law enforcement agencies and the judiciary on the rights of people living with HIV and key populations under protective laws.

Review of country progress in addressing legal and policy barriers to universal access to HIV services in Asia and the Pacific 24 recommended that an accountability mechanism be established to ensure that police enforce protective laws, including prosecution of perpetrators of violence including sexual violence against sex workers. Other recommendations relating to strengthening of enforcement of protective laws included training of health care workers on gender equality (Indonesia), and on human rights and medical ethics related to HIV (Fiji), enforcing compliance of health care workers in implementing the protocols for reproductive health care and PMTCT to ensure that unmarried clients are not stigmatized (Indonesia), and developing briefs for government officials, health and education services on their legal obligations (Myanmar). Some countries recommended establishing new procedures or clarifying existing procedures for the handling of complaints of discrimination in employment, education and health care (Cambodia, Myanmar). Some countries recommended documentation and research to better understand the circumstances of rights violations and the avenues for assistance, e.g. Indonesia recommended that a Stigma Index study be conducted to generate data on the nature and extent of discrimination. 3.2.2 Examples of progress Progress of countries in implementing recommendations relating to enforcement of protective laws include: \ufffd In India, a new national process for handling HIV-related health care complaints has been proposed that involves establishing an Ombudsman in each State with power to issue orders in relation to health care complaints.42 \ufffd In the Philippines, the Department of Labour and Employment provided training on legal obligations in the workplace. Although the Philippines has prohibited discrimination on the grounds of HIV since 1998, very few cases have been brought to court.

Key country-level recommendations since 2012 25 3.3 Reducing police abuses in enforcing punitive laws 3.3.1 Priorities recommended by reviews and consultations National reviews and consultations in many countries noted that abusive police conduct towards key populations impedes access to HIV services. Examples include confiscation of condoms from sex workers and MSM, confiscation of syringes from people who inject drugs, and police harassment, violence and other abuses directed at peer educators, sex workers, people who use drugs, MSM and transgender people. Recommendations to address police abuses included education, training and sensitization of police about HIV and key populations (Myanmar, Lao PDR, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Thailand) including programmes to train police to respond to crimes involving sexual minorities (Mongolia) and official guidance to police to refrain from harassing peer educators (Bangladesh, Myanmar). Several countries recommended that guidelines, standard operating procedures or instructions be provided to law enforcement agencies on access to condoms and syringes, including not to confiscate condoms or syringes or use them as evidence (Cambodia, China, Malaysia, Myanmar). Bangladesh recommended that police guidelines require the presence of a woman officer at the time of arrest of a female sex worker, and that legal representation be provided. Some countries proposed that local cooperation arrangements be formalized between police, communities and HIV prevention services (Cambodia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Indonesia). Bangladesh recommended that a mechanism be established to monitor police conduct and to ensure accountability to prevent police abuses affecting key populations. 3.3.2 Examples of progress Progress in improving police conduct includes: \ufffd Cambodia\u2019s Most-at-Risk Populations Community Partnership Initiative (MCPI) (also referred to as the Police Community Partnership Initiative (PCPI)) is an example of good practice as an intervention that supports HIV prevention by improving relations between police, prevention services and key populations. Following Cambodia\u2019s legal review, the government scaled-up the MCPI programme to 14 provinces. Challenges remain in implementing the programme, which needs to be standardized across implementing partners. To address this, a MCPI SOP will be developed in 2016. \ufffd China\u2019s Red Ribbon Forum advocated for the police to stop the use of condoms as evidence of sex work offences, however the Public Security Bureau is yet to confirm follow-up actions. \ufffd HIV organizations in Hong Kong SAR made representations to the judiciary and police to stop the practice of using condoms as evidence in prosecution of sex workers. \ufffd In Myanmar, police attended trainings on HIV and drug use, and government officials attended an international best practice study tour on HIV and drug use in 2015. Information was also provided to police on existing instructions against use of condoms as evidence. \ufffd In Thailand, police training has been implemented through a partnership between the Royal Thai Police, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Public Health, Foundation for AIDS Rights and UNDP. Since 2013, the Innovative Learning Programme on HIV and Human Rights in the Context of Law Enforcement has sensitized police to issues concerning human rights, people living with HIV and key populations. Review of country progress in addressing legal and policy barriers to universal access to HIV services in Asia and the Pacific 26 3.4 Access to justice 3.4.1 Priorities recommended by reviews and consultations Reviews and consultations recommended the following range of measures to expand access to justice: \ufffd Establish formal mechanisms for inquiring into complaints and redressing grievances (Myanmar).

Mechanisms for follow-up and accelerating progress 29 4.1 National coordination and planning mechanisms Many countries that held national reviews and consultations are engaging in ongoing activities to improve the legal and policy environment. Progress in implementing these ongoing activities has been supported by: i. Integration of outcomes of reviews into existing planning processes. ii. Multi-sectoral and participatory approaches to implementation engaging key populations. iii. High-level government engagement. iv. Prioritization and focus. v. Attention to sub-national contexts.

Importantly, reporting will be integrated into national reporting on the SDGs. (ii) Multi-sectoral and participatory approaches Implementation of recommendations from reviews has been supported by: \ufffd Multi-sectoral engagement across government, e.g. engagement of ministries responsible for health, law and justice (including law enforcement and public security agencies, correctional services and the judiciary), education, labour and immigration. \ufffd Engagement of a range of stakeholders including government, UN agencies, NGOs and civil society, including participation of people living with HIV and key populations. Progress has occurred where formal, national processes have been established for engaging civil society and different sectors of government. These processes provided forums for sharing experiences and developing evidence-informed solutions. Inclusive and participatory processes ensured that a wide range of civil society and government stakeholders had ownership in the process and outcomes. Civil society participation supports accountability and transparency and can also help to empower people living with HIV and key populations to play an ongoing role in advocacy, policy formulation and implementation of policy changes. In addition to participation at national level, there was a very high level of participation and engagement of civil society (including representatives of national and regional organizations and networks of key populations) Review of country progress in addressing legal and policy barriers to universal access to HIV services in Asia and the Pacific 30 in the 2012 and 2015 intergovernmental meetings on HIV and AIDS and the creation of the ESCAP frameworks for action. However, in some countries, engagement of key populations in reviews and follow-up work has been limited due to criminalization, stigma, discrimination and fear of disclosure. For example, it was reported that people living with HIV did not participate in planning mechanisms in the Federated States of Micronesia because of fear of public identification of their HIV status, and in Samoa sex workers did not participate in planning due to the fear of being stigmatized. This underscores the need for capacity building efforts to support community participation and sensitivity to confidentiality concerns. In some countries, key populations were engaged through pre-consultation meetings and focus group discussions, in which participants could opt not to be identified. Other challenges in implementing participatory processes included: ensuring adequate representation of women and transgender people to ensure that the gender dimensions of legal and policy issues received attention; engaging young people, particularly young key affected populations; engaging people who are prepared to identify as people who use drugs; and enabling people in prisons and other closed settings to participate. Examples of ongoing planning and implementation using participatory approaches include: \ufffd Cambodia: The Joint Forum of Networks of People Living with HIV and Most-at-Risk Populations (FoNPAMs) was used as a platform for ensuring community participation in follow up, including development of a \u2018removing legal barriers\u2019 module for the Global Fund proposal. However, it was noted that people who use drugs were not well represented due to limited capacity. \ufffd China: The action framework was implemented using the Red Ribbon Forum, which is a quasi- governmental organization with representatives of ministries, including health, public security and the State Council AIDS Working Committee, informed by ongoing consultations with key populations. The Red Ribbon Forum\u2019s expert committee and executive board acts as a multi-sectoral government advisory body. \ufffd Fiji: An Action Plan was developed through a multi-sectoral and participatory dialogue with the involvement of the President of Fiji, clinicians, key populations and a lawyer. The Action Plan was adopted by the country\u2019s HIV/AIDS Board, which is a Board established by Decree with representation from ministries responsible for health, education, women, youth and police, and community representation including a person living with HIV. \ufffd Indonesia: Implementation of the Action Plan on laws and human rights is guided by the National AIDS Commission Working Group on Human Rights and Gender.

Another mechanism for engaging government was the Core Working Group on the Intellectual Property Law, which included Myanmar Positive Group, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Information, UN agencies, NGOs and a law firm. \ufffd Thailand: Since 2012 a National Sub-committee on Rights Promotion and Protection has operated with participation of people living with HIV, MSM, people who inject drugs and sex workers. Government sectors also participate in the Sub-Committee and meeting outcomes are reported to the meetings of the National AIDS Committee. Civil society organizations formed a sub-committee of the National Reform Council to take forward recommendations on drug law reform. \ufffd Viet Nam: The National Committee for AIDS, Drug and Prostitution Prevention and Control is a national multi-sectoral coordination mechanism chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister. Policy issues are also addressed through the Viet Nam Country Coordinating Mechanism, which was re-structured in 2014 to 4. Mechanisms for follow-up and accelerating progress 31 include more civil society representatives from key populations, people living with HIV and community- based organizations. UN leadership and collaboration The UN played an important role in supporting follow-up in the majority of countries. In 2014, ESCAP, UNDP and UNAIDS co-organized the regional Expert Group Meeting to enable countries to share experiences and lessons learned in conducting reviews and consultations.45 Examples of countries in which the coordinated engagement of the broader UN Country Team has been strong are Lao PDR, Myanmar and Viet Nam. \ufffd In Lao PDR, UNAIDS, UNDP, WHO and UNODC collaborated with the Ministry of Health\u2019s Centre for HIV/AIDS and STIs to identify an agreed pathway for acting on priority recommendations from the review relating to laws on sex work, drug use and criminalization of HIV transmission. Recommendations were considered by the government taskforce responsible for drafting the new Penal Code and were referred to technical working groups under the National Strategy and Action Plan on HIV and AIDS. \ufffd In Myanmar, follow-up activities on developing a national HIV law and related policies have been coordinated by UNAIDS and UNDP. UNODC played a key role in supporting a national consultation on reforming the narcotics law, and UNFPA coordinated country inputs to the regional study on violence and sex work. UNAIDS, UN Women, UNFPA, UNDP and UNICEF made joint representations to the Ministry of Home Affairs on sex work law reform. \ufffd In Viet Nam, the UN Country Team provided technical support to the drafting committee for new laws relating to sex work and drug use. This provided a strategic opportunity for the UN to engage as one in supporting Government of Viet Nam. The UN Country Team reviewed consecutive drafts of the Law and provided joint UN comments. Civil society experts on sex work and drug use also participated in meetings. (iii) High-level government engagement to support outcomes \ufffd Cambodia: The National Legal and Policies Technical Working Group of the National AIDS Authority presented recommendations to a meeting of the government\u2019s Council of Ministers in 2014, which endorsed the National Legal and Policy Review Report. \ufffd China: The convening of the national consultation at Renmin University allowed for participation of public security officials and the National People\u2019s Congress. Proposals from the Red Ribbon Forum expert committee were presented to government departments, and as background documents for the Chinese Political Consultative Conference and the National People\u2019s Congress. \ufffd India: UNDP facilitation of consultations in 13 states brought thousands of transgender women to interface directly with the senior state-level political leaders, judiciary and government officials to discuss the specific welfare needs of the transgender community. \ufffd Viet Nam: The Ambassadors and UN Heads of Agency Coordination Group on HIV engaged in advocacy with the Deputy Prime Minister and government ministers on reform of laws on sex work and drug use. The Social Affairs Committee of the National Assembly organized policy dialogues on sex work and harm reduction, which enhanced the understanding of parliamentarians and it was agreed that the Social Affairs Committee would advocate for specific legal and policy changes.

(iv) Prioritization and focus National reviews generally resulted in comprehensive and detailed recommendations reflecting the various inputs received through consultations. The agenda for each country is potentially lengthy. It is therefore critically important that countries engage in an ongoing priority setting process, taking into account local political realities 45 Expert Group Meeting on the Implementation of National Reviews and Consultations on Legal and Policy Barriers to Universal Access to HIV Services, 4-5 March 2014, Pattaya, Thailand. Review of country progress in addressing legal and policy barriers to universal access to HIV services in Asia and the Pacific 32 and opportunities, potential impact on achieving zero discrimination and ending AIDS, and the likely timeframe for achieving results. Country mechanisms in Lao PDR and Myanmar developed consensus on \u2018quick wins\u2019 that could be achieved in a two-year timeframe, as well as identifying medium and longer term goals. This enabled development of action frameworks with an immediate strategic focus on achievable changes (such as influencing Penal Code drafting processes in Lao PDR and amending the Excise Act in Myanmar), while ensuring longer term law and policy reform objectives remain on the agenda as part of ongoing planning processes. Bangladesh also developed a time-bound action plan to guide follow-up of recommendations, and has proposed a consultation process for identifying the short and medium term priorities. Pakistan\u2019s review also distinguished short, medium and long term recommendations. Papua New Guinea has mobilized political support around three top legislative priorities, recognizing that these priorities may require several years of focused advocacy: decriminalization of sex work and sodomy, and removal of travel restrictions. The scheduling of regular national meetings to take account of evolving political developments and to adjust approaches is an important strategy to ensure advocacy has a clear focus and does not lose momentum. For example, in Thailand, the Sub-Committee on Rights Promotion and Protection meets every two months, followed by an annual HIV situation and human rights meeting. Papua New Guinea\u2019s Legal Reform Reference Group convenes monthly meetings to support the progress of penal code reforms. (v) Attention to sub-national contexts Some of the legal reviews have resulted in actions focusing on particular provinces and districts that are highly affected by HIV and/or that have locally-specific legal and policy obstacles. For example: \ufffd In Cambodia, a Standard Operating Procedure is being drafted on enabling environment issues to assist reaching the 90:90:90 targets in 34 identified priority districts. \ufffd In the Philippines, there has been a strong focus on addressing HIV policy though Local Government Units and drafting of provincial and city ordinances to support HIV responses and combat discrimination. Sub- national consultations were held in Mindanao and Visayas. \ufffd In Indonesia, the national review identified a range of discriminatory local regulations that obstruct access to HIV services. To encourage local authorities to issue supportive regulations, the National AIDS Commission, UNAIDS and UNDP are compiling a good practice document of positive local laws that can be replicated by other local level administrations and used to contribute to guidance by the Ministry of Law and Human Rights for local legal drafters. In Indonesia\u2019s Papua province, UNFPA worked with officials to draft protective local laws. \ufffd In Myanmar, sub-national dissemination meetings were held in the north (Mandalay Region) and Shan State to share the recommendations from the national consultation meeting with partners working at the local level. 4.2 Country inputs into global human rights reporting mecha- nisms Treaty reporting mechanisms and the UPR process provide an opportunity for country stakeholders to accelerate progress on removing legal and policy obstacles to access to HIV services. Several countries have used information and recommendations from national reviews and consultations to directly inform submissions to the UPR for their country. Examples of effective use of the UPR process include: \ufffd The UN Country Team submissions to the UPR for Myanmar referred to issues identified in the national reviews and consultations relating to the rights of young people to access HIV testing and treatment, drug law reform, decriminalization of same-sex sexual conduct and the need for protections against discrimination and gender-based violence. \ufffd Submissions from the UN Country Team for the UPR for Nepal also raised a number of the issues from the national consultation (e.g. women\u2019s limited access to PMTCT services, overly broad criminalization of HIV transmission and \u2018unnatural sex\u2019 in the draft Penal Code, mandatory HIV testing, discrimination in employment, housing and travel), and cited the regional study on violence against sex workers.46", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e6f9bda-c017-4caf-8592-888ff8660ba9": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e6f9bda-c017-4caf-8592-888ff8660ba9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-country-progress-addressing-legal-and-policy-barriers-universal-access-hiv-services-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Review of country progress in addressing legal and policy barriers to universal access to HIV services in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-country-progress-addressing-legal-and-policy-barriers-universal-access-hiv-services-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4781a4237ce968d88eeaf6e0c9e1ef729123708bba43167cc51ef25876baa253"}, "3": {"node_id": "550dade9-0ba9-427e-8697-276ca77ed795", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-country-progress-addressing-legal-and-policy-barriers-universal-access-hiv-services-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c5f14fb8f5fb28f5a95765ed69cd1eb979efb8d25215ee6d9b18aa268b16f126"}}, "hash": "848084abdeafb1451d0976db617b127df3c4f484168b82d33005e346a0c0d16e", "text": "Nepal\u2019s National Human Rights Commission also prepared a report to the Working Group of the UPR drawing from dialogues with women and girls affected by HIV.

The Government of Viet Nam accepted the UPR recommendation to develop a law to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. This is in line with Concluding Observations on the second to fourth periodic reports of Viet Nam to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Examples where civil society has been effective in influencing the recommendations from the the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) include: \ufffd In Cambodia, the Khmer HIV/AIDS NGO Alliance and the Cambodian Community of Women Living with HIV provided inputs to the Cambodian NGO Committee on CEDAW\u2019s 2013 shadow report.49 As a result, the CEDAW Committee Concluding Observations50 included recommendations on access to free ART for women engaged in sex work and pregnant women, and actions to combat discrimination against pregnant women living with HIV. \ufffd In China, civil society organizations submitted a shadow report on issues affecting women living with and affected by HIV and sexual minorities in 2014, informed by surveys of women living with HIV and interviews with NGOs and sex workers. As a result, the CEDAW Committee\u2019s Concluding Observations included a recommendation on measures to eliminate discrimination against women living with HIV and support for women\u2019s organizations that provide HIV care. A government official also stated that China recognizes the rights of all citizens regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. \ufffd In Indonesia, a shadow CEDAW report was prepared by women\u2019s NGOs, which highlighted several HIV issues. As a result, the CEDAW Concluding Observations in 2012 included recommendations on discrimination affecting women living with HIV, the sexual and reproductive health rights of unmarried women and actions to ensure women can access contraception without the consent of their husbands.51 \ufffd In Viet Nam, NGO networks prepared a shadow report to the CEDAW Committee in 2015. The Viet Nam Network of Women Living with HIV/AIDS provided inputs. Civil society and the UN raised the issue of gender-based violence, including violence against sex workers. As a result the CEDAW Committee\u2019s 2015 Concluding Observations for Viet Nam included recommendations to decriminalize female sex workers and to strengthen enforcement of the Law on HIV and AIDS Prevention and Control to address stigma and 46 Bhattacharjya, M., Fulu, E. and Murthy, L. with Seshu, M.S., Cabassi, J. and Vallejo Mestres, M.

Regional frameworks have been developed on specific issues, such as transition plans for phasing out CCDUs, which include a pillar on conducting reviews on legal and policy barriers to moving towards community-based treatment and services.53 Another example of a regional framework designed to accelerate progress at country level is the Programme of Action and Support for NHRIs in addressing sexual orientation, gender identity and intersex issues, agreed in 2015.54 UN regional bodies have played an important role in supporting country-level planning and implementation of recommendations. This support took a variety of forms. The Ad-Hoc UN Regional Interagency Team on Enabling Legal Environments led by ESCAP, UNDP and UNAIDS played an active role in regional tracking and monitoring of progress, and in strengthening the evidence base on effective legal and policy approaches. Analysis of progress in addressing legal and policy priorities was disseminated through global and regional events such as the 2015 ESCAP Asia-Pacific Intergovernmental Meeting on HIV and AIDS and the 2015 International Harm Reduction Conference. Regional and country progress and outputs were regularly disseminated using the HIV and AIDS Data Hub for Asia and the Pacific55 and the ESCAP website.56 Another source of support to country-level action was the UN Inter Agency Task Team on Women, Girls, Gender Equality and HIV, which coordinates efforts of UN agencies and civil society to address health and HIV challenges faced by marginalized women. In many cases the regional offices of UN agencies and the UNAIDS Technical Support Facility brokered and coordinated technical support to countries to conduct and document reviews, consultations and follow-up work. For example, UNDP leveraged resources from two multi-country grants from the Global Fund.57 Additional resources for reviews, consultations and follow-up activities were mobilized from a variety of sources including the Technical Support Facility for Asia and the Pacific, UNDP, UNAIDS, UNODC, UNFPA, ESCAP, the Global Fund and other international development partners (e.g. European Union Human Rights Commission provided a grant to assist implementation of recommendations in Mongolia and the United Kingdom provided support to community participation in the Myanmar consultations). In the Pacific, the Regional Rights Resource Team of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community has played an important technical support role. Fiji has proposed targeting the Melanesian Spearhead Group (a regional political leaders\u2019 forum) to support implementation of recommendations. Many countries participated in regional initiatives supported by UN agencies and development partners to develop the technical capacities of country stakeholders to respond to legal and policy issues (Box 3). Regional initiatives can add significant value to national responses in providing opportunities for sharing information on legislative and policy models as well as strategies for achieving change. Regional initiatives also provide an opportunity to conduct advocacy. 52 Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, Concluding observations on the combined seventh and eighth periodic reports of Viet Nam, 24 July 2015, CEDAW/C/VNM/CO/7-8, paragraphs 21, 32 and 33. 53 Report of the Third Regional Consultation on Compulsory Centres for Drug Users in Asia and the Pacific, 21-23 September 2015, Manila, Philippines. 54 UNDP, Asia Pacific Forum of NHRIs (2015), Programme of action and support: The role of National Human Rights Institutions in promoting and protecting human rights in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity including health rights in Asia and the Pacific. 55 http://www.aidsdatahub.org/stigma 56 http://www.unescap.org 57 Multi-Country South Asia Global Fund HIV Programme (MSA-910-G02-H) and the ISEAN/HIV Multi-Country Global Fund HIV Programme (ME1-011-G01-H). 4.

Regional forums can be particularly helpful to ensure governments and other actors such as NHRIs are exposed to examples of progress from other countries. Government officials may be more willing to consider new approaches in discussions convened at the regional level than at country-level.

Conclusion 39 This report has illustrated the many ways that national reviews and consultations, follow-up activities and related regional initiatives have helped countries in Asia and the Pacific to identify and address specific legal and policy barriers impacting HIV responses, thereby advancing the human rights of people living with HIV and key populations. The 2016 HLM on HIV and AIDS presents an opportunity for countries in Asia and the Pacific to embed the issues and recommendations identified through these national and regional processes in the global framework that will provide guidance and support for future HIV responses. The examples of progress provided by this report are intended to support stakeholders in Asia and the Pacific to further their efforts in advancing their country priorities and to respond to new legal and policy challenges as they arise. It is also hoped that the summaries of country progress and the description of the ways that country responses benefited from regional initiatives and overarching regional accountability frameworks will be useful for other regions around the world in designing and implementing legal and policy measures to end AIDS by 2030 and in addressing legal and policy barriers to achieving other related SDGs. This analysis of approaches implemented in Asia and the Pacific suggests that ongoing efforts are particularly needed in the following areas: \ufffd Cultivating champions Leadership will be key to addressing law reform bottlenecks, particularly in relation to laws on sensitive issues such as sexual orientation, gender identity, gender equality and drug use. Leaders can be mobilized from community groups including organizations and networks of people living with HIV and key populations, parliamentary groups, faith-based organizations, NHRIs, the judiciary, legal and medical professionals and the media. Private sector leadership will be important for some issues, such as workplace rights, where private sector employers can demonstrate the benefits of workforce diversity and inclusion policies and practices in challenging stigma and discrimination. Leadership from within the justice sector is critical. Leadership from law enforcement bodies is important to challenge and change harmful practices by some police and public security agencies that tolerate or turn a blind eye towards abuses of key populations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ef723f46-7516-4707-85bc-81dd2e26262a": {"__data__": {"id_": "ef723f46-7516-4707-85bc-81dd2e26262a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-country-progress-addressing-legal-and-policy-barriers-universal-access-hiv-services-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Review of country progress in addressing legal and policy barriers to universal access to HIV services in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-country-progress-addressing-legal-and-policy-barriers-universal-access-hiv-services-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1278327061c10295076dd41fc5ac94b1e9e84599e03a6d7bfc1db683ff12802c"}, "2": {"node_id": "b1fe04f2-5b28-43f3-8ed7-66325790398d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-country-progress-addressing-legal-and-policy-barriers-universal-access-hiv-services-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a164d2632721413311cfd67049d578ddff9279d2341e9c8d33ec754057f7a370"}}, "hash": "ceb4ac6be5e018c65a8af4ae5927ae2aa9415a2fecf1aa3d8a25de1a53a80f1b", "text": "Leadership from police and public security bodies can promote partnership approaches that enable harm reduction services and HIV prevention, testing and treatment services to reach key populations. \ufffd Empowerment, participatory approaches and meaningful inclusion Engaging communities of people living with HIV, key populations and key affected women and girls will remain of fundamental importance to ensure community voices can continue to advocate for action to end discrimination, violence and other human rights violations and participate in reform processes.

In planning future reviews and consultations, countries may need to consider special measures to ensure particular groups such as these are not left behind. Participation can be facilitated through focused, thematic consultations, focus group discussions and pre-consultations designed to ensure participation of neglected populations whose voices are seldom heard. \ufffd Increased focus on location and population The UNAIDS Strategy 2016-2021 encourages countries to give greater attention to location and population in fast-tracking HIV responses. This approach requires focusing resources on high-impact programmes in the geographical areas and among the populations in greatest need. It also means addressing laws and policies specific to the localities and populations most affected, such as municipal laws and policies in the large cities where key populations are concentrated. The work in Asia and the Pacific has demonstrated that national and sub-national reviews can provide the necessary specificity in terms of identifying barriers and avenues for addressing these issues at the local level. It can also provide opportunities for stakeholders to consider and be guided by global-level recommendations such as those from the Global Commission on HIV and the Law and the policies of UN agencies. Review of country progress in addressing legal and policy barriers to universal access to HIV services in Asia and the Pacific 40 \ufffd Integration of legal and human rights issues into planning, budgeting, programming, monitoring and evaluation To ensure momentum is not lost, legal and human rights responses to HIV can be integrated into national HIV strategy planning cycles, Global Fund proposals and SDG planning and reporting. Countries should ensure HIV budgets include an allocation to enabling environment programmes, adopt human rights and gender-sensitive design processes for HIV prevention, testing and treatment programmes, and use national monitoring and evaluation systems to track progress towards an enabling legal environment. As clearly demonstrated by the recommendations from the reviews and consultations, addressing legal and policy barriers is an area for programming \u2013 not only programmes directly aimed at achieving law and policy reform, but also programmes for improving law enforcement practices and access to justice, which can make a significant difference on the ground even if discriminatory laws and policies remain on the books. National investment cases and sustainability plans also need to take account of legal and policy barriers and factor in the broad development benefits of creating enabling legal environments. Middle-income countries will increasingly need to mobilize resources from domestic budgets to address legal and human rights priorities as international donors reduce financial support to HIV, health and justice programmes. Most of the targeted programmes for key populations are currently funded by external sources and must be protected during this funding transition. Such national efforts can be further supported by continued attention to legal reviews and consultations under the Regional Framework for Action on HIV and AIDS and by countries developing regional targets for zero discrimination in the context of HIV responses, including targets for zero discriminatory laws and agreed indicators and data collection methods to track progress towards such targets.

The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) contribute to tiger range countries\u2019 efforts toward implementing the GTRP through a series of projects, recognizing the recovery of healthy tiger populations and their habitats as an important part of maintaining globally significant biodiversity and the essential ecosystem services upon which all life on Earth depends.

This publication highlights the unique contribution of ten GEF financed, UNDP supported projects in six tiger range countries (Bhutan, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar and Thailand), demonstrating how conservation activities in tiger habitat can accomplish more than the preservation of one iconic wildlife species. The comprehensive approach our projects employ, based on clear identification of threats and barriers, can catalyze significant improvement in human well-being and support countries\u2019 efforts towards achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Our strategy comprises maintenance of vital ecosystem services, improved livelihoods and realization of rights and enhanced security through comprehensive policy and functioning systems of natural resource governance. Weaving through this narrative, traditional knowledge, religious beliefs, folklore and artwork illustrate the role tigers have played in shaping cultural identity and history throughout Asia, further illuminating the imperative for conserving Panthera tigris.

Each of these habitat types provides a home for hundreds of different plant and animal species, many of which can live nowhere else.

Whether providing food and raw materials (provisioning), controlling floods and purifying water (regulating), or forming rich topsoil in which to grow crops (supporting), human welfare depends on functioning ecosystems. Beyond our physical needs, healthy ecosystems also provide for our emotional well-being though cultural services, including opportunities for recreation, education and spiritual fulfillment. Providing the right conditions for tigers to survive and thrive provides life-giving benefits to humans as well, not only on a local or regional scale, but for the whole planet. Ecosystem Services?

PHOTOS BY KONMESA 11 Tigers and their habitat face many complex and overlapping/interlinked threats, driven in part by an expanding human population and increased exploitation of natural resources particularly over the last century. Loss or fragmentation of healthy ecosystems leads to a decline in food and reproductive opportunities for tigers, as well as increased conflict with humans. This has resulted in the decimation of tiger numbers \u2014 down from an estimated 100,000 in 1900 to approximately 3,200-3,800 wild individuals remaining today. During that same time-frame three, possibly four, sub-species have already been driven to extinction. ISSUE 1 HABITAT LOSS AND FRAGMENTATION Degraded habitat supports fewer plant and animal species, both in number and variety, undercutting the foundation of the food web and resulting in loss of tiger prey. Fewer prey species and restricted territory in which to hunt results in reduced tiger populations and limited reproduction and genetic exchange. Intensive land use practices by humans have resulted in isolated pockets of natural habitat interrupted by land cleared for agriculture or urbanization.

Weak institutions and policies in tiger range countries further contribute to these threats as a cross-cutting issue. Communities without legal rights to use and benefit from their local natural resources have no incentive for their equitable and sustainable management. Regional and national governments that do not effectively conduct land use planning coordinated across all sectors cannot ensure the functionality of landscapes that support biodiversity and provide ecosystem services. Furthermore, corruption at all levels can lead to habitat and wildlife destruction, whether by illegally granting permits for destructive resource extraction or accepting bribes to overlook poaching operations. Weak institutions result in poor enforcement of Protected Area (PA) regulations and park boundaries. Weak policies provide insufficient regulation of illegal wildlife trade and trafficking, as well as low conviction rates and weak penalties for the few low-level criminals who can be caught. In the same way that tiger conservation strengthens the wellbeing of many other species, tiger poaching threatens any other species inhabiting the same environment that has commercial value, e.g. bears, rhinos, or \u2018exotic\u2019 birds and timber. These threats leading to the decline of tiger populations and decreased human well-being serve as part of a feedback loop, each reinforcing the other as both cause and effect. Attempting to solve one threat without addressing the others cannot ultimately achieve success. Instead, the problem requires a holistic response with multiple interventions aimed at tackling each threat simultaneously. The GEF financed, UNDP managed projects described in the following pages have been implemented with just such a holistic approach in mind. These projects have been designed to address the underlying conditions that allow for the decline of ecosystem health which decimates tiger populations, contributes to increased poverty for people in tiger range countries, and undermines the sustainable development path which the countries have committed to follow. 13 The interventions described in the following pages directly correspond to the aforementioned major issues facing tigers and which also compromise human well-being in tiger range countries. For each threat, GEF financed, UNDP supported projects employ a suite of interventions that work in combination to address the issues of habitat loss, poverty, gender inequality and illegal wildlife trade. While only a small portion of each project has been highlighted below, each project involves a holistic set of interventions that work in tandem to address the threats and achieve a comprehensive resolution that benefits both tigers and people. Additional information about each project may be found on pages 4\u20137 of this booklet. 15 INTEGRATED LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT It is not enough just to protect isolated pockets of prime habitat. Areas outside PA boundaries support a large percentage of important wildlife populations, including tigers, and play a significant role in the overall health of people and ecosystem functions. It is imperative for governments to take a landscape-scale view when making decisions about zoning and infrastructure projects, as well as policies that encourage environmentally- responsible behavior from its citizens.

The primary strategy there is a Landscape Level Land Use Plan to serve as a framework providing an overall vision and land use prescription within which biodiversity-friendly Sector Plans may then be developed. Through a process of engaging stakeholders from multiple government, non-government and private sector agencies, these plans seek to balance the objectives of biodiversity conservation, livelihoods and economic production with the ultimate objective of determining how current land uses by different sectors can be made more compatible with the landscape\u2019s conservation needs. Developing these plans is an opportunity for stakeholders to set common goals, engage in dialogues and manage trade-offs for resource use that will yield the best overall long-term benefit for all parties. EFFECTIVE PROTECTED AREA MANAGEMENT It is not enough to have habitat areas protected on paper. Protected Areas (PAs) must be managed effectively on the ground to adequately protect intact wildlife habitat and preserve ecosystem functions. While enforcement of park boundaries and restrictions on harmful activities are important, the capacity of PA staff is the first step to effective protection. However, investing in capacity building for individual Protected Area sites will only result in long-term benefits if there is a comprehensive policy and financial framework at the national level to provide ongoing support for local efforts. Thus, our projects place heavy emphasis on a system-level approach to improving the management effectiveness of Protected Areas in perpetuity.

Securing this support requires a fresh approach to governance. Traditionally, PAs have been established by governing authorities despite, not with, the people; a problem that is particularly acute in Asia where PAs often encompass, or lie adjacent to, settlements that rely heavily on the park\u2019s natural resources for their daily needs. In many cases, these communities have sustainably used these resources for generations. Our projects system of PAs with consistent policies, appropriate financing mechanisms, standard operating procedures and satisfactory technical standards. At the national level, this project begins by creating national criteria for the establishment of Protected Areas and the management standards to which different categories of PAs will be held. A framework for financial support of the national system of Protected Areas is also being established, using economic valuation of PA resources and services. Capacity building activities will strengthen sub-national institutions in the areas of governance, design and implementation of projects, effective planning and financial management, as well as community support and outreach.

Institutionalizing these committees creates a platform from which local and indigenous community members have a say in the management decisions of the land, improving commitment to conservation objectives within the park and benefiting the community as a whole. EXPAND PROTECTED AREAS Expanding PAs where possible is an effective approach to preventing further loss or fragmentation of tiger habitat. To make the best use of limited resources, projects seeking to create new PAs must determine the most effective areas in which to invest resources. Determining areas that are critical for tiger survival is thus paramount. This can include prime habitat with plenty of prey species, sufficient area to support the territorial needs of multiple tigers, and buffer zones between tiger habitat and human populations. Especially crucial to preserve and expand PAs in this respect are areas currently occupied by breeding populations of tigers, as these areas serve as strongholds from which tiger recovery may spread out naturally without human intervention. PROJECTS The 12-million hectare Kayah Karen Tenasserim Ecoregion which spans the border of Thailand and southern Myanmar harbours a critical wild tiger population (approximately 50 individuals).

The Tiger is traditionally thought to govern the pleasure area of your house and to a lesser degree the western part of each room in microcosm, and is also considered a source of potential surprises, both good and bad. For this reason it is recommended to avoid placing dense shrubberies close to the western side of your house as that might invite ambush, as surprise itself is not considered ideal. It is thought best to place images of the tiger in an open space at head height to thoroughly activate the Chi in that area that you wish to stimulate.

RIDING TIGERS Traveling by tiger is a well-established mode of divine transport in many religious traditions. In the case of the Hindu deity Ayyappa, he established his God-head not by slaying the demon Mahishi but by emerging victorious from the haunted forest of battle mounted on a tigress, followed by her cubs and holding a goblet of her milk. Ten-armed Hindu goddess, Durga uses her tiger, Damon, less peacefully, as a battle steed. Dragon Tiger Mountain temple in China\u2019s Jiangxi province is the hereditary seat of the Daoist Wise.

Chao Kunming, the Chinese God of Wealth, carries an ingot of silver. Unusually his tiger is black. One of the most dramatic tiger tales comes from the remote Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan where Guru Rinpoche arrived 3,000 feet above the Paro valley mounted on a flying tigress bearing Buddhist texts. After three years meditating in a series of caves he introduced Buddhism to Bhutan and nine centuries later in the 1600s the precipitous cliff-face Takstang \u201cTiger\u2019s Nest\u201d monastery was built to commemorate this momentous cultural and spiritual revolution.

In an inclusive, stakeholder-led process, participants will lay out the governance structure, land use specifications, biodiversity management and monitoring protocols, regulations, enforcement, budgetary needs and financing mechanisms. Designed with a view toward community development and livelihood enhancement for residents in and around these biological corridors, these projects will promote management plans that optimize land use for both ecological conservation and economic benefits for local residents. Maximizing the benefits of these newly operational corridors for local residents not only increases the likelihood of compliance with regulations but fills multiple government goals at once, making cost effective use of limited funds by linking conservation with increased health and well-being, sustainable rural development and contributing to the national economy. Furthermore, corridors through significantly degraded landscapes require major interventions, such as construction of wildlife crossing overpasses or viaducts in critical corridor areas where highways or other infrastructural barriers exist. Our projects are supporting these governments to turn the theoretical corridors into reality.

STRATEGY 2: REDUCING POVERTY AND SUPPORTING RURAL DEVELOPMENT Poverty drives people to use the resources available at hand to survive. Households in rural or remote areas of tiger range countries may be forced to degrade the natural landscape in order to scrape a living for the day, trapping them in a cycle that leaves them further impoverished as ecosystem services decline and provide less for each tomorrow. Conservation regulations may be interpreted by residents as restricting their access to their only means of survival. By introducing sustainable options that result in greater benefits for all community members, both women and men, our projects help curb habitat degradation and poaching, as well as decreasing human-wildlife conflict. TIGERS AND CHILDREN Tigers in folklore, myth, literature and children\u2019s stories are usually the bad guys. Rudyard Kipling\u2019s Shere Khan, for example, has no redeeming features! He\u2019s everything bad \u2014 boastful, violent, cowardly, and in the end, he gets skinned. Tigers stalk the pages of fiction.

A Conservation Agreement is then drawn up, defining the agreed responsibilities of both parties: the community with respect to conservation goals (such as limiting poaching or clear-cutting for agriculture) and the project with respect to livelihood assistance in the form of trainings, equipment and networking facilitation with local institutions. These agreements formalize the community\u2019s right to use and benefit from the land in biodiversity-friendly ways, as well as lay out a framework by which the whole community may benefit more from jointly practicing conservation than by exploiting resources for individual gain. Indigenous Karen villages located within the wildlife sanctuaries participate in the project, as well as villages in the buffer zone surrounding the parks. Where livestock grazing and tourism are not permitted within park boundaries, the project supports the development of sustainable livelihoods such as planting, processing and marketing indigenous varieties of upland rice, chili, betel nut and medicinal herbs, or improving business opportunities for traditional weavers with active involvement and empowerment of women in the communities. The emphasis on traditional knowledge adds value to these products for the outside consumer, as does the fact that families produce these goods according to biodiversity-friendly practices, allowing them to draw premium prices in the marketplace and significantly supplement household income. For villages outside of park boundaries, the project focuses on community forestry activities such as agroforestry and forest gardens, tree farms of economically valuable indigenous hardwoods and fruit trees, and reforestation projects that result in community owned forests on previously degraded land. Additional project activities work with the most vulnerable households to identify sustainable harvesting India, home to 70% of the world\u2019s wild tigers, published a report in 2015 calculating the total value to India\u2019s economy of six tiger reserves at US$24 BILLION!

In addition, the services that ecosystems provide enable people from entire regions and even around the globe to benefit from clean water and air, energy, extreme weather protection and more. Through traditional stewardship of the land and formal protection, rural residents and conservation agencies safeguard these services for municipalities, urban citizens and business owners. Our projects support innovative biodiversity financing mechanisms to fund these conservation efforts by initiating Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) programmes, which encourage cities and corporations to recognize the value of these services and to contribute financially for their continued upkeep. These funds contribute to rural poverty alleviation through job creation and by promoting healthy ecosystems which support livelihoods for forest-dependent communities.

With support of four civil society organizations, namely Fauna and Flora International, Wildlife Conservation Society, Zoological Society of London and the Sumatra Tiger Forum, the project facilitates an increase in forest rangers and patrol units trained in SMART-based patrolling methods. SMART patrolling is designed to detect and mitigate threats to PAs and the biodiversity within, such as illegal logging and poaching activity. Trained rangers input field data into spatial mapping software that will calculate trends and levels of threats, performance of patrol teams and gaps in coverage. These outputs will help park managers monitor trends in threats to forests and wildlife, plan enforcement operations and monitor patrol effectiveness.

TIGER GUARDIANS Little Fang Lin is three years old. Although he is unlikely ever to see a wild tiger in China, tigers will surround him for the rest of his life. On his feet he wears red slippers decorated with tigers. When it is cold or on special occasions he shrugs on a jacket. Again a tiger prowls in design. When Fang Lin has a cold his grandmother rubs tiger balm under his nose. There are tigers on his favourite chopsticks and on the soy sauce bottle and his noodle pack. The nearest temple has tiger wall sculptures. A white tiger will guard him after death if his family follow the geomantic (Feng Shui) practice of raising his tomb slightly higher on the right side (the right side is considered stronger) to attract the tiger. The tiger is a symbol of strength and health, widely used to brand products, but it is also the ultimate spiritual watchdog against evil forces. Throughout Asian myth and religion the tiger, along with the dragon, have been fending off demons for millennia. In Indonesia were-tigers guard fields against thieves. In China they dismay \u201cThe Three Evils\u201d: fire, thieves and ghosts. Protective tiger amulets, as well as fragments of tiger skin and bone, frequently fraudulent, are sold at religious sites in all tiger range states. Fang Lin and his family believe the tiger protects them. Convincing them they can protect the tiger in return is the conservation challenge. Our projects engage with religious, corporate and community bodies to help everybody make that reciprocal link.

PROJECTS Thailand serves as a transportation hub for Southeast Asia, with an important international airport and thriving sea trade. Along with strengthening capacity of law enforcement to detect illegal wildlife cargo and closing loopholes that facilitate corruption, the \u201cCombatting Illegal Wildlife Trade\u201d project led by the Department of National Parks is working to dismantle the networks that facilitate the exchange of illegal wildlife and wildlife products across international borders. A key feature of this endeavor is to improve cooperation, coordination and information exchange among government, non-government and private sector organizations, both inside Thailand and internationally. The project will establish a central 1 2 PHOTO CREDITS: 1) Photo by Royal Thai Customs. 2) Photo by Dominic Sansoni/World Bank. 28 PROJECTS The \u201cCombatting illegal and unsustainable trade in endangered species in Indonesia\u201d project led by Indonesia\u2019s Ministry of Environment and Forestry aims to tighten regulatory structures and improve oversight of enforcement responses. The project will support the revision of existing conservation laws to remove loopholes and inconsistencies, as well as to enhance minimum penalties as a deterrent to wildlife crimes. Introducing anti-money-laundering legislation will further hinder access to financial resources that fund wildlife crime and related corruption. Finally, additional mechanisms for enhanced oversight of enforcement agencies and stricter monitoring of permitting and concessions ensures appropriate actions are taken in response to regulatory infractions, and further limits the opportunities for corruption and malpractice. DEMAND REDUCTION As long as demand for wildlife products persists, illegal traders will not stop exploiting desirable species for personal profit. Our projects aim to reduce demand by educating consumers about the true cost of wildlife crime to biodiversity, national economies, political and social stability and human livelihoods, as well as the legal consequences for purchasing protected wildlife or prohibited wildlife products. PROJECTS For example, Thailand\u2019s \u201cCombatting Illegal Wildlife Trade\u201d project will conduct a campaign to raise awareness about how the complex legal and illegal ivory trade in Thailand contributes to the plight of elephants in Africa. This campaign will also serve as a springboard to raise broader issues of the trade in prohibited wildlife and wildlife parts, including Thailand\u2019s own tigers, and the greater benefit that will be gained by protecting rather than exploiting these creatures.

In Bhutan, under GEF financed UNDP supported project \u201cLinking the Enhancing Protected Areas in the Temperate Broadleaf Forest Ecoregion of Bhutan (LINKPA),\u201d the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Bhutan, laid the foundation for the current biological corridor strengthening project (see page 20). The project identified suitable corridors for tiger and other wildlife, developed a management plan, and piloted management approaches with local authorities and communities in the corridor, linking Thrumshingla National Park with two other protected areas. In Nepal, the GEF financed UNDP supported Western Terai Landscape Project worked collaboratively with local people to manage human wildlife conflict and improve livelihoods around the Bardia National Park and Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve. Before the Tiger Summit, between 1991 and 2010, the GEF has supported 19 projects that are related to tiger conservation, with a total GEF grant of about $100 million in the range countries. 29 human-wildlife conflict and prevents the sustainable use of natural resources. Furthermore, it results in a lack of collective will to influence policymakers and markets to support biodiversity and resource conservation.

The earliest depictions of the 12 zodiac animals were discovered on Chinese tomb ceilings dating back to 533 BC and to this day, these creatures can be found throughout Asia, in effigy, in amulets sold in temples, in fortune tellers\u2019 booths, and in daily newspapers! Only three range nations include the tiger \u2014 Hindu-influenced zodiacs replace it with a lion \u2014 but in China, Korea and Japan the tiger remains among the most auspicious of what the Koreans call sibi jisin lit: Gods of the Earth. All symbolic zodiac animals are credited with influencing both human character and destiny and in China demographics clearly show that in some cases decisions to have children are made based on the most auspicious zodiac dates. The Tiger is a powerfully energetic and auspicious sign. Traditionally Tiger people are second only to Dragons in terms of luck and power. They can make great leaders as they are considered dominant, courageous, spirited, charismatic, energetic, patriotic, generous, honest, competitive, determined and self-actuated. They love glory and make good self-publicists. On the downside, their spirit can be selfish, possessive, fierce, inflexible, wasteful and challenging. To succeed they need to be diligent and try to keep calm. Some suggested career paths to suit a tiger include advertising executive, actor, writer, musician and military general. Proof of this latter is convincingly supplied by Minamoto no Yoshitsune, one of Japan\u2019s greatest heroes, who was born in the hour of the tiger, in the month of the tiger\u2026 and the year of the tiger! \"Hachimantaro Minamoto no Yoshiie: Selection of Six Men of Wisdom and Courage\".

In 2015 we saw India\u2019s tiger population increase by 30% from 2010 figures. Bhutan, Nepal, Russia and Bangladesh have carried out systematic national tiger surveys. Scientists have observed the first evidence of Amur tigers breeding in China in 10 years and more evidence of tiger breeding in the Thailand and Myanmar border areas. However, poaching continues and demand for tiger parts has not diminished. News comes in\u2026 both good and bad. Tigers face a serious challenge. More than 50% of the world\u2019s human population lives in the historical tiger range countries. The future of the tiger is in co-existence \u2014 wildlife and humans. UNDP and GEF will continue to support the range countries\u2019 collective efforts to save the striped giant of Asia. This publication we hope will have explained some of our strategies. For UNDP and GEF, the fight to save tigers and the fight to improve the well-being of people are one and the same.

UNDP Maldives 10 U N D P M A L D I V E S With recurrent floods contaminating groundwater, and long dry spells creating drinking water shortages, the plight of these island communities could not be starker. The slightest fluctuation in ocean currents or an under-ocean earthquake thousands of kilometers away can cause tremendous damage in a matter of hours. The science behind climate change is certainly complex, but the impact it has on lives and livelihoods is straightforward. Simply put, besides changing the way people act and think about the environment, the most pressing need for communities at risk is funding. Money that will help them adapt to climate change and protect their homes, jobs and lives. In the Maldives, rising sea levels and storm surges have salinated freshwater tables on several islands. But now, adaptation projects across these islands are helping communities harvest rainwater to make up for the loss of those freshwater tables. According to a United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Adaptation Gap Report, developing countries, particularly those categorized as small island developing states, like the Maldives and various landlocked and mountainous nations, face serious challenges in terms of mobilizing resources for adapting to climate change. The Small Island Developing States (SIDs), for instance, have relatively small settlements, where -- given concerns over economies of scale -- private for-profit investments can be difficult UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative Shoko Noda Interacting with Community members UNDP Maldives 11 ISLAND LIFE to attract. These countries can spare very little of their own public resources to cater to the adaptation needs of communities spread across far-flung islands. But financing for adaptation while seemingly simple, is an issue of contention in the global climate-change talks now taking place in Paris. Despite international pledges made during previous conferences to raise over $100 billion annually for such efforts by 2020, the funding provided for adaptation initiatives in local communities in 2012-13 was only about $25 billion, 88% of which was spent outside the developed world. UNEP\u2019s Adaptation Gap Report estimates that by 2050, the annual cost of adaptation for developing countries will have risen to between $250 billion and $500 billion, even with the necessary cuts to greenhouse gas emissions. If the world is to help countries such as SIDs combat climate change, we need a more multi-dimensional approach to financing adaptation. This includes the ability of a country to mobilize domestic resources and leverage affordable private finance, to deal with its debt levels, its vulnerability to economic shocks, as well as natural disasters. This is where the private sector, philanthropists and individuals could play a vital role. Last year, US citizens donated up to $258 billion, according to Giving USA, a philanthropic annual report that monitors charitable donations. This is more than double what adaptation currently costs -- based on current projections of $100 billion annually. While it is true that needs are ever on the rise, fortunately, so too are contributions from individuals. Indeed, the potential of crowd-funding platforms to finance adaptation projects that help communities build resilience to cope with climate change is immense. In 2014, over $16 billion was raised through such platforms and that amount is likely to double this year, says Massolution, an online platform that tracks crowd-funding contributions annually. Crowd-funding is particularly viable in the context of SIDs, where comparatively small investments -- say, of around $50,000 or so -- could help extend the reach of adaptation measures over entire communities and deliver big results. In the case of the Maldives, any platform would have to be linked to the tourism industry, given that the country receives over a million visitors every year. Tourism accounts for nearly 30% of gross domestic product and over 60% of foreign exchange earnings for the Maldives. The islands attract high-spending tourists. Hypothetically, if each tourist were to voluntarily contribute $20 that could add up to an annual collection of $20 million. Working with the government, the UN is already piloting an innovative approach in the Maldives that seeks to make awareness and sensitivity about climate-change issues an integral part of development and planning at the local level, thus bringing about a change in the way communities think and act on climate change. The goal is to integrate climate change and adaptation into government development plans and programs, at all levels including at the grassroots. The first step under this program -- the Low Emission Climate Resilient Development (LECReD) Programme -- involves promoting a low carbon lifestyle while building communities that are resilient to the impact of climate change.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f3cc3d08-121c-4a21-a495-409f70f67d29": {"__data__": {"id_": "f3cc3d08-121c-4a21-a495-409f70f67d29", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-maldives-2016-island-life-magazine", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Maldives 2016 Island Life Magazine", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-maldives-2016-island-life-magazine", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6a5fb9b7c9e488b3eea53452066b0f246f97fce59ffb5e86c11492b8032b580c"}, "3": {"node_id": "6af775b4-85c7-4556-b614-203de49be98c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-maldives-2016-island-life-magazine", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2d05e5462aa0bd299de714f7cda683452885291ae783c81230dc9a4e7648e033"}}, "hash": "9fa05097cbc470e990343a870cbc1be928c1c4d12229c27cede345eaa7ba239c", "text": "The objective is that this will lead to short-term, medium-term and long-term development planning for the islands and atolls based on the evidence from the project underway at the Laamu Atoll.

In addition, under this program, the UN will provide up to $50,000 to local councils, community-based organizations, and women\u2019s development committees. But clearly, that is not enough money to sustain projects on waste and water management, energy, floods, soil erosion and conservation for communities, for the long term. The LECReD program will help communities develop their own climate- sensitive plans for development, and explore the public and private finance options. While our efforts to build partnerships with the private sector and individuals are still in progress,, it is evident that the private sector, philanthropists, as well as individuals are vital to funding, and can help communities adapt to risks from climate change.

MOHAMED INAZ FORMER ASSISTANT RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE (ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY), UNDP MALDIVES. HE HAS FORMERLY WORK WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF MALDIVES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL PLANNING AND MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY 16 U N D P M A L D I V E S In the Maldives, a paradigm shift has been taking place lately in the approach. to environmental conservation. In the past, conservation in the country\u2014as well as in the international arena\u2014was largely concerned with the protection of a region and its flora and fauna for future generations. The approach now is \u201cslightly different, in that conservation efforts actively seek to find an ecological balance, where the natural resources of a region can be used sustainably by the current generation while also preserving them for the future. GOING LOCAL This approach was exemplified in the transformation of the Baa Atoll in the Maldives to a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, completed in the year 2011 with the help of the UNDP. Identification of key zones in the atoll and management plans for these were put in place with the active participation of the community, as it was apparent that communities wouldn\u2019t readily see the benefit in conservation for the future if they themselves were unable to use the resources available for their present- day livelihoods. This doesn\u2019t imply that people are simply looking for immediate monetary benefits, but that they are also looking for value for their community in the long run. Another example of this collaborative approach would be our work with fishermen and the tourism sector in the Baa Atoll, as part of support through the same intervention.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6af775b4-85c7-4556-b614-203de49be98c": {"__data__": {"id_": "6af775b4-85c7-4556-b614-203de49be98c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-maldives-2016-island-life-magazine", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Maldives 2016 Island Life Magazine", "node
