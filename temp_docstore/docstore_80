This text should provide enough information for the KBA NCG and KBA RFP to understand and assess what was done. 8.4 Beyond KBA identification and delineation Guidance on stakeholder consultation and involvement relating to active management falls beyond the remit of the KBA Guidelines. Here, we note that the IUCN Policy on Conservation and Human Rights for Sustainable Development includes the guiding principle that FPIC is required when IUCN projects, activities, and/or initiatives take place on Indigenous peoples\u2019 lands and territories and/or impact natural and cultural resources, sites, assets, etc. More specifically, the IUCN Standard on Indigenous Peoples includes the following principle: \u201cIndigenous peoples are consulted and are active and effective participants in decision-making processes relevant to them and related to conservation activities supported by IUCN. Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) is obtained for any intervention affecting their rights and access to their lands, territories, waters and resources.\u201d More generally, there is a responsibility to involve any natural resource-dependent communities, including forest-dependent peoples, farmers, pastoralists and fishers, when considering conservation or management actions that might affect their rights. The Guidelines on Business and KBAs include the following recommendation: \u201cThe establishment of an inclusive and transparent stakeholder and right-holder engagement process (including, for example, representatives of national, regional, and Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 154 local government; indigenous peoples; local communities; and other elements of civil society) in planning and decision making is recommended. International best practices for stakeholder and right-holder engagement, including a rights-based approach and Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) for engaging with indigenous and traditional peoples and local communities, are implemented as early as possible in the project cycle and follow recognised best practices.\u201d Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 155 9. Data availability, quality and uncertainty The KBA Standard (IUCN, 2016, p. 5) states: \u201cThe KBA criteria have quantitative thresholds to ensure that site identification is transparent, objective and repeatable. It is important to compile the best available data for KBA identification, but the availability of high quality data differs significantly between different taxonomic groups\u2026\u201d The KBA Standard (IUCN, 2016, p. 7) states that: the data used to support KBA identification and delineation \u201c\u2026must be traceable to a reliable source and be recent enough to give confidence that the biodiversity elements are still present given the history of land use [and other types of] change in an area.\u201d 9.1 Data availability Global estimates of the number of mature individuals, range, ESH, and AOO, if available, will be pre-filled in the WDKBA when it is fully functional. Do data used in KBA identification and delineation need to be published? In the case of global estimates of assessment parameters that are not derived from IUCN Red List or Red List of Ecosystems assessments and have not been published previously, KBA Proposers should document how these parameters were estimated so that the method can be reviewed and updated in the future. KBA Proposers are responsible for ensuring that data used to estimate site-level values of assessment parameters, or to observe or infer the ecological integrity of a site, are referenced to a publication, are publicly available (e.g., through a free data-archiving service such as the Dryad Digital Repository), or are made available on request. In the latter case, a brief description of the data and data source and contact details for the data-holder should be included in the KBA proposal; this information can then be cited as in litt. (See the KBA Proposal Process guidance for more detailed guidance on required and recommendation documentation to support KBA identification and delineation.) 9.1.1 Sensitive data How are sensitive data treated?

KBA Proposers should also follow these principles adapted from the Sensitive Data Access Restrictions Policy for the IUCN Red List. A sensitive data flag should be applied to species that: (a) are listed as CR or EN on the IUCN Red List under Criteria C and D, or have not been assessed for the IUCN Red List but would likely qualify as CR or EN under Criteria C and D; (b) have high economic value; (c) are listed or would likely be listed as threatened by trade; and (d) have important sites that are not generally known (e.g., an internet search engine such as Google cannot find these sites). Given that the KBA website provides more detailed information on the distribution of many species than the IUCN Red List, a more precautionary approach is appropriate for KBAs. Therefore, trigger species may also be flagged as sensitive if: \u25cf the species has a small global population size in the wild and is known to be exploited, collected, traded or utilised, resulting in the death or permanent removal of individuals from the wild (or belongs to a group of species that is exploited in this way); or \u25cf the species is threatened by widespread, unregulated exploitation of wild populations, resulting in the death or permanent removal of individuals from the wild; and: \u25cf the species has a life history that cannot sustain or recover easily from over- exploitation; and: \u25cf the proposed site is not generally known to hold a significant population of the species. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 157 It is recommended that KBA Proposers include information about sensitive trigger species in KBA proposals, but flag any species as sensitive if it meets the criteria set out above and there are concerns about publishing the information provided. Information included in KBA proposals on sensitive trigger species will be made available to the KBA Secretariat (including KBA RFPs) and possibly to IBAT subscribers, but will not be published on the KBA website. If KBA Proposers have any concerns about sharing sensitive data, they are asked to discuss these with their RFP. 9.2 Data quality 9.2.1 Observing and inferring the proportion of the global population size at a site For some of the species-based criteria (i.e. A1, B1-3), the proportion of the global population size at a site may be observed or inferred based on one or more assessment parameters. For D1-3, the proportion of the global population size at a site may be observed based on the number of mature individuals. How can the proportion of the global population size at the site be \u201cobserved\u201d? The population size at a site may be observed17 from well documented recent direct observations of mature individuals (e.g., the number of sea lion females observed nursing sea lion pups at a site). Animal tracking data collected using devices with high location accuracy (e.g., global positioning system, GPS) and camera traps are considered equivalent to direct observations. Population size may be based on counts of all mature individuals at a site or on counts of mature individuals in representative sampling areas (e.g., points, transects, quadrats) together with statistical assumptions about sampling (e.g., point sampling, distance sampling). Any statistical assumptions regarding the representativeness of sampling or detectability should be justified in the documentation. Statistical habitat models may be needed if densities within the site vary as a function of topographical or environmental covariates (see Appendix III.2). Site population size estimates based on sampling may be subject to expert review. How can the proportion of the global population size at the site be \u201cinferred\u201d? The proportion of the global population size at a site may be inferred based on indirect evidence, such as indices of the relative abundance of mature individuals (e.g., the 17 Note that the definition of \u201cobserved\u201d here includes the definition of \u201cestimated\u201d in the IUCN Red List Guidelines (IUCN SPC 2022, Section 3.1).

How recent do data need to be when used to observe or infer the proportion of the global population size or global extent of an ecosystem type at a site, or ecological integrity? Estimates of abundance and distribution are likely to become less accurate over time. Data that were collected more than 8-12 years before the assessment should be used cautiously and only if there is no information suggesting that there has been significant relevant change in global or site-level population size or distribution patterns (i.e. a change likely to affect KBA qualification or delineation). Thus, for example, older data may be acceptable in a remote wilderness area that has seen little change in the last 50 years, but not in one that has seen recent extensive habitat transformation, or where trigger species may have suffered significant decline due to factors such as disease, invasive species, or over-exploitation. See Section 9.2.3 below for confirmation of presence. 9.2.2 Known, inferred and projected occurrences Range is defined as the current known limits of distribution of a species, accounting for all known, inferred or projected sites of occurrence (IUCN, 2012a). What are \u201cknown sites of occurrence\u201d? \u201cKnown\u201d sites of occurrences are known localities based on well documented recent direct observations (i.e. recent enough to give confidence that the biodiversity elements are still present, given the history of land-use change in an area, see IUCN, 2016, p. 7), excluding vagrancies. Note that the confirmed presence of proposed trigger species is required for all sites identified as KBAs under species-based criteria, except for species listed as CR (PE) or CR( PEW) at sites where they trigger KBA Criterion A1e (see Section 2.4.5). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 159 What are \u201cinferred sites of occurrence\u201d? \u201cInferred\u201d refers to the use of information about habitat characteristics, dispersal capability, rates and effects of habitat destruction and other relevant factors (such as exploitation), based on known localities, to deduce a very high likelihood of presence (IUCN SPC, 2022, Section 4.10.7). Note that inferred occurrences may be used to estimate the proportion of the global population size found at a site, but a KBA must include at least one known locality (i.e. confirmed presence, see Section 9.2.3). What are \u201cprojected sites of occurrence\u201d? \u201cProjected\u201d refers to spatially predicted occurrences based on habitat maps or models (IUCN SPC, 2022, Section 4.10.7). Any projected occurrences beyond the spatial extent of known localities (as defined by a minimum convex polygon based on known localities) should have a very high likelihood of presence, based on known localities and the species\u2019 dispersal capability. When used to estimate AOO, projected occurrences are subject to the three conditions outlined in Appendix III. Note that projected occurrences may be used to estimate the proportion of the global population size found at a site, but a KBA must include at least one known locality (i.e. confirmed presence, see Section 9.2.3). 9.2.3 Confirmation of presence and reproductive units For all sites proposed as KBAs, with the exception of sites identified under subcriterion A1e for species listed as CR (PE) or CR (PEW), the presence of the KBA trigger biodiversity elements at the site must be confirmed and documented (see the KBA Proposal Process guidance). This is especially important where KBA identification relies on area-based parameters (i.e. AOO, ESH, or range). How can presence be confirmed for species that are listed as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) or Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct in the Wild)? In the case of CR (PE) or CR (PEW) species, the proposed KBA should be the site where the species is most likely to occur, if it still exists.

Where this is not possible, some forms of inference may be used as described below: (i) Direct observations: Animal tracking data collected using devices with high location accuracy (e.g., GPS) and photographic data (collected in-person, by drone or camera trap) are considered equivalent to direct observations. (ii) Indirect observations: Indirect evidence of the minimum number of reproductive units or mature individuals may be used for cryptic species (e.g., active burrows indicating the threshold number of breeding pairs). Presence of immature individuals may be used if parental care is required (e.g., presence of pups for seals) or if both mature and immature individuals are sedentary (e.g., presence of tadpoles for frogs or toads). (iii) Information in the IUCN Red List account indicating that the species likely occurs in numbers that exceed the reproductive-units threshold at the site: For example, the species is described as \u201dabundant\u201d, \u201ccommon\u201d or \u201cfrequent\u201d at the site. (Note that relevant information may be found in sections on Geographic Range, Population, Habitat and Ecology, or Conservation Actions.) Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 161 (iv) Inference based on continuous presence: The species has been present at the site for multiple generations and the site population size is not declining, indicating ongoing successful reproduction. (v) Inference based on the number of mature individuals at the site: A reproductive unit is defined as 1 or 2 mature individuals and the minimum population size regularly held at the site is estimated at \u2265100 mature individuals (or \u226550 mature individuals for 5 reproductive units); (vi) Inference based on the proportion of the global population size held at the site together with the species\u2019 IUCN Red List category and criteria: In some cases, the proportion of the population size estimated to occur at the site, together with the species\u2019 IUCN Red List category and criteria indicate that it is unlikely that the site holds fewer than the threshold number of reproductive units or mature individuals. It can be inferred that a site holds at least 10 reproductive units in the following circumstances: a) the site regularly holds effectively the entire global population size of a species listed as VU, Near-Threatened (NT) or Least Concern (LC); b) a reproductive unit is defined as 1 or 2 mature individuals and the species has been assessed as EN (but not under IUCN Red List Criterion D), indicating a minimum global population size of at least 250 mature individuals, and the site holds at least 40% of known localities or AOO (for 5 reproductive units); c) a reproductive unit is defined as 1 or 2 mature individuals and the species has been assessed as VU (but not under IUCN Red List Criterion D1), NT or LC, indicating a minimum population size of at least 1,000 mature individuals, and the site holds at least 20% of known localities or AOO. (vii) Inference based on geographically separate occurrences: If occurrence records represent observations of mature individuals and the species is sedentary, territorial or otherwise of limited mobility (such that it is unlikely that different occurrences represent the same individuals), then the minimum number of reproductive units at the site may be inferred from the number of known geographically separate occurrences at the site. The definition of \u201cgeographically separate\u201d will depend on the mobility of mature individuals and other relevant aspects of the behaviour, ecology and reproductive system of the species and should guide the number and spatial dispersion of known occurrences required Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 162 to infer that the reproductive-units threshold is met.

Inference should not be based on range or ESH, except for (v a), as range and ESH may be unoccupied. Any inference should include confirmation that adequate habitat exists at the site to support the species in numbers meeting or exceeding the reproductive-units threshold and that there is no reason to expect that the species does not occur at the site in such numbers (for example, as a result of pressure from hunting, fishing, invasive predators or competitors, inadequate prey, disease). How recent do data need to be when used to confirm species presence or reproductive units at a site? The data used to confirm presence and the number of reproductive units (where required) should be recent \u2013 ideally collected within the last 8-12 years before KBA identification. Older data should be used conservatively, especially for species listed as globally threatened under IUCN Red List Criterion A2, A3 or A4, for other species known to have suffered recent population declines, or if the site has suffered significant habitat loss or other types of degradation in the intervening period. Clear justification should be given in the documentation for using older data, up to a maximum of 50 years (except for CR (PE) or CR (PEW) species). Data older than 50 years may only be used to confirm the presence of species at sites where the species triggers subcriterion A1e and the species has not been assessed as CR (PE) or CR (PEW). KBA Proposers should confirm that adequate habitat persists at the site and explain why the species may have escaped detection if it still exists. The logic for allowing older data in this context is as follows: If a site is thought to hold effectively the entire global population size of a species, but the species has not been listed as CR (PE) or CR (PEW) even though it has not been observed at the site for more than 50 years, it can be inferred that the IUCN Red List assessors believe the species still occurs at the site. If older data were not allowed in this context, then it Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 163 would not be possible to confirm any site as a KBA for some CR or EN species that would otherwise trigger subcriterion A1e. This would be contrary to the intent of the KBA Standard and inconsistent with the guideline that KBAs can be identified under subcriterion A1e for species listed as CR (PE) or CR (PEW) without confirmation of presence. Surveys to confirm the presence of trigger biodiversity elements should be conducted during the 8-12 years between initial KBA confirmation and reassessment and between reassessments, so that presence can be confirmed based on recent data at the time of reassessment. Data used to confirm presence and reproductive units (where required) in KBA reassessments should not be older than 8-12 years unless the justification for older data is very strong and it is very unlikely that the species has been extirpated. How are presence and reproductive units documented? Confirmation of presence and that the number of reproductive units at a site meets the relevant threshold (where required) should, ideally, be referenced to a publication or other publicly available data source (e.g., IUCN Red List account, a peer-reviewed journal article or publicly available site monitoring report). Where this is not possible, for options (i)-(iv) above (under What types of data can be used to confirm that the reproductive-units threshold is met?), the knowledge of one or more named biodiversity knowledge-holders may be used instead. Biodiversity knowledge-holders should have sufficient expertise to provide reliable confirmation of species identification. Ideally, the biodiversity knowledge-holder(s) will have made a recent visit to the site, but expert review of data recently collected at the site may also be used. In particular, species that are challenging to identify in the field may be confirmed later through expert verification of specimens, photographs, video or other evidence collected at the site. Experts should provide a brief explanation of the data used to confirm presence and/or that the number of reproductive units meets the threshold (see examples in Appendix VIII).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "257e6b24-56bf-4870-b10a-7e3d53149758": {"__data__": {"id_": "257e6b24-56bf-4870-b10a-7e3d53149758", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/tunisie-guide-de-poche-pour-lidentification-des-principales-especes", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Tunisie - Guide de poche pour l\u2019identification des principales esp\u00e8ces vuln\u00e9rables captur\u00e9es accidentellement au cours d\u2019activit\u00e9s de p\u00eache en Tunisie", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/tunisie-guide-de-poche-pour-lidentification-des-principales-especes", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b522b7d4e77a05767fbc743a58b144aad4dfa03f16aefe4bd7f0fcba9d3f8c82"}, "2": {"node_id": "4f92a8ae-3aa9-4ce7-b9fa-f71ee871a022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/tunisie-guide-de-poche-pour-lidentification-des-principales-especes", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "617617f26f1a93bf64a0e39b8701e2a8a4cc1c3e5e4794884fd02567ba8d1283"}}, "hash": "dc875609c7753a297619eb450a30104123e9160bd05097efea8c3ec555d0b7bc", "text": "For option (v) above, it is only necessary to indicate the basis for inference (e.g., with a reference to (a), (b), (c), (d), or (e) ), as calculations can be made automatically in the WDKBA when it is fully functional.

What types of data can be used to confirm presence of an ecosystem type? See Sections 4.3.4 and 4.4.4. 9.3 Uncertainty 9.3.1 Types of uncertainty There are two main types of uncertainty that may affect KBA identification: \u25cf Measurement uncertainty, such as uncertainty about the true number of mature individuals at any point in time, can often be reduced by collecting more data (for example, by increasing the sample size or number of sampling occasions) using appropriate sampling, measurement and estimation methods. \u25cf Ecological variation (often called \u201cprocess variation\u201d), such as interannual variation in the true number of mature individuals at a site, can be a source of uncertainty as to whether a site qualifies as a KBA, even if the number of mature individuals is counted precisely each year. 9.3.2 Dealing with uncertainty In many cases, the population size at a site will be either well above or well below the threshold for qualification as a KBA. Uncertainty is only significant for KBA identification when the estimated site-level population size lies close to the relevant threshold, such that there is uncertainty about whether or not the site qualifies. For example, if the minimum site-level population-size estimate exceeds the relevant threshold based on the maximum global population-size estimate, then the site would qualify as a KBA regardless of uncertainty. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 165 In the process of identifying sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity, it is important to balance the risks of omission and commission errors, i.e. the risks of failing to identify a site that actually qualifies (omission error) and the risks of identifying a site that does not actually qualify (commission error). High rates of omission error may lead to biodiversity loss, but high rates of commission error could deflate the value of identifying KBAs and may dilute conservation resources. Note that the low thresholds for Criteria A1 and A2 relative to the other criteria provide a built-in precautionary approach to identifying sites of importance for globally threatened species and ecosystem types. How to deal with measurement uncertainty? The general principle for handling measurement uncertainty is to balance the risks of omission and commission error. In the context of measurement uncertainty, a site should be proposed if it is more likely than not that it meets the relevant threshold. For example, if the global population size is 10,000 mature individuals, and the site- level population size is most likely greater than 1,000 individuals, then the site population most likely exceeds a 10% threshold. In other words, the site would qualify if there was a greater than 50% chance that it exceeds 1,000 mature individuals. Consider the data summarised in Table 9.3.2.1 \u2014 in this case, the site would qualify because the median estimate exceeds the threshold (i.e. there is a greater than 50% chance that the site population exceeds the threshold). The determination of whether a site is more likely than not to meet the relevant threshold may be based on quantitative or qualitative analysis (e.g., a statistical analysis or an expert-based weighing of various types of evidence). Table 9.3.2.1 Example of measurement uncertainty. The true number of individuals is not observed directly; rather, the estimated number is based on counts by three observers.

How to deal with ecological variation? Ecological variation (e.g., fluctuations in a species\u2019 population size or the extent of ecosystem type attributable to random environmental variation) is distinct from long- term trend (see Section 3.1 for guidance on handling trends). It likely occurs to some extent for all species at all sites, as well as for dynamic ecosystem types (e.g., kelp forests). Ecological variation is often substantial for sites important for biological processes, such as demographic aggregations (D1), ecological refugia (D2) and recruitment sources (D3). The general principles for handling ecological variation are based on the application of Ramsar Criteria 5 and 6 (Ramsar, 2018). A site predictably holds the threshold population size if the following conditions are met: (i) Interannual variation: the number of mature individuals at the site is known to have met or exceeded the threshold population size in at least two thirds of the years for which adequate data are available for the relevant season (e.g., the breeding season in the case of a breeding aggregation); the total number of years considered should not be fewer than three; or (ii) Intra-annual variation: the mean of the maximum number of mature individuals at the site during the relevant season meets or exceeds the threshold population size; the mean should be taken over at least five years.19 For example, adult female marine turtles return to specific nesting beaches to lay their eggs, but, in most cases, individual females do not return every year, so that the 18 If necessary, the maximum likelihood, \u201cbest\u201d and median can be compared to each other. The mean should only be compared to the maximum likelihood, \u201cbest\u201d or median if measurement error is limited. The mid-point of the maximum and minimum should not be compared to the other metrics. 19 Note that the mean may be used here, instead of the median, for consistency with the Ramsar criteria. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 167 number of nesting females that use a site over a breeding season can vary substantially from one year to the next. Suppose the site threshold under Criterion D1a is 1,000 mature females. Under (i) above, the site would be considered to predictably hold 1,000 mature females during the nesting season if it holds 1,000 mature females in at least two thirds of nesting seasons. Consider the data set out in Table 9.3.2.2. The site would qualify under D1a because the site exceeds threshold numbers in two out of three years. Table 9.3.2.2 Ecological variation.

For example, during the dry season, large flocks of a particular waterfowl species move among several distinct wetlands depending on prey availability, so that the number of mature individuals counted at a particular wetland can vary substantially from one day to the next as well as interannually. (The wetlands are too far apart to be manageable as a unit.) The population-size threshold for this species under Criterion D1a is 1,000 mature individuals. Consider the data set out in Table 9.3.2.3, comprising counts of mature individuals on a number of survey days each year over six years.

Returning to the marine turtle example, consider the data set out in Table 9.3.2.4.

What happens if different assessment parameters point to different conclusions? See Section 3.1. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 169 10. Reassessment The term \u201creassessment\u201d is used synonymously with the term \u201cre-evaluation\u201d throughout the KBA Guidelines. Confirmed KBAs should be reassessed against the KBA criteria and thresholds at least once every 8-12 years, although more frequent monitoring of KBAs is recommended wherever possible. If the original KBA Proposer is no longer available, the KBA NCG or KBA RFP (in that order) may identify a group to work on reassessment. Reassessment of sites identified as KBAs is especially important in the context of climate change, as climate change may affect biodiversity to such an extent that a site increases in importance and qualifies under additional criteria or loses importance and ceases to qualify. The reassessment process also presents a good opportunity to check whether there are any additional species or ecosystem types that might trigger KBA status at the site. 10.1 Reasons for a change in KBA status Why might the status of a confirmed KBA change? The focus here is on changes in the status of confirmed KBAs and delisting of KBAs. KBA Proposers or KBA NCGs may also decide to reassess sites that almost qualified in previous KBA identification processes, but information on sites that do not qualify is not stored in the WDKBA, so that process is not covered here. A site that has been confirmed as a KBA may change status for one or more of the following reasons: A. KBA criteria revision: for example, a site that qualified under previous KBA criteria does not qualify under the current KBA Standard (e.g., Version 1.0); B. taxonomic change: for example, a species is reclassified as a subspecies; C. change in threat category: for example, a species or ecosystem type was reassessed for the IUCN Red List or Red List of Ecosystems and is now listed under a different category or set of criteria; D. new or more reliable information: for example, better estimates of a species\u2019 global population size or the extent of an ecosystem type that regularly occurs at the site, including corrections to erroneous data or analysis; reclassification of a species so that it is no longer restricted-range, or ecoregion- or bioregion-restricted; Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 170 E. genuine change: for example, a reduction in the proportion of a species\u2019 global population size or number of reproductive units, or the extent of an ecosystem type that regularly occurs at the site; a reduction in ecological integrity.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "425322c9-0f2c-4cea-b6ef-da5b98bdc291": {"__data__": {"id_": "425322c9-0f2c-4cea-b6ef-da5b98bdc291", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/tunisie-guide-de-poche-pour-lidentification-des-principales-especes", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Tunisie - Guide de poche pour l\u2019identification des principales esp\u00e8ces vuln\u00e9rables captur\u00e9es accidentellement au cours d\u2019activit\u00e9s de p\u00eache en Tunisie", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/tunisie-guide-de-poche-pour-lidentification-des-principales-especes", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dd363c3333d0acfd874a527827c88042436efc98624cf99bdb4955ad538908a7"}, "2": {"node_id": "89918e4d-b4d2-4299-9f80-296c1fe1d5a5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/tunisie-guide-de-poche-pour-lidentification-des-principales-especes", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0ec2bfb587e82b74519f21803ff86b8fdbae5535b1b853e932134f27a4dec6a6"}}, "hash": "e577da725529bf57dea7221ca40f6272458864e7df6f2de81530f88be5c70bd3", "text": "Genuine changes may be classified as (i) attributable primarily to factors relating to site management (e.g., habitat degradation at the site), or (ii) primarily to factors operating beyond the site (e.g., overexploitation of a migratory species elsewhere in its range, shifts in the distribution of an ecosystem type driven by global climate change); F. change in the site boundary or manageability: for example, the site is redelineated because it is not (or no longer) considered to be actually or potentially manageable as a unit (e.g., because an existing KBA was originally proposed without taking manageability into account; or following a change in a management unit boundary or jurisdiction).

An 8-12-year window was selected as a practical compromise; it encourages a shorter reassessment timeframe (8 years is ideal), while recognizing that it will often take longer and some flexibility will be needed (12 years is the maximum). For each KBA trigger biodiversity element, the baseline for the 8-12 year window is the previous assessment for that element, not the year when data were collected. A site will be retained in the WDKBA after 12 years, but flagged as \u201cneeds updating\u201d. A confirmed KBA will not lose its KBA status solely on the basis of old data or the need for reassessment.20 Earlier updates to documentation and reassessment, if appropriate, is encouraged in the case of: \u25cf a taxonomic change to a trigger species; \u25cf a change in threat category of a trigger species or ecosystem type for a site confirmed as a KBA under Criterion A1 or A2. 20 New data showing that the site does not qualify would be required in any KBA Appeals process. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 171 Earlier reassessment is also encouraged if: \u25cf new information becomes available \u25cf a site suffers a catastrophic event (i.e. a genuine change) leading to the irreversible loss of a trigger species or ecosystem type or to loss of a site\u2019s ecological integrity. Earlier reassessment is required if: \u25cf there is a change to the site boundary. Ideally, all trigger biodiversity elements will be reassessed at the same time on 8-12 year cycles, even if some have been added more recently. Interim reassessments of particular species (e.g., following a taxonomic change, change in threat category, or new information affecting a particular species) can be conducted individually without reassessing all other trigger biodiversity elements. What about AZE sites, IBAs or other KBAs identified under previously published criteria? AZE sites, IBAs or other KBAs identified under previously published criteria that are shown to meet the criteria and thresholds in the KBA Standard, and for which minimum documentation requirements have been met, will be recognised as global KBAs. Those that may meet global KBA criteria and thresholds, but for which the data have not yet been compiled to demonstrate the case, will be flagged as \u201cglobal/regional status not yet determined\u201d and considered a priority for update. Those that do not meet global KBA criteria and thresholds but which do meet previously established regional criteria and thresholds will be recognised as regional KBAs. The start date for the 8-12 year reassessment period for AZE sites, IBAs or other KBAs identified under previously published criteria is the publication date of the KBA Standard (i.e. April 2016). 10.3 Reassessment process What does KBA reassessment involve? During the reassessment process, KBA NCGs or KBA Proposers should use the following checklist: \u25cf For sites that were confirmed as a KBA under any of the species-based criteria (i.e. A1, B1-3, D1-3, E), check whether there have been any taxonomic changes to trigger species (see Section 2.2.1). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 172 \u25cf For sites that were confirmed as a KBA under Criterion A1 or A2, check whether there has been any change in the threat category of the trigger species or ecosystem type, such that the site no longer qualifies as a KBA under Criterion A1 or A2. \u25cf For each KBA trigger biodiversity element, check whether there has been a change in the global or site-level values of assessment parameters (e.g., based on new or more reliable information), such that the biodiversity element no longer meets relevant thresholds. \u25cf For each KBA trigger biodiversity element, reconfirm the KBA trigger biodiversity element\u2019s presence at the site, in numbers that meet or exceed the reproductive- units threshold, where applicable. It is recommended that data used to confirm presence in KBA reassessments under any of the criteria should not be older than 8-12 years. \u25cf For each confirmed KBA, check whether there have been any changes in manageability or other changes indicating that KBA delineation should be re- visited.

Reassessment will generally follow similar lines to the original assessment (e.g., in terms of the set of ecological integrity indicators), but may expand on the original assessment if additional relevant data are available. How are KBAs identified under Criterion E reassessed? For sites identified as KBAs under Criterion E, reassessment needs to be conducted at the network level, as irreplaceability is the property of a site within a network rather than an individual site in isolation (see Section 6). Reassessment may be based on the same geographic extent and taxonomic scope and methods as the original assessment. In this case, reassessment will generally involve a review of datasets and species representation targets followed by re-analysis. However, KBA Proposers are encouraged to expand the taxonomic scope if newly available data allow for the Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 173 inclusion of additional species. KBA Proposers are also encouraged to check the set of recommended decision support tools (Section 6.2.5) and update the methods used, if appropriate. What happens if a KBA no longer qualifies because of a genuine increase in the global population size? (i) Effective conservation of a trigger species at a KBA may contribute to an increase in the global population size. In that case, the proportion of the global population size held at the site would be expected to increase. The KBA would only lose its status if successful conservation of a globally threatened trigger species led to its downlisting on the IUCN Red List and a change in the relevant KBA criteria or thresholds (e.g., KBA Criterion A1 no longer applies). In this case, the site should be reassessed against all the KBA criteria to clarify its status. The site may be highlighted as a conservation success on the IUCN Green List, subject to meeting the IUCN Green List criteria. (ii) Effective conservation of a trigger species elsewhere in its range may also contribute to an increase in the global population size. The proportion of the global population size held at the site may decrease and/or a globally threatened trigger species may be downlisted on the IUCN Red List, leading to a change in the relevant KBA criteria or thresholds. In this case, the site should be reassessed against all the KBA criteria to clarify its status. If it no longer qualifies under any global KBA criteria, it will no longer be a global KBA, but may still qualify as a regional KBA following guidelines for regional application of the KBA criteria and thresholds (to be developed in due course). What happens if a KBA no longer qualifies because of a genuine reduction in site-level population size? The reassessment process may indicate that a site no longer qualifies as a global KBA because of a genuine reduction in the site-level population size, ecosystem extent or ecological integrity. If this reduction could be reversed in the next 8-12 years through proposed restoration activities, the site will be flagged as \u201crestoration dependent\u201d in the WDKBA to allow for restoration. The KBA NCG or KBA Proposer should review the site\u2019s status in two years. If restoration activities are not underway by that time, the site\u2019s change in status will be confirmed (i.e. after two years). If restoration activities are underway but do not enable the site to recover its KBA status by the next reassessment, then the change in status will be reviewed and confirmed at that time (i.e. after 8-12 years). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 174 Conversely, if the reduction in the site-level population size, ecosystem extent or ecological integrity is unlikely to be reversed through proposed restoration activities in the next 8-12 years (i.e. before the next reassessment), the site should be reassessed against all the KBA criteria to clarify its status. The site\u2019s change in status will be indicated in the WDKBA immediately after it has been reviewed and confirmed and on the KBA website at the next update. If the site no longer qualifies under any global KBA criteria, it will no longer be a global KBA, but may still qualify as a regional KBA following guidelines for regional application of the KBA criteria and thresholds (to be developed in due course).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a7c8c377-3b2d-423b-b980-c0338cd081db": {"__data__": {"id_": "a7c8c377-3b2d-423b-b980-c0338cd081db", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/tunisie-guide-de-poche-pour-lidentification-des-principales-especes", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Tunisie - Guide de poche pour l\u2019identification des principales esp\u00e8ces vuln\u00e9rables captur\u00e9es accidentellement au cours d\u2019activit\u00e9s de p\u00eache en Tunisie", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/tunisie-guide-de-poche-pour-lidentification-des-principales-especes", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "67f812dcb0da82be34af4eab229eb17fd92e82d261662e3b9a484f2a5336cfd1"}, "2": {"node_id": "0849ca84-c136-4c89-ad44-9f366121a28a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/tunisie-guide-de-poche-pour-lidentification-des-principales-especes", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "306d56937ab7431a3eb1dc8f13254126a7b2e4c482af63965aea2d67b8e09ff5"}}, "hash": "40eadf953e5fde21916452c82bd6255576913925c546834cda8175c17902877f", "text": "How should changes in the status of KBA be documented?

The following terms are defined in the KBA Standard (IUCN, 2016, pp. 9-15). In the text below, definitions taken verbatim from the KBA Standard are shown in black; additional clarifications are shown in grey. I.1 Terms used in defining KBAs Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) KBAs are sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity. Biodiversity Biodiversity is \u201cthe variability among living organisms from all sources including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems\u201d, according to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) (UN, 1992). Contributing/Contribution The contribution of a site to the global persistence of biodiversity depends on the global distribution and the abundance of the biodiversity elements for which the site is important. Sites holding biodiversity elements that are globally restricted, or at risk of disappearing, make high contributions to the persistence of those elements. The global persistence of a biodiversity element occurring at any given KBA, unless it is entirely confined to the site, depends not only on the fate of the site itself but also on that of other sites and of the land-/seascapes where it occurs. Global Global implies that the contributions of a site to the persistence of a given biodiversity element are measured in relation to its worldwide population size or extent.

Significantly/Significant Significant means that an outstanding proportion of a biodiversity element (e.g., species population size or ecosystem extent) occurs at the site, as defined by a quantitative threshold. Site A geographical area on land and/or in water with defined ecological, physical, administrative or management boundaries that is actually or potentially manageable as a single unit (e.g., a protected area or other managed conservation unit). For this reason, large-scale biogeographic regions such as ecoregions, Endemic Bird Areas and Biodiversity Hotspots, and land-/seascapes containing multiple management units, are not considered to be sites. In the context of KBAs, \u201csite\u201d and \u201carea\u201d are used interchangeably. I.2 Terms used in the KBA criteria and delineation procedures Aggregation (Criterion D) A geographically restricted clustering of individuals that typically occurs during a specific life history stage or process such as breeding, feeding or migration. This clustering is indicated by highly localised relative abundance, two or more orders of magnitude larger than the species\u2019 average recorded numbers or densities at other stages during its life-cycle. The KBA Standard refers to a difference in relative abundance of two or more orders of magnitude, but this is advisory rather than required. Other metrics may also be used to support KBA proposals under Criterion D1 (e.g., nearest-neighbour distances). Area of occupancy (Criteria A, B, E) The area within the range of a species that is actually occupied (IUCN, 2012a). AOO is the area of habitat that is occupied by the species, based on known, inferred and projected occurrences (IUCN 2001). This definition does not include old localities Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 189 where the species is no longer known, inferred or projected to be present as a result of habitat transformation or other factors likely to have caused the species\u2019 extirpation, such as disease, invasive species or over-exploitation. This definition also excludes localities with a single record or sporadic occurrence outside the species\u2019 habitat or beyond the species\u2019 dispersal range from known, inferred or projected occurrences, such that the species is not expected to occur regularly at the locality. Assemblage (Criterion B) A set of species within a taxonomic group having: a) their ranges \u226595% predictably confined to a single ecoregion for at least one life-history stage; b) their ranges \u226595% predictably confined to a single biome for at least one life-history stage (for taxonomic groups with a global median range size >25,000 km2); or c) their most important habitats in common with multiple other species. In the definition of \u201cassemblage\u201d, the term \u201cbiome\u201d should be replaced by the term \u201cbioregion\u201d. This will be corrected in the next version of the KBA Standard. For species with validated ESH maps, ESH may be substituted for range. The term \u201cassemblage\u201d is also used in the definition of \u201cecological integrity\u201d, but in a more generic sense. Biodiversity element Genes, species or ecosystems, as used by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) definition of biodiversity (Jenkins, 1988). Biological process (Criterion D) The demographic and life-cycle processes that maintain species such as reproduction and migration. Bioregion (Criterion B) Major regional terrestrial and aquatic habitat types distinguished by their climate, flora and fauna, such as the combination of terrestrial biomes and biogeographic realms (Olson et al., 2001) or marine provinces (Spalding et al., 2007, Spalding et al., 2012).

Ecoregions have been mapped for terrestrial (Olson et al., 2001), freshwater (Abell et al., 2008) and near-shore marine (Spalding et al., 2007) environments and are nested within bioregions or provinces. Please see Appendix V for ecoregion templates for terrestrial, freshwater and marine systems. Ecosystem type (Criteria A, B) A defined ecosystem unit for standard and repeatable assessment, at an intermediate level in a globally consistent ecosystem classification hierarchy such as macrogroup or equivalent (Faber-Langendoen et al., 2014). It is defined by a particular set of variables related to its characteristic native biota, an abiotic environment or complex, the interactions within and between them, and a physical space in which these operate (Keith et al., 2013, Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2015). Other terms such as \u201cecological Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 191 communities\u201d and \u201cbiotopes\u201d are often considered operational synonyms of ecosystem type. In the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology, biogeographic ecotypes (Level 4) and global ecosystem types (Level 5) are considered the relevant levels for KBA identification (see the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology Ver. 2.0, Table 2 for further details). The KBA Standard also allows for KBAs triggered by equivalent ecosystem types, defined using other globally consistent ecosystem classification hierarchies (e.g., EcoVeg, Faber-Langendoen et al., 2014). For consistency with the definition of ecosystem type in the KBA Standard (see above) and the ecosystem concept used in the Red List of Ecosystems, equivalent ecosystem types should be defined by a particular set of variables related to the characteristic native biota, abiotic environment or complex, the interactions within and between them, and a physical space in which these operate (Keith et al., 2013, Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2015). Endemic (Criteria A, E) A species having a global range wholly restricted to a defined geographic area such as a region, country or site. Environmental stress (Criterion D) Natural events like floods, droughts, storms, wildfires, earthquakes as well as high or low temperature caused by global change; it can also describe the lack of food due to the bottom-up effect of environmental stress or massive die off of prey in ecosystem due to infectious disease. Environmental stress refers to extreme environmental conditions, whether natural or anthropogenic. Extent of suitable habitat (Criteria A, B) The area of potentially suitable ecological conditions, such as vegetation or substrate types within the altitudinal or depth, and temperature and moisture preferences, for a given species (Beresford et al., 2011). ESH refers to the area of habitat available to a species within its range. ESH cannot extend beyond the range, but may include unoccupied habitat within the species\u2019 range, unlike AOO. ESH is broadly defined to include habitat maps based primarily on expert knowledge (deductive models) or statistical analysis (inductive models). ESH thus includes both Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 192 the concept of \u201carea of habitat\u201d (AOH), which focuses on deductive models (Brooks et al. 2019), and output from statistical habitat models.

Localities refer to known points of occurrence, and do not include inferred or projected occurrences or sampling points where the species was not found to occur. For the purposes of KBA identification, old records from areas where the species no longer occurs and vagrancies (i.e. records from areas where the species has only been recorded sporadically and is not known to be native) are excluded from known localities. Each locality should represent a discrete population, to the extent this can be inferred, given the degree of habitat fragmentation and what is known about the dispersal capabilities of the species. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 193 Manageability (Delineation) The possibility of some type of effective management across the site. Being a manageable site implies that it is possible to implement actions locally to ensure the persistence of the biodiversity elements for which a KBA has been identified. This requires that KBA delineation consider relevant aspects of the socio-economic context of the site (e.g., land tenure, political boundaries) in addition to the ecological and physical aspects of the site (e.g., habitat, size, connectivity). An additional aspect of manageability is site accessibility. In some cases, the scale of manageability will be determined by how large an area can be monitored in practice, given the configuration of roads or waterways or the range of typical survey vessels. Mature individuals (Criteria A, B, E) The number of individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction as defined in IUCN (2012a). Population size (Criteria A, B, D) The total, global, number of mature individuals of the species (IUCN, 2012a). Population size is used throughout the KBA Standard rather than simply \u201cpopulation\u201d, which IUCN, (2012a) use to mean the total number of individuals of a species. In the KBA Guidelines, the term \u201cpopulation size\u201d is used to refer to the total number of individuals in a species, as in \u201cglobal population size\u201d; and to the number of individuals in a geographically or otherwise distinct group, as in the \u201csite population size\u201d. This differs from the IUCN Red List, in which the term \u201csubpopulation\u201d is used to refer to a geographically or otherwise distinct group in the population (IUCN, 2012a). Predictably (Criterion D) An expectation of species occurrence at a site during particular seasons or at one or more stages of its life cycle, based on previous or known occurrence, such as in response to specific climate conditions. Predictable occurrence includes both regular (seasonal) occurrence and irregular (episodic) occurrence, as long as the occurrence is a predictable response to environmental conditions. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 194 For Criterion D1, which is based on regular (seasonal) occurrence, a site \u201cpredictably\u201d holds a species if the species is known to have occurred at the site in at least two thirds of the years for which adequate data are available for the relevant season (e.g., the breeding season in the case of a breeding aggregation); the total number of years considered should not be fewer than three. This is consistent with the definition of \u201cregularly\u201d in the application of Ramsar Criteria 5 and 6 (Ramsar, 2018). (See Section 9.3.2 for detailed guidelines.) In contrast, Criterion D2 is based on irregular (episodic) occurrence. The term \u201cpredictably\u201d is not used in Criterion D2, but consistent with D1 and D3, a site may be considered to hold a species during periods of environmental stress if the species is known to have occurred at the site in at least two thirds of the periods of environmental stress for which adequate data are available.

For the purposes of KBA identification, range explicitly includes areas where a species has been introduced for conservation purposes outside its native habitat, as these are included in IUCN Red List assessments. 21 Note that IUCN SPSC (2014) has been updated to IUCN SPS (2019). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 195 Regularly (Criteria A, B) The occurrence of a species is normally or typically found at the site during one or more stages of its life cycle. A site \u201cregularly\u201d holds a species if the species is either continually present or occurs there on a predictable cyclical basis, typically (but not necessarily) following a seasonal pattern. In the case of seasonal occurrence, a site \u201cregularly\u201d holds a species if is known to have occurred there in two thirds of the years for which adequate data are available for the relevant season (e.g., the breeding season in the case of a breeding aggregation); the total number of years considered should not be fewer than three. This is consistent with the definition of \u201cregularly\u201d in the application of Ramsar Criteria 5 and 6 (Ramsar, 2018). Reproductive unit (Criteria A, B, E) The minimum number and combination of mature individuals necessary to trigger a successful reproductive event at a site (Eisenberg, 1977). Examples of five reproductive units include five pairs, five reproducing females in one harem, and five reproductive individuals of a plant species. Additional examples of five reproductive units include: \u25cf birds: 5 active nests; 5 pairs; or 5 mature females and at least 1 mature male in lekking species; \u25cf amphibians: 5 mature females and at least 1 mature male for most species; 5 pairs for species that provide biparental care; \u25cf turtles: 5 mature females for marine turtles on nesting beaches; \u25cf fish: 5 mature females and at least 1 mature male for most species; 5 pairs for species that form bonded pairs (e.g., some seahorse species); \u25cf insects: 5 females and at least 1 male for non-social insects; 5 colonies with a single reproducing queen each for social insects; 5 reproductive females for parthenogenetic insects; \u25cf cooperative breeders: 5 cooperative units (e.g., 5 packs of African Wild Dog, Lycaon pictus); \u25cf fungi: 5 mature individuals; \u25cf plants: 5 mature individuals for self-fertilising monoecious or hermaphroditic species; \u25cf clonal species: 5 distinct clones. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 196 Restricted range (Criterion B) Species having a global range size less than or equal to the 25th percentile of range- size distribution in a taxonomic group within which all species have been mapped globally, up to a maximum of 50,000 km2. If all species in a taxonomic group have not been mapped globally, or if the 25th percentile of range-size distribution for a taxonomic group falls below 10,000 km2, restricted range should be defined as having a global range size less than or equal to 10,000 km2. For coastal, riverine and other species with linear distributions that do not exceed 200 km width at any point, restricted range is defined as having a global range less than or equal to 500 km linear geographic span (i.e. the distance between occupied locations [i.e. localities] farthest apart). Species known only from their type locality should not automatically be assumed to have a restricted range, since this may be indicative of under-sampling. For species that have been assessed for the IUCN Red List, information on whether the species is likely to occur more widely, should be available in the IUCN Red List account. Note that range, not ESH, must be used for identifying restricted-range species. The minimum threshold for restricted range is set at 10,000 km2 as a precautionary measure. A list of all species that have been assessed for the IUCN Red List that qualify as restricted-range (using the 10,000 km2 threshold for any taxonomic group that has not yet been comprehensively assessed) is provided on the KBA website (Tools page).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6563d082-72b2-43ba-b7a5-ddd9ddd874f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "6563d082-72b2-43ba-b7a5-ddd9ddd874f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/tunisie-guide-de-poche-pour-lidentification-des-principales-especes", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Tunisie - Guide de poche pour l\u2019identification des principales esp\u00e8ces vuln\u00e9rables captur\u00e9es accidentellement au cours d\u2019activit\u00e9s de p\u00eache en Tunisie", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/tunisie-guide-de-poche-pour-lidentification-des-principales-especes", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f04bd6ef4e965c5c02a8a9886cd040d7a53b83bb66d1bad3400734539498d1d2"}, "2": {"node_id": "9a03df88-153a-4387-954b-4d086ad125a0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/tunisie-guide-de-poche-pour-lidentification-des-principales-especes", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0cdebabe1518dfc81341a0d25edf8aeb498cfc25094b78484d6a2217bb26b92a"}}, "hash": "ac3a94124df0a384885c9500a65cfb97ead361358acb5efba342bda1d30f97ca", "text": "Target (Criterion E) A conservation target is the minimum amount of a particular biodiversity feature for which conservation is desirable through one or multiple conservation actions (Possingham et al., 2006).

Threatened ecosystems are those assessed as CR, EN or VU according to the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (IUCN, 2015). The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems Categories and Criteria (Version 2.0) were established as a standard by IUCN (2014), based on Keith et al. (2013), not by \u201cIUCN (2015)\u201d as erroneously cited in the KBA Standard. The formatting (but not the content) of these has been updated in the two versions of the RLE Guidelines produced to date (Bland et al., 2016, 2017). Threshold (Criteria A-E) Numeric or percentage minima which determine whether the presence of a biodiversity element at a site is significant enough for the site to be considered a KBA under a given criterion or subcriterion. Trigger (Criteria A-E) A biodiversity element (e.g., species or ecosystem) by which at least one KBA criterion and associated threshold is met. I.3 Additional terms The following terms defined here were not defined in the KBA Standard. Biogeographic ecotype (Criteria A, B) Biogeographic ecotypes (Level 4) are defined as: \u201cAn ecoregional expression of an ecosystem functional group derived from the top down by subdivision of Ecosystem functional groups (Level 3). They are proxies for compositionally distinctive geographic variants that occupy different areas within the distribution of a functional group.\u201d (See the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology Ver. 2.0, Table 2 for further details.) Ecological refugium (Criterion D) In the KBA Standard (IUCN, 2016), ecological refugia are sites that maintain necessary resources (such as food and water) during periods of environmental stress (such as Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 198 severe droughts) when conditions elsewhere become inhospitable, sometimes over multiple years or decades. Note that the KBA Standard states that ecological refugia are used in times of environmental stress. Sites where individuals concentrate in times of environmental plenty (e.g., when prey is available at unusually high densities) do not meet this definition. Extent of an ecosystem type (Criteria A, B) Extent of an ecosystem type refers to the current geographic distribution of an ecosystem type, representing all spatial occurrences of the ecosystem type (Bland et al., 2017, p. ix). Equivalent system (Criterion A) Equivalent systems refers to regional- or national-based assessment processes that produce global status assessments that: i) are based on similar criteria to the IUCN Red List and can be reliably cross-walked to the IUCN Red List; ii) set similar standards for minimum supporting documentation and involve an appropriate process of independent review; and iii) are implemented by recognised assessment bodies in the region/country in question, based on science and input from scientists/ experts throughout the entirety of each species\u2019 range. (See Appendix VII for further details.) Global ecosystem type (Criterion B) Global ecosystem types are defined as: \u201cA complex of organisms and their associated physical environment within an area occupied by an ecosystem functional group. Global ecosystem types grouped into the same ecosystem functional group share similar ecological processes, but exhibit substantial difference in biotic composition. They are derived from the bottom up, either directly from ground observations or by aggregation of subglobal types (Level 6).\u201d (See the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology Ver. 2.0, Table 2 for further details.)

Appendix III.2 includes a section on Validation that is relevant to all habitat maps or models used in KBA assessments. III.1 Range Existing data on range For species that have been assessed for the IUCN Red List, range polygons can be downloaded from the IUCN Red List account22. If the IUCN Red List account for a species assessed since 2004 does not include a range map or locality data, this may indicate that distribution data for the species are considered sensitive. KBA Proposers should also check whether range polygons are coded \u201cGeneralised = 1\u201d; if so, this also indicates that the range polygon has been generalised and that distribution data for the species are considered sensitive. In both cases, KBA Proposers should review Section 9.1.1 on sensitive data and check with their KBA RFP, who will liaise with the IUCN Red List Unit, before submitting a KBA proposal for these species. Range estimates derived from a generalised polygon should not be used as an assessment parameter in KBA identification. With the exception of species listed as CR (PE) or CR (PEW), KBA Proposers should use the range map in the IUCN Red List assessment coded as follows: \u25cf Presence = 1 (Extant) and 2 (Probably Extant)23; \u25cf Origin = 1 (Native) and 2 (Reintroduced) and 6 (Assisted Colonisation); and 22 Individual range maps for non-commercial use can be downloaded from IUCN Red List species accounts; whole groups may be downloaded from http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical- documents/spatial-data; and custom-built sets using a free Red List user account. 23 Note that Presence = 2 is deprecated and will be discontinued. Any range maps that include areas coded as Presence = 2 that extend beyond known occurrences should be reviewed carefully and updated if appropriate prior to KBA identification. Range polygons coded as Presence = 3 (Possibly Extant), Presence = 4 (Possibly Extinct), Presence = 5 (Extinct) or Presence = 6 (Presence Uncertain) should be excluded. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 205 \u25cf any Season code (see below for migratory species). Select the polygons with the codes listed above to calculate total range area, or breeding and non-breeding range area. (See the IUCN Red List Mapping Standards for detailed definitions of mapping codes.) Migratory species For migratory species that have distinct breeding and non-breeding ranges identified in IUCN Red List assessment maps, breeding and non-breeding ranges will typically be assessed separately. Proposers should use the area of the range coded as follows for the breeding range: \u25cf Presence = 1 (Extant) and 2 (Probably Extant)24; \u25cf Origin = 1 (Native) and 2 (Reintroduced) and 6 (Assisted Colonisation); and \u25cf Seasonality = 1 (Resident) and 2 (Breeding Season) and 5 (Seasonal Occurrence Uncertain). Proposers should use the area of the range coded as follows for the non-breeding range: \u25cf Presence = 1 (Extant) and 2 (Probably Extant)25; \u25cf Origin = 1 (Native) and 2 (Reintroduced) and 6 (Assisted Colonisation); and \u25cf Seasonality = 1 (Resident) and 3 (Non-breeding Season) and 5 (Seasonal Occurrence Uncertain). Species listed as CR (PE) or CR (PEW) For species listed as CR (PE) or CR (PEW), KBA Proposers may use polygons coded as Presence = 3 (Possibly Extant) and coded for Origin and Seasonality as above.

ESH is broadly defined to include habitat maps based primarily on expert knowledge (deductive models) or statistical analysis (inductive models). ESH thus includes both the concept of \u201carea of habitat\u201d (AOH), which focuses on deductive models (Brooks et al., 2019), and output from statistical habitat models (also referred to as species distribution models, ecological niche models, bioclimatic models, density distribution models, etc.) Deductive approaches are well suited to developing consistent binary habitat maps for entire taxonomic groups, including data-limited species. They have lower data, technical and computational demands than inductive approaches. Deductive approaches are well suited to sedentary species and species with fixed breeding and/or non-breeding habitats. They are not well suited to species with spatially dynamic habitats, including many pelagic marine species. For such species, inductive approaches based on statistical habitat models provide the best available methods for estimating the distribution of mature individuals, if sufficient data are available. Existing data on ESH Validated ESH maps, derived using a deductive approach, are available for terrestrial mammals and birds (Dahal et al., in press) and will be provided through the IUCN Red List (spatial downloads page). Validated ESH maps for other taxonomic groups will also be provided when available. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 207 Estimating ESH If there is no validated ESH map or there is scope for improving the existing ESH map, the first step for KBA Proposers seeking to use ESH as an assessment parameter is to download the existing range map or develop a new range map (see Appendix III.1). Spatial resolution An ESH map is typically a raster (i.e. set of grid cells), but may be a polygon. If ESH is based on grid cells, the proportion of a species\u2019 ESH that is found within a site will depend in part on the spatial resolution of analysis. Analysis at a finer spatial resolution (for example, using 1-km2 or 4-km2 grid cells rather than 100-km2 grid cells) will generally lead to a lower global ESH and make it more likely that a site that falls entirely within the ESH exceeds the thresholds specified in the criteria. The standard resolution for AOO is 2 x 2 km grid cells; a link to a standardised 2 x 2 km grid is provided on the KBA website (Tools page). KBA Proposers are encouraged to use this grid for ESH where appropriate, but may use other resolutions if the 2 x 2 km grid is not suitable given the species\u2019 distribution patterns or the resolution of available data. Deductive approaches Deductive approaches, such as AOH (Brooks et al. 2019), typically involve classifying topographical and environmental data layers (e.g., altitude, bathymetry, land cover and benthic habitats, distance to water bodies), using information on altitudinal limits and habitat classes in IUCN Red List accounts (see IUCN Red List Habitat Classification Scheme) derived from published and unpublished literature and expert knowledge. A similar approach may be used in marine systems, especially for relatively sedentary benthic or demersal species, using bathymetry and other physiological limits (e.g., sea-surface temperature and salinity) together with benthic habitat classes. Once a range map is available, ESH can be delimited as follows: i. in a GIS, rasterise the range map into grid cells (optional); ii. remove cells or areas that fall outside the altitudinal/bathymetric or climate/temperature/salinity/soil type limits of the species distribution; iii. remove cells or areas that are otherwise unlikely to be suitable for the species, based on land cover or benthic habitat.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "668e34e4-e147-41cb-88f2-3b3aabeeeaad": {"__data__": {"id_": "668e34e4-e147-41cb-88f2-3b3aabeeeaad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/tunisie-guide-de-poche-pour-lidentification-des-principales-especes", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Tunisie - Guide de poche pour l\u2019identification des principales esp\u00e8ces vuln\u00e9rables captur\u00e9es accidentellement au cours d\u2019activit\u00e9s de p\u00eache en Tunisie", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/tunisie-guide-de-poche-pour-lidentification-des-principales-especes", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e48ac9eefd1ba82698f9badfb1c6173e19652677a555c589b0f4cfb4f5878396"}, "2": {"node_id": "5087f6d6-689f-4b5d-b288-58e062940491", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/tunisie-guide-de-poche-pour-lidentification-des-principales-especes", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "11b220be6143f9ab192defae0a59630d9c48b1a357ffa099d8798edd28b47a2d"}}, "hash": "49b59f4973a4ef2ab5bc6aed01538696298cb13160e3b59c6372bb020c74a8ce", "text": "Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 208 Inductive approaches ESH maps may also be developed using inductive approaches, by applying statistical methods (e.g., generalized linear or additive models, classification or regression trees) to known localities and topographical and environmental covariates (Elith & Leathwick, 2009; Franklin, 2010; Zurell et al., 2020).

Given adequate data, statistical analysis can account for variation in sampling effort and detectability. Validation The final ESH map should include all known, inferred or projected occurrences (including conservation translocations but excluding vagrancies), and all habitat (with unsuitable areas removed). Habitat maps and models can vary widely in quality and accuracy. A map or model may not provide an accurate representation of habitat if key variables are omitted. For example, a map would overestimate the habitat of a forest-dependent montane species if it identified all forest areas as potential habitat, irrespective of altitude. All habitat maps or models used in KBA assessments should therefore be subject to a critical evaluation based on biological and statistical considerations (where applicable). The selection of environmental covariates should be based on knowledge of the biology of the species and not simply fitted statistically from a pool of candidate variables that are conveniently available. All habitat maps or models used in KBA assessments (including ESH maps) should be validated with independent occurrence data. See Dahal et al. (in press) for validation methods for deductive approaches. When using inductive approaches, appropriate methods for model selection and evaluation should be employed, Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 209 including statistical tests of goodness-of-fit (e.g., the area-under-the-curve, Akaike\u2019s Information Criterion). Habitat maps and models that have not been published in the peer-reviewed literature should be sufficiently rigorous to pass peer review. Documentation In the documentation, KBA Proposers are requested to include sufficient information on datasets and mapping procedures to enable reproduction of the final ESH layer, and describe the process whereby the ESH map was created and validated (including the degree of expert engagement). The final ESH spatial data layer should also be submitted to the KBA Secretariat for archiving. This file may then be provided to other KBA Proposers for use in future KBA proposals (with a reference to the original spatial data source). III.3 Estimating area of occupancy (AOO) The area within the range of a species that is actually occupied (IUCN, 2012a). AOO is the area of habitat that is occupied by the species, based on known, inferred and projected occurrences (IUCN, 2001). Existing data on AOO For some species that have been assessed for the IUCN Red List, AOO may have been defined and mapped already. AOO maps must be validated before they can be used in KBA identification. Validated AOO maps can be obtained from the KBA Secretariat, if available. Estimating AOO If there is no validated AOO map or the AOO map needs updating, KBA Proposers seeking to use AOO as an assessment parameter should see the IUCN Red List Mapping Standards for detailed guidelines on mapping AOO. Habitat maps and models cannot be used to estimate a species\u2019 AOO directly because they map areas of habitat that may presently be unoccupied (i.e. outputs are closer to ESH than AOO). Low habitat-occupancy may result because factors other than habitat are limiting, such as exploitation, availability of prey, impacts of predators, competitors or disturbance, dispersal limitations. Habitat maps and models may therefore need to be filtered to produce a valid depiction of AOO for use in KBA identification. In some cases, filtering out areas that are unlikely to be occupied may Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 210 be fairly straight-forward. For example, projected occurrences in habitat patches that are small and distant from habitat patches with known localities may be filtered out using knowledge of the species\u2019 dispersal limitations; projected occurrences in areas close to roads or human population centres may be filtered out if hunting is a threat; areas that lack recent known occurrences and are known to have been affected by pathogens may be filtered out.

Remote sensing is a common approach for mapping the geographic distributions of many terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Global data sets, such as those available for forests (Hansen et al., 2013), mangroves (Giri et al., 2011), water cover (Pekel et al., 2016), and coral reefs (Andr\u00e9fou\u00ebt et al., 2006), may provide a useful basis for superimposing appropriate classifications of ecosystem types. Spatial proxies for ecosystem distributions (such as climate, substrate, topography, bathymetry, ocean currents, flood regimes, water cover, aquifers or some synthesis of these that can be justified in the documentation as valid representations of the distribution of ecosystem biota or its niche space) may be used in some cases. Physical factors such as sea floor characteristics, ocean currents, water temperatures and water chemistry may be appropriate predictors of ecosystem distribution for marine ecosystems. Spatial distribution models offer an additional opportunity to formally select and combine the most suitable set of spatial proxies to predict ecosystem distributions. Clark et al. (2015), for example, used bathymetric spatial data and remote sensing data on sea ice concentration to model the distribution of suitable light conditions for under-ice marine benthic invertebrate communities in Antarctic waters. When using spatial proxies or developing spatial distribution models, a mechanistic understanding of the relationship between occurrence of the ecosystem and limiting environmental factors is essential for developing a valid representation of the geographic distribution of an ecosystem type. Spatial distribution models should follow best practice recommendations for each model type and should be validated (see IUCN SPC, 2022, Section 4.10.7). Once the geographic distribution of an ecosystem type has been assessed using the methods described above, areas that have been lost to settlement, agriculture or other forms of habitat conversion should be removed before calculating the global and site- level extent of the ecosystem type.

Pressey et al. (1994) proposed a method that was computed as the number of representative combinations including the focal spatial unit divided by the total number of representative combinations, but this is computationally costly and cannot be calculated for large numbers of spatial units. Ferrier et al. (2000) proposed two methods, including summed irreplaceability, but this can exceed a value of 1 and is not easily rescaled, which makes it difficult to use in Criterion E assessments. The software Marxan (Ball et al., 2009) approximates irreplaceability by running an algorithm with the objective function of minimising the total network area or cost, subject to the constraint of achieving the representation targets. The algorithm is run a large number of times and the irreplaceability of each spatial unit is approximated by its selection frequency. This is the most widely used approach for estimating irreplaceability. However, it is based on a large number of suboptimal solutions \u2014 it can approximate irreplaceability if Marxan can find near-optimal solutions, but selection frequencies across spatial units will then tend to 0 or 1. CLUZ (Smith, 2019) is a user-friendly GIS plug-in that links to Marxan. With integer linear programming methods now available in tools such as prioritizr (Hanson et al., 2017), it is possible to calculate the optimal solution for a given conservation planning problem. Given a single optimal solution, the selection frequency for each spatial unit will be 0 or 1. prioritizr provides two alternative methods for estimating irreplaceability \u2014 the replacement cost method (Cabeza & Moilanen, 2006) is recommended for Criterion E analysis. KBA Proposers are advised to review software manuals carefully to check for relevant practical limitations (e.g., the maximum number of planning units that can be Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 220 included and expected run times), recognising that software and computing power are improving all the time (see Schuster et al., 2019 for example). Baisero et al. (2021) developed a proximity-to-irreplaceability metric (proxirr) that separates measurement of irreplaceability from complementarity. This is not currently recommended for use in Criterion E assessments because the KBA Standard specifies that complementarity-based methods should be used. Given the various ways that irreplaceability can be estimated, KBA Proposers should clearly document the method used to enable proper review. References Baisero, D., Schuster, R. and Plumptre, A.J.

Species that can trigger KBA Criterion A1 are: \u25cf species assessed as globally threatened (i.e. CR, EN or VU) on the IUCN Red List; and \u25cf species that (a) have not been assessed globally and (b) are endemic to the region/country in question and (c) have been assessed as regionally/nationally threatened following the Guidelines for Application of IUCN Red List Criteria at Regional and National Levels (IUCN, 2012b) or equivalent systems. What are equivalent systems? Equivalent systems refers to regional- or national-based assessment processes that produce global status assessments that: i) are based on similar criteria to the IUCN Red List and can be reliably cross-walked to the IUCN Red List; ii) set similar standards for minimum supporting documentation and involve an appropriate process of independent review; and iii) are implemented by recognised assessment bodies in the region/country in question (e.g., NatureServe in the USA/Canada, the Threatened Species Scientific Committee in Australia), based on science and input from scientists/experts throughout the entirety of each species\u2019 range. By definition, equivalent systems have demonstrated consistency with IUCN Red List assessments and so can serve as reliable proxies. There are taxonomic groups with large numbers of species that have not yet been assessed for the IUCN Red List that have been assessed as globally threatened under equivalent systems. Allowing such species to trigger KBAs under Criterion A1 expands the scope of Criterion A1 to include taxonomic groups that have not yet been assessed for the IUCN Red List, in a way that is consistent with the IUCN Red List and hence with the intent of the KBA Standard.

Each species in the WDKBA must have a unique identification number, unique scientific name, and a single status assessment, as per the database that underpins the Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 222 IUCN Red List (i.e. the Species Information Service, SIS). This is essential for the functionality of the WDKBA. In the case of a mismatch in taxonomy, the species concept used for KBA identification must be consistent with the species concept used in the SIS. In the case of a simple difference in nomenclature for the same species concept (e.g., Morus capensis in SIS; Sula capensis in the equivalent system), the difference in nomenclature should not impede KBA assessment. On the other hand, where there is a difference in treatment of a species or species complex (e.g., Canis lupus lycaon is recognised as a subspecies of C. lupus on the IUCN Red List, but as a distinct species in some other systems), a KBA may only be triggered by a full species recognised by the IUCN SSC Red List Authority or IUCN Red List Unit (see Section 2.2.1). (See also Section 2.2.1 for detailed guidelines on the process for updating taxonomy in the case of new information.) What if there is already a global IUCN Red List assessment?

The KBA Proposer should request that the national/regional assessment body prepare an updated IUCN Red List account and submit it to the relevant IUCN SSC Red List Authority. In addition, the KBA Proposer may ask the their KBA RFP to request that the IUCN SSC Red List Authority update the assessment for the species. If the national/regional assessment body provides the required information, but the IUCN SSC Red List Authority does not submit an updated assessment for publication on the IUCN Red List within a reasonable timeframe, the KBA Proposer may request the KBA Secretariat (through their KBA RFP) to allow that the equivalent system assessment be used in the interim for species that are endemic to the region or country where the equivalent system is recognised. The KBA Secretariat will then consult with the IUCN SSC Red List Authority or IUCN Red List Unit to check that the equivalent system assessment corresponds to the expected updated IUCN Red List assessment 26 Note. A species listed as \"Not Evaluated (NE)\" has not yet been assessed against the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria. This does not qualify as having an IUCN Red List assessment for the purposes of this appendix. A species listed as \"Data Deficient (DD)\" does not have adequate data to assess its extinction risk using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria. This qualifies as having an IUCN Red List assessment for the purposes of this appendix. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 223 (in particular, the delay should not reflect a significant disagreement about the species\u2019 status). Decisions will be made on a species-by-species basis. (Please note that this option may no longer be available once the WDKBA is fully linked to the SIS. This appendix will then be updated accordingly.) What about non-endemic species? Regional- or national-based equivalent systems cannot be used for species that are not endemic to the region or country where the equivalent system is the recognised assessment body (e.g., USA/Canada for NatureServe\u2019s G-ranks, Australia for species listed under Australia\u2019s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act). Given that each species can only have a single global status in the WDKBA, this stipulation minimises the potential for conflict over status assessments (for example, because the assessor is not recognised as the relevant assessment body in some part of a species\u2019 range and/or different assessments are made for the same species by different regional/national authorities). For non-endemic species that have been identified as globally threatened by equivalent systems, the best solution is for the KBA Proposer to request that the national/regional assessment body prepare an IUCN Red List account and submit it to the relevant IUCN SSC Red List Authority. In addition, the KBA Proposer may ask their KBA RFP to request that the IUCN SSC Red List Authority prioritise assessment of the species. Where does the responsibility lie for determining whether a system meets the criteria for use as an equivalent system? The KBA Standards and Appeals Committee has the responsibility for verifying that criteria (i) and (ii) above are met, i.e. that the criteria are similar and there is a reliable cross-walk and that documentation standards and review are appropriate. KBA NCGs are responsible for determining whether (iii) is met, i.e. whether the assessment agency is the recognised authority in the region/country, and whether assessments are based on science and input from scientists/experts throughout the species\u2019 range. Are NatureServe\u2019s G-ranks considered an equivalent system? Yes, NatureServe\u2019s G-ranks are considered an equivalent system, as the system complies with the three criteria established above. Specifically, species that (a) have not been assessed globally for the IUCN Red List and (b) are endemic to the USA/Canada and (c) have been assessed as possibly extinct (GH), possibly extinct in the wild (GHC), critically imperiled (G1) or imperiled (G2) can trigger KBA Criterion Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 224 A1.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "83725ba1-af95-461f-9927-0d070a56938e": {"__data__": {"id_": "83725ba1-af95-461f-9927-0d070a56938e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/tunisie-guide-de-poche-pour-lidentification-des-principales-especes", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Tunisie - Guide de poche pour l\u2019identification des principales esp\u00e8ces vuln\u00e9rables captur\u00e9es accidentellement au cours d\u2019activit\u00e9s de p\u00eache en Tunisie", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/tunisie-guide-de-poche-pour-lidentification-des-principales-especes", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "965c6ce45d4a9d4a226e4c25f56ee8a0d9d97d1c566d9e7729a6dfbc1068ce2f"}, "2": {"node_id": "6c3f0a00-a6c0-45d7-aca7-e41b177bf002", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/tunisie-guide-de-poche-pour-lidentification-des-principales-especes", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f207f23bae09633f42083a5763de067fcd3ff154c3c668fee7f581ef05b3a6d8"}}, "hash": "25cdf8bff5debdd4132f47bf6f91e5564f73ddf557c2e82c3b0866a29997ba00", "text": "For the purposes of KBA identification, species listed as GH, GHC or G1 are considered equivalent in status to species listed as CR or EN on the IUCN Red List; whereas species listed as G2 are considered approximately equivalent in status to species listed as VU on the IUCN Red List (Master et al. 2012).

A Global Standard for the Identification of Key Biodiversity Areas (IUCN, 2016, hereafter the KBA Standard) provides criteria and associated quantitative thresholds for identifying KBAs in an objective, repeatable and transparent way. The purpose of the Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of Key Biodiversity Areas (hereafter the KBA Guidelines) is to ensure that KBA identification is based on consistent, scientifically rigorous yet practical methods. The KBA Guidelines provide an overview of the steps for identifying and delineating KBAs, together with explanation of how the KBA criteria, thresholds and delineation procedures should be applied in practice. The primary audience for the KBA Guidelines includes KBA Proposers, KBA National Coordination Groups (NCGs) and KBA Regional Focal Points (RFPs). It is important that the KBA Standard remains stable for a period of time to enable comparisons of KBAs across species, ecosystems, and regions and over time. In contrast, the KBA Guidelines will be updated periodically, with frequent revisions anticipated in the initial years as experience in applying the KBA Standard grows. We expect these updates will be mostly clarifications and additions of detail rather than substantial changes. A summary of the main changes, clarifications and additions in each version is provided in Appendix X.

Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 1 1. Introduction 1.1 Key Biodiversity Areas Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) are sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity. The criteria used to identify KBAs incorporate elements of biodiversity across genetic, species and ecosystem levels, and are applicable to terrestrial, freshwater, marine and subterranean systems. KBAs have delineated boundaries and are actually or potentially manageable as a unit. KBAs provide an effective bridge between assessment processes and conservation planning and an important step towards conservation action. However, the process of KBA identification and delineation does not include steps to advance management activity and does not imply that any specific conservation action, such as protected area designation, is required. 1.2 A Global Standard for the Identification of Key Biodiversity Areas The KBA Standard (IUCN, 2016) defines a set of criteria and associated quantitative thresholds for identifying KBAs in an objective, repeatable and transparent way. The general approach for identifying KBAs was informed by The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species\u2122 (IUCN, 2012a, hereafter the IUCN Red List) and by the Red List of Ecosystems (RLE, Keith et al., 2013), which use criteria and quantitative thresholds to identify threatened species and ecosystem types respectively. Development of the KBA criteria, thresholds and delineation procedures was informed by decades of experience identifying important sites for biodiversity, including Alliance for Zero Extinction (AZE) sites (Ricketts et al., 2005), Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs, Donald et al., 2018), Important Fungus Areas (Evans et al., 2001), Important Plant Areas (IPAs, Plantlife International, 2004; Darbyshire et al., 2017), previous iterations of KBAs (Eken et al., 2004; Langhammer et al., 2007), Prime Butterfly Areas (van Swaay & Warren, 2006), Ramsar sites (Ramsar, 2018), Special Protection Areas (Stroud et al., 1990) and Ecologically and Biologically Significant Areas (EBSAs, Dunn et al., 2014). The KBA criteria, thresholds and delineation procedures were subject to an extensive global consultation process. The KBA Standard was approved by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Council and launched at the World Conservation Congress in Hawai\u2032i in 2016. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 2 1.3 Criteria and subcriteria for identifying Key Biodiversity Areas The KBA criteria are explicitly designed to cover all levels of biodiversity, including genetic diversity, species and ecosystems. The KBA criteria include both species-based criteria similar to those used in the above-mentioned schemes (e.g., AZE sites, IBAs), and ecosystem-based criteria designed to identify sites that are important for biodiversity at the ecosystem level (Table 1.3). Genetic diversity is addressed through its inclusion in assessment parameters used to identify sites under several of the species-based criteria. Collectively, the criteria aim to capture the various ways in which a site can be important for the global persistence of biodiversity. The eleven criteria are grouped into five high-level criteria (A-E). A site must contribute significantly to the global persistence of at least one of the following to qualify as a KBA: A. Threatened biodiversity (Criteria A1-2) B. Geographically restricted biodiversity (Criteria B1-4) C. Ecological integrity (Criterion C) D. Biological processes (Criteria D1-3) or, it must have: E. Very high irreplaceability, as determined through quantitative analysis (Criterion E). The threatened biodiversity criterion (A) identifies sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of threatened species (A1) or threatened ecosystem types (A2).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a6045fa4-4ee4-4abb-ab9e-eb42cc600e57": {"__data__": {"id_": "a6045fa4-4ee4-4abb-ab9e-eb42cc600e57", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Morocco - Pocket identification guide of main vulnerable species incidentally caught in Moroccan fisheries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b39bba8c5e1c01eb5121bbd325160024b20eebcc49e9c6f609760ad4aca11b1a"}, "2": {"node_id": "204e60d3-b03b-48d4-bf81-c6b463fbd284", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4b5cccc961313a8ed9166881f7c293f3a4455a336e96913098af678858a6caa7"}}, "hash": "1546793a4b5fa87f9fa289948a01380ef7f4348db31d5270349935bd13d79b06", "text": "The geographically restricted biodiversity criterion (B) identifies sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of individual geographically restricted species (B1), co-occurring geographically restricted species (B2), geographically restricted assemblages (B3), or geographically restricted ecosystem types (B4).

Assessing sites against multiple criteria and for multiple biodiversity elements will strengthen the robustness of KBA identification to changes in the status of particular trigger species, assemblages, or ecosystem types. For example, if a KBA is identified for both a globally threatened mammal species (under Criterion A1) and an aggregation of fish (under Criterion D1), the site would remain a KBA even if the mammal is reassessed as having lower extinction risk on the IUCN Red List and no longer triggers the KBA. Assessing sites against multiple criteria and for multiple biodiversity elements may be an iterative process. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 4 Many of the criteria include subcriteria (e.g., a, b, \u2026) that describe explicitly how a site contributes to the global persistence of biodiversity (see Appendix II for a summary). A site that qualifies as a KBA under Criterion A1 (threatened species) subcriterion b, for example, supports at least 1% of the global population size and at least 10 reproductive units of a species listed as Vulnerable (VU) on the IUCN Red List (Fig. 1.3). Figure 1.3 Criteria, subcriteria, thresholds and assessment parameters. Source: Compiled by the KBA SAC. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 5 Recognition that a site meets KBA thresholds may be based on one or more assessment parameters. A site may be recognised as meeting the thresholds for subcriterion A1b, for example, based on the assessment parameters (ii) area of occupancy and (iii) extent of suitable habitat (Fig. 1.3). This site would then be listed as a KBA under Criterion A1b (ii, iii). 1.4 Thresholds for identifying Key Biodiversity Areas The KBA criteria have quantitative thresholds to ensure that KBA identification is objective, repeatable and transparent. The thresholds in the KBA Standard are designed to identify sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity under each of the KBA criteria. These thresholds were developed through a series of technical workshops and subsequently refined through wide expert consultation and testing with datasets covering diverse taxonomic groups, regions and systems. Guidelines for regional application of the KBA criteria and thresholds will be developed in due course. The KBA thresholds are applicable to all macroscopic species (i.e. excluding micro- organisms) and ecosystem types in terrestrial, freshwater, marine and subterranean systems. The criteria and thresholds are designed to be as simple as possible, while meeting the need for consistent applicability across biodiversity elements and systems. Many KBA thresholds are based on proportions of a species\u2019 global population size or the global extent of an ecosystem type. For example, a site would qualify as a KBA under Criterion A1b if it holds at least 1% of the global population size of a Vulnerable species (Fig. 1.3), or under Criterion B4 if it holds at least 20% of the global extent of an ecosystem type (Appendix II). The use of percentage thresholds avoids the challenge of identifying fixed numeric thresholds (such as a pre-defined number of mature individuals or extent of an ecosystem type) that would be appropriate across all taxonomic groups or ecosystem types.

There is therefore a range of assessment parameters that can be used to estimate the proportion of the global population size at a site if estimates of the number of mature individuals are not available. These assessment parameters include area of occupancy (AOO), extent of suitable habitat (ESH), range, and number of localities. 1.5 Confirmed presence of biodiversity elements in Key Biodiversity Areas KBA identification requires the confirmed presence at the site of one or more biodiversity elements (e.g., species, species assemblage, or ecosystem type) that trigger one or more of the KBA criteria. Many species-based criteria have two thresholds, one relating to the percentage of the global population size held by the site, the other relating to the number of reproductive units present at the site. This second threshold is designed to ensure that the species is documented at the site in sufficient numbers that the population is capable of maintaining itself beyond the current generation. In the case of Criterion C, a site evaluation should be conducted to confirm the presence of fully functional ecosystem types and their components and minimal human impact, using the ecological integrity attributes and associated indicators set out in Section 5.4. 1.6 Climate and environmental change KBAs may be triggered by species or ecosystem types that are threatened by future climate change as long as they meet relevant thresholds in the present. The predicted loss of biodiversity elements at a site that currently meets the KBA criteria and thresholds due to climate or other environmental change does not preclude its identification as a KBA. In such situations, it would be appropriate to document climate change as a threat to the KBA (see the KBA Proposal Process guidance). Sites that do not currently meet the criteria and thresholds cannot be identified as KBAs based on predictions that they will do so in the future as a result of climate change. Models that predict the future occurrence of biodiversity elements under specific climate-change scenarios may be important in national and regional conservation planning exercises but cannot be used to identify KBAs that do not currently meet the criteria and thresholds. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 7 1.7 Key Biodiversity Area boundaries Delineation is the process of defining the geographic boundaries of a KBA and is a required step in the KBA identification process. The aim is to derive site boundaries that are ecologically relevant and provide a basis for potential management activities. Delineation is an iterative process that typically involves assembling spatial datasets (Section 7.1), deriving initial KBA boundaries based on ecological data (Section 7.2), refining the ecological boundaries to yield practical KBA boundaries (Section 7.3) and documenting delineation precision (see the KBA Proposal Process guidance). 1.8 Stakeholder consultation and involvement Stakeholder consultation and involvement are important at various stages of the KBA identification and delineation process. This includes consultation with knowledge- holders, consensus-building with proposers of existing KBAs where a new KBA might overlap, and involvement of customary rights-holders. KBA NCGs and other KBA Proposers are encouraged to consult with a range of local knowledge-holders, including biodiversity knowledge-holders and local tenure and resource management knowledge-holders, during KBA identification and delineation (see Section 8.1). KBAs should not overlap. If a new site proposed as a KBA intersects with an existing KBA (e.g., an AZE site, IBA or KBA identified under previous initiatives), then consensus-building with proposers of the existing KBA is required before any boundaries are modified (see Section 8.2). The process of KBA identification and delineation does not include steps to advance management activity, but confirmation of a site as a KBA may lead to new or increased efforts to safeguard the site. The involvement of those who hold customary rights to terrestrial, freshwater, marine or subterranean resources is strongly recommended before any action that might affect their rights to those resources (see Section 8.3). In particular, the Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) of Indigenous peoples or other natural resource dependent communities is required when contemplating actions or decisions that could affect rights to lands, territories or resources (IUCN Standard on Indigenous Peoples). 1.9 Locally and nationally driven process KBAs are ideally identified and delineated by local and national constituencies using globally standardised criteria, thresholds and delineation procedures.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dff4c5b3-0a4e-4799-98ee-26c3793b5a06": {"__data__": {"id_": "dff4c5b3-0a4e-4799-98ee-26c3793b5a06", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Morocco - Pocket identification guide of main vulnerable species incidentally caught in Moroccan fisheries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3b91f2838f384f1bb2bd9b0a07d2199b2cad7e8e949389de142519e84f569c05"}, "2": {"node_id": "a286dd14-a37f-4136-b041-7722c9f7ac90", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "96e498471762c455fbe9f174c06c9b5060b82f2014adbb8a7c7be7152e39b7e5"}}, "hash": "4ac12f8d9dfffc7d70fe9d8df7fdd210c073f1726247e83281b84a30532fa969", "text": "The leading Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 8 role of in-country organisations and experts serves to mobilise local biodiversity knowledge in KBA identification and enable effective stakeholder consultation and involvement, with the additional benefit of building local and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "02bdebd3-8826-4ee5-9786-1953593223a5": {"__data__": {"id_": "02bdebd3-8826-4ee5-9786-1953593223a5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Morocco - Pocket identification guide of main vulnerable species incidentally caught in Moroccan fisheries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f5af0bd01361eb34eb80a1d5d18e0ffb09616dfeed5081cbf8258dc94b862c45"}, "3": {"node_id": "40137787-a9bd-4b7a-b5ba-0ccf612addd4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "88dc1b9232649520cfa24f67b4689992c8aec4c040b70ffb74eaaf39a0e95a2f"}}, "hash": "886429bd81a12df3c75f4029666d470a0006b5acd00069001d5b74e4ed0fe642", "text": "national support for safeguarding KBAs. Any organisation or individual with appropriate scientific data may serve as a KBA Proposer, proposing one or more KBAs based on the KBA Standard and the KBA identification and delineation process set out in the KBA Guidelines and the documentation requirements set out in the KBA Proposal Process guidance. In countries with a KBA NCG, KBA Proposers are strongly encouraged to work in coordination with the NCG. Where there is no NCG, KBA Proposers should engage with their KBA RFP early in the process, and are encouraged to reach out to other in- country experts and national representatives of the KBA Partners to stimulate the establishment of an NCG. KBA NCGs play a key role in supporting the identification of a single, comprehensive and harmonised set of KBAs and promoting their conservation. In particular, NCGs can ensure that KBA Proposers are aware of other ongoing efforts to identify new KBAs or to revise existing KBAs in the country, so that boundaries can be aligned. In large countries, this role may be supplemented by similar coordination groups working at ecoregion, bioregion, state or provincial levels, as appropriate. In each region, KBA RFPs, regional representatives of the KBA Secretariat, are available to provide technical support and training to KBA NCGs and other KBA Proposers. NCGs and other KBA Proposers are encouraged to engage with their RFP early in the process of KBA identification and delineation. Please see the KBA Proposal Process guidance for more details on the role of various actors in proposing, reviewing, nominating and confirming KBAs. International organisations or experts may conduct various types of desk-based analysis to scope out possible KBAs in processes that are not locally or nationally driven. Examples include regional and global datasets prepared by the KBA Secretariat and provided to KBA NCGs or other KBA Proposers as an input to local or national KBA identification processes, analyses by IUCN SSC Red List Authorities or IUCN SSC Specialist Groups focused on particular taxonomic groups, and university- based research on various aspects of the application of the KBA criteria and thresholds. The results of these analyses are not KBAs until the KBA identification and delineation process is complete, including delineation of practical boundaries (Section 7.3), consultation and involvement of customary rights-holders and other Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 9 stakeholders (Section 8), and confirmation of presence and reproductive units. With the exception of the high seas, this will require collaboration with KBA NCGs or other in-country organisations and experts. 1.10 Data availability, quality and uncertainty KBA identification should be based on the most comprehensive and up-to-date data available and the best available methods for quantitative analysis. Nevertheless, it is recognised that the availability of high quality data and quantitative analysis differs significantly among taxonomic groups and ecosystems. (See Section 9 for further guidelines on data availability, quality and uncertainty.) KBA NCGs and other KBA Proposers are responsible for ensuring that the data used to support a site\u2019s qualification as a KBA are reasonable and defensible. KBA proposals will be reviewed by the KBA RFP who may send proposals to additional experts for independent review (see the KBA Proposal Process guidance). Site assessments that are not based on the best available data may be vulnerable to challenge through a KBA Appeal. 1.11 Monitoring of Key Biodiversity Areas KBA monitoring is essential for improving our understanding of what is happening to KBAs in relation to trigger species, ecosystem types and ecological integrity and how these biodiversity elements are responding to pressures. Monitoring information is important at the site, national, regional and global scale. It enables the design and adaptation of effective conservation actions to safeguard the biodiversity that KBAs hold, and may contribute to KBA reassessment by providing updated information on site-level values of assessment parameters for trigger biodiversity elements. KBA monitoring data can also be compiled at national and international levels and used to support policy recommendations and advocacy. 1.12 Reassessment of sites as Key Biodiversity Areas Confirmed KBAs should be reassessed against the KBA criteria and thresholds at least once every 8-12 years, with more frequent monitoring of biodiversity elements that triggered KBA qualification recommended where possible.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "40137787-a9bd-4b7a-b5ba-0ccf612addd4": {"__data__": {"id_": "40137787-a9bd-4b7a-b5ba-0ccf612addd4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Morocco - Pocket identification guide of main vulnerable species incidentally caught in Moroccan fisheries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f5af0bd01361eb34eb80a1d5d18e0ffb09616dfeed5081cbf8258dc94b862c45"}, "2": {"node_id": "02bdebd3-8826-4ee5-9786-1953593223a5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "886429bd81a12df3c75f4029666d470a0006b5acd00069001d5b74e4ed0fe642"}}, "hash": "88dc1b9232649520cfa24f67b4689992c8aec4c040b70ffb74eaaf39a0e95a2f", "text": "Both genuine status changes and new information about the biodiversity element(s) triggering KBA criteria and thresholds may affect the status of a site as a KBA.

The KBA Standard uses several assessment parameters that are also used in IUCN Red List or Red List of Ecosystems assessments (e.g., \u201cmature individuals\u201d, \u201cAOO\u201d). The KBA Guidelines therefore make frequent reference to the Guidelines for using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN SPC, 2022) and the Guidelines for the application of IUCN Red List of Ecosystems Categories and Criteria (Bland et al., 2017), which provide more detailed discussion of these parameters. 1.14 Documentation Sites will only be accepted as KBAs if they are adequately documented. All required documentation should be compiled prior to submission. Documentation provides information to reviewers on the justification for identifying a site as a KBA and to decision-makers on why each KBA is important. Documentation also enables analysis of KBA data across species, ecosystem types and regions over time. (See the KBA Proposal Process guidance for further details.) Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 11 2. Identifying Key Biodiversity Areas using species-based criteria (A1, B1-3, D1-3) This chapter provides detailed guidelines on applying the species-based criteria, A1, B1-3 and D1-3. It is supplemented by Section 3, which provides detailed guidelines on assessment parameters. Criterion E is also species-based, but is covered separately in Section 6 because the identification process differs substantially from that used for Criteria A1, B1-3 and D1-3. 2.1 Overview The step-by-step process shown below serves to structure the guidelines and is indicative only. In practice, the process of KBA assessment is likely to vary among countries and taxonomic groups. KBA NCGs and other KBA Proposers are encouraged to conduct a comprehensive scoping analysis (Steps 1-3 in Fig. 2.1) to identify all potential KBA trigger biodiversity elements and potential KBAs in the region of interest. For species-based criteria (A1, B1-3, D1-3), this scoping analysis should ideally be implemented across multiple taxonomic groups simultaneously. For each country, the aim should be to conduct inventories and compile spatial data for as many taxonomic groups as possible to improve data availability for lesser-known biodiversity elements (e.g., some invertebrates, fungi). KBA identification will ideally be based on the same datasets for all criteria for consistency. KBA NCGs and KBA Proposers are also encouraged to conduct comprehensive assessments (Steps 4-10 in Fig. 2.1) covering all potential KBA trigger biodiversity elements and potential KBAs identified in the scoping analysis for which there are adequate data. Assessing sites against multiple criteria and biodiversity elements will strengthen the robustness of KBAs to changes in the status of particular trigger species. Nonetheless, some KBA Proposers may wish to focus on identifying KBAs for a particular species or taxonomic group; whereas others may be primarily interested in a particular site and prefer to start by conducting an inventory of biodiversity elements that may meet KBA criteria and thresholds at the site. This chapter includes a section on identifying species that are eligible to trigger KBAs (Section 2.2), a section on scoping analysis (Section 2.3), and then a section for each of the species-based criteria, except Criterion E.

This section also applies to Criterion E (Section 6). 2.2.1 Taxonomy The species concept used for KBA identification must be consistent with the species concept used in IUCN Red List assessments and the database that provides the taxonomic backbone for the IUCN Red List (i.e. the Species Information Service, SIS). This is essential for the functionality of the WDKBA. What taxonomy should be used for species that have been assessed for the IUCN Red List? For species that have been assessed on the IUCN Red List, KBA Proposers must follow the species concept used in the IUCN Red List. If there is a proposed change in the treatment of a species or species complex (e.g., a proposed taxonomic split), the SIS, the IUCN Red List assessment and the WDKBA must be updated first, before a KBA can be submitted based on the new information. If there is a proposed change in nomenclature for the same species concept (e.g., a proposed change from Morus capensis to Sula capensis), this difference should not delay KBA assessment. KBA Proposers can submit a proposal using the current nomenclature, which will be updated in the WDKBA automatically when it is updated in the SIS. What taxonomy should be used for species that have not been assessed on the IUCN Red List? As a first step, KBA Proposers need to confirm whether the species is included in the SIS, as many species in the SIS have not yet been assessed for the IUCN Red List. KBA Proposers can liaise with their KBA RFP who will contact the IUCN Red List Unit to check. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 14 If a species is not included in the SIS, it must first be added to the SIS, or the taxonomy must be approved by the IUCN SSC Red List Authority or IUCN Red List Unit and be in the process of being added to the SIS, before it can be proposed as a KBA trigger species. For taxonomic groups that fall under the remit of an IUCN SSC Red List Authority, KBA Proposers should liaise directly with the designated IUCN SSC Red List Authority to confirm the taxonomy of any species not yet in the SIS. For taxonomic groups that do not have a designated IUCN SSC Red List Authority (or if the IUCN SSC Red List Authority is unable to respond in a timely manner), KBA Proposers should liaise with their KBA RFP, who will ask the IUCN Red List Unit whether there is an approved checklist (e.g., Catalogue of Life, World Register of Marine Species) or relevant expert group (e.g., an IUCN Species Survival Commission Conservation Committee) who can advise on taxonomy. The final decision on which taxonomy to follow rests with the IUCN Red List Unit. Can KBAs be identified for undescribed species? Undescribed species cannot trigger KBAs, unless the species has been assessed on the IUCN Red List (see IUCN Red List Guidelines; IUCN SPC, 2022, Section 2.1.1 for conditions under which undescribed species may be listed). In the case of species that are in the process of being formally described through a scientific article that has not yet been published, the site will not be confirmed for that species until the article has been published and the species has been accepted by the IUCN SSC Red List Authority or relevant expert group and included in the SIS.

Critically Endangered (CR) or Endangered (EN) species known only from their type locality1 can trigger subcriterion A1e if it is likely that effectively the entire population size is regularly held at the site. This information should be available in the IUCN Red List account. If it is not, KBA Proposers should check with IUCN Red List assessors. Otherwise, globally threatened species known only from their type locality may trigger one of the other A1 subcriteria, providing the relevant reproductive-units threshold is met. Generally, species known only from their type locality should not automatically be assumed to trigger KBA Criteria B1, B2, or B3, without further assessment of whether the species might occur beyond the site. For species that have been assessed for the IUCN Red List, this information should be available in the IUCN Red List account. The distribution of species listed as Data Deficient (DD) on the IUCN Red List is often poorly known. For DD species and other species with limited data, KBA Proposers should consult with relevant experts (e.g., IUCN Red List assessors) to evaluate whether the species is likely to occur more widely and, hence, would likely fail to trigger KBA Criterion B if its distribution was well known. If this consultation reveals that the species is likely to occur more widely, this information should be forwarded to the KBA Secretariat, which will forward new information to relevant IUCN SSC Red List Authorities on a periodic basis. Can species without range maps trigger a KBA? In principle, a range map should be available for all species before they can trigger a KBA. Some species on the IUCN Red List, including the majority of plant species, have locality data but no range map, although such instances should become rare as a range 1 The type locality is the single locality where the type specimen (i.e. the scientific name-bearing representative of the species) was collected. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 16 map is now required supporting information for all IUCN Red List assessments. However, many species are not yet included on the IUCN Red List and do not have range maps, KBA Proposers are encouraged to develop range maps for these species following the IUCN Red List Mapping Standards (see also Appendix III), but a range map is not required if the assessment parameter is number of mature individuals, number of localities, or distinct genetic diversity. Species with an IUCN Red List assessment but no range map cannot trigger a KBA that falls outside the range described in the IUCN Red List account (including conservation translocations). Please see Section 3.1 if the range description needs updating. If the IUCN Red List account for a species assessed since 2004 does not include a range map or locality data, this may indicate that distribution data for the species are considered sensitive. KBA Proposers should review Section 9.1.1 on sensitive data and check with their KBA RFP, who will liaise with the IUCN Red List Unit, before submitting a KBA proposal for these species. 2.2.3 Migratory species How are KBAs identified for migratory species? For migratory species with well-defined spatially segregated life-cycle processes, such as breeding and feeding, Criteria A1, B1-3, D1a and D2 can be triggered separately by mature individuals in each spatially segregated life function. For example, a CR migratory species may trigger subcriterion A1e if a single site holds effectively the entire global population size of breeding adults during the breeding season, even if no mature individuals are found at the site during the non-breeding season. The same species could also trigger a separate KBA under subcriterion A1a if the site regularly holds \u22650.5% of the population size and \u22655 reproductive units in the non-breeding season.

Only populations that are considered \u201cwild\u201d, following the guidance provided in the IUCN Red List Guidelines (IUCN SPC, 2022, Section 2.1.4), can trigger a KBA. There is a continuum of management intensities from captive populations (e.g., in zoos, aquaria and greenhouses) to populations that are not managed in any way. Many populations are dependent on anthropogenic ecosystems (e.g., reservoirs or grazed ecosystems) and/or conservation measures (e.g., protected areas) \u2014 these populations are generally considered wild. Captive animal populations and cultivated plant populations are not considered wild. In general, classification as wild should be based on the intensity of management and the expected viability of the population without intensive management. For example, an unmanaged population of a plant species in a botanical garden may be considered wild, whereas a population dependent on heated greenhouses would not. For further guidance, please refer to the IUCN Red List Guidelines (IUCN SPC, 2022, Section 2.1.4). Can KBAs be identified for introduced or re-introduced populations? A site that supports an introduced population outside its natural range that is considered wild may be identified as a KBA only if it qualifies as a conservation translocation based on all the following conditions: (a) The known or likely intent of the introduction was to reduce the extinction risk of the introduced species; (b) The site is geographically close to the natural range of the species (see IUCN SPC, 2022, Section 2.1.3 for definition of \u201cgeographically close\u201d); (c) The introduced population has produced viable offspring at the site; and (d) At least five years have passed since the conservation translocation. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 18 Conservation translocations are explicitly included in the definition of range in the KBA Standard and should be included in IUCN Red List range maps2. Self-sustaining wild populations that have been re-introduced within the species\u2019 natural range may trigger a KBA and should be included in estimates of global population size, regardless of the original goal of the re-introduction. In such cases, conditions (a) and (b) above are not relevant, but conditions (c) and (d) must be met. Please see the IUCN Red List Guidelines (IUCN SPC, 2022, Section 2.1.3) for further details. Please see Section 2.4.1 for the special case of species listed as EW on the IUCN Red List. 2.3 Scoping analysis for species-based criteria (A1, B1-3, D1-3) 2.3.1 For each taxonomic group, compile a list of potential trigger species in the region of interest. For taxonomic groups that have been comprehensively assessed for the IUCN Red List3, a list of species known to occur in a particular country can be downloaded from the IUCN Red List.4 For other taxonomic groups, it is recommended that lists of potential trigger species are compiled from the IUCN Red List and additional sources (e.g., national field guides, checklists, the National Red List database, GlobalTreeSearch, FishBase, SeaLifeBase, World Register of Marine Species), in consultation with biodiversity knowledge-holders (see Section 8.1). Comprehensive lists of potential trigger species will likely result in a more complete initial KBA assessment, but should not delay or deter KBA identification where capacity or resources are limited. There is no straight-forward way to compile a list of potential trigger species for all KBA criteria.

Validated AOO maps can be obtained from the KBA Secretariat, if available. Locality data may be found through a literature search, museum/herbarium records, online databases (e.g., the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, GBIF), additional citizen science platforms and direct contact with biodiversity knowledge-holders. Some of these data may need to be digitised for use in a geographic information system (GIS). Locality data should be reviewed carefully and filtered to remove unreliable or unverified observations. 2.3.3 Identify the existing/potential sites where each potential trigger species may occur in significant numbers. One possible approach is to develop a species/site table (e.g., Table 2.3) by overlaying site boundaries on spatial data for each species in a GIS. Boundaries of existing sites (e.g., existing KBAs, other sites of importance for biodiversity, protected or conserved areas) can be overlaid on species\u2019 spatial data to develop a list of existing sites where each potential trigger species is known to occur (e.g., based on recent well documented locality data or validated AOO maps), or inferred or projected to occur (e.g., based on ESH or range).

Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 20 Table 2.3 Example of a species/site table used to identify sites that might qualify under Criterion A1. Additional columns can be added to identify sites under other criteria (e.g., restricted-range for B2, ecoregion- or bioregion-restricted for B3, forms an aggregation at the site for D1).

If there are no suitable delineated sites in areas of potential importance, initial boundaries for potential KBAs may be based on ecological considerations (see Section 7.2). These boundaries may need to be refined later to yield practical KBA boundaries (see Section 7.3). KBA Proposers should review the Justification, Geographic Range and Population sections of IUCN Red List for listed species, as well as available spatial data on range, ESH, AOO and localities for all proposed trigger species to ensure that KBA proposals are consistent with this information. Useful information on existing sites where a species is currently known to occur may also be found in the Conservation Actions section of the IUCN Red List account. For many species, available data will be limited to range and/or localities. Sites proposed as KBAs for a species must fall within the species\u2019 range (at least partially) and/or include at least one locality (see also Section 9.2.3 on confirmation of presence and reproductive units). If there are recent known localities that fall outside the Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 21 mapped range, the range map should be updated before proceeding (see Sections 3.1 and 3.5). Note that old records are excluded from known localities and may fall outside the current range if the species has been extirpated from the area.

How are globally threatened species identified for the purposes of applying KBA Criterion A1? The IUCN Red List is the global standard for species status assessments despite its taxonomic and geographic gaps (Stuart et al., 2010) and using it as the authority for threatened species increases the rigour and transparency of the KBA identification process. Species that can trigger KBA Criterion A1 are: \u25cf species assessed as globally threatened (i.e. CR, EN or VU) on the IUCN Red List; and \u25cf species that (a) do not have a global IUCN Red List assessment and (b) are endemic to the region/country in question and (c) have been assessed as regionally/nationally threatened following the Guidelines for Application of IUCN Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 22 Red List Criteria at Regional and National Levels (IUCN, 2012b)5 or equivalent systems (see Appendix VI). If a species\u2019 IUCN Red List threat category has been proposed but not yet accepted or is in revision, the site will not be confirmed as a KBA for the species under the new threat category until after the new IUCN Red List account is published. The KBA Standard does not specify any particular version of the IUCN Red List criteria (IUCN, 2016, p. 16), but the most recent assessment must be used for each species. Species assessed as globally CR, EN or VU under previous versions of the IUCN Red List criteria that have not been updated may trigger KBA Criterion A1, but it is strongly recommended that such species are reassessed prior to KBA identification to confirm that they fall into the same categories under the current criteria and update population and distribution information. Similarly, if an IUCN Red List assessment is flagged as \u201cneeds updating\u201d, it is strongly recommended that all efforts are made to update the IUCN Red List assessment prior to KBA identification. KBA NCGs and KBA Proposers are encouraged to develop a list of assessments that need updating early in the KBA identification process. They may then ask the KBA Secretariat (through their KBA RFP) to request that the IUCN SSC Red List Authorities update assessments for these species. Can species assessed as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) or Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct in the Wild) trigger a KBA? Species listed as CR (PE) or CR (PEW) can only trigger a KBA under subcriterion A1e, where the site is assumed to hold effectively the entire global population of any surviving individuals. Species listed as CR (PE) or CR (PEW) cannot trigger any of the other KBA subcriteria or criteria as it is not possible to confirm presence. There is no reproductive-units threshold for subcriterion A1e, because it is assumed that all (or nearly all) mature individuals occur at the site. Species listed as CR (PE) or CR (PEW) can only trigger a KBA at the site at which the species is most likely to occur if it still exists. It is recommended that this site is proposed as a KBA. For many species listed as CR (PE) or CR (PEW), this corresponds to the locality of the last recorded population. However, in a few cases, the species may never have been recorded at this site \u2013 for example, if the area where the species 5 A repository of species assessed at national levels can be found at www.nationalredlist.org.

For each species that can trigger Criterion A1, the relevant subcriterion and threshold depends on its category on the IUCN Red List (e.g., CR, EN, VU). A site qualifies as a KBA under Criterion A1 because it regularly holds one or more of the following: a) \u22650.5% of the global population size AND \u22655 reproductive units of a CR or EN species; b) \u22651% of the global population size AND \u226510 reproductive units of a VU species; c) \u22650.1% of the global population size AND \u22655 reproductive units of a species assessed as CR or EN due only to population size reduction in the past or present (as indicated by the IUCN Red List assessment); d) \u22650.2% of the global population size AND \u226510 reproductive units of a species assessed as VU due only to population size reduction in the past or present (as indicated by the IUCN Red List assessment); e) Effectively the entire global population size of a CR or EN species. Note that a single species may trigger a KBA at a site under multiple A1 subcriteria (e.g., A1a, A1c and A1e for a CR or EN species that is listed as CR or EN due only to population size reduction in the past or present that is effectively confined to a single site). When are subcriteria A1c and A1d applicable? KBA subcriteria A1a and A1b are intended for general applicability across all globally threatened species; whereas subcriteria A1c and A1d are intended for limited application to species that have experienced, or are currently experiencing, rapid Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 24 decline in population size. Thus, KBA subcriteria A1c and A1d apply only to species listed as globally threatened under IUCN Red List Criterion A (population size reduction), but not IUCN Red List Criterion B, C or D. The species must have already experienced or be experiencing this rapid decline, so KBA subcriteria A1c and A1d apply only to species listed under IUCN Red List subcriteria A1, A2, and/or A4 (population size reduction including the past). Species listed only under IUCN Red List subcriterion A3 (population size reduction in the future) cannot serve as trigger species for KBA subcriteria A1c and A1d. For example: \u25cf KBA subcriterion A1c would apply to a species listed as CR A2 or to a species listed as CR A2; E, but not to a species listed as CR A2; C2; D. \u25cf KBA subcriterion A1c would apply to a species listed as CR A2+A3+A4, but not to a species listed only as CR A3. These guidelines are based on the current IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (Ver. 3.1; IUCN, 2012a). KBA subcriteria A1c and A1d cannot be applied to species assessed against previous versions of the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (e.g., Ver 2.3). What is meant by \u201ceffectively the entire global population size\u201d in KBA subcriterion A1e? A site is considered to hold \u201ceffectively\u201d the entire global population size of a CR or EN species if it holds more than 95% of the global population size. This is the threshold used in identifying AZE sites (Ricketts et al., 2005). The entire global population size refers to the population in the wild, not including individuals in captivity. (Please see Section 2.2.3 for application to migratory species.) In case of uncertainty, a CR or EN species can trigger subcriterion A1e if it is more likely than not that the site regularly holds effectively the entire population size, i.e. there is a greater than 50% chance that the site population size exceeds the 95% threshold.

For each globally threatened species, KBA Proposers should calculate the proportion of the global population size that regularly occurs at each site based on the estimated global and site-level values for each assessment parameter, and then compare that to the relevant population-size threshold for the species given its threat category. This calculation will be checked in the WDKBA when it is fully functional. 2.4.5 Confirm the presence of each potential trigger species that meets the relevant population-size threshold at each proposed site. The final step in assessing a site against KBA Criterion A1 is to confirm the presence of each potential trigger species at the site by reviewing recent data, requesting information from local biodiversity knowledge-holders or conducting new field surveys if necessary. In some cases, the IUCN Red List account provides the information required to confirm the presence of potential trigger species at proposed sites. For subcriteria A1a-d, the species must be regularly present in numbers that meet or exceed the relevant reproductive-units threshold (see Section 3.3). The reproductive- units thresholds are an intrinsic component of the A1 thresholds (except for subcriteron A1e) and are intended to prevent identification of KBAs where the species occurs in very low numbers and the population is unlikely to maintain itself beyond the current generation. If available data indicate that a site holds at least 10 reproductive units of a species listed as CR or EN, KBA Proposers are encouraged to provide that information, even though only 5 reproductive units are required for CR and EN species, as this may prove useful if the species is downlisted in the future. There is no reproductive-unit requirement for subcriterion A1e. Nevertheless, with the exception of species listed as CR (PE) or CR (PEW) on the IUCN Red List, it is still Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 26 necessary to confirm that the species regularly occurs at the site (see Section 9.2.3). If data are available on reproductive units, KBA Proposers are encouraged to provide that information as it may prove useful if the species\u2019 status changes and it no longer qualifies as an A1e trigger species in the future. 2.4.6 Refine ecological boundaries, if necessary, to yield practical KBA boundaries. KBA delineation is not complete until ecological boundaries have been evaluated and refined, if necessary, to yield a manageable site or sites (see Section 7.3 for guidelines on delineation). 2.4.7 Compile required and recommended documentation under Criterion A1. See the KBA Proposal Process guidance for required and recommended documentation for Criterion A1. 2.5 Applying Criterion B1 to identify KBAs for individual geographically restricted species 2.5.1 Identify species that may trigger Criterion B1. Any species whose population or distribution is so concentrated that 10% or more of the global population size regularly falls within a site can trigger a KBA under B1. How are geographically restricted species identified for the purposes of applying KBA Criterion B1? For the purpose of identifying KBAs under Criterion B1, there is no need for the species to be identified as restricted-range (as per Criterion B2) or restricted to an ecoregion or bioregion (as per Criterion B3). Some species with broad global distributions have many individuals concentrated in just a few areas within their range limits and may thus trigger Criterion B1. Any species whose population or distribution is so concentrated in certain places that \u226510% of the global population size regularly occurs in a single site may trigger a KBA under Criterion B1. Can migratory species trigger Criterion B1? The KBA Standard states that \u201cthe regular occurrence of all life stages of a species at a site distinguishes Criterion B1 from Criterion D1\u201d (IUCN, 2016, p. 18). Here, the KBA Guidelines clarify that Criterion B1 may apply to resident or migratory species as long as at least 10% of the global population size and at least 10 reproductive units of the Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 27 species regularly occur at the site.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "751f014c-092a-4e45-aab2-8a5aa464aa21": {"__data__": {"id_": "751f014c-092a-4e45-aab2-8a5aa464aa21", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Morocco - Pocket identification guide of main vulnerable species incidentally caught in Moroccan fisheries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8f3f7d672f5a131fb4bcd7b0795816bf2fc54c76847b3577446cbccf9df0bf8a"}, "2": {"node_id": "11e2e254-f9ce-4f36-9c57-889dcbdea98d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d1010764efc542d7154137f3da4d4f9461acc50a51ca48ac628cde3ff1c9f6f4"}}, "hash": "e92c6066c3914baa69f3807fa2c6cb2f21c50dbc2a45734c5ffab47865d26d82", "text": "Some sites may qualify as KBAs under B1 and D1 for the same species, provided that the aggregation definition for D1 is met.

The first step in applying Criterion B2 is to identify the appropriate taxonomic group for applying this criterion. A list of standard taxonomic groups for applying Criteria B2 and B3 is provided on the KBA website (Tools page).

A list of all species that have been assessed for the IUCN Red List that qualify as restricted-range6 is provided on the KBA website (Tools page). For other species, KBA Proposers are encouraged to review the guidelines below and consult with their KBA RFP before proceeding with site assessments. Site analysis should be conducted separately for each taxonomic group. Restricted- range species from different taxonomic groups cannot be combined to meet Criterion B2.

In comparison, the class of flowering plants Magnoliopsida has approximately 260,000 species, so Order is used instead (e.g., Ericales with ~14,000 species; Gentianales with ~22,750 species). Working at lower taxonomic levels would generally make it less likely that 2 or more potential trigger species would co-occur at the same site, as required by the species threshold for Criterion B2. If a KBA Proposer wants to apply a different taxonomic level to that proposed in the standard taxonomic groups for applying Criteria B2 and B3, please contact the KBA Secretariat first to discuss this. How are restricted-range species identified for the purposes of applying KBA Criterion B2? For the purpose of identifying KBAs under Criterion B2, the KBA Standard defines restricted-range species as: \u25cf species with a global range size less than or equal to 10,000 km2, and \u25cf the 25% of species in the taxonomic group with the smallest ranges up to a maximum of 50,000 km2. (Please see Appendix I for the full definition.) Can KBA Criterion B2 be applied to migratory species? In the case of migratory species, Criterion B2 may be applied separately to each spatially segregated life-cycle process. For example, a migratory species that is restricted-range in its breeding range, but not in its non-breeding range, could only trigger KBAs under Criterion B2 in its breeding range; whereas a migratory species that is restricted-range in its breeding and non-breeding range could trigger KBAs Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 30 under Criterion B2 in both its breeding range and non-breeding range. (See Appendix III for details on how range is assessed for migratory species.) 2.6.2 The Criterion B2 threshold is 1% for all restricted-range species. A site qualifies as a KBA under Criterion B2 because it regularly holds \u22651% of the global population size of each of a number of restricted-range species in a taxonomic group, determined as either \u22652 species OR 0.02% of the global number of species in the taxonomic group, whichever is larger. For example, if the total number of species in the taxonomic group is 20,000, the threshold number is 4. As most standard taxonomic groups for applying Criteria B2 and B3 have 10,000-50,000 species, the species threshold will be 2-10 species for most groups. The standard list of taxonomic groups for applying Criteria B2 and B3 includes information on the global number of species in the taxonomic group and the threshold number of restricted-range species that must co-occur at a site to trigger a KBA under Criterion B2.7 2.6.3 For each species, identify assessment parameters for which reliable global and local level data are available, and estimate these parameters at the global and site level for all sites where the species may meet the 1% threshold. For each potential trigger species, review the available data at global and local levels and decide which assessment parameters to use, then estimate global and site-level values for those parameters. For Criterion B2, the proportion of the global population size at a site can be observed or inferred through any of the following: (i) number of mature individuals, (ii) area of occupancy, (iii) extent of suitable habitat, (iv) range, (v) number of localities, (vi) distinct genetic diversity. See Section 3.1 for guidelines on selecting among assessment parameters. 7 Note that exact information on the global number of species is not required. If the number is less than 15,000, then the species threshold is 2 restricted-range species (species thresholds are rounded down). If the number is greater or equal to 15,000, then the species threshold is 0.02% of the global number of species in the taxonomic group (e.g., a taxonomic group containing 15,000-19,999 species would require 3 restricted-range species in the taxonomic group to co-occur at the site).

How can species presence be confirmed at a site for Criterion B2 given that there is no reproductive-units threshold? While there is no explicit reproductive-units threshold for Criterion B2, numbers and densities of mature individuals should be sufficient to support reproduction at sites within the breeding range. KBA Proposers must confirm the presence of potential trigger species at the site and are asked to report this in terms of reproductive units (see Section 3.3), where this information is readily available (using the 10 reproductive units threshold for Criterion B1, for example). This is especially important for threatened species, which may meet the population threshold despite very low numbers of mature individuals.

The first step in applying Criterion B3 is to identify the appropriate taxonomic group for applying this criterion. A list of standard taxonomic groups for applying Criteria B2 and B3 is provided on the KBA website (Tools page). The second step is to determine whether subcriterion B3a, B3b or B3c is applicable to the taxonomic group. Information on whether B3a or B3b is applicable is included in the list of taxonomic groups for applying Criteria B2 and B3. The third step is to identify the potential trigger species that occur in the country or region of interest for each taxonomic group. For taxonomic groups that have been comprehensively assessed8: \u25cf if B3a is applicable to the taxonomic group, a list of ecoregion-restricted species will be provided on the KBA website (Tools page); \u25cf if B3b is applicable to the taxonomic group, a list of bioregion-restricted species will be provided on the KBA website (Tools page) in due course. KBA proposers should follow the guidelines below for other taxonomic groups. If neither B3a or B3b is applicable to the taxonomic group in a region, KBA Proposers interested in applying B3c should identify species in the country or region of interest that have been surveyed using systematic and quantitative methods at numerous localities across most of their known range. How is the appropriate subcriterion (B3a, B3b or B3c) determined? The KBA Standard states that Criterion B3a is applicable to taxonomic groups for which the global median range size is <25,000 km2, while B3b is applicable to taxonomic groups with a global median range size \u226525,000 km2 (IUCN, 2016, p. 19).

In contrast, it is not possible to apply B3a and B3b to the same taxonomic group in different regions because B3a is applicable to taxonomic groups with global median range size <25,000km2, while B3b is applicable to taxonomic groups with global median range size \u226525,000 km2 (IUCN, 2016, p. 19). How are ecoregion-restricted assemblages identified under subcriterion B3a? The KBA Standard defines ecoregions as: A \u201crelatively large unit of land (or water) containing a distinct assemblage of natural communities and species with boundaries that approximate the original extent of natural communities prior to major land-use change\u201d (Olson et al., 2001). Ideally, ecoregion- or bioregion-restricted species would simply be identified by overlaying ecoregion or bioregion templates on species\u2019 range maps. But this approach is limited due to a combination of the relatively coarse spatial resolution of Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 34 ecoregion and bioregion templates and the relatively high endemism requirement of 95%, especially when based on range. Range maps typically include areas that are not used by the species, so this approach may fail to identify a number of species that are genuinely ecoregion- or bioregion-restricted. Therefore, it is important to allow modification of lists of ecoregion- and bioregion-restricted species based on expert knowledge, rather than relying solely on spatial overlays. The KBA Secretariat generates preliminary lists of ecoregion-restricted species by overlaying ecoregion templates (Appendix V) on range maps or validated ESH maps for all species with an IUCN Red List range map. If the KBA NCG or other local experts hold good information on the distribution of a taxonomic group within an ecoregion, then the list of ecoregion-restricted species based on the spatial overlay may be replaced by a list identified by the KBA NCG or other local experts. If an ecoregion straddles national boundaries, agreement between KBAs NCGs or local experts will be needed in advance of submitting an expert-derived list of ecoregion- restricted species. Please see Appendix V for ecoregion templates for terrestrial, freshwater and marine systems. Lists of ecoregion-restricted species are provided on the KBA website (Tools page). How are bioregion-restricted assemblages identified under subcriterion B3b? The KBA Standard defines bioregions as: Major regional terrestrial and aquatic habitat types distinguished by their climate, flora and fauna, such as the combination of terrestrial biomes and biogeographic realms (Olson et al., 2001) or marine provinces (Spalding et al., 2007, Spalding et al., 2012). The process of developing lists of bioregion-restricted species parallels that described above for ecoregion-restricted species, except that the KBA Secretariat only generates lists for relevant taxonomic groups that have been comprehensively assessed (e.g., mammals, birds). KBA NCGs and KBA Proposers interested in developing a list of bioregion-restricted species for other taxonomic groups are asked to contact their KBA RFP first to avoid duplication of effort. Bioregion templates for terrestrial, freshwater and marine systems are currently being evaluated and will be provided in Appendix V in due course. Lists of bioregion-restricted species will be provided on the KBA website (Tools page) in due course.

A site qualifies as a KBA under Criterion B3 because it regularly holds one or more of the following (IUCN, 2016, p. 19, with minor edits for clarification): a) \u22650.5% of the global population size of each of a number of ecoregion-restricted species within a taxonomic group, determined as either \u22655 species OR 10% of the species restricted to the ecoregion, whichever is larger; b) \u22655 reproductive units of \u22655 bioregion-restricted species OR \u22655 reproductive units of 30% of the bioregion-restricted species known from the country, whichever is larger, within a taxonomic group; c) Part of the globally most important 5% of occupied habitat for each of \u22655 species within a taxonomic group.

For other taxonomic groups, KBA Proposers should consult with their KBA RFP before proceeding. In many cases, it will be possible to determine the species threshold based on an estimate of the number of species restricted to the ecoregion. An exact number may not be required. If the number is less than 60, then the threshold is simply 5 ecoregion-restricted species. Conversely, if the number is greater than or equal to 60 then the species threshold is 10% of the number of species restricted to the ecoregion. Subcriterion B3b: For each combination of bioregion and taxonomic group, KBA Proposers should estimate the number of species within the taxonomic group that are both restricted to the bioregion and known from the country (i.e. the number known from the country is per bioregion not for a combination of bioregions). An exact number may not be required. If the number is less than 20, then the threshold is simply 5 bioregion- restricted species. Conversely, if the number is greater than or equal to 20 then the species threshold is 30% of the number of species restricted to the bioregion that are known from the country. \u201cKnown from the country\u201d requires regular occurrence, and cannot be based on vagrants. For marine species \u201cknown from the country\u201d refers to the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Subcriterion B3c: Relevant thresholds are fixed for subcriterion B3c. Any polygon or grid cell that ranks in the top 5% in terms of relative densities or abundance for each of 5 or more well- sampled species within the taxonomic group may form the basis for identifying and delineating a KBA under subcriterion B3c.

(This is a clarification of the text in the KBA Standard; IUCN, 2016, p. 19.) Subcriterion B3c: Under subcriterion B3c, \u201cthe globally most important occupied habitat\u201d can be observed or inferred through the following: (i) density of mature individuals, (ii) relative abundance of mature individuals. Note that (i) may refer to relative densities as well as absolute densities. Subcriterion B3c is designed to identify sites that are disproportionately important within the set of sites where species within a taxonomic group are known to occur (e.g., sites with exceptionally high productivity). Subcriterion B3c does not target geographically restricted biodiversity \u2014 individual geographically restricted species Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 38 and co-occurring geographically restricted species are the focus of Criteria B1 and B2 respectively. Analysis of relative densities or abundance should be based on a set of theoretical sites of similar size. Where possible, it is recommended that KBA Proposers use grid cells or polygons with a spatial resolution close to the average size of manageable units within the region of interest. Grid cells may be better suited to species with continuous distributions, especially in areas with few existing sites; whereas other polygons may be better suited to species with patchy distributions. If polygons vary in size, then relative densities should be used, rather than abundance. The grid or set of polygons should extend across most of the known ranges of each of the species in the analysis, including all suspected high density areas. For each species, relative density or abundance estimates should be available for a large number of cells or polygons (generally greater than 100) \u2014 species recorded at fewer than 20 cells or polygons should be excluded. The relative density or abundance of each species included in the analysis is tabulated for each cell or polygon. If sampling has been conducted at a finer resolution than the cells or polygons used in this analysis, then the average relative density or abundance should be estimated for each cell or polygon. For highly mobile species, sampling data should be averaged over multiple sampling seasons. For each species, cells or polygons are ranked from the most important (i.e. highest relative density or abundance) to least important; ranks are then divided by the number of cells or polygons with the species present. For example, if a species occurs at 50 sites, the proportional ranking for the three most important sites is 1/50, 2/50, and 3/50 (i.e. 2%, 4%, 6%), and therefore the two most important sites are included in the most important 5% of habitat for the species. A cell-by-species or polygon-by-species matrix is thereby constructed with cells or polygons in the most important 5% of habitat for each species identified. For each cell or polygon, it is then possible to count the number of species for which the cell or polygon is in the most important 5% of habitat. The \u22655 species threshold is then applied to identify cells or polygons that could form the basis for delineating a KBA. 2.7.4 Assess whether each potential trigger species meets the relevant population-size threshold at each existing/potential site.

KBA Proposers should then compare the number of species that meet the population- size threshold at the site to the species threshold for subcriterion B3a, given the number of species in the taxonomic group restricted to the ecoregion. These calculations will be checked in the WDKBA when it is fully functional.

While there is no explicit reproductive-units threshold for subcriteria B3a and B3c, numbers and densities of mature individuals should be sufficient to support reproduction at sites within the breeding range. KBA Proposers are encouraged to confirm the presence of potential trigger species at the site in terms of reproductive units, where this information is readily available, using the 5 reproductive units threshold for Criterion B3b, for example. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 40 2.7.6 Refine ecological boundaries, if necessary, to yield practical KBA boundaries. KBA delineation is not complete until ecological boundaries have been evaluated and refined, if necessary, to yield a manageable site or sites (see Section 7.3 for guidelines on delineation). 2.7.7 Compile required and recommended documentation under Criterion B3. See the KBA Proposal Process guidance for required and recommended documentation for Criterion B3. 2.8 Applying Criterion D1 to identify KBAs for demographic aggregations 2.8.1 Identify species that aggregate at specific sites and may trigger Criterion D1. Criterion D1 is triggered by demographic aggregations of species, typically occurring during a specific life-cycle process. When applying Criterion D1, KBA Proposers first need to confirm whether the population at the site represents a demographic aggregation. The trigger species must aggregate at the site \u2014 a species cannot trigger a KBA under Criterion D1 at sites where it does not aggregate, even if it is generally considered congregratory. Many congregatory species aggregate for some life-cycle processes, but disperse widely for others. For example, many shorebird species (family Scolopacidae), aggregate for specific life-cycle processes (e.g., during migration or to over-winter) and are more widely dispersed at lower densities during other seasons. Albatross and petrel species typically aggregate in breeding colonies, but many species disperse widely at sea, even though foraging aggregations may occur at specific oceanographic sites such as seamounts9. A few species, such as the Lesser Flamingo (Phoeniconaias minor), are aggregated through most or all of their life-cycles. Criterion D1 may be applied to species that aggregate for some or all of their life-cycle (IUCN, 2016, p. 22) if they form an aggregation at the site. Sites that support \u22651% of the global population size of a species but where the species is not aggregated do not qualify as KBAs under Criterion D1. For example, almost the entire global population of Kirtland\u2019s Warbler (Setophaga kirtlandii) breeds in a very limited area in north and central Michigan (USA), but does not aggregate to breed, so does not trigger D1. (It could, however, trigger KBAs under Criterion B1 for any site that regularly holds \u226510% of the global population size and \u226510 reproductive units.) 9 Note that this differs from the comment in the KBA Standard that albatrosses and petrels remain aggregated throughout most or all of their life cycles as they move between sites (IUCN 2016, p. 22). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 41 Information indicating that the species forms an aggregation at the site must be included in KBA proposals under Criterion D1. Relevant information will most likely be found through a literature search or expert knowledge. How are demographic aggregations defined for the purposes of applying KBA Criterion D1? An aggregation is defined in the KBA Standard as: \u201cA geographically restricted clustering of individuals that typically occurs during a specific life-cycle process such as breeding, feeding or migration. This clustering is indicated by highly localised relative abundance, two or more orders of magnitude larger than the species\u2019 average recorded numbers or densities at other stages during its life-cycle.\u201d (IUCN, 2016, p.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d7038488-6cc9-4457-9645-b8ee9c0a6645": {"__data__": {"id_": "d7038488-6cc9-4457-9645-b8ee9c0a6645", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Morocco - Pocket identification guide of main vulnerable species incidentally caught in Moroccan fisheries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "99324785a3177e509fe205c4ce058958e488055adca4c96b12ae88d4e6239022"}, "2": {"node_id": "988119fd-26ff-4f38-b92e-e2299f75722b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d7ca033322125701599c6e75e53346780824303d90ac7dc895ef3589c6566d80"}}, "hash": "045c041f8062b58c1ce8fd2185b3353b61d30b09c986f0df51e53bf9a50fb822", "text": "11) The KBA Standard refers to a difference in relative abundance of two or more orders of magnitude, but this is advisory rather than required.

In some cases, an aggregation occupies a relatively small area in a larger site because the aggregation moves unpredictably within a broader predictable space or because site delineation accommodates additional biodiversity elements or manageability considerations. Where this is the case, KBA Proposers are asked to note this in the KBA proposal. Can foraging areas for species that aggregate to breed qualify as KBAs under Criterion D1? Many congregatory species aggregate to breed, but disperse widely while foraging (e.g., some seabird and pinniped species). For such species, a site that holds a breeding colony or rookery of 1% or more of the global population size would be expected to meet the aggregation requirement and qualify under D1a. By extension, a site that includes a colony or rookery and associated marine area (perhaps encompassing an Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 42 important staging or foraging area) would also be expected to meet the D1 aggregation requirement because it includes the colony or rookery as well as staging or foraging aggregation areas. For some species, a separate foraging area might meet the aggregation requirement in its own right \u2014 for example, the highly social Guanay Cormorant (Leucocarbo bougainvilliorum) forages in large dense foraging flocks, especially at locations where oceanographic processes predictably concentrate prey near the surface. A site that predictably holds dense foraging flocks would meet the aggregation requirement and qualify under D1a if the population-size threshold is also met. In contrast, a separate foraging area would not meet the D1 aggregation requirement if the species does not predictably form dense foraging flocks at the site, even if the species aggregates elsewhere in its range in the same season (e.g., many gadfly petrel species, genus Pterodroma). How are migratory stop-over or bottleneck sites identified? Along migration routes, KBAs should be identified at key stop-over or bottleneck sites, as stated in the KBA Standard (IUCN, 2016, p. 22), rather than over entire migration corridors. Distinguishing stop-over or bottleneck sites may be challenging, especially for species that do not fly. Individuals are expected to accumulate as the movement process slows, so stop-over and bottleneck sites may be distinguished using survey data by higher than average densities along a migration corridor. In animal tracking datasets, stop-over sites may be identified by a switch from fast directed movements to slower more tortuous movements. Can Criterion D1 be applied to resident species or populations? The KBA Standard states that \u201cCriterion D1 is not meant to identify sites that hold all key stages of a species\u2019 life-cycle; those sites may be triggered by criteria A1, B1, B2 or B3.\u201d Thus, Criterion D1 is not generally intended to apply to resident species or the resident components of partially migratory species, where they can be discerned, although it may be triggered by resident species that aggregate in specific areas within their range for specific life-cycle processes (e.g., at lekking areas or in spawning areas). Can KBA Criterion D1 be applied to aggregations of juveniles or other life stages? KBA Criterion D1 cannot be triggered by aggregations of juveniles or other life stages as the threshold is defined in terms of mature individuals only. 2.8.2 Check the relevant subcriterion and threshold for each potential trigger species. A site qualifies as a KBA under Criterion D1 because it predictably holds one or more of the following: Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 43 a) An aggregation representing \u22651% of the global population size of a species, over a season, and during one or more key stages of its life cycle; b) A number of mature individuals that ranks the site among the largest 10 aggregations known for the species.

The term \u201clife-history stage\u201d here is intended to be synonymous with life-cycle process (e.g., breeding, feeding, migration) and does not refer to developmental stage (e.g., pup, juvenile, adult). What does \u201cover a season\u201d mean in the threshold for D1a? \u201cOver a season, and during one or more key stages of its life cycle\u201d refers to a specific period of the year when some or all members of a population predictably aggregate to perform some life-cycle process(es), such as breeding, moulting, or over-wintering. Under subcriterion D1a, the threshold population size may be met cumulatively \u201cover a season\u201d. This is especially relevant to stop-over or bottleneck sites along migration corridors \u2014 the threshold number of mature individuals may not occur at the site simultaneously; instead, the threshold may be met over a relatively short period of time during the migration season, in a relatively small space with individuals clustered together at highly localised relative abundance. When is subcriterion D1b applicable? Subcriterion D1b is only applicable if there are insufficient data to apply subcriterion D1a. For example, even if a site ranks among the largest 10 aggregations known for Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 44 the species, it cannot qualify under Criterion D if it is known to hold <1% of the global population size of the species. For a few species, it may be possible to infer that the D1b threshold is met, even if data are only available in terms of localities. For example, if mature individuals of a species is only known to aggregate at 10 or fewer localities throughout its range, then it can be inferred that these localities are among the largest 10 aggregations of the species in terms of mature individuals. Can subcriterion D1b be applied separately to aggregations for specific functions? The D1b threshold (i.e. the largest 10 aggregations known for the species) applies across all life-cycle processes rather than separately for specific processes (e.g., breeding or feeding). Thus, if a species forms aggregations at one time of year for breeding and aggregations at another time of year for feeding, only the ten largest aggregations across both seasons would qualify. 2.8.3 For D1, the only assessment parameter is number of mature individuals; estimate this parameter at the global and site level for all sites where the species may meet the relevant threshold. For Criterion D1, the proportion of the global population size at a site can be observed or inferred through the following: (i) number of mature individuals. Note that the proportion of the global population size predictably held at a site cannot be inferred using area-based parameters or localities under Criterion D1. For some species, however, numbers of individuals in large aggregations are extremely hard to estimate, but the densities of individuals in aggregations of the same type may be relatively consistent (e.g., some seabird species nest pecking-distance apart). In this case, the size (i.e. area or volume) of the aggregation may be used to infer whether a site ranks among the largest 10 aggregations known for the species under Criterion D1b. Individual mark-recapture data can be used to provide reliable estimates of population size at stop-over or bottleneck sites with high turnover (Ramsar, 2018). 2.8.4 Assess whether each potential trigger species meets the relevant threshold at each existing/potential site. For each potential trigger species under subcriterion D1a, KBA Proposers should calculate the proportion of the global population size that predictably occurs at each site based on the estimated global and site-level values for each assessment parameter, Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 45 and then compare that to the 1% population-size threshold for subcriterion D1a. This calculation will be checked in the WDKBA when it is fully functional.

Recruitment sources include sites where plants or fungi produce a large number of seeds or spores that have a high probability of dispersing, and germinating and surviving to maturity elsewhere; sites where adults deposit a large number of eggs that have a high probability of producing larvae that survive to maturity and disperse elsewhere; and nursery sites where large numbers of larvae settle and have a high probability of growing into juveniles that survive to maturity and disperse elsewhere. Relevant information will most likely be found through a literature search and/or expert knowledge. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 48 2.10.2 The D3 threshold is 10% for all species. A site qualifies as a KBA under Criterion D3 because it predictably produces propagules, larvae, or juveniles that maintain \u226510% of the global population size of a species. 2.10.3 For D3, the only assessment parameter is number of mature individuals; estimate this parameter at the global and site level for all sites where the contribution to recruitment may meet the 10% threshold. For Criterion D3, the proportion of the global population size can be observed or inferred through the following: (i) number of mature individuals. A significant proportion of the global population size of a species may be produced at sites identified under Criterion D3 even though there may be only a few mature individuals at the site at any given time. Hence, the threshold is based on the global population size of mature individuals produced by the site, rather than the number of immature individuals within the site. KBA Proposers should estimate the global population size and the number of mature individuals that are produced by each proposed site. Note that the proportion of the global population size produced by a site cannot be inferred using area-based parameters or localities under D3. How can the number of mature individuals produced by a site be estimated? Estimating the proportion of the global population size of mature individuals that is produced by a site will often be challenging. For most species, it is not feasible to tag or track propagules, larvae, or juveniles from recruitment to maturity. Exceptions may include anadromous fish species with high site-fidelity (e.g., salmon), or species that produce large juveniles (e.g., sharks and rays). For some species (e.g., corals), genetic markers have been used to identify recruitment sources. Recruitment models that include the transport or dispersal of propagules, larvae, or juveniles from recruitment sources to final settlement sites have also been developed for some species (e.g., fungi, plants, corals, benthic invertebrates), but are often complex and difficult to validate. Identification of recruitment sources may therefore be based on the simplifying assumption that survival from proposed recruitment source habitat to maturity is uniform, unless reliable data or models are available to quantify an alternative distribution. Hence, in most cases, it will be sufficient to estimate the relative density Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 49 of propagules, larvae, juveniles and use this information to identify recruitment sources that produce \u226510% of propagules, larvae, or juveniles, under the assumption that these recruitment sources also produce \u226510% of mature individuals. This can be achieved through direct sampling throughout the range or, more likely, a combination of sampling and spatial density modelling (see Appendix III). What is meant by \u201cpredictably produces\u201d? For Criterion D3, a site predictably produces propagules, larvae, or juveniles that maintain \u226510% of the global population size of a species if it produces them in at least two thirds of the recruitment cycles for which adequate data are available; the total number of recruitment cycles considered should not be fewer than three. 2.10.4 For each potential trigger species, assess whether the contribution to recruitment meets the 10% threshold at each existing/potential site. For each potential trigger species under Criterion D3, KBA Proposers should calculate the proportion of the global population size that is predictably produced by each site based on the estimated global and site-level values for each assessment parameter, and then compare that to the 10% population-size threshold for Criterion D3.

Assessment parameters for species-based criteria (A1, B1-3, D1-3 and E) 3.1 Selecting assessment parameters Which assessment parameters provide the best indication of the proportion of the global population size at a site? Under KBA Criteria A1, B1-2 and B3a, the proportion of the global population size at a site can be observed or inferred through any of the following: (i) number of mature individuals, (ii) area of occupancy, (iii) extent of suitable habitat, (iv) range, (v) number of localities, (vi) distinct genetic diversity (except for Criterion B3a). KBA NCGs and KBA Proposers are responsible for ensuring that KBA identification is based on the best available data for each species. The rest of this section provides an overview of what is meant by \u201cbest\u201d and \u201cavailable\u201d in this context. In brief, the \u201cbest\u201d parameter provides a measure of the proportion of the global population size at a site that is most appropriate to the ecology of the species; while an \u201cavailable\u201d parameter has already been estimated (or can be estimated) consistently at both global and site levels, is complete, recent, reliable and documented. (Distinct genetic diversity measures the proportion of genetic diversity rather than the proportion of global population size at a site and is excluded from this overview.) In principle, the number of mature individuals provides the best (most direct) measure of the proportion of the global population size at a site (Fig. 3.1.1). However, in some species, the number of mature individuals fluctuates significantly among years or within seasons at the global and/or site scale, such that the proportion of mature individuals held at the site often switches above-and-below the threshold from one year to the next. In that context, one or more of the area-based assessment parameters or localities (i.e. ii-iv) may provide a better (less direct but more stable) indicator of the proportion of the global population size regularly held at a site. Mature individuals may still be used to assess the proportion of the global population size predictably held at a site based on the two-thirds rule (see 9.3.2 on dealing with ecological variation). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 51 Area-based assessment parameters should be used cautiously, as species are generally unevenly distributed across their range, ESH or even AOO. Estimating numbers of mature individuals should be prioritised for species that occur at highly variable densities within their range, ESH or AOO, or that are unevenly distributed among localities. Area-based assessment parameters and localities should not be used for species on migration or moving nomadically or for species with dynamic habitat and consequently distribution patterns that fluctuate significantly among years or within seasons, or for sites that are primarily used during migration or by nomadic populations (Fig. 3.1.1). Species that exhibit significant fluctuations in both population size and distribution may depend primarily on conservation actions at the landscape or seascape scale rather than the site scale of KBAs.

An overview of area-based parameters and localities is provided in Section 3.4.

Source: Compiled by the KBA SAC. For most species, high quality data will only be available for one or two assessment parameters. For each species, the same assessment parameter must be used at the global and site levels, and estimation methods should be the same, or as consistent as possible, to ensure that population-size estimates at the global and site levels are directly Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 53 comparable and enable calculation of the proportion of the global population size held at the site (see Section 9.3 for further details). Global estimates of assessment parameters must be based on the entire range10. For example, if estimates of numbers of mature individuals are only available for part of the range, KBA Proposers should consider alternative assessment parameters for estimating the proportion of the global population size at a site. Using numbers of mature individuals from just a subset of known localities as a conservative estimate of the global population size would be equivalent to reducing the thresholds in the KBA Standard. Estimates of abundance and distribution are likely to become less accurate over time. Assessment parameters based on data collected more than 8-12 years before the assessment should be used cautiously and only if available data indicate that there have not been significant changes in global or site-level population size or distribution patterns (see also Section 9.2.1). How reliability is judged varies by parameter, but all assessment parameters should be based on an adequate representative sampling strategy; methods for estimating the number of mature individuals need to be appropriate for the species; range maps should follow the IUCN Red List Mapping Standards (see also Appendix III.1); ESH and AOO should be validated (see Appendix III); and species identification and geographical coordinates need to be accurately recorded for localities. For documentation requirements, please see Section 3.1 for number of mature individuals and Sections 3.5-8 for area-based assessment parameters and localities. Selecting the best available assessment parameter will often be a matter of compromise; it is better to use an assessment parameter for which there are recent reliable estimates at both global and site levels than one for which the site estimate is recent and reliable and the global estimate is old or unreliable, or vice versa. KBA Proposers are asked to provide a brief explanation for their choice of best assessment parameter for each species from available options when submitting a KBA proposal. 10 Only populations considered \u201cwild\u201d should be included in estimates of assessment parameters (see Section 2.2.4). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 54 What happens if different assessment parameters point to different conclusions? Where different assessment parameters point to different conclusions, KBA Proposers should use the best available data and justify that choice. The better the data available on a population\u2019s distribution, the more likely it is that a site that actually qualifies as a KBA will meet the thresholds. What if assessment parameters derived from the IUCN Red List account need updating? For species that have been assessed for the IUCN Red List, estimates of the global number of mature individuals, range and AOO provided in the IUCN Red List account will be pre-filled in the WDKBA when it is fully functional. If any estimates of the global number of mature individuals, range or AOO provided in a species\u2019 IUCN Red List account need updating to support KBA identification, KBA Proposers should consult with their KBA RFP who will liaise with the IUCN SSC Red List Unit. The IUCN Red List Unit will know which IUCN SSC Red List Authorities are responsible for overseeing assessments of the species and can determine whether the existing IUCN Red List assessment can be corrected or a reassessment is required. The best solution will be for the IUCN Red List account to be updated first, before the KBA proposal is submitted. If this is unlikely to happen within the next year, a new estimate of the global number of mature individuals, range or AOO may be used, but must be approved by the relevant IUCN SSC Red List Authorities before the KBA proposal is submitted. Documentation of this approval must be provided with the proposal. Can the proportion of the global population size at a site be rounded up? No \u2013 estimates of the proportion of the global population size at a site should not be rounded up, as that would have the effect of reducing the threshold.

What if a relevant assessment parameter is not provided in the IUCN Red List account? KBA Proposers should also consult with their KBA RFP who will liaise with the IUCN Red List Unit before submitting KBA proposals based on new estimates of global population size, range or AOO for species with an IUCN Red List account, even if there is no existing estimate in the account. In a few cases, a new parameter estimate will have implications for the current IUCN Red List status assessment. In such cases, IUCN SSC Red List Authority approval is encouraged but not required. What if the number of mature individuals (or other assessment parameter) is known to be increasing or decreasing significantly over time at the global or site level? KBAs should be identified on the basis of the current presence of biodiversity elements, according to the KBA Standard (IUCN, 2016). If the number of mature individuals, range, ESH, AOO or number of localities is known to be increasing or decreasing at significantly different rates at the global or site level, then past data on population size should be projected forward to the current time to estimate the proportion of the global population size currently found at the site. This is especially important if these data were collected more than 8-12 years before the assessment (see Section 9.2.1). Does the same parameter need to be used for all species at a proposed site? When determining either the proportion of the global population size at the site, KBA Proposers should use the assessment parameter that provides the best available data for each individual species. In the case of multi-species criteria (i.e. B2, B3), it is not necessary to use the same assessment parameter for all species in an assemblage. 3.2 Number of mature individuals (Criteria A1, B1-3, D1-3, E) For Criteria A1, B1-3 and D1-3 the proportion of the global population size can be observed or inferred through any of the following: (i) number of mature individuals. For Criterion E, targets may be set in terms of numbers of mature individuals. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 56 Why focus on mature individuals? The global population size and population size at a site are both measured in terms of mature individuals because this can be measured more consistently across species than the total number of individuals, given the wide variation in life history strategies and life forms. Whenever number of mature individuals is used as the assessment parameter, the global and site-level population-size estimates submitted to the WDKBA must be provided in terms of mature individuals, even if the data used to construct these estimates were derived from a subset of mature individuals or some other index. This is the best way to ensure that population-size estimates for each species are consistent across the WDKBA and with the IUCN Red List. It also facilitates the review and confirmation process. How are mature individuals defined? The definition of mature individuals in the KBA Standard (IUCN, 2016) is the same as the definition used by the IUCN Red List: \u201cThe number of individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction as defined in IUCN (2012a).\u201d For species that have been assessed for the IUCN Red List, KBA Proposers should use the definition of mature individuals in the IUCN Red List assessment. For species from taxonomic groups that have not yet been assessed for the IUCN Red List (or for which the above information is unavailable), KBA Proposers should follow the detailed guidance on defining mature individuals in the IUCN Red List Guidelines (IUCN SPC, 2022).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e41cd8b-85bb-44a1-9a57-427e347b982f": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e41cd8b-85bb-44a1-9a57-427e347b982f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Morocco - Pocket identification guide of main vulnerable species incidentally caught in Moroccan fisheries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "449f0927792bcec2d6dc8581db985df142a107e45cc497ff13275acae845c212"}, "2": {"node_id": "cb3f8100-5ab3-476e-b29a-f84f77c9c18a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3f06e9e2b6a2e10eefc69d707c8412d7b10282bcff792da20a23639c7a5a315f"}}, "hash": "3802eaf4ba848bd256bbe3343e1c2d76baeb4d8bbb0715cbb71c3c2bed179638", "text": "The guidance below is derived from the IUCN Red List Guidelines (IUCN SPC, 2022, Section 4.3).

Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 57 \u25cf In the case of taxa that naturally lose all or a subset of mature breeding individuals at some point in their life cycle, the estimate should be made at the appropriate time, when mature individuals are available for breeding. \u25cf Reintroduced individuals must have produced viable offspring before they are included in counts of mature individuals (IUCN, 2012a). What if the ratio of mature individuals to population counts varies spatially? For some species, the number of mature individuals may be estimated based on population counts or some other index that is easier to count reliably than mature individuals. The proportion of all individuals at a site should provide a reasonable approximation of the proportion of mature individuals at a site if the mature/immature ratio is similar at global and site levels. For example, if the mature/immature ratio is 50/50 at both global and site levels, a site that holds 10% of global population size of all individuals would be expected to hold 10% of the global population size of mature individuals. In contrast, if the species distribution is characterised by spatial segregation of life stages (e.g., juveniles vs mature individuals) or the mature/immature ratio is known to differ at global and site levels, then KBA Proposers should account for this information. Likewise, if the ratio of some other population index that is easier to count reliably (e.g., nests, pups, breeding pairs) to mature individuals is similar at global and site levels, then the relative value of the index at global and site levels should provide a reasonable approximation of the proportion of mature individuals at a site. For example, if the estimated global population size is 10,000 mature individuals, but approximately 25% of mature individuals skip breeding each year throughout the range (i.e. the annual breeding population size is 7,500 mature individuals or 3,750 breeding pairs), then a colony with more than 375 breeding pairs would meet the 10% threshold under Criterion B1. What if the sex ratio is imbalanced? If the sex ratio is imbalanced but similar at global and site levels, then KBA Proposers may use mature individuals of either or both sexes as the basis for estimating the proportion of the global population size at a site. However, if the sex ratio is imbalanced and known to differ at global and site levels, then KBA Proposers should focus on the limiting sex and use a ratio-based approach when estimating population size at both global and site levels. For species in which females bear and raise young, the limiting sex will generally be females, unless males Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 58 are severely under-represented. For example, if females are the limiting sex for a species, breeding sites that regularly hold >10% of the global population size of mature females would qualify under Criterion B1, even if few mature males are present. (Marine turtles provide a relevant example here.) Where can KBA Proposers find global population-size estimates for species that have been assessed for the IUCN Red List? For species that have been assessed on the IUCN Red List, KBA Proposers seeking to use mature individuals as an assessment parameter must use the global number of mature individuals in the IUCN Red List account, if provided, unless there are clear and compelling reasons for using a different estimate (see below). This estimate will be pre-filled in the WDKBA when it is fully functional. If no global estimate is pre- filled in the WDKBA, KBA Proposers should check the Justification and Population sections of the IUCN Red List account, as information may be provided there. For some species, the IUCN Red List account only provides a rough estimate of population size. In such cases, KBA Proposers may use a more precise population-size estimate, with supporting data, as long as that estimate is consistent with the IUCN Red List account and does not point to a change to the species\u2019 IUCN Red List category.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0274d2ba-a425-4d9b-938b-c702a79279ca": {"__data__": {"id_": "0274d2ba-a425-4d9b-938b-c702a79279ca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Morocco - Pocket identification guide of main vulnerable species incidentally caught in Moroccan fisheries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d3b47834a8180413ac262523d6efc7fbd0981536b48423ad83138d7814b6a3aa"}, "2": {"node_id": "070fd9c5-6834-463b-aa92-c5686b7e8c03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c46ac526392542bf4b70ac51c5534bd0f13bb68e85486891a66c5ebc385553c8"}}, "hash": "bbe6aa2c4b8fa1b535b389e81cd5601abb1e7d1f510ba0d4ab7703fc91af88bc", "text": "(For example, if the IUCN Red List account provides an estimate of greater than 2,500 mature individuals, a KBA proposal based on a global", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d6181a1a-21f2-454a-999b-bb831d0357ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "d6181a1a-21f2-454a-999b-bb831d0357ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Morocco - Pocket identification guide of main vulnerable species incidentally caught in Moroccan fisheries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "92efda4ef2779575c684bb70990454fc79d367e0e518dc57dbcbd93c93d31614"}, "3": {"node_id": "af753b4d-9bb4-4b73-86ce-1d990bf32590", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "80d10b4a7c72ba0330793d0cdde04bff2db53fa908364aeee172419d77d5756a"}}, "hash": "75af0adfd220a7fb05bacf2481c40ad927fcb51f02f56772ce758597eed6ea66", "text": "population-size estimate of 3,000 mature individuals would be consistent with this, but not one based on 2,000 mature individuals.) Information on global population size is not available for all species assessed for the IUCN Red List. The following reasons for using a different estimate of global population size may be considered clear and compelling: i. The IUCN Red List account is flagged as \u201cneeds updating\u201d; ii. New data are available showing that the global population-size estimate has changed significantly since the most recent IUCN Red List assessment; iii. The IUCN Red List account gives an estimate that it acknowledges is not the estimate of the total global population size but only partial and data now exist to estimate the global population size. The best solution in each case is for the IUCN Red List account to be updated first, before the KBA proposal is submitted. If this is unlikely to happen within the next year, a new global population-size estimate may be used, but must be approved by the relevant IUCN SSC Red List Authority before the KBA proposal is submitted (see Section 3.1). Documentation of this approval must be provided with the proposal. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 59 Ideally, the new global population-size estimate will be published in a peer-reviewed journal article or report that can be cited. If not, the details of how the global population-size estimate was derived must be described in documentation submitted to the IUCN SSC Red List Authority. Where can KBA Proposers find existing global population-size estimates for species that have not been assessed for the IUCN Red List? If an estimate of the global number of mature individuals has previously been confirmed for the species, this estimate will be pre-filled in the WDKBA when it is fully functional. In the meantime, KBA Proposers seeking to use mature individuals as an assessment parameter should check whether the species has already been confirmed as a trigger species in the WDKBA and use the same global estimate unless new data are available showing that this has changed significantly. If a global estimate of the number of mature individuals has not previously been confirmed for the species, possible sources of information on the global number of mature individuals include IUCN Red List Authorities, NatureServe Explorer, national authorities, and the scientific literature. How can KBA Proposers estimate the number of mature individuals at the global or site level? A complete count of all mature individuals in the global population is only possible for very few species. A wide range of valid methods for estimating population size is available for other species. A population index is also acceptable (e.g., number of breeding pairs), as long as the relationship between the index and the actual number of mature individuals is expected to be similar at global and site scales. It is beyond the scope of the KBA Guidelines to provide detailed guidance on how to estimate the number of mature individuals at the global or site level, given the wide range of valid methods available. However, the following principles apply: i. For each species, the method used to determine the number of mature individuals should be scientifically valid and appropriate for the species (i.e. should be acceptable for publication in the peer-reviewed literature). ii. For some species, the number of mature individuals may be estimated based on some proxy that is easier to count reliably (e.g., nests or chicks for some birds; pups for some seals). iii. In many cases, estimates of population size will be based on sampling, such as counts of the number of individuals in representative samples of the habitat (e.g., point counts, transects quadrats); estimates of the number of individuals in Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 60 representative samples of the habitat using distance sampling (Buckland et al. 2001), individual mark-recapture (Amstrup et al., 2010), or other methods that account for imperfect detection; or methods based on indirect indicators of abundance, such as scat or footprint surveys (e.g., Jachmann, 2012). iv.

For each species that has not been assessed for the IUCN Red List or for which the IUCN Red List account does not quantify mature individuals, information on how the global number of mature individuals was estimated should be documented in the KBA proposal. Should KBA Proposers use the lowest plausible estimate of the global population size as a precautionary approach? No. A precautionary approach is built into the thresholds provided in the KBA Standard. Using the lowest plausible estimate rather than the best estimate of the global population size would be equivalent to reducing the thresholds in the KBA Standard. (See also Section 9.3 on uncertainty.) What if the number of mature individuals at the global or site level is characterised by significant fluctuations or uncertainty? See Section 3.1 on selecting assessment parameters and Section 9.3 on uncertainty (including ecological variation). Note that the recommendation in the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN, 2012a) to use a lower population size estimate (often much less than the mean) for species with fluctuating population size, is not appropriate in the context of KBA assessment. Should number of mature individuals be used as the assessment parameter for species listed as CR (PE) or CR (PEW)? For some species listed as , the IUCN Red List account gives the global number of mature individuals as 0-49 (e.g., Bob\u2019s Robber Frog, Craugastor punctariolus, CR (PE)). Number of mature individuals should not be used as the assessment parameter in this Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 61 situation, as it will not be possible to provide a reliable estimate of the number of mature individuals at the site level. Area-based assessment parameters or number of localities should be used instead. 3.3 Reproductive units (Criteria A1, B1, B3, E) Why are reproductive units included in the thresholds for some species-based criteria? Reproductive units are included in the thresholds for some species-based criteria because the intent of the KBA Standard is to identify sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity. The reproductive-units thresholds are intended to prevent identification of KBAs where the species occurs in very low numbers and the population is unlikely to maintain itself beyond the current generation. (Note that this is not the same as having a minimum viable population.) The reproductive-units threshold is especially important where population size is inferred through area-based assessment parameters because it provides confirmation of the species\u2019 presence at the site and reduces the risk of including vagrant records. How are reproductive units defined? The KBA Standard defines reproductive units as: \u201cThe minimum number and combination of mature individuals necessary to trigger a successful reproductive event at a site (Eisenberg, 1977).

However, evidence of successful reproduction is not generally required. Are counts of reproductive units required? No. KBA Proposers are required to confirm that the relevant reproductive-units threshold is met (e.g., the number of reproductive units is at least 5 or at least 10 depending on the subcriterion), but are not required to provide counts of reproductive units beyond that. If actual counts are readily available, KBA Proposers can choose to provide this information as it may be useful for KBA monitoring. What if males and females cannot be readily distinguished? For species in which males and females cannot be readily distinguished, the reproductive-units threshold should be translated into the equivalent number of mature individuals (e.g., if 10 reproductive units = 10 pairs, this is equivalent to 20 mature individuals). However, if there is evidence of a severely imbalanced sex ratio, KBA Proposers should increase efforts to assess whether the minimum number of reproductive units does indeed occur at the site. 11 Exceptions may be made for extensive clonal colonies with a high probability of individual persistence (e.g., a clonal colony of Quaking Aspen (Populus tremuloides) in Fishlake National Forest (Utah, USA) occupies nearly 50 hectares and is estimated to be several thousand years old). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 63 What about sites outside the breeding range? \u201cBreeding\u201d here refers to mating and other processes that require reproductive units, such as incubation and chick-rearing in many bird species. For sites where breeding does not occur (e.g., sites outside the breeding range), the reproductive-units threshold should be translated into the equivalent number of mature individuals (e.g., if 10 reproductive units = 10 pairs, this is equivalent to 20 mature individuals; for sexually segregated species, this may be 20 mature females or 20 mature males). Densities do not need to be sufficient to enable reproduction at sites where breeding does not occur. How is the reproductive-units threshold applied to species listed as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) or Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct in the Wild)? See Section 2.4.1. What about species-based criteria that do not have reproductive units included in the threshold? Some species-based criteria (i.e. A1e, B2, B3a, B3c, D1-D3) do not include a reproductive-units threshold. For non-threatened species, it is very likely that a site that meets the population-size threshold would hold at least 10 reproductive units. Nevertheless, KBA Proposers must still confirm the regular or predictable presence of each trigger species at sites proposed under these criteria (see Section 9.2.3), except for species listed as CR (PE) or CR (PEW) on the IUCN Red List. In sites where breeding occurs, numbers and densities should be sufficient to support successful reproduction and KBA Proposers are encouraged to confirm presence in terms of reproductive units if possible (e.g., at least 10 reproductive units). This information may prove useful if additional criteria are considered in the future. It was not the intent of the KBA Standard that these criteria provide an easier alternative to Criteria A1 and B1 for safeguarding globally threatened or individual geographically restricted species. What types of evidence can be used to assess whether the reproductive units threshold is met? See Section 9.2.3.

Source: Compiled by the KBA SAC. Can area-based assessment parameters be applied to species with spatially dynamic habitats? For species with spatially dynamic habitats, including many pelagic marine species, AOO and ESH are seasonally and interannually variable at both global and site levels. AOO and ESH will not generally provide a stable and reliable basis for inference about the proportion of the global population size at a site in this context, and should not be used. How can area-based assessment parameters be applied to migratory species? For migratory species, estimates of known localities, AOO, ESH, or range at the global and site levels must be calculated separately for each season, such that percentages of the global population size in the site can be inferred for the relevant season. For example, a species will trigger a KBA if the ESH in its breeding range at the site exceeds the threshold percentage of the global ESH in its breeding range. Area-based parameters (i.e. range, ESH, AOO) and localities do not provide a good proxy for the population distribution of species when on migration (e.g., at bottleneck and stop-over sites), so should not be used as the basis for identifying KBAs during this life-cycle process. The proportion of the global population size held at a site cannot be inferred using area-based parameters or localities under Criterion D1. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 66 How is the proportion of the global population size at a site estimated using area-based assessment parameters? When calculating area at the global or site scale, range, ESH or AOO maps should be projected into the World Cylindrical Equal Area projection (specifically \u201c+proj=cea +lat_ts=0 +lon_0=0 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs\u201d) in a GIS package. This projected coordinate reference system can be referenced by the code \u201cESRI: 54034\u201d in QGIS and \u201cWorld_Cylindrical_Equal_Area\u201d in ArcGIS. Area should be reported in km2. (Note that the IUCN Red List range polygons come with an area calculation but KBA Proposers should recalculate area using the standard projection and km2.) 3.5 Range (Criteria A1, B1-3, E) How is range defined? The KBA Standard (IUCN, 2016) defines range as: \u201cThe current known limits of distribution of a species, accounting for all known, inferred or projected sites of occurrence (IUCN, 2012a), including conservation translocations outside native habitat (IUCN SPSC, 2014)12 but not including vagrancies (species recorded once or sporadically but known not to be native to the area)\u201d (Fig. 3.5). (See Section 9.2.2 for definitions of known, inferred and projected occurrences.) For the purposes of KBA identification, range should not include areas where the species no longer exists (i.e. range refers to the current distribution, rather than the historic distribution; IUCN, 2016), or where the species has been introduced (except for conservation translocations).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29784405-4634-4d2e-bea1-f32be0d8fa0a": {"__data__": {"id_": "29784405-4634-4d2e-bea1-f32be0d8fa0a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Morocco - Pocket identification guide of main vulnerable species incidentally caught in Moroccan fisheries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "27a89d139bc5ffb26a13ca29b06bf917159380bd468c8b33016e6b77228226e3"}, "2": {"node_id": "1abbc03f-bf5b-4dbd-87af-67241ab4c50b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "607ddcc28534b568ef18511eae5f5a6c2f65246d477d687efa4037cf1dbeeaab"}}, "hash": "4ff250c6a1a0a95d92683282c48276aab18cebb1219ee8e95683acb9f4f169ae", "text": "This definition is consistent with the use of \u201crange\u201d in IUCN Red List assessments, and is represented by IUCN Red List range map polygons coded as extant and native/reintroduced/assisted colonisation. 12 Note that IUCN SPSC (2014) has been updated to IUCN SPS (2019).

For all species with range maps on the IUCN Red List, total range area (for resident species) and breeding and non-breeding ranges (for migratory species with distinct breeding and non-breeding ranges) will be calculated by the KBA Secretariat. This information will be used to pre-fill global range areas in the WDKBA when it is fully functional. In the meantime, KBA Proposers should download range polygons from the IUCN Red List account and follow the guidelines in Appendix III to estimate the range area at global and site levels. 13 Note that \u201crange\u201d differs from EOO, which is calculated as the minimum convex polygon around all known, inferred or projected sites of occurrence. EOO is used in IUCN Red List assessments as a measure of the spatial spread of risk. It may include large areas that are unsuitable (including marine areas in the case of terrestrial species and vice versa), and is not used in KBA identification. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 68 If there is no range map or the range map in the IUCN Red List account needs updating, KBA Proposers should follow the IUCN Red List Mapping Standards to develop a new distribution map for estimating range (see also Appendix III). The resulting range map should be submitted to the relevant IUCN SSC Red List Authority. If there is an existing range map in the IUCN Red List account, the relevant IUCN SSC Red List Authority must approve any updates before a KBA can be proposed that is inconsistent with the existing range map for the proposed trigger species and before range can be used as the assessment parameter. Documentation of this approval should be provided with the KBA proposal. If there is no existing range map, prior approval by the IUCN SSC Red List Authority is encouraged but not required. For taxonomic groups with no IUCN SSC Red List Authority or if the relevant IUCN SSC Red List Authority is unable to review the new range map in a reasonable timeframe, the KBA Proposer should submit the new range map to their KBA RFP for expert review and approval. Following review and approval, the range map will be available for use in future KBA proposals. Where can KBA Proposers find data on range for species without an IUCN Red List account? If the range has previously been confirmed for the species, the global range estimate will be pre-filled in the WDKBA when it is fully functional. In the meantime, KBA Proposers seeking to use range as an assessment parameter should check whether the species has already been confirmed as a trigger species in the WDKBA and use the same global estimate and range map unless new data are available showing that these have changed significantly. For species without an IUCN Red List account, confirmed range maps can be obtained from the KBA Secretariat. If the range has not previously been confirmed for the species or the range map needs updating, KBA Proposers seeking to use range as an assessment parameter should follow the IUCN Red List Mapping Standards to develop a new distribution map for estimating range (see also Appendix III). The resulting range map should be flagged for expert review when the KBA proposal is submitted to the WDKBA. Following review, the range map will be available for use in future KBA proposals. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 69 When is it important to use consistent range maps for entire taxonomic groups? Consistent range maps are important for identifying restricted-range species within a taxonomic group for Criterion B2. Consistent range maps are also important as a basis for estimating the median range size for a taxonomic group for Criterion B3 (see Section 2.7.1). However, the median range size can be estimated from a representative sample of species, so data on range are not required for the entire taxonomic group. When determining either the proportion of the global population size at the site, or whether a species is restricted to an ecoregion or bioregion, KBA Proposers should use the best available data for each individual species (see Section 3.1 on selecting assessment parameters).

For species that have distinct breeding and non-breeding ranges identified in IUCN Red List assessment maps, breeding and non-breeding ranges will typically be assessed separately. (Please see Appendix III for details.) What if the range map is a standardised buffer In general, if the IUCN Red List range map is a standardised buffer around a single known locality, it makes sense to delineate a more realistic KBA boundary. If new information on the species\u2019 distribution is uncovered during this process, that information should be fed back to the IUCN Red List assessors so that the range map can be updated. In the meantime, number of localities can be used as the assessment parameter. When is it inappropriate to use range? If a species\u2019 range is poorly defined, localities may provide better information on the distribution of the global population size, especially if the species distribution is highly localised. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 70 For species whose range is well defined but that occur patchily within their range, ESH or AOO may provide better information on the distribution of the global population size. 3.6 Extent of suitable habitat (ESH, Criteria A1, B1-3) How is ESH defined? The KBA Standard (IUCN 2016) defines ESH as: \u201cThe area of potentially suitable ecological conditions, such as vegetation or substrate types within the altitudinal or depth, and temperature and moisture preferences, for a given species (Beresford et al., 2011)\u201d (Fig. 3.6). Figure 3.6 Schematic demonstrating extent of suitable habitat (ESH) for a hypothetical species. Source: Compiled by the KBA SAC. ESH refers to the extent of habitat available to a species within its range and cannot extend beyond the range (Fig. 3.6). ESH is a refinement of range \u2014 for example, a range polygon may be clipped to exclude areas that do not contain habitat, or the range may be converted into grid cells and cells that do not contain habitat may be removed. For some species, range and ESH may be similar. ESH may encompass a much larger area than AOO as ESH may include unoccupied habitat within the species\u2019 range. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 71 ESH is broadly defined to include habitat maps based primarily on expert knowledge (deductive models) or statistical analysis (inductive models). ESH thus includes both the concept of \u201carea of habitat\u201d (AOH), which focuses on deductive models (Brooks et al., 2019), and output from statistical habitat models (see Appendix III.2 for further discussion). Where can KBA Proposers find data on ESH? Validated ESH maps are available for mammals and birds and will be provided through the IUCN Red List (spatial downloads page). Validated ESH maps for other taxonomic groups will also be provided when available. If a validated ESH map exists for the species, the global ESH estimate will be pre-filled in the WDKBA when it is fully functional. In the meantime, KBA Proposers seeking to use ESH as an assessment parameter should check whether the species has already been confirmed as a trigger species in the WDKBA and use the same global estimate and ESH map unless new data are available showing that these have changed significantly. If there is no validated ESH map or there is scope for improving the existing ESH map, KBA Proposers seeking to use ESH as an assessment parameter should follow the guidance in Appendix III.2 to develop an ESH map. ESH maps may be based primarily on expert knowledge or statistical habitat models and should be validated using independent occurrence data for the species before they are used in KBA assessment. The resulting ESH map should be flagged for expert review when the KBA proposal is submitted to the WDKBA. Following review, the ESH map will be available for use in future KBA proposals. When is it inappropriate to use ESH? If a species\u2019 habitat is poorly defined, range may provide better information on the distribution of the global population size.

The IUCN Red List Guidelines (IUCN SPC, 2022) strongly recommend a reference resolution of 2 x 2 km for all species when measuring AOO, and this is also recommended for KBA assessments. Figure 3.7 Schematic demonstrating area of occupancy (AOO) for a hypothetical species. Source: Compiled by the KBA SAC. For many species, AOO may be characterised as a refinement of range and ESH and range. However, for some species (e.g., some invertebrates), habitat may occur at much finer scales than the standard 2 x 2 km used for AOO, and ESH may be less than AOO. Where can KBA Proposers find data on AOO? For species that have been assessed for the IUCN Red List, AOO may have been defined, and possibly mapped, already. If a validated AOO map exists for the species, the global AOO estimate will be pre-filled in the WDKBA when it is fully functional. In the meantime, KBA Proposers seeking to use AOO as an assessment parameter should check whether the species has already been confirmed as a trigger species in the WDKBA and use the same global estimate and AOO map unless new data are available showing that these have changed significantly. Validated AOO maps can be obtained from the KBA Secretariat.

If the IUCN Red List account gives an estimate for AOO, but does not provide an AOO map, KBA Proposers seeking to use AOO as an assessment parameter are encouraged to liaise with the IUCN Red List assessment authors to obtain or develop an AOO map. If there is no validated AOO map or the AOO map needs updating, KBA Proposers should follow the IUCN Red List Mapping Standards for mapping AOO (see also Appendix III). The resulting AOO map should be flagged for expert review when the KBA proposal is submitted to the WDKBA. Following review, the AOO map will be available for use in future KBA proposals. When is it inappropriate to use AOO? KBA Proposers should avoid using AOO when there is insufficient information to distinguish occupied and unoccupied habitat (see Appendix III). In this situation, ESH may provide better information on the distribution of the global population size, even if occupation of habitat is patchy. KBA Proposers should evaluate carefully whether AOO is the best assessment parameter when species are distributed on very fine scales, such that the standard 2 x 2 km is likely to significantly overestimate the area of occupied habitat. (For example, the patches of stony habitat occupied by the Crau Plain Grasshopper (Prionotropis rhodanica, CR) are much smaller than the standard 2 x 2 km grid.) AOO may still be used in this context, if it provides a good representation of the proportion of the global population size at a site. Alternatively, if most habitat is occupied and ESH provides a finer resolution, ESH may be selected over AOO. Number of localities may also be used, as long as each locality represents a discrete population (see Section 3.8). 3.8 Number of localities (Criteria A1, B1-3) How are localities defined and identified? The KBA Standard (IUCN, 2016) defines localities as follows: \u201cA sampling locality is a point indicated by specific coordinates of latitude and longitude. Note that the term \u2018locality\u2019, as defined here, is fundamentally and conceptually different from the term \u2018location\u2019 used in the IUCN Red List (IUCN, 2012a).\u201d Known localities refer to known points of occurrence, and do not include inferred or projected occurrences. (See Section 9.2.2 for definitions of known, inferred and projected occurrences.) For the purposes of KBA identification, old records from areas where the species no longer occurs and vagrancies (i.e. records from areas where the Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 74 species has only been recorded once or sporadically and is known not to be native) are excluded from known localities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cf78c8c2-0e66-4964-aa68-900fe908e545": {"__data__": {"id_": "cf78c8c2-0e66-4964-aa68-900fe908e545", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Morocco - Pocket identification guide of main vulnerable species incidentally caught in Moroccan fisheries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "18c9998a5138096f9e2156ef45d6e9f117a0a8f69fabd30f59766502388e0b51"}, "2": {"node_id": "8e26f9ba-b8a4-433c-bb07-04a09da1cef0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1422e72c29074cedba5bac00f3ef5d7538b9ea86cb5fe1b5095b772652cf25a6"}}, "hash": "5b1b3633f139b8cc2e7d2f15ad5966bbb9c5ec0b70817ec6dec47cd6649ca48d", "text": "Each locality should represent a discrete population, to the extent this can be inferred, given the degree of habitat fragmentation and what is known about the dispersal capabilities of the species.

The term \u2018location\u2019 defines an area in which a single threatening event (e.g., a disease outbreak or hurricane) can rapidly affect all individuals of the species present. The scale of a \u2018location\u2019 thus depends on the area covered by the threatening event, which may be smaller than, similar to, or larger than a species\u2019 population (IUCN, 2012a). KBA Proposers should clarify whether each \u2018location\u2019 refers to a discrete population before using number of locations as a proxy for number of localities. Where can locality data be found? If a global estimate of number of localities has previously been confirmed for the species, it will be pre-filled in the WDKBA when it is fully functional. In the meantime, KBA Proposers seeking to use number of localities as an assessment parameter should check whether the species has already been confirmed as a trigger species in the WDKBA and use the same global estimate unless new data are available showing that this has changed significantly. If a global estimate of the number of localities has not previously been confirmed for the species (or the previous estimate needs updating), KBA Proposers seeking to use number of localities as an assessment parameter should check the data sources given below and compile locality data to estimate the global number of localities. Locality data should be checked by an appropriate species expert to ensure that the taxonomy is up-to-date and erroneous records are removed. Sources of locality data include museums, herbaria, GBIF and other citizen science platforms, Global Seabird Tracking Database, Ocean Biogeographic Information System and NatureServe\u2019s National Species Dataset (for the US and Canada). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 75 How are thresholds applied to locality data? Where the threshold is \u22651%, a site qualifies as a KBA if it represents one of 100 or fewer localities; where the threshold is \u226510%, a site qualifies as a KBA if it represents one of 10 or fewer localities. Localities may be weighted by estimated population size (e.g., based on the relative size of habitat patches) given that abundance may vary considerably across localities. When is it appropriate to use number of localities? Locality information is most useful for species that have a highly localised distribution and for which there is insufficient information to define and delineate range, ESH or AOO. Note that number of localities is based on known occurrences only, whereas as AOO is based on known, inferred and projected occurrences, so more information about factors underpinning distribution patterns is needed to map AOO, ESH or range than for estimating number of localities. When is it inappropriate to use number of localities? Where there are sufficient occurrences or the factors underpinning the species\u2019 distribution are known, KBA Proposers are encouraged to use AOO, ESH or range instead. In particular, where a cluster of occurrences that likely represents a single discrete population (i.e. locality) falls partly within and partly outside a site, KBA Proposers should use AOO or some other assessment parameter instead. Number of localities should not be used as the basis for KBA identification if sampling effort has been opportunistic or insufficient to assume that known localities represent the species\u2019 distribution (IUCN, 2016). The judgement that sampling effort has been adequate should be justified in the documentation. If sampling effort has been inadequate, additional survey work may be required before the species can trigger a KBA. 3.9 Relative density or abundance of mature individuals (Criterion B3) Under subcriterion B3c, \u201cmost important occupied habitat\u201d can be observed or inferred through the following assessment parameters: (i) density of mature individuals. (ii) relative abundance of mature individuals. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 76 When can relative density or abundance be used? The KBA Standard only specifies [relative] density or relative abundance of mature individuals as possible assessment parameters for subcriterion B3c. The relative density or abundance of mature individuals can also serve as a proxy for the number of mature individuals in cases where it is not possible to detect or count all individuals in a population (see Section 3.2).

In addition, sampling data for estimating relative density or abundance of mature individuals must be available at a wide range of localities encompassing most of the species\u2019 known range; any unsampled areas must be unlikely to hold relatively high densities. 3.10 Distinct genetic diversity (Criteria A1, B1-2) The inclusion of distinct genetic diversity as a metric under Criteria A1, B1 and B2 is intended to identify sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of genetic diversity. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 77 How is distinct genetic diversity defined? The KBA Standard defines distinct genetic diversity as follows: \u201cThe proportion of a species\u2019 genetic diversity that is encompassed by a particular site. It can be measured using Analysis of Molecular Variance [AMOVA] or similar technique that simultaneously captures diversity and distinctiveness (frequency of alleles and the genetic distinctiveness of those alleles).\u201d How is distinct genetic diversity used to identify sites under Criteria A1, B1 and B2? Distinct genetic diversity differs from the other assessment parameters in that it refers to the proportion and unique nature of a species\u2019 genetic diversity that is encompassed by a particular area. A site holding more than the threshold proportion of a species\u2019 global genetic diversity can qualify as a KBA, even if the proportion of the species\u2019 global population size at the site is insufficient to trigger a KBA. What measures can be used to assess the proportion of a species\u2019 distinct genetic diversity that is encompassed by a particular site? AMOVA can be used to estimate the proportion of distinct genetic diversity at a given site compared to a dataset representing a species\u2019 entire range. AMOVA allows a percentage of distinct genetic diversity to be ascribed to an entire dataset or to some partitioning of that dataset. Provided sufficient sampling has been carried out, a site\u2019s distinct genetic diversity can be measured with reference to a species\u2019 entire range by subtracting a site from the dataset and asking what proportion of the distinct genetic diversity is lost (e.g., Table 3.10). (Note that the percentage of distinct genetic diversity contributed by each of the remaining sites may change when one site is selected, depending on how each site complements the selected site.)

Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 78 Analysis of allele or haplotype frequencies alone provides information on the demographic distinctiveness of a population occupying a site. For the purposes of KBA identification, analysis of genetic markers should be modified to account for the evolutionary distinctiveness of the alleles in the analysis by incorporating a measure of genetic distance in the calculation (e.g., using DNA sequence dissimilarity). Using allele or haplotype frequencies alone, the analysis may simply detect the signature of recent demographic isolation (e.g., attributable to anthropogenic barriers to gene- flow), as opposed to long-term evolutionary distinctiveness (e.g., attributable to natural barriers such as rivers, mountain ranges, etc.), which are better incorporated by accounting for the evolutionary distinctiveness of the sequences studied. The increasing use of genomics in conservation biology can provide a framework for identifying the relative importance of evolutionary, demographic and local adaptive diversity in species occupying potential KBAs (see Funk et al., 2012).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a3fb79a0-5154-437f-9720-eeebbf8c3219": {"__data__": {"id_": "a3fb79a0-5154-437f-9720-eeebbf8c3219", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Morocco - Pocket identification guide of main vulnerable species incidentally caught in Moroccan fisheries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5143609a636f784cbfccb156d1d5609b22cc2fb3a447cbe785f1802c98410f6e"}, "2": {"node_id": "9f60b327-752a-444e-a841-4a42fb167912", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3f1fa1b975e5eff808949ba35d99f8e70c656f8333d3077592bc7e7bdaa27fb0"}}, "hash": "2fd79049789346e47eee0e808e2ca7523a4b074e9556ee6ba06b6eb5d753b96e", "text": "The analysis shown in Table 3.10 could be applied to genomic datasets with neutral (demographic) and selected (adaptive) markers, analysed both together (to obtain an estimate of genome-wide divergence) and separately (to obtain an estimate of demographic differentiation and signatures of local adaptation).

Where can KBA Proposers find data for analysing distinct genetic diversity? If distinct genetic diversity has previously been used as an assessment parameter for the species, this will be indicated in the WDKBA when it is fully functional. In the meantime, KBA Proposers seeking to use number of localities as an assessment parameter should check whether the species has already been confirmed as a trigger species in the WDKBA. Any new analysis should be contextualised in terms of this previous analysis, if new data are used or a different metric applied. In some cases the data required for analysing distinct genetic diversity will exist in the literature. This is most likely for species of conservation concern with restricted distribution, species with restricted genetic diversity, and species that are related to high value domesticated species (e.g., crop wild relatives). However, in most cases, new data will need to be collected, based on the sampling, genetic and data analysis requirements summarised above. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 79 Are there any specific requirements for genetic data used to estimate the proportion of distinct genetic diversity at a site? Genetic datasets should be evaluated for data quality and rigour before being used for KBA identification. Where possible, genetic data should be taken from recent peer-reviewed literature. Data should ideally comprise nuclear DNA (e.g., microsatellite markers, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), RAD-seq data or whole genome sequencing data) and, if appropriate, organelle DNA data (mitochondrial and chloroplast sequences). Analyses based on organelle DNA alone should be treated with caution as such studies only provide a partial genealogical history of the population(s) concerned. A robust sampling design is essential. If potentially important populations are not sampled, or sampling is uneven across the range, the results could be biased. Uncertainty can be reduced by increasing the number of independent genetic markers used and by ensuring that sufficient individuals have been sampled within each gene- pool. The balance between number of markers and number of individuals has long been debated (e.g., Beaumont & Nichols, 1996), but the general consensus is that, provided enough genomic data are sampled, no more than 15 unrelated individuals need be sampled within each gene-pool or potential KBA to capture most of the genealogical variance present. This has led to vigorous debate about how many genomic markers are needed. Traditional AMOVA has used mitochondrial DNA sequences, often alone. This is risky because mitochondrial DNA represents a single maternally inherited haplotype and hence variation within this sequence is inherently non-independent. For traditional genetic markers (e.g., microsatellites), reputable journals have long applied a minimum number of markers required for publication14. Nuclear DNA studies sampling very few genomic markers (e.g., <8 for microsatellites; <100 for SNPs) should also be treated with caution. This debate has been largely rendered moot by the arrival of genomic and reduced representation genomic tools such as Genotype By Sequencing, RAD-seq and whole genome resequencing, which yield thousands to millions of such markers. Thus, 14 This used to be eight markers for wild animal species, and 20 for domestic animal species. These thresholds were not applied to plants because of the difficulty in obtaining markers, or to certain recalcitrant animal groups (e.g., gastropods). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 80 genealogical sampling considerations are now simply a matter of acquiring a sufficient number of unrelated individuals per site. However, concerns about the number of genetic markers remain relevant when legacy datasets are being used, and the best approach will generally be to combine data from past and current studies. This can prove problematic if the sample sets are mutually exclusive, but triangulation methods can be used, even if just a few common samples are available (e.g., Carroll et al., 2018). In case of doubt, KBA Proposers are advised to consult with conservation genetics specialists (e.g., the IUCN SSC Conservation Genetics Specialist Group).

Identifying Key Biodiversity Areas using ecosystem-based criteria (A2, B4) This chapter provides detailed guidelines on applying the ecosystem-based criteria, A2 and B4. Criterion C is also based on ecosystems but is covered separately in Section 5 because the identification process differs substantially from that used for Criteria A2 and B4. 4.1 Overview KBA NCGs and KBA Proposers are encouraged to conduct a comprehensive scoping analysis (Steps 1-3 in Fig. 4.1) to identify all potential trigger ecosystem types and potential KBAs in the region of interest. Assessing sites against multiple criteria and biodiversity elements will strengthen the robustness of KBAs to changes in the status of particular trigger biodiversity elements. The step-by-step process shown below serves to structure the guidelines and should be read as indicative. In practice, the process of KBA identification will likely vary among countries. Some KBA Proposers may wish to focus on identifying KBAs for a particular ecosystem type or determine whether a particular site qualifies as a KBA under Criterion A2 or B4.

The IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology provides a comprehensive classification framework for Earth\u2019s ecosystems based on their functional and compositional features (Figure 4.2; Table 4.2). In this hierarchy, biogeographic ecotypes (Level 4) and global ecosystem types (Level 5) are currently considered the relevant levels for KBA identification, but this needs to be confirmed through testing in multiple regions. In the meantime, KBA Proposers are requested to contact the KBA Secretariat for updates. According to the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology, biogeographic ecotypes (Level 4) are developed from the top down, by subdividing ecosystem functional groups (Level 3) using an ecoregional template (e.g., Spalding et al., 2007; Abell et al., 2008; Dinerstein et al., 2017). In contrast, global ecosystem types (Level 5) are derived from the bottom up, by aggregating sub-global ecosystem types (Level 6) based on compositional similarities.

Source: IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology Ver. 2.0 Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 85 When applying KBA Criteria A2 and B4, KBA NCGs or KBA Proposers may choose to use biogeographic ecotypes (Level 4), global ecosystem types (Level 5) or equivalent levels in a similar globally consistent ecosystem classification hierarchy (e.g., Macrogroup or Group in the EcoVeg hierarchy, Faber-Langendoen et al., 2014). Further guidance on appropriate levels in the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology and on equivalent levels in similar globally consistent ecosystem classification hierarchies will be provided following testing in multiple regions (e.g., Comer et al., 2022 Appendix 3 links North American terrestrial ecosystems to Level 3 of the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology). Using biogeographic ecotypes (Level 4) will maximise global consistency as the RLE Committee on Scientific Standards plans to map and assess all biogeographic ecotypes using the RLE Guidelines (Bland et al., 2017) by 2025. The list of biogeographic ecotypes (Level 4) that may trigger Criterion A2 or B4 will be made available on the Red List of Ecosystems website. In some countries, global ecosystem types (Level 5) may provide a more appropriate resolution and basis for global KBA identification. For Criterion A2, global ecosystem types will need to be assessed at the global level using the RLE Guidelines (Bland et al., 2017) and submitted for peer review and publication on the Red List of Ecosystems. For Criteria A2 and B4, the global extent of global ecosystem types must be mapped before the relevant threshold can be applied. This may require international collaboration where global ecosystem types extend beyond national boundaries. The decision on which ecosystem classification and level to use should be made in consultation with the KBA RFP and RLE Committee on Scientific Standards. Can KBAs be identified for lower-level ecosystems? As stated in the KBA Standard (IUCN, 2016), the thresholds associated with the ecosystem-based criteria (i.e. both A2 and B4) are designed to be applied at intermediate levels in a globally consistent ecosystem classification hierarchy (e.g., Levels 4 or 5 in Table 4.2.1). Lower-level ecosystem types (e.g., sub-global ecosystems types at Level 6 in Table 4.2.1) cannot trigger global KBAs, pending further testing. Can KBAs be identified for collapsed ecosystem types? No \u2013 unlike species, ecosystems do not go extinct, but are transformed and replaced by different ecosystems (with different species, interactions, and ecological processes). An ecosystem type is considered collapsed when its characteristic native species and other defining features are lost, or when species that perform key ecological roles are Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 86 greatly reduced in abundance and no longer able to maintain those functions. A collapsed ecosystem type cannot therefore trigger a KBA. 4.2.2 For each ecosystem type, compile available data on the ecosystem\u2019s global extent and distribution in the region of interest. Spatial data showing the extent of biogeographic ecotypes (Level 4) will be made available through the Red List of Ecosystems website when these data are available. For global ecosystem types (Level 5), KBA Proposers should follow the guidelines in Appendix IV on mapping the extent of ecosystem types. Note that the global extent of any ecosystem types used for KBA identification must be mapped; a national map is insufficient for ecosystem types that extend beyond national boundaries. 4.2.3 Identify the existing/potential sites where each ecosystem type occurs in the region of interest.

These boundaries may need to be refined later to yield practical KBA boundaries (see Section 7.3). 4.2.4 Prepare and submit Red List of Ecosystem assessments as appropriate. Ideally, national-level assessments of potential KBAs against Criterion A2 will be based on a comprehensive assessment of all Level 4 or Level 5 ecosystem types in the country following the RLE Guidelines (Bland et al., 2017), as this will ensure a consistent ecosystem mapping and assessment approach and that threatened ecosystem types are not overlooked. However, where a comprehensive assessment is not possible, ecosystem types that are likely to be threatened and have the potential to trigger a KBA under Criterion A2 may be prioritised for assessment using the RLE Guidelines. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 87 4.3 Applying Criterion A2 to identify KBAs for threatened ecosystem types 4.3.1 Identify ecosystem types that could trigger Criterion A2 in the region of interest. Ecosystem types at an intermediate level in a globally consistent ecosystem classification hierarchy (e.g., Levels 4 and 5 in Table 4.2) that have been assessed as globally threatened using the RLE Guidelines (Bland et al., 2017) can trigger KBA Criterion A2. Once the RLE Committee on Scientific Standards has completed global assessments of biogeographic ecotypes (Level 4), the list of biogeographic ecotypes that have been assessed as globally CR or EN or VU will be made available on the Red List of Ecosystems website. KBA NCGs or KBA Proposers interested in assessing global ecosystem types (Level 5) using the RLE Guidelines (Bland et al., 2017) should consult with the RLE Committee on Scientific Standards. Following peer review, completed assessments of global ecosystem types will be published on the Red List of Ecosystems website. 4.3.2. Check the relevant threshold for each potential trigger ecosystem type given its threat category. A site qualifies as a KBA under Criterion A2 because it holds one or more of the following: a) \u22655% of the global extent of a globally CR or EN ecosystem type; b) \u226510% of the global extent of a globally VU ecosystem type. How is the global extent of an ecosystem type defined? In the context of KBA identification, the extent of an ecosystem type refers to its current global area of geographic distribution, representing all spatial occurrences of the ecosystem type including degraded occurrences (Bland et al., 2017, p. ix). KBA identification is based on geographic distribution maps, not the extent of ecosystem occurrence or the area occupied by the ecosystem (see Bland et al., 2017, p. 57 for comparison). 4.3.3 Assess whether each ecosystem type meets the relevant threshold at each existing/potential site given its threat category. The percentage of the global extent of each globally threatened ecosystem type that lies within each existing/potential site\u2019s boundaries can be compared to the relevant threshold for the ecosystem type given its threat category (see Table 4.3 for example). This calculation will be checked in the WDKBA when it is fully functional.

For biogeographic ecotypes (Level 4) and global ecosystem types (Level 5) that have recently been assessed for the Red List of Ecosystems, the associated geographic distribution maps may be used as confirmation of presence, unless it is likely that the distribution has changed since the map was developed (e.g., through recent ecosystem-transforming fires or landcover conversion). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 89 If it is likely that distribution changes have occurred since the most recent geographic distribution map, KBA Proposers should overlay this map on recent high-resolution satellite imagery to reconfirm presence of the ecosystem type within the proposed KBA boundaries. In the case of a forest ecosystem type, for example, KBA Proposers should confirm that the forest ecosystem type is still present within the KBA and has not been destroyed by fire or converted to other types of landcover, such as pasture or crops. This can often be done using open-access tools such as Google Earth.

How are geographically restricted ecosystem types identified for the purposes of applying KBA Criterion B4? The definition of geographically restricted given in the KBA Standard (IUCN, 2016) is indicative rather than prescriptive.

The ecological integrity of a site is a function of its component ecosystems and their collective ecological integrity. When assessing ecological integrity, it is therefore important to recognise that the composition of natural ecosystems may be dynamic Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 92 on multiple spatial and temporal scales, especially in the context of global climate change, and that the contribution of species to ecosystem function is diverse. Key terms used in this working interpretation of ecological integrity include: High-integrity reference states are used to identify ecological attributes and indicators of ecosystem structure, function and composition within the expected range of variation characteristic of the geographic location in ecosystems with outstanding ecological integrity. High-integrity reference states may be derived from regionally appropriate historical baselines, replicated contemporary ecosystem samples, ecosystem models and/or expert judgement (see further detail below). Degree: Ecological integrity is not binary \u2013 a particular sample of an ecosystem may lie anywhere along a spectrum from outstanding ecological integrity to collapsed. Sites qualifying as KBAs under Criterion C are demonstrated to be examples of globally outstanding ecological integrity. Composition: Encompasses the identity and variety of the biota, and includes characteristics of species assemblages such as diversity and abundance/ biomass across taxonomic groups and trophic levels. Structure: Relates to physical organisation, including structural connectivity, contiguity of natural habitat, vertical and horizontal spatial arrangement of the biota, substrate characteristics, and size- or age-class distributions. Function: Refers to the functioning of ecological processes, such as nutrient-cycling, productivity, pollination, seed dispersal, predator\u2013prey interactions, functional connectivity (including species movement, dispersal and metapopulation dynamics, and exchanges between ecosystems), phenology, disturbance regimes (e.g., fire and drought) and hydrological processes. How are high-integrity reference states defined? High-integrity reference states should be defined in a way that is consistent with identifying only those sites that represent examples of globally outstanding ecological integrity. There are a range of options for defining high-integrity reference states, all of which depend on some combination of ecological theory, empirical data, Indigenous and Local Knowledge and other expert judgement, including one or more of the following: \u25cf Historical benchmarks \u2013 These are the initial states for assessing change over specified timeframes (e.g., since the industrial era). The choice of historical baseline Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 93 should be accompanied by an explanation of why it is appropriate to the region (see Stephenson et al., (2019) for discussion), taking into account the history of Indigenous land management in the region. Historical benchmarks will be less relevant in regions that have been significantly impacted by global climate change. There are many methods for developing historical reconstructions that can be used to establish high-integrity reference states. For example, long-term fire histories can be created from fire scars in forested ecosystems, indicating the range of historical variation; other examples include the use of pollen cores from lakes. \u25cf Replicated contemporary samples (or reference sites) \u2013 High-integrity reference states may be based on replicated contemporary samples of the ecosystem type exposed to minimal impacts from threatening processes or drivers (e.g., industrial agriculture, mining, timber harvest, fishing, invasive species, fire suppression). \u25cf Modelling \u2013 Conceptual or quantitative ecosystem models that describe the expected values of key ecosystem features, processes and interactions are a useful way to define reference states. Ecosystem models that describe the expected state of the ecosystem under current climate conditions, but without other industrial human impacts, are especially useful for defining high-integrity reference states (c.f. Rodrigues et al., 2019). At a species level, quantitative population viability models or model-based estimates of carrying capacity can be useful for defining the expected range of variation in population size or abundance of functional indicator species in ecosystems with outstanding ecological integrity. \u25cf Biological patterns \u2013 Ecosystems have characteristic biological patterns for metrics such as food webs. For example food chain length is a fundamental ecosystem property, and plays a central role in determining ecosystem functioning (Vander Zanden and Fetzer, 2007; Saporiti et al., 2015) Observed food webs can be compared to the expected characteristics of food webs in a particular geographic location, which serve as a high-integrity reference state.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b8667c2-6d66-4126-9e48-de0733095318": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b8667c2-6d66-4126-9e48-de0733095318", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Morocco - Pocket identification guide of main vulnerable species incidentally caught in Moroccan fisheries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "64a114d5feec1d6f648725ab00f9f76d0af473706674fdfa9728aac0f015fc43"}, "2": {"node_id": "ec23c400-047e-4965-9392-c0ef97243044", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ff18b6c8870f519d0c704be0132603bf5ae1965b8ed68f7a185b72ba0c7ad7ed"}}, "hash": "af1262ad3465cd6a86293761100470d898e1a8aa1f9cf45e7aacf0cca7ea6666", "text": "\u25cf Long-term datasets \u2013 Long-term datasets relating to ecosystem structure, function and/or composition are available for some ecosystems (e.g., including data on primary production, nutrient-cycling, species abundance and distribution, and disturbance patterns; Vanderbilt & Gaiser, 2017).

Ecoregions provide the basis for assessment of Criterion C. An ecoregion is a \u201crelatively large unit of land (or water) containing a distinct assemblage of natural communities and species with boundaries that approximate the original extent of natural communities prior to major land-use change\u201d (Olson et al., 2001; IUCN, 2016, p. 12; please see Appendix V for ecoregion templates for terrestrial, freshwater and marine systems.) Nevertheless, delineation of Criterion C KBAs should not be overly constrained by ecoregion boundaries (see Section 5.3.2 for further discussion). Some ecoregions do not have any remaining areas with the outstanding ecological integrity required to qualify as a KBA under Criterion C. The KBA Standard states that ecological integrity should be observed or inferred from evidence based on both: \u25cf absence (or very low levels) of direct industrial human impact, as quantified by appropriate indices at the scale of interest and verified on the ground or in the water; AND \u25cf direct measures of species composition and abundance/ biomass/ density across taxonomic groups (particularly for species indicative of long-term structural stability and functionality or those known to be highly sensitive to human impact). The guidelines below outline a practical approach for identifying sites of outstanding ecological integrity. Identifying sites qualifying as KBAs under Criterion C in practice Criterion C identifies sites of globally outstanding ecological integrity, with observed or inferred ecosystem structure, function and composition measured relative to Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 95 regionally appropriate historical benchmarks or other high-integrity reference states that support ecosystem and biodiversity persistence, within the range of natural variability characteristic of the geographic location and with minimal impacts from threatening processes including industrial human activities. KBAs qualifying under Criterion C: \u25cf maintain fully functional ecosystem types and their components, and should be large enough to maintain ecological communities through most natural disturbance events and sustain most broad-scale ecological processes over the long-term (Janzen, 1986; Newmark et al., 1995; Balmford et al., 1998; Scott et al., 1999; Laurance et al., 2002; Leroux et al., 2007; Woodley, 2010; IUCN & WCPA, 2017). \u25cf are characterised by contiguous or near-continuous natural communities and functioning broad-scale ecological processes (e.g., wildfire, free-flowing rivers, and flooding patterns) and the natural movement patterns of species. \u25cf maintain diagnostic components of their characteristic native biota (defined in Section 5.4.0), including species indicative of long-term structural stability and functionality at levels of abundance or biomass sufficient to maintain key ecological functions (Soul\u00e9 et al., 2003). \u25cf are still natural, requiring no or very limited human intervention to maintain ecosystem structure, function and composition and support ecosystem and biodiversity persistence, apart from traditional Indigenous management and actions to prevent incursions of threatening processes (e.g., invasive species, industrial development). \u25cf are substantially undisturbed by significant direct industrial human influence, as shown by appropriate indicators including the continued presence of species known to be highly sensitive to human impacts. Ecological integrity is a multidimensional concept that cannot be assessed using a single ecological attribute or indicator. Sites qualifying as KBAs under Criterion C may be identified using the ecological integrity attributes and indicators detailed below in Section 5.4.0.

Most Criterion C identification processes have taken a sequential approach, focusing on direct industrial human impact pressures (e.g., infrastructure) during scoping analysis and other elements during site evaluation. KBA Proposers are urged to pay particular attention to balancing omission and commission errors. It is generally better to be inclusive rather than exclusive at this stage (i.e. allow some candidate areas with lower ecological integrity to slip through the preliminary scoping filter to ensure that areas with high ecological integrity are not inadvertently discarded by an overly stringent filter). Some candidate areas that pass the initial scoping filter will not be proposed as Criterion C sites following site evaluation (see Section 5.4.1); whereas some potential sites that do not fall within initial candidate areas may be reconsidered later, if subsequent expert consultations indicate that was an error. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 97 Figure 5.3.1 Overview of possible workflow for applying Criterion C. Source: Compiled by the KBA SAC. How is absence (or very low levels) of human impact measured? Absence, or very low levels, of direct industrial human impact does not necessarily mean absence, or even low densities, of human inhabitants. For example, many sites with outstanding ecological integrity have been inhabited by Indigenous peoples for millennia. Conversely, some areas with very low human population densities have undergone extensive loss of ecological integrity through human-induced pressures (e.g., over-exploitation, invasive species, alteration of hydrological processes and natural disturbance processes). Rather, for a site to qualify as a KBA under Criterion C, human impacts must not have eroded ecological integrity. The focus should therefore be on pressures that are likely to have significant impacts on structure, function and composition in the ecosystems of interest. Spatial indices that integrate information on pressures and impacts can be especially useful in this context (e.g., the Forest Landscape Integrity Index, which integrates information on observed and inferred human pressures and lost forest connectivity, Grantham et al., 2020). Preliminary analyses may be based on readily available global and/ or preferably regional-level cumulative human pressure datasets (e.g., roads and infrastructure; Sanderson et al., 2002; Venter et al., 2016; Poley et al., 2022). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 98 Understanding the key drivers of change within an ecoregion or area of interest can help to identify the most appropriate factors and datasets for identifying areas with low levels of human impacts. KBA Proposers are encouraged to refer to summaries of the main threats currently affecting or likely to affect relevant ecosystems in existing ecoregional assessments and Red List of Ecosystems assessments where available. KBA Proposers may develop quantitative indices based on cumulative human pressure datasets to filter out areas with significant direct industrial human impacts. In regions where drivers of change are similar across adjacent ecoregions, the same indices may serve for multiple ecoregions. Elsewhere, ecoregion-specific indices of human impact will likely be more appropriate, especially where more detailed or up- to-date information is available at the ecoregional level than at broader scales. Thresholds should be set at regional or ecoregional levels, with reference to the impacts of pressures on the ecological integrity attributes listed below. Sensitivity analysis should be conducted around thresholds. In all ecoregions, the aim is to identify sites that represent examples of outstanding ecological integrity, but the same type of infrastructure can have different levels of impact in different regions. Roads, for example, can have limited impacts on ecological integrity in some regions, but lead to broad-scale logging, mining and hunting in others. Pervasive global-scale threats that affect all marine and/or terrestrial areas (e.g., climate change, ocean acidification, past overharvest of cetaceans) should not be included as binary factors in this analysis (i.e. as simple yes/no layers), as no site would be identifiable under Criterion C in that case.

In terrestrial ecoregions without other clear ecological boundaries, watersheds can provide a useful tool for deriving initial site boundaries at an appropriate spatial scale. (See Section Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 99 7.3.3 for guidance in this context.) Initial boundaries may need to be refined later to yield practical KBA boundaries (see Section 7.3). Are KBA Criterion C sites required to be at least 10,000 km2? Sites generally need to be large to maintain ecological integrity without significant management intervention. The KBA Standard states that \u201cKBAs identified under Criterion C should ideally be delineated to be at least 10,000 km2 in size, within the confines of manageability\u2026\u201d (IUCN, 2016, p. 21). However, this is not integral to the Criterion C threshold and should be interpreted as a recommendation rather than a requirement. Sites that are less than 10,000 km2 in size may therefore be proposed as KBAs under Criterion C. Criterion C KBAs may extend beyond ecoregion boundaries (see below in this section), so the size of individual ecoregions does not represent a constraint. However, the requirement that all KBAs should be manageable as a unit may constrain the upper size limit of Criterion C KBAs. The ecological and social characteristics of the area in question (including Indigenous governance) will determine the appropriate scale of potential sites and should be described by KBA Proposers. Sites should be large enough to match the description of KBAs qualifying under Criterion C in Section 5.2 above. See also the concept of minimum dynamic area (Pickett & Thompson, 1978; Leroux et al., 2007; and the IUCN Green List of Protected and Conserved Areas, IUCN & WCPA, 2017). In some regions, sites larger than 10,000 km2 will be required to accommodate broad-scale processes such as fire regimes and species migrations. Conversely, smaller sites may be appropriate for isolated islands or island-like features (e.g., isolated physical features) that maintain fully functional ecosystem types and their components. What does \u201cwithin the confines of manageability\u201d mean in the context of Criterion C? The concept of manageability may be somewhat different in the context of sites identified as KBAs for their ecological integrity under Criterion C from sites identified as KBAs under other criteria (e.g., a site identified for a CR species under subcriterion A1e). Generally, managing for ecological integrity will require a less intensive approach to in situ management, with the exception of addressing direct threats to ecological integrity (e.g., control of invasive species, barrier removal). This implies that the scale of manageability is potentially much larger in the context of Criterion C than for other KBAs. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 100 Can a Criterion C site encompass parts of more than one ecoregion? Yes. In many cases, sites with outstanding ecological integrity do not fit neatly within the boundaries of ecoregions. Global ecoregion boundaries are approximations and do not necessarily align with ecological features relevant to site delineation. Broad- scale ecological processes, including the natural movement patterns of area- demanding species and natural disturbance regimes, often extend across ecoregion boundaries. Delineation of Criterion C KBAs should not be overly constrained by ecoregion boundaries. Delineating sites that include more than one ecoregion may be especially appropriate in regions with relatively small ecoregions. The KBA Standard states that, \u201cwhere sites straddle ecoregional boundaries, delineation should proceed without respect to ecoregional division\u201d (IUCN, 2016, p. 21). Some well delineated Criterion C KBAs may include one or more primary ecoregions and small segments of other ecoregions. For sites that encompass parts of more than one ecoregion, KBA Proposers should specify which ecoregion(s) the site is representing (see Section 5.4.2 for more details).

Different indicators will likely be needed for the main ecosystems within a site. KBA Proposers are encouraged to refer to descriptions of the characteristic native biota and key ecological processes and interactions of relevant ecosystems in existing ecoregional assessments and Red List of Ecosystems assessments where available. Conceptual models of key ecosystem dynamics, such as those developed as part of Red List of Ecosystems assessments, can also provide a useful reference (see Bland et al., 2017). For each selected indicator, the next step is to define the expected range of variation in ecosystems with outstanding ecological integrity, consistent with high-integrity reference states. Given that natural ecosystems are dynamic, assessments of ecological integrity should take into account the expected range of variation in ecosystem structure, function and composition under natural environmental conditions and phases of natural disturbance (e.g., a site in a fire-adapted ecosystem should not be excluded because it has relatively few fire-intolerant seedlings immediately following a natural fire). The final decision on whether a site qualifies as an example of outstanding ecological integrity at the global scale should be based on a weight-of-evidence approach applied 15 Adapted from The Nature Conservancy (2003) Assessment of Target Viability1 Worksheet: Conservation Project Management Workbook Versions 3 (CAP) and 4.

Expert judgement can play an important role in assessing ecological integrity attributes and indicators where suitable quantitative or qualitative data are not available. Ecological integrity attributes and indicators Ecological integrity attributes that can be adapted for all ecosystems can be identified using the following questions. Ecological integrity attributes and associated indicators should be identified and assessed for all questions for which reliable data are available. Attributes are not independent of each other. 1. Functional indicator species: Are functional indicator species within acceptable population ranges? (Function) This ecological integrity attribute focuses on the functional components of the characteristic native biota (i.e. the species that are central in driving ecosystem dynamics and function, such as ecosystem engineers, trophic or structural dominants, or functionally unique elements, Bland et al., 2017). The set of functional indicator species should ideally include species from multiple taxonomic groups with diverse ecological functions and ideally collectively serve as indicators for structure, function, composition and anthropogenic stress, including: \u25cf species indicative of long-term structural stability and that underpin key ecosystem functions (e.g., old structure-forming plants, top predators, other keystone species, ecosystem engineers and foundation species, seed-dispersers and pollinators; Paine, 1969; Dayton, 1972; Jones et al., 1994); \u25cf species sensitive to broad-scale ecological processes (e.g., fire, flood, grazing and predation; Carignan & Villard, 2002); \u25cf area-demanding species (e.g., low density and highly mobile species; Boyd et al., 2008; Didier et al., 2009); The set of functional indicator species should be accompanied by an explanation of why such species are appropriate and relevant for inferring ecosystem integrity. It will often be useful to construct simple foodweb or ecosystem models to identify functional components of the characteristic native biota and help select functional indicator species at various trophic levels.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "42968ae3-f054-4673-a164-15811c8e8d72": {"__data__": {"id_": "42968ae3-f054-4673-a164-15811c8e8d72", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Morocco - Pocket identification guide of main vulnerable species incidentally caught in Moroccan fisheries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8b489e4b82f0bea3fffc019bda2cb9aad0d8a496c3a36aa42de4641d4da518cc"}, "2": {"node_id": "3bdb4ece-d351-493f-8272-51dbb1d4991c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d1cf3d60726ce916b73f1f640627ba71b60b191831287c8e519cf7c55f64247c"}}, "hash": "47b4815df03694e0249a6172c0f99809e35b453c39e3be8bf3b4a258c9f1229b", "text": "If a species has a high number of web connections or a large proportion of the total energy in the foodweb flows through that species, its loss would impact the ecosystem\u2019s integrity.

Shifts in the relative abundance of functional indicator species are symptoms of change in ecosystem behaviour and identity (Bland et al., 2017; see Table 8 for examples). Indicators for this ecological integrity attribute should therefore ideally capture the relative abundance or biomass of functional indicator species, using measures that can be assessed quantitatively, qualitatively or through expert judgement. 2. Characteristic native species: Has the system lost characteristic native species? (Composition) Assessments of species composition are essential for the identification of KBAs that qualify under Criterion C. Systems under stress tend to lose native species, and declines in species richness may lead to loss of ecosystem function and resilience (see Bland et al., 2017, Table 8 for examples). Nevertheless, it is recognised that comprehensive species inventories covering all taxonomic groups are impossible in most regions of the world, especially remote ecoregions with few human settlements and limited road access. This ecological integrity attribute therefore focuses on the diagnostic components of the characteristic native biota, i.e. the native species that define the identity of an ecosystem type and distinguish it from other ecosystem types. For example, raised bogs in Germany are characterised by vegetation dominated by peat mosses (e.g., Sphagnum magellanicum, Sphagnum fuscum) and insectivorous plants like sundew (Drosera spp.); dominance by peat mosses, together with geomorphic and hydrological processes, distinguishes raised bogs from other ecosystem types (see Bland et al., 2017, Box 3, for this and other examples). Loss of these species may lead to significant alterations in ecosystem structure, function, composition or ecosystem identity; the significance of a species\u2019 loss should be considered in this context. Indicators for this ecological integrity attribute can be derived from the list of species representing the diagnostic component of the characteristic native biota of ecosystems at the site. Preliminary scoping of areas that retain their characteristic native biota may be informed by regional maps showing areas where species have been extirpated if reliable data are available at appropriate scales. However, site evaluation will often involve workshops or interviews with biodiversity knowledge-holders and possibly new field surveys to ground-truth regional datasets (see Section 5.4.1). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 104 3. Natural movement patterns: Are species able to engage in natural movement patterns? (Structure) Sites qualifying as KBAs under Criterion C should be large enough, with contiguous natural habitat, to enable species to engage in natural movement patterns unimpeded by artificial barriers (e.g., veterinary fences). Natural movement patterns include those of highly mobile migratory and nomadic species (e.g., migratory ungulates) as well as more localised movements between ecosystems (see Bland et al., 2017, Table 8 for examples). Indicators for this ecological integrity attribute may include maps indicating the movement patterns of species with broad-scale natural movement patterns. 4. Harmful invasive species: Has the system gained non-native species with significant impacts on ecosystem structure, function or composition? (Composition) Here, the focus is on harmful invasive species that have significant impacts on ecosystem structure, function or composition. Harmful invasive species may alter ecological communities through predation or competitive exclusion or by making habitat unsuitable for the persistence of some native biota. The Guidelines for using the IUCN Environmental Impact Classification for Alien Taxa (EICAT) Categories and Criteria describe harmful alien taxa as those that are known to be having deleterious impacts upon native biodiversity at the level of the organisation of ecological communities (e.g., through population declines and local population extinctions). The significance of non-native species should be considered in the context of their impacts on ecosystem structure, function or composition; they do not need to have been assessed using the EICAT Guidelines to be considered relevant here. (See also Bland et al., 2017, Table 8, for relevant examples.) Indicators for this ecological integrity attribute should be based on the expected impacts of transformer invasive species known or likely to occur at the site. (For example, in some deciduous forest ecosystems, unusually large stands of dead trees are indicative of invasive pest outbreaks.) 5.

Indicators for this ecological integrity attribute may be derived from simple foodweb diagrams or more complex ecosystem models (e.g., Ecopath models; NOAA, 2007) . 6. Ecosystem configuration: Does the physical organisation of ecosystem types support native biodiversity? (Structure) This ecological integrity attribute focuses on the physical organisation of ecosystem types in forests, woodlands, savanna, reefs, kelp forests etc. This refers to the arrangement of ecosystem types, ecosystem states and recurrent ecosystem patterns. At a given site, disturbance regimes, such as fire, flooding, drought, storms and disease, create a mosaic of ecosystem types, with characteristic juxtaposition or recurring pattern. The resulting configuration of community types is essential for biodiversity persistence. Indicators for this ecological integrity attribute include cover, adjacency, patch size, connectivity, fragmentation, and the vertical and horizontal spatial arrangement of biotic habitat, as well as size distributions. For terrestrial ecosystems, several of these indicators can be assessed using remotely sensed data. 7. Productivity: Is the productivity of the system operating within limits that support the system? (Function) This ecological integrity attribute focuses on the productivity needed to maintain ecosystem function. Ecosystems are driven by primary productivity, the amount of organic matter produced by biological activity per unit area in a given time period. Productivity and decomposition operate within a range for specific ecosystems. When these vital processes move outside that range, the ecosystem may be fundamentally altered. Primary productivity in marine and terrestrial systems has been measured by remote sensing for several decades. Long-term movement away from the mean annual productivity at a site is generally indicative of ecosystem transformation (e.g., a decrease in primary productivity is a key indicator for land degradation). Indicators for this ecological integrity attribute measure the expected range of variation in primary productivity in ecosystems with outstanding ecological integrity. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 106 8. Broad-scale physical processes: Are key physical processes supporting biodiversity? (Function) This ecological integrity attribute focuses on broad-scale ecological processes, specifically key physical or abiotic processes that are not captured by other indicators. Ecosystems are inherently dynamic, driven by processes such as fire, flooding, drought and storms. After disturbance, ecosystems pass through sometimes- predictable successional stages and biodiversity is adapted to those disturbance regimes. Long-term changes in disturbance regimes can lead to ecosystem transformation. Thus, an understanding of the ecological processes that sustain ecosystems and biodiversity at a site can be important for assessing ecological integrity. Indicators for this ecological integrity attribute will be specific to each physical process (e.g., frequency and spatial extent of fire or flooding events) and should capture the expected range of variation in ecosystems with outstanding ecological integrity. 9. Anthropogenic stress: Are anthropogenic pressures leading to significant alterations in ecosystem structure, function or composition? (Anthropogenic stress) Here, the focus is on identifying any anthropogenic pressures that are major drivers of changes in ecosystem structure, function and/or composition at the site. Examples include reduced abundance in mid-trophic level fish biomass through unsustainable fishing, significant changes in forest habitat structure through unsustainable logging, eutrophication of freshwater systems through aquatic pollution. The effects of disease associated with human activities may also be considered here (e.g., disease transmitted to wildlife from domestic livestock). As with other pressures, the significance of disease should be considered in the context of its potential to contribute to significant alterations in ecosystem structure, function or composition. Indicators should ideally focus on the impacts rather than the pressure (for example, focusing on reductions in fish biomass rather than numbers of fishing vessels) where data are available. For each site, a set of human pressure indicators can be developed to help evaluate the ecological integrity of the site. In some cases, species that are sensitive to specific pressures can provide relevant indicators (e.g., all large hunted and harvested species; invertebrates and lichens that indicate water and air quality; species that are sensitive to climate change; Karr, 1981; Redford, 1992; Thiollay, 1992).

Evidence may come from workshops or interviews with biodiversity knowledge- holders, including ecologists, ecosystem experts, holders of Indigenous and Local Knowledge (ILK, see below and Section 8.1) and site managers, recently collected data or new field surveys. Site evaluation should include workshops and/ or interviews with relevant knowledge-holders and experts to validate the evidence for the outstanding ecological integrity of the site and supporting data, particularly those that are out-of-date. The KBA Proposer should provide a brief explanation of why any data older than 12 years are still considered valid (for example, no more recent data are available and no major ecological or human management changes have occurred in the area in the intervening period). Interviews and site evaluation may be conducted by local experts other than the KBA Proposer, but must be documented (see Section 9.1). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 108 What is the role of Indigenous and Local Knowledge (ILK) in site evaluation? Many sites that may qualify as KBAs under Criterion C will coincide with Indigenous territories and local communities, and ILK will play an important role in evaluating all aspects of ecological integrity including high-integrity reference states as well as site delineation in this context. (For example, ILK can be applied in assessing species composition, abundance and distribution, and in discovering the extent of natural resource use and exploitation over time.) Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) is required prior to the publication or display of previously unpublished ILK (see Section 8.1 for further guidelines). Any KBA proposal based on data derived from previously unpublished ILK should be flagged for review during the submission process (see the KBA Proposal Process guidance). What happens if a site does not qualify as an outstanding example of ecological integrity at the global scale? The process of assessing a site under Criterion C involves determining where a site falls on the spectrum from outstanding ecological integrity to degraded. If a site does not represent an example of outstanding ecological integrity at the global scale based on a weight-of-evidence approach applied to the full set of ecological integrity indicators, but is characterised as having relatively high ecological integrity at the regional scale, it may qualify as a regional KBA following guidelines for regional application of the KBA criteria (to be developed in due course). 5.4.2 Selecting sites in ecoregions with more than two sites with potential to trigger Criterion C Sites qualifying under Criterion C represent examples of outstanding ecological integrity at the global scale. The KBA Standard states that the maximum number of sites that can qualify under Criterion C is two per ecoregion (IUCN, 2016, p. 21). When proposing sites that include parts of more than one ecoregion under Criterion C, KBA Proposers should specify the primary ecoregion(s) at the site so that the KBA does not count towards the two sites per ecoregion threshold for ecoregions with limited coverage by the site. How are sites selected when there are more than two potential sites that could trigger Criterion C in an ecoregion? For ecoregions that are the focal ecoregion for more than two potential sites that could trigger Criterion C, site selection will likely be an iterative process, possibly involving Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 109 considerations of ecosystem representation and/ or a comparative analysis of ecological integrity attributes and indicators.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "25973db0-344d-4dc8-bc28-ae15687f99ac": {"__data__": {"id_": "25973db0-344d-4dc8-bc28-ae15687f99ac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Morocco - Pocket identification guide of main vulnerable species incidentally caught in Moroccan fisheries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0f44af4e53ac2d2bd6a07d3862760192295605e367997eaab734de13cf4d0ef4"}, "2": {"node_id": "28f59f9a-10fd-4b57-b6a1-989e4ce5c36c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ad03487f3047182408abc6a46f954168e0b4332f193090184d6b14d6fb8fa24c"}}, "hash": "8ee30d47fd801b960cae888e9df66169a4fab8203ff5c059001faefd46940615", "text": "5.4.3 Refining ecological boundaries, if necessary, to yield practical KBA boundaries KBA delineation is not complete until ecological boundaries have been evaluated and refined, if necessary, to yield a manageable site or sites (see Section 7.3 for further guidelines).

Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 110 6. Identifying Key Biodiversity Areas based on quantitative analysis of irreplaceability (Criterion E) 6.1 Irreplaceability and complementarity Criterion E is a species-based criterion, like Criteria A1, B1-3, and D1-3. Criterion E aims to identify sites that have very high irreplaceability for the global persistence of biodiversity because they are very likely needed as part of a global network of complementary sites designed to achieve predefined representation targets for all species. Sites identified as KBAs under Criterion E should have very high irreplaceability (i.e. at least 0.9 on a scale of 0 to 1). The KBA Standard defines irreplaceability as follows: \u201cEither (a) the likelihood that an area will be required as part of a system that achieves a set of targets (Ferrier et al., 2000) or (b) the extent to which the options for achieving a set of targets are reduced if the area is unavailable for conservation (Pressey et al., 1994). Irreplaceability is heavily influenced by geographically restricted biodiversity, but it is a property of an area within a network rather than of an element of biodiversity and is related to the concept of complementarity.\u201d The KBA Standard defines complementarity as follows: \u201cA measure of the extent to which an area contains elements of biodiversity not represented, or that are underrepresented, in an existing set of areas; alternatively, the number of unrepresented or underrepresented biodiversity elements that a new area adds to a network (Margules & Pressey, 2000).\u201d Irreplaceability is a function of the conservation features considered (e.g., species), their established representation targets (i.e. the desired amount of a species\u2019 global population size or distribution incorporated in a network of sites), and the size of spatial units (e.g., grid cells). Sites are irreplaceable if there is insufficient area (or combination of sites) that can replace them while maintaining species' representation, and have high irreplaceability if there are very few options (i.e. limited area or combinations of sites) for doing so. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 111 Sites with very high irreplaceability are thus important for the persistence of biodiversity, especially species that are geographically concentrated or have population sizes not much greater than the representation target, such that there is limited spatial flexibility to meet the target. Criterion E may also identify some sites that have high irreplaceability because of their importance for a combination of species or set of biodiversity elements (IUCN, 2016, p. 25), including some species with broader distributions. These sites are highly likely to be required as part of an efficient network for achieving the set of representation targets. Typically, there are many possible combinations of complementary sites that can achieve a given set of species\u2019 representation targets, with different spatial configurations. Some of these combinations are more efficient than others, achieving representation targets in a smaller total area, for example. Sites that qualify under Criterion E are KBAs in their own right, but quantitative analysis of irreplaceability may also serve as a useful scoping tool for identifying sites that might meet other criteria (especially A1 and B1-3). KBA NCGs and KBA Proposers are encouraged to take advantage of this to assess sites identified as having very high irreplaceability under Criterion E against other criteria (IUCN, 2016, p. 5). Assessing sites against multiple criteria will strengthen the robustness of KBA identification to changes in the status of trigger species and available data. 6.2 Preparing datasets for Criterion E analysis A site qualifies as a KBA under Criterion E because it has a level of irreplaceability of \u22650.90 (on a 0\u20131 scale), measured by quantitative spatial analysis, and is characterised by the regular presence of species with \u226510 reproductive units known to occur (or \u2265 5 units for EN or CR species).

Figure 6.1 Overview of possible workflow for applying Criterion E. Source: Compiled by the KBA SAC. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 113 6.2.1 Decide the geographic and taxonomic scope for analysis. What is the appropriate geographic scope for applying Criterion E? The KBA Standard states that irreplaceability analysis needs to take into account the entire range of species, and so must either (a) be conducted at a global scale, or (b) focus only on species endemic to the region analysed, or (c) focus on a study region after setting the representation targets to reflect the fraction of the global population size of each species that is included in the study region (IUCN, 2016, p. 25). In all three cases (a \u2013 c), the definition of targets needs to take into account the global population size (or distribution) of the species, rather than just the population size (or distribution) within the subglobal region analysed. This is straight-forward for analyses (a) at the global scale or (b) for species endemic to the study region in subglobal analyses. For non-endemic species (c), The KBA Standard states that representation targets should be adjusted to reflect the fraction of the global population size in the study region (see Section 6.2.2). Following testing, we recommend that only species with \u226510% of their population or range within the study region are included in subglobal analysis for Criterion E. Previous concerns that species with only a small proportion of their global population size within the study region might lead to sites being identified as highly irreplaceable because of limited spatial flexibility were not supported once representation targets were adjusted to reflect the fraction of the global population size in the study region (see Section 6.2.2). As with all KBAs, KBA identification under Criterion E should be locally driven, ideally coordinated by a KBA NCG. Collaboration between KBA NCGs and KBA Proposers in neighbouring countries within the same biogeographic region is encouraged, especially if the combined study region would reduce the number of edge-of-range species (i.e. species with a small percentage of their population or range within the study region). KBA RFPs should coordinate with KBA NCGs and other KBA Proposers to ensure that sites are not proposed as KBAs based on Criterion E analyses that overlap both spatially and taxonomically. Global analyses may serve as valuable scoping and evaluation exercises and international organisations may play a valuable supporting role, but are not an alternative to site identification processes led by local or national constituencies. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 114 What is the appropriate taxonomic scope for applying Criterion E? Criterion E analysis may be conducted separately for terrestrial, freshwater, and marine systems. If so, species that occur in multiple systems may be identified as trigger species in more than one system (for example, seabird breeding colonies may contribute to irreplaceability in terrestrial analyses, while seabird foraging areas may contribute to irreplaceability in marine systems). For each system, the recommendation for applying Criterion E is to conduct the most comprehensive analysis possible given the available data (i.e. including all species with suitable data). Once a Criterion E analysis is complete and KBAs have been confirmed, re-analysis will not be required when new data become available until the end of the 8-12 year reassessment period. However, if additional data do become available, KBA NCGs or KBA Proposers may choose to revisit Criterion E analysis, combining the old and new datasets, at any time. If a site previously identified as a KBA under Criterion E no longer meets the 0.9 irreplaceability threshold and does not meet any other KBA criteria, it will no longer be considered a KBA (see Section 10 for more detailed guidance on reassessment).

Can migratory species be included in quantitative irreplaceability analysis under Criterion E? Migratory species may be included; see Section 6.2.2 for guidelines on setting representation targets for migratory species. 6.2.2 Specify the representation target for each species. Under Criterion E, representation targets are set for each species individually, as defined in the KBA Standard (IUCN, 2016, pp. 24-25). There are two types of target, Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 115 applicable to species with different types of available data. For each species, one type of target should be selected, based on the data available: \u25cf Population-based targets (i.e. Ea) apply to species for which it is possible to know, estimate or infer the number of mature individuals per spatial unit. Representation targets are then set in terms of number of mature individuals. \u25cf Area-based targets (i.e. Eb) apply to species for which only distribution data are available (e.g., range or AOO). Representation targets are then set in terms of area, with the implicit assumption that population density is constant across the species\u2019 distribution. Note that Ea and Eb represent different types of target, not separate subcriteria. A single analysis may include some species with population-based targets and others with area-based targets. The two types of target parallel each other, describing a consistent level of representation for any given species (i.e. a minimum of 1,000 mature individuals AND a minimum area of 1,000 km2 within the species\u2019 range or 20 km2 within the species\u2019 AOO). In practice, however, the two types of target may lead to different results because of spatial variation in densities. (See Section 6.2.4 for discussion of which type of target and data type to use.) The representation targets are reproduced here, with minor edits for clarification (please also see the flowchart shown below in Figure 6.2).

Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 117 Figure 6.2 Selecting species representation targets for Criterion E. Source: Compiled by the KBA SAC. How are representation targets set for non-endemic species? For any species that is not endemic to the region analysed, the representation target must be adjusted to reflect the fraction of the global population size of the species in the study area (IUCN, 2016). For example, say the global representation target for a species is 1,000 mature individuals and 75% of the species\u2019 global population size occurs in the study region, then the representation target for the study region would be 750 mature individuals and analysis would be based on the species\u2019 distribution within the study region only. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 118 Are there guidelines for quantitative viability analysis for targets Eaii and Ebii? For targets Eaii and Ebii, quantitative viability analysis should be consistent with the general IUCN Red List Guidelines on applying Red List Criterion E (IUCN SPC, 2019, Section 9). For global analysis or endemic species, quantitative viability analysis should be representative of the species\u2019 population dynamics at the global level, constructed from information sampled from at least 10% of the species\u2019 overall distribution. (This is the intention of the phrase \u201cup to a minimum of 10% of the total species distribution\u2026\u201d in the KBA Standard, IUCN, 2016, pp. 24-25). Targets for non-endemic species under Eaii or Ebii should be set to ensure the persistence of the species in the study region with a probability of \u226590% in 100 years, and the quantitative viability analysis should be representative of the species\u2019 population dynamics within the study region, constructed from information sampled from at least 10% of the species\u2019 distribution within the study region. How are representation targets set for coastal, riverine and other species with linear distributions? In many cases, Criterion E analyses of freshwater systems will be based on subcatchments, as range maps for freshwater species are typically based on subcatchments (see IUCN Red List Mapping Standards). However, in the special case of Criterion E analysis of riverine or coastal systems in which all species have linear distributions that do not exceed 200 km in width within the study region (e.g., an analysis of intertidal marine invertebrates), species representation targets may be rescaled to 50 km linear geographic span for range.16 How are representation targets set for migratory species? For migratory species with well-defined spatially segregated life-cycle processes, such as breeding and non-breeding, representation targets should be set separately for each spatially segregated life-cycle process (e.g., 1,000 mature individuals or 1,000 km2 in the breeding range and 1,000 mature individuals or 1,000 km2 in the non-breeding range). 16 The scaling ratio is derived from the definition of restricted range, which converts the standard 10,000 km2 threshold to 500 km for species with linear distributions. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 119 6.2.3 Determine the spatial units for analysis.

HydroBASIN subcatchments at levels 8-12 have an average size within this range. When deciding the size of spatial units, the following points should be taken into consideration: \u25cf When identifying KBAs under Criterion E (or other criteria), the aim is to balance the risks of commission errors (species assumed to be represented but actually absent) and omission errors (species assumed to be absent but actually represented). When choosing the size of spatial units, the rate of commission errors can generally be reduced by avoiding spatial units that are so small that there is considerable uncertainty regarding whether the species is present in any given unit. In particular, if species distribution data are based on grid cells (e.g., atlas data), the size of spatial units used in irreplaceability analysis should not be smaller than the resolution of the input data (e.g., if the input data are for cells of 20 x 20 km2 = 400 km2, then spatial units should be 400 km2 or larger). \u25cf The size of spatial units affects the likelihood of identifying spatial units that meet the irreplaceability threshold. Smaller spatial units will lead to a smaller total area meeting Criterion E than with larger spatial units. Consequently, larger spatial units will generally lead to higher overall species representation than smaller spatial units. \u25cf Nevertheless, spatial units should not be so large that they are unlikely to be manageable as a unit as these would need to be partitioned into smaller manageable sites later. The smaller sites could have much lower irreplaceability scores, invaliding the results. It is generally better to combine rather than split spatial units during final delineation. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 120 6.2.4 Compile distribution data for each species. In any analysis of irreplaceability, considerable effort will generally be required to compile comprehensive species distribution datasets across the entire study region. It is recommended that KBA NCGs and KBA Proposers invest in compiling high-quality comprehensive datasets, coding species as present only in spatial units where there is high confidence that the species is present. This will reduce the need to repeat the analysis later, if it is discovered that species are not actually present in relevant spatial units. However, it is recognised that, for many species, Criterion E analysis will need to be based on range or ESH, and analysis may need to be repeated if proposed trigger species are not found at proposed sites. These datasets can also inform identification of sites under other species-based KBA criteria. Which type of target (Ea or Eb) is better for quantitative irreplaceability analysis under Criterion E? KBA Proposers are encouraged to set targets in terms of the number of mature individuals, by estimating the number of mature individuals per spatial unit where possible. Data on the distribution of mature individuals provide the most direct measure of the contribution of a site to species persistence. Accounting for spatial variation in densities in this way will also maximise the consistency of targets across species. Which types of data on the distribution of mature individuals can be used for population-based targets (Ea)? Data on the number of mature individuals in each spatial unit may be actual counts or abundance estimates based on sample data or a spatial density model (see Appendix III), as long as it is possible to estimate numbers in absolute rather than relative terms (e.g., as number of mature individuals per km2 rather than catch-per- unit-effort). Which types of data can be used for area-based targets (Eb)? In the context of quantitative analysis of irreplaceability, the choice of area-based assessment parameter from available options will affect the balance of risks between commission and omission errors. In particular, using range runs the risk of overestimating the true distribution, leading to commission errors in the analysis output (for example, some sites may be identified as having high irreplaceability despite the species not being present). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 121 As noted above, it is recommended that species are only coded as present in spatial units where there is high confidence that the species is present to avoid the need to repeat the analysis after failing to confirm presence. This suggests there may be efficiency advantages from using atlas data (i.e. gridded presence/absence maps) where available. Atlas data may be used and treated similarly to range or AOO depending on the size of grid cells (see below). The KBA Standard does not provide representation targets for locality or occurrence data.

Range-type datasets: Range maps for many species can be downloaded from the IUCN Red List (see Appendix III.1 for detailed guidelines on selecting relevant polygons etc.). If no range map exists for the species, KBA Proposers seeking to use range in Criterion E analysis should follow the guidance in the IUCN Red List Mapping Standards on developing distribution maps for estimating range (see also Appendix III.1). KBA Proposers are encouraged to use ESH in place of range where available (using the same targets as for range). This will generally reduce the risks of commission error and be more efficient, especially if the range includes large unsuitable areas. Validated ESH maps will be provided through the IUCN Red List (spatial downloads page) when available. If ESH maps have not yet been developed, KBA Proposers seeking to use ESH should follow the guidance on estimating ESH in Appendix III.2. KBA Proposers are also encouraged to use atlas data, if available, as this will generally reduce the risks of commission error and be more efficient than range or ESH. Atlas data based on large grid cells (e.g., >2 x 2 km) should be treated as range data for the purposes of setting representation targets. AOO-type datasets: KBA Proposers are encouraged to use AOO, where available and reliable. This will generally reduce the risks of commission error and be more efficient than range or ESH maps, especially for species that occur patchily at high densities within their range or ESH. Validated AOO maps can be obtained from the KBA Secretariat, if available. If AOO maps have not yet been developed, KBA Proposers seeking to use AOO should follow the guidance in the IUCN Red List Mapping Standards on estimating AOO (see also Appendix III.3). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 122 KBA Proposers may also use atlas data, if available. Atlas data based on small grid cells (i.e. 2 x 2 km or smaller) that effectively distinguish between occupied and non- occupied parts of the range should be treated as AOO for the purposes of setting representation targets. If atlas data use grid cells smaller than 2 x 2 km, they should be scaled up to 2 x 2 km for consistency with the definition of AOO. What about species that occur at very low densities? Species that occur at very low densities and have a relatively small global population size, such that a very large area may be required to meet the representation target, can have a disproportionate effect on irreplaceability analysis. However, the species may not meet the relevant reproductive-units threshold in much of this area. As a general recommendation, when using global population size to derive population-type targets (under Ea) or densities to derive area-based targets (under Eb), KBA Proposers should start by estimating the number of mature individuals per spatial unit. If this indicates that the number of mature individuals in some spatial units is much lower than the relevant reproductive-units threshold (i.e. 5 reproductive units for CR or EN species and 10 reproductive units for all other species), then the contributions of those spatial units to the species\u2019 representation target can be set to 0 as it is unlikely that the reproductive-units threshold will be met within the spatial unit. 6.2.5 Select a decision support tool. Some sites can be identified as irreplaceable without the need for complex analysis. For example, if a site holds 500 mature individuals of a species with a global population size of 1,400 mature individuals, the site is irreplaceable \u2013 without it, it would not be possible to achieve the target of 1,000 mature individuals. The recommended decision support tools for conducting complementarity-based quantitative analysis of irreplaceability under Criterion E are Marxan (Ball et al., 2009), Conservation Land-Use Zoning software (CLUZ; Smith 2019) or prioritizr using the replacement-cost function (Hanson et al., 2017).

KBA assessment to identify sites under Criterion E should be implemented through complementarity-based irreplaceability analyses. A site qualifies as a KBA under Criterion E because it has a level of irreplaceability of \u22650.90 (on a 0\u20131 scale), measured by quantitative spatial analysis, and is characterised by the regular presence of species with \u226510 reproductive units known to occur (or \u22655 reproductive units for EN or CR species). What types of cost layer can be included in quantitative irreplaceability analysis under Criterion E? The purpose of KBA identification is to identify sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity, not to prioritise sites for conservation action. The only \u201ccost\u201d information included in quantitative irreplaceability analysis to identify KBAs under Criterion E is the area of each spatial unit. Additional cost considerations may be included, along with other factors, in subsequent conservation priority-setting (IUCN, 2016, p. 8; see also Smith et al., 2019, Table 1). What consideration should be given to landscape/ seascape-level considerations when measuring irreplaceability? Some decision support tools used in systematic conservation planning include optional features for integrating landscape/ seascape-level considerations (e.g., forcing selected sites to be as adjacent or connected as possible). Given that the purpose of KBA identification is to identify sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity, and not to design conservation landscapes or seascapes, these optional features should not be used. When using Marxan or prioritzr, for example, the boundary-length modifier or penalty argument should be set to 0. Such landscape/ seascape-level considerations may be included, along with other factors, in subsequent conservation priority-setting exercises (see IUCN, 2016, p. 8). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 124 6.3.2 Redelineate spatial units, if necessary, to yield practical KBA boundaries. Identification of KBAs under Criterion E is not complete until spatial units identified as highly irreplaceable are delineated as manageable sites (see Section 7.3 for further guidelines). If the boundaries of spatial units align with ecological and management boundaries, as recommended above, then this should be straight-forward. The boundaries of existing sites (e.g., existing KBAs, other sites of importance for biodiversity, protected or conserved areas) should be overlaid on spatial units with very high irreplaceability to generate a list of existing sites that might qualify as KBAs under Criterion E. If a spatial unit with high irreplaceability falls wholly or largely within an existing site, then the site\u2019s irreplaceability can be inferred from the underlying spatial unit. If a spatial unit with high irreplaceability falls outside existing sites, then site boundaries may be derived from ecological and management boundaries that encompass the spatial unit (see Section 7.2). If a spatial unit with high irreplaceability is too large to form a manageable site or only part of the spatial unit falls within a site, care must be taken to ensure that the proposed site boundaries encompass the area within the spatial unit that is driving high levels of irreplaceability. Otherwise, it is not possible to infer the site\u2019s irreplaceability from the spatial unit and the analysis may need to be repeated with smaller spatial units. 6.3.3 Identify and confirm the presence of proposed trigger species in numbers that meet relevant reproductive-units thresholds. Identification of KBAs under Criterion E is not complete until the presence of proposed trigger species has been confirmed in numbers that meet or exceed the relevant reproductive-units threshold by reviewing recent field data or conducting new field surveys (see Section 9.2.3). The reproductive-units threshold for Criterion E is 5 reproductive units for CR and EN species, and 10 reproductive units for all other species. The trigger species for each site are those whose presence at the site explains why irreplaceability exceeds the threshold for Criterion E. Sites may be identified as having very high irreplaceability because of one or more individual species with restricted distributions or a combination of species with broader distributions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "297af221-9b34-4af4-a0dc-93166f629ef7": {"__data__": {"id_": "297af221-9b34-4af4-a0dc-93166f629ef7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Morocco - Pocket identification guide of main vulnerable species incidentally caught in Moroccan fisheries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7edaa133a90fea532d05830985a50990cc8c04bfe9a7d57bba3dcab5d5555aa9"}, "2": {"node_id": "78d91a63-e2e8-4697-be30-1cd4adeb5a34", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a2834edbb412a33536266cbcf845e74e248ea93ca9f30c01d3f00eceb1f8efda"}}, "hash": "e6037e6948a0fc3d8d92b820565a08ee4b6074f5150d31868ddd84b8c90982b6", "text": "The simplest practical method for identifying trigger species for each site under Criterion E involves calculating the irreplaceability score using the \u201cFerrier method\u201d Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 125 (Ferrier et al., 2000).

KBA Proposers should provide a report documenting the methods in sufficient detail for another analyst to replicate the results, as would be required by a research journal. In particular, the geographic extent and spatial resolution, taxonomic scope and criteria used to identify species with adequate data, the decision support tool and parameters used should all be adequately documented. The target used for each species in the analysis (including those that did not qualify as trigger species) should be provided in an appendix. The input dataset (including planning units) should be archived, as required by many research journals, to provide a basis for updated analysis in the future. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 126 7. Delineation procedures Delineation is the process of defining the geographic boundaries of a KBA and is a required step in the KBA identification process. The aim is to derive site boundaries that are ecologically relevant and provide a basis for potential management activities. More specifically, the objective is to provide the best conditions for the long-term persistence of the biodiversity elements for which the site is important, dependent on their ecological requirements and the socio-cultural, economic and management context, within the constraint that the final delineated site meets the threshold for at least one KBA criterion. Delineation is an iterative process that typically involves assembling spatial datasets (Section 7.1), mapping the distribution of trigger biodiversity elements and deriving initial boundaries based on ecological data (Section 7.2), refining ecological boundaries to yield practical KBA boundaries (Section 7.3), and documenting delineation (see the KBA Proposal Process guidance). In most cases, it will not be possible to complete this process in a single KBA identification and delineation workshop with a limited number of participants. Stakeholder consultation and involvement is an essential element of the delineation process (see Section 8 for detailed guidelines). In particular, consultation with a range of knowledge-holders is recommended when assembling spatial datasets, mapping the distributions of biodiversity elements, delineating ecological boundaries, and refining ecological boundaries to yield practical KBA boundaries (Section 8.1). Consensus-building with proposers of existing KBAs (including AZE sites, IBAs and KBAs identified under previous initiatives) is required before significant modifications to the boundaries of existing KBA boundaries and to avoid overlapping KBAs (Section 8.2). Involvement of customary and legal rights-holders is recommended during the delineation process (Section 8.3). Once KBA identification and delineation are complete, additional consultation and involvement will generally be required before advancing any form of conservation or management action that might affect Indigenous peoples or other natural resource dependent communities (Section 8.4). Is there a minimum or maximum size requirement for a KBA? There is no absolute minimum or maximum size requirement for a KBA. The size of a KBA will depend on the ecological requirements of the biodiversity elements triggering the criteria, and consideration of site manageability (see Section 7.3). The Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 127 size distribution of existing protected or conserved areas may provide some guidance on the practical scale of management in each region. Previous initiatives (e.g., AZE sites or IBAs) can also be useful, if manageability was taken into account during delineation. Sites identified under Criterion C are likely to be larger on average than sites identified under other KBA criteria, as are those in the open ocean compared with ones on land (see Section 5.2.2). Why do KBAs need to be manageable as a unit and what does this mean? The KBA Standard defines \u201csite\u201d as: \u201cA geographical area on land and/or in water with defined ecological, physical, administrative or management boundaries that is actually or potentially manageable as a single unit (e.g., a protected area or other managed conservation unit)\u2026\u201d (IUCN, 2016, p. 7). The KBA Standard defines \u201cmanageability\u201d as: \u201cThe possibility of some type of effective management across the site.

However, the process of KBA identification and delineation does not include steps to advance management activity and does not imply that any specific form of conservation action, such as protected area designation, is required (IUCN, 2016, p. 8). A KBA should be a manageable unit, but does not need to be a single management unit. Rather, there needs to be scope for effective management across the site. For example, a site that comprises several different ownership or management units (e.g., a protected area and adjacent private reserve) may be proposed as a single KBA if management can be coordinated across the site. Where a proposed KBA comprises Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 128 multiple management units, KBA Proposers should make the case that there is scope for some type of effective management across the site to support the persistence of trigger biodiversity elements. (See the KBA Proposal Process guidance for documentation of manageability). Can the boundaries of KBAs overlap one another? KBA boundaries should not overlap. This includes global versus regional KBAs. It also includes surface versus subterranean or deep sea KBAs, i.e. KBA boundaries should not overlap in 2-dimensional space. It is not possible to propose a subterranean cave and the terrestrial surface above it as two distinct KBAs; rather the two should form part of a single KBA. Similarly, it is not possible to propose an area of seabed and the surface waters or water column above it as two distinct KBAs; rather the two should form part of a single KBA, even though different management authorities may be involved. KBAs with clear, non-overlapping boundaries are much easier to communicate to end-users than a set of overlapping sites that are important for different biodiversity elements and meet different KBA criteria. In many areas, the distribution of biodiversity elements that have not previously been considered will overlap with existing KBAs (including AZE sites, IBAs and KBAs identified under previous initiatives). Many of these existing KBAs have national recognition, active conservation and monitoring initiatives and/or are linked to legislative and policy processes. KBA Proposers should work to harmonise proposed KBA boundaries with existing ones through consensus-building and agreement with the proposers of existing KBAs (see Section 8.2). Can KBAs have dynamic boundaries? KBAs should have fixed boundaries because sites displayed in the WDKBA must be stable, although it is anticipated that boundaries may change periodically as additional biodiversity elements are added or distribution patterns shift. Where dynamic features are important, as for many marine species and freshwater/terrestrial species that depend on dynamic or ephemeral habitats, KBAs should be large enough to encompass those features, as long as there is scope for effective management at that scale. KBAs that support trigger biodiversity elements seasonally (e.g., KBAs that support seasonal aggregations under Criterion D1) are also displayed with fixed boundaries in the WDKBA. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 129 7.1 Assembling spatial datasets What types of spatial datasets are useful for KBA delineation? A range of different types of data may be useful for KBA delineation (see Table 7.1 for examples). Data layers should be of an appropriate spatial resolution to form the basis for delineating manageable KBAs.

Source: Compiled by the KBA SAC. 7.2 Deriving initial KBA boundaries based on ecological data The boundaries of a KBA should be based on ecological considerations, with adjustments for manageability as required. 7.2.1 Distribution maps for individual KBA trigger biodiversity elements Distribution maps of biodiversity elements are a useful starting point for delineation where there are no existing sites in the area of interest, or biodiversity elements overlap with existing sites but do not align with their boundaries. For well sampled KBA trigger biodiversity elements, it may be possible to derive distribution maps that represent the known local geographic distribution from observed locality data. In contrast, for elements with relatively few sampling localities, it may be necessary to infer the approximate geographic distribution using knowledge of habitat requirements combined with maps of remaining habitat or by using habitat models. Distribution maps should contain enough of each trigger biodiversity element to meet KBA thresholds. For trigger biodiversity elements that do not occupy the entire KBA, it is recommended that KBA Proposers submit spatial data showing their distribution within the KBA with the KBA proposal, where possible. (Please see the KBA Proposal Process guidance for details.) These data will be used to support monitoring, possible targeted management actions, and possible redelineation in the future. With the exception of sensitive species (see Section 9.1.1), these will be visible in the WDKBA Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 131 when it is fully functional. Distribution maps are not requested for trigger biodiversity elements that occupy the entire KBA, but the KBA Proposer should make it clear that the trigger biodiversity element occurs throughout the site. 7.2.2 Deriving initial KBA boundaries based on ecological data Where there is no existing site, initial KBA boundaries can be derived that encompass the distribution of overlapping trigger biodiversity elements. These initial KBA boundaries should generally be delineated so that the area contained within them is distinct from surrounding areas in terms of importance for the trigger biodiversity elements or habitat, while minimising the inclusion of land or water that is not relevant to the trigger biodiversity elements. In addition to habitat, it is advisable to consider the spatial aspects of ecological boundaries, including size, edge:area ratio and connectivity with other natural areas. In particular, delineating boundaries that align with natural topographic or habitat features may enhance prospects for the persistence of trigger biodiversity elements. If distribution maps of KBA trigger biodiversity elements are clipped during this process, it is important to check that the initial KBA boundaries still contain enough of each potential trigger biodiversity element to meet relevant KBA criteria and thresholds. Does the area contained within a KBA need to support a minimum viable population of each trigger species? No \u2013 populations of trigger species within KBAs may form part of a larger meta- population and so do not need to be self-sustaining. The area contained within ecological boundaries needs to meet the relevant KBA thresholds, including the threshold number of reproductive units (if applicable). It should be sufficient to sustain the threshold population size and number of reproductive units during the relevant seasons of the annual life-cycle (e.g., year-round for resident species and seasonally for migratory species), although it is recognised that this information will be unavailable for many species. How can ecological boundaries be defined in wilderness areas? KBA delineation may be challenging in areas of continuous habitat, such as wilderness areas (Upgren, et al. 2009). Data on species distributions are often lacking and data on remaining habitat may be of limited use because much of the habitat still remains. The Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 132 best approach may be to generate predictive maps of species distributions through habitat modelling, validated by additional surveys (see Appendix III). In regions with multiple overlapping biodiversity elements, it may be helpful to start by locating areas where overlaps are concentrated. Areas of concentrated overlaps that differ from the surrounding areas (because they hold a number of biodiversity elements not found in other areas of concentration, for example) can provide a starting point for identifying independent sites; whereas areas of concentration that share many biodiversity elements may be best combined into a single site.

Topographic and environmental data such as elevation, bathymetry, ridgelines, seamounts, geological features and other identifiable elements of the land/seascape may also be used to delineate provisional ecological boundaries that can be refined using additional data to yield practical KBA boundaries (see Section 7.3.3). 7.3 Refining ecological boundaries to yield practical KBA boundaries KBA delineation is not complete until ecological boundaries are evaluated for their manageability and refined, if necessary, to yield a manageable site or sites. Initial ecological boundaries based on the trigger biodiversity element should be retained for future reference, even if they do not become the final KBA delineated boundary. Refining ecological boundaries to yield practical KBA boundaries will generally involve additional information (e.g., on land/resource tenure considerations) as well as stakeholder input. Once practical KBA boundaries have been delineated, KBA Proposers should check that these contain enough of each KBA trigger biodiversity element to meet relevant KBA thresholds. 7.3.1 Refining boundaries with respect to existing KBAs KBA delineation must take into account the boundaries of existing global or regional KBAs (including AZE sites, IBAs and KBAs identified under previous criteria). Many of these sites have national recognition, active conservation and monitoring initiatives and/or are linked to legislative and policy processes. This provides an opportunity for reassessment of existing KBAs for the original trigger biodiversity elements Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 133 (especially if these have not yet been assessed based on the KBA Standard) and a review of manageability. Some existing KBAs are very large, potentially encompassing multiple management units (e.g., logging concessions, forest reserves, and national parks). During the reassessment process, the same principles should be applied as for newly proposed KBAs. If the existing KBA cannot now be considered actually or potentially manageable as a unit, then the site should be redelineated and possibly partitioned into multiple smaller KBAs. Any reassessment should involve consensus-building with proposers of the existing KBA(s) to the extent possible (Section 8.2). Consultation with owners and managers of the management units within the existing KBA is also recommended (Sections 8.1, 8.3). The boundaries of an existing global or regional KBA may not be modified in such a way that the site no longer qualifies as a KBA for previous trigger biodiversity element(s) unless there is an agreement with the previous proposer that it makes sense to do this or the existing KBA extends to the landscape or seascape scale and does not meet the definition of a site under the KBA Standard. Delineation with respect to other sites of biodiversity importance and to protected or conserved areas is treated separately (see Section 7.3.2).

If Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 136 proposers of the existing KBA are unwilling to modify its boundary and the additional area does not qualify independently, KBA Proposers should seek advice from the KBA NCG or KBA RFP (in that order). The choice between these options will depend on the ecological significance of the areas outside the existing KBA for relevant biodiversity elements, the scale of manageability, and consensus-building with proposers of the existing KBA (see Section 8 on stakeholder consultation and involvement for further guidance). The case for modifying the existing KBA will generally be stronger if trigger species periodically move between the existing KBA and the additional area, such that coordinated management will likely increase the probability of persistence.

Source: Compiled by the KBA SAC. 7.3.2 Refining boundaries with respect to other sites of biodiversity importance, or protected or conserved areas When a biodiversity element triggering one or more KBA criteria falls within a site of biodiversity importance not yet recognised as a KBA (such as a site identified using other criteria or processes, e.g., an IPA, IMMA, Ramsar site) or other protected or conserved area where active management is underway, it may be advisable to use the boundary of the other site of biodiversity importance or other protected or conserved area to delineate the KBA. Like KBAs, sites of biodiversity importance identified using other criteria or processes often have national or local recognition, active conservation and monitoring initiatives, and may be linked to legislative and policy processes. Most protected or conserved areas are recognised management units with a goal of Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 137 safeguarding the biodiversity contained within them. Where the boundaries of other existing sites of biodiversity importance or protected or conserved areas are suitable for the biodiversity elements triggering the KBA criteria and are manageable units, conservation efforts can be strengthened by using the same boundaries for KBA delineation. However, if their boundaries are not suitable for KBA trigger biodiversity elements, a KBA may be proposed that overlaps with other sites of biodiversity importance, or protected or conserved areas, with justification (see Fig. 7.3.2 for an overview). Consultation with the managers of other sites of biodiversity importance or protected or conserved areas that overlap with proposed KBAs is recommended as they may have additional relevant information on the spatial extent of biodiversity elements and land/resource tenure and management in the area (see Section 8.1).

What if management units are small and ecological boundaries encompass multiple distinct management units? Ecological boundaries may encompass multiple management units or jurisdictions (e.g., landholdings, land management agencies, administrative areas). In this context, there are generally three options: Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 139 \u25cf If the area that lies within management units would qualify independently as a KBA, then identifying a separate KBA in each qualifying management unit will most likely align with the scale of practical management responsibilities and implementation (Fig. 7.3.3.1b). \u25cf If management units would not qualify independently as KBAs, but there is scope for effective management across the site, then a KBA may be delineated based on multiple management units (Fig. 7.3.3.1c). \u25cf If management units would not qualify independently as KBAs and are too small to provide a basis for coordinated management, then KBA delineation may be based on the ecological data used to derive initial KBA boundaries (Fig. 7.3.3.1d). What if management units are too large to be useful or do not exist? In some cases, management units may be too large to be useful (e.g., state/ provincial boundaries or EEZs) or may not exist (e.g., in wilderness areas or on the high seas, Fig. 7.3.3.1e). In such cases, the best approach is to base KBA delineation on the ecological data used to derive initial KBA boundaries (see Section 7.2).

Some KBA trigger biodiversity elements have a patchy distribution such that ecological boundaries contain a number of distinct areas separated by unsuitable areas. The decision on whether to delineate one or several KBAs depends on several factors: in particular, whether separate areas would qualify as KBAs if delineated as separate sites; and manageability. The case for a single site will be stronger if non- contiguous areas fall within a single protected or conserved area (Fig. 7.3.4.1), or where a single site is more likely to lead to the effective conservation of the KBA trigger biodiversity element(s).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e526302b-4378-4682-be23-343bc43f1aa0": {"__data__": {"id_": "e526302b-4378-4682-be23-343bc43f1aa0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Morocco - Pocket identification guide of main vulnerable species incidentally caught in Moroccan fisheries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "012cda73de52a1ed9662ffaafa6f27c8e1738fe237320966fd5a0b9b391caeb7"}, "2": {"node_id": "82747828-2c81-478b-be14-caf863a5e58b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "30890079e36dbc63d42f2a912d947319b66df7f757dca1fae0aeac59bcb62e04"}}, "hash": "449e79a8b28a06b20493ff5d9a9efaf80f1a1252ae05c38e0d0af15b98e4ecab", "text": "Figure 7.3.4.1 A KBA can comprise several non-contiguous areas: (a) biodiversity elements occur in patches within an existing KBA; (b, c) biodiversity elements occur in patches within an existing manageable unit such as a protected area \u2014 the solution shown in (b) is to delineate a single KBA following the protected area boundaries; whereas the alternative solution shown in (c) is to delineate one or more separate KBAs encompassing non-contiguous areas within a much larger manageable unit.

As with all KBAs, there should be scope for effective management across the site. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 142 The use of broader-scale catchment levels should generally be avoided, but may be useful for delineating KBAs proposed under Criterion C. When delineating KBA boundaries for freshwater biodiversity, it may be appropriate to add a buffer to include riverine or lakeshore habitat, especially where the persistence of trigger species depends on the management of adjacent terrestrial habitat (for example, woody debris plays an important role in creating habitat for salmon spawning and rearing). How can freshwater KBAs be aligned with existing terrestrial KBAs? In many cases, freshwater biodiversity elements fall within or align with the boundaries of existing KBAs identified for terrestrial biodiversity. In some cases, however, the boundaries of existing terrestrial KBAs are inappropriate for delineating KBAs for freshwater biodiversity. For example, boundaries that follow rivers may exclude some or all of the area important for freshwater trigger biodiversity elements. Where freshwater biodiversity elements overlap with an existing KBA, KBA Proposers should follow the guidelines in Section 7.3.1. Where freshwater biodiversity elements overlap with other sites of biodiversity importance, or protected or conserved areas, KBA Proposers should follow the guidelines in Section 7.3.2. What if ecological boundaries for single biodiversity elements extend to the landscape or seascape scale? For some biodiversity elements, especially area-demanding species that occur at low densities across large areas of contiguous habitat, it may not be possible to delineate manageable sites that encompass a sufficient quantity to meet a KBA threshold. These biodiversity elements may depend primarily on conservation actions at the landscape or seascape scale rather than the site scale of KBAs (Boyd et al., 2008; IUCN, 2016, p. 4). Whenever a large initial area (e.g., a landscape or seascape) is partitioned into smaller manageable units as the basis for identifying KBAs, it is important to estimate the population size of the smaller manageable units appropriately: \u25cf Under Criteria A1, B1-3 and E, a site must regularly hold the threshold proportion of a species\u2019 global population size. If a species is distributed over a landscape or seascape that is partitioned into smaller manageable sites, the population size regularly held by each site should add up to the landscape/seascape population size. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 143 \u25cf In contrast, Criterion D1 requires that a site predictably holds an aggregation meeting the threshold proportion of the global population size \u201cover a season\u201d. The phrase \u201cover a season\u201d is significant here. If a species forms a large aggregation that moves over the landscape or seascape over a season (e.g., a herd of wildebeest tracking fresh grass over a landscape), each of the smaller manageable sites may predictably hold the landscape/seascape population size over the season. What if overlapping biodiversity elements extend to the landscape or seascape scale? In some cases, distribution maps for different biodiversity elements yield multiple polygons that overlap in such a way that ecological boundaries surrounding them extend to the landscape or seascape scale (i.e. beyond the scale that is manageable as a unit, Fig. 7.3.4.2). In this case, delineation may involve parsing the different biodiversity elements into sites that are manageable in scale. The decision on whether to combine or separate management units into one or more KBAs will depend on whether ecological boundaries for some biodiversity elements align with management boundaries, whether management units qualify independently as KBAs, and the scope for effective management across management units. Figure 7.3.4.2 Ecological boundaries overlap and extend to the landscape or seascape scale. Management units are shown as irregular shapes with blue dashed boundaries; ecological boundaries are filled yellow polygons; proposed KBAs are shown as green boundaries.

What if ecological boundaries encompass multiple overlapping jurisdictions? In some cases, different resources or activities are managed by different agencies with spatially overlapping jurisdictions (Fig. 7.3.4.3). For example, fisheries may be managed by the fisheries management agency, shipping by the coastguard, or oil and gas development by an energy management agency. In this context, a KBA may be delineated based on the ecological data used to derive initial KBA boundaries (see Section 7.2). These initial KBA boundaries may be refined using topographic data (e.g., bathymetry, seamounts, and other bathymetric features) as appropriate, as long as there is scope for effective management at this scale.

Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 145 7.4 Documenting the delineation rationale and manageability 7.4.1 Documenting the delineation rationale Documentation of the rationale for selecting the final KBA boundaries is required for each proposed KBA. KBA Proposers should provide text briefly describing the boundaries and why they were chosen, in addition to submitting a shapefile representing the KBA boundaries. For example, this text may simply explain that the KBA boundaries follow the boundaries of a community reserve or align with the edges of contiguous habitat for a particular trigger species. This information will be important if there is a need to redelineate the site in the future (e.g., to accommodate additional trigger species or facilitate management). 7.4.2 Documenting manageability KBAs are sites that are actually or potentially manageable as a unit. KBA Proposers should provide text briefly explaining how manageability considerations were taken into account during site delineation. For example, this text may simply explain that the site is an existing national park, or combines a national park and state forest reserve that are managed under a coordinated management plan. This information is used in the review process and is required documentation. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 146 8. Stakeholder consultation and involvement The purpose of this section is to set out the stakeholder consultation and involvement that is required or recommended during the KBA identification and delineation process prior to KBA confirmation and publication on the KBA website, consistent with the KBA Standard. The process of KBA identification and delineation by itself does not include steps to advance management activity. According to the KBA Standard, \u201cKBAs are sites of importance for the global persistence of biodiversity. However, this does not imply that any specific conservation action, such as protected area designation, is required. Such management decisions should be based on [subsequent] conservation priority- setting exercises, which combine data on biodiversity importance with the available information on site vulnerability and the management actions needed to safeguard the biodiversity for which the site is important\u201d (IUCN, 2016, p. 8). The KBA Guidelines on stakeholder consultation and involvement relate solely to the KBA identification and delineation process, and do not cover steps to advance management activity (but see Section 8.4 for some relevant policies). For the purposes of KBA identification and delineation, we define key terms as follows: \u25cf Rights-holder: has legal or customary tenure or use rights over land/water/resources within a proposed or confirmed KBA; \u25cf Stakeholder: may affect or may be affected by the outcome of the KBA identification and delineation process; all rights-holders are stakeholders, but not all stakeholders are rights-holders; \u25cf Consultation: sharing information and seeking input; \u25cf Involvement: working with rights-holders or other stakeholders to ensure their concerns and aspirations are understood, considered, and reflected in the alternatives developed; \u25cf Collaboration and consensus-building: extends beyond consultation and involvement to building consensus and seeking agreement, where possible.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4b8b04e1-df6e-41bd-aaf4-6c1113457af2": {"__data__": {"id_": "4b8b04e1-df6e-41bd-aaf4-6c1113457af2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Morocco - Pocket identification guide of main vulnerable species incidentally caught in Moroccan fisheries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "552deacb0a4548a818f6615e39477aff113b6e393b54188ea694ea6a2d00dea0"}, "2": {"node_id": "3bc36812-9651-4af2-ba14-9392637c0e33", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/morocco-pocket-identification-guide-main-vulnerable-species-incidentally", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0837b9e3ac82dc542bfc8e6095f4482bb7aea6ffcb8d013a59be914625ba240a"}}, "hash": "79df56ace22574cb29bebe040f3fa284a1c4767c8e9a6b4c5f957519a3c5f1ca", "text": "Stakeholder consultation and involvement are important at various stages of the KBA identification and delineation process, as summarised in Table 8.1.

In many cases, a biodiversity element\u2019s range may fall wholly or mostly within the territory of an Indigenous or local community; in others, ILK may need to be interpreted in the broader context of the species' or ecosystem\u2019s overall distribution. ILK can also play an important role in KBA delineation by ensuring that this is informed by the best available information on customary tenure and resource management systems. Accessing ILK can be complex and will require different approaches in different communities. It is generally advisable to approach the leadership of the community first before going directly to particular knowledge-holders. This should be done with an understanding of the community's cultural practices, language(s) and traditions, in order to ensure any approach to an ILK knowledge-holder is done in a respectful, culturally appropriate manner, recognising they are equal partners in the information- sharing process. It is generally important to build trust with knowledge-holders, be open and transparent about how the information will be used, and consider issues relating to ownership of the information and permission to use the information (see below). The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 150 Ecosystem Services (IPBES) Approach to recognizing and working with indigenous and local knowledge provides further guidelines on working with ILK. Is Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) required to display KBAs on the KBA website? The KBA Proposer is responsible for ensuring that FPIC is granted and documented before displaying information based on previously unpublished ILK on the KBA website. Any KBA proposal that uses data derived from unpublished ILK must be flagged for expert review when the KBA proposal is submitted to the WDKBA; FPIC should be documented (see the KBA Proposal Process guidance). In rare cases, publication of information on KBAs could compromise the value of sacred natural sites (i.e. areas of land or water have special spiritual significance to peoples and communities, Verschuuren et al., 2010) if it encourages increased visitation. The KBA Proposer is therefore responsible for ensuring that FPIC is granted and documented before the publication or display of previously unpublished information regarding sacred natural sites, regardless of the information source. The location of sacred natural sites may not be widely known \u2014 it is therefore strongly recommended that KBA Proposers involve relevant ILK-holders, especially when working in regions where sacred natural sites may occur, to avoid revealing information on sacred natural sites inadvertently. Is Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) required before using an Indigenous name for a KBA? In regions that are important for Indigenous communities, using an Indigenous name may capture a site\u2019s local importance and have benefits in strengthening local support for the KBA. KBA Proposers are strongly recommended to involve Indigenous peoples and ensure that FPIC is granted before using an Indigenous name for a proposed KBA, especially if this is not the name of an existing KBA or the official name of a relevant geographic feature (e.g., the name of a mountain, lake or river used in maps produced by the national cartographic agency). (See the KBA Proposal Process guidance for further guidance on naming sites as KBAs.) How is consultation with knowledge-holders documented? Any consultation with knowledge-holders during the KBA identification and delineation process should be documented.

It is also recommended that KBA Proposers inform site managers of any such changes. Consensus-building with the proposers of existing KBAs is required before any trigger biodiversity elements are removed (e.g., following a site-level population decline) or if a significant change in delineation is proposed (for example, to accommodate additional trigger biodiversity elements, or because the existing KBA is not, or no longer, considered actually or potentially manageable as a unit). Mechanisms for contacting proposers of existing KBAs will be provided through the WDKBA, when it is fully functional. What happens if proposers of existing KBAs in the area of interest cannot be contacted or do not respond? As outlined in the KBA Standard (IUCN, 2016, p. 28), the aim is to avoid KBA boundaries that overlap with each other. KBA Proposers are required to make a genuine attempt to build consensus with proposers of existing KBAs that may overlap with newly proposed KBAs. If efforts to contact proposers of existing KBAs or resolve overlaps are unsuccessful, then KBA Proposers should involve the KBA NCG or RFP (in that order). What happens if proposers of existing KBAs in the area of interest are unwilling to modify them to accommodate additional trigger biodiversity elements or criteria? If proposers of existing KBAs are unwilling to modify site boundaries so that it is not possible to delineate KBAs for additional KBA trigger biodiversity elements or additional criteria without overlapping an existing KBA, then KBA Proposers should involve the KBA NCG or KBA RFP (in that order) to try to find a mutually acceptable solution. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 152 How is consensus-building with proposers of existing KBAs documented? KBA Proposers should provide text briefly summarising the process and outcomes of consensus-building with proposers of any existing KBAs that may overlap with a newly proposed KBA when submitting a KBA proposal as part of the delineation rationale (see the KBA Proposal Process guidance). This text should provide enough information for the KBA NCG, KBA RFP and the KBA Secretariat to understand and assess the decision and rationale. 8.3 Involvement of customary and legal rights-holders The process of KBA identification and delineation does not directly affect the customary or legal ownership/management/use rights of any rights-holders because KBA identification and delineation does not include any steps to advance management activity. Nevertheless, involvement of customary rights-holders is strongly recommended during the KBA identification and delineation process because KBAs can provide the basis for future conservation and management actions. Customary rights-holders need to be in a position to shape and anticipate this momentum early on, so they can be involved as they wish in decision-making about future management activities. This is especially important in situations where customary rights do not have legal backing and/or Indigenous people or other natural resource-dependent communities are typically marginalised in decision-making processes. FPIC will generally be required before any steps are made to advance management activities that might affect the rights of Indigenous people and other natural resource-dependent communities (see Section 8.4). Involvement of legal rights-holders (including land/water/resource owners, managers and users), protected area managers and government agencies responsible for conservation and management of land, water, and other natural resources is also encouraged because it engages them in the process and can help with identification of practical KBA boundaries. Customary and legal rights-holders may also serve as biodiversity knowledge-holders or tenure knowledge-holders (see Section 8.1). How can involvement of customary rights-holders be achieved? In many countries, customary rights-holders are represented at the national level by various national bodies, such as organisations or networks for Indigenous or forest- Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 153 dependent peoples, livestock-holders, fishers, etc. Where this is the case, involvement of customary rights-holders may be facilitated by seeking advice from representative organisations or networks, including advice on how best to reach out to customary rights-holders for particular sites. In most cases, however, involvement of customary rights-holders will take place at the local level.

This text should provide enough information for the KBA NCG and KBA RFP to understand and assess what was done. 8.4 Beyond KBA identification and delineation Guidance on stakeholder consultation and involvement relating to active management falls beyond the remit of the KBA Guidelines. Here, we note that the IUCN Policy on Conservation and Human Rights for Sustainable Development includes the guiding principle that FPIC is required when IUCN projects, activities, and/or initiatives take place on Indigenous peoples\u2019 lands and territories and/or impact natural and cultural resources, sites, assets, etc. More specifically, the IUCN Standard on Indigenous Peoples includes the following principle: \u201cIndigenous peoples are consulted and are active and effective participants in decision-making processes relevant to them and related to conservation activities supported by IUCN. Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) is obtained for any intervention affecting their rights and access to their lands, territories, waters and resources.\u201d More generally, there is a responsibility to involve any natural resource-dependent communities, including forest-dependent peoples, farmers, pastoralists and fishers, when considering conservation or management actions that might affect their rights. The Guidelines on Business and KBAs include the following recommendation: \u201cThe establishment of an inclusive and transparent stakeholder and right-holder engagement process (including, for example, representatives of national, regional, and Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 154 local government; indigenous peoples; local communities; and other elements of civil society) in planning and decision making is recommended. International best practices for stakeholder and right-holder engagement, including a rights-based approach and Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) for engaging with indigenous and traditional peoples and local communities, are implemented as early as possible in the project cycle and follow recognised best practices.\u201d Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 155 9. Data availability, quality and uncertainty The KBA Standard (IUCN, 2016, p. 5) states: \u201cThe KBA criteria have quantitative thresholds to ensure that site identification is transparent, objective and repeatable. It is important to compile the best available data for KBA identification, but the availability of high quality data differs significantly between different taxonomic groups\u2026\u201d The KBA Standard (IUCN, 2016, p. 7) states that: the data used to support KBA identification and delineation \u201c\u2026must be traceable to a reliable source and be recent enough to give confidence that the biodiversity elements are still present given the history of land use [and other types of] change in an area.\u201d 9.1 Data availability Global estimates of the number of mature individuals, range, ESH, and AOO, if available, will be pre-filled in the WDKBA when it is fully functional. Do data used in KBA identification and delineation need to be published? In the case of global estimates of assessment parameters that are not derived from IUCN Red List or Red List of Ecosystems assessments and have not been published previously, KBA Proposers should document how these parameters were estimated so that the method can be reviewed and updated in the future. KBA Proposers are responsible for ensuring that data used to estimate site-level values of assessment parameters, or to observe or infer the ecological integrity of a site, are referenced to a publication, are publicly available (e.g., through a free data-archiving service such as the Dryad Digital Repository), or are made available on request. In the latter case, a brief description of the data and data source and contact details for the data-holder should be included in the KBA proposal; this information can then be cited as in litt. (See the KBA Proposal Process guidance for more detailed guidance on required and recommendation documentation to support KBA identification and delineation.) 9.1.1 Sensitive data How are sensitive data treated? In some cases, publication of KBAs or information on species distribution patterns on the KBA website or Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT) could put the Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 156 biodiversity values of those sites at risk.

KBA Proposers should also follow these principles adapted from the Sensitive Data Access Restrictions Policy for the IUCN Red List. A sensitive data flag should be applied to species that: (a) are listed as CR or EN on the IUCN Red List under Criteria C and D, or have not been assessed for the IUCN Red List but would likely qualify as CR or EN under Criteria C and D; (b) have high economic value; (c) are listed or would likely be listed as threatened by trade; and (d) have important sites that are not generally known (e.g., an internet search engine such as Google cannot find these sites). Given that the KBA website provides more detailed information on the distribution of many species than the IUCN Red List, a more precautionary approach is appropriate for KBAs. Therefore, trigger species may also be flagged as sensitive if: \u25cf the species has a small global population size in the wild and is known to be exploited, collected, traded or utilised, resulting in the death or permanent removal of individuals from the wild (or belongs to a group of species that is exploited in this way); or \u25cf the species is threatened by widespread, unregulated exploitation of wild populations, resulting in the death or permanent removal of individuals from the wild; and: \u25cf the species has a life history that cannot sustain or recover easily from over- exploitation; and: \u25cf the proposed site is not generally known to hold a significant population of the species. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 157 It is recommended that KBA Proposers include information about sensitive trigger species in KBA proposals, but flag any species as sensitive if it meets the criteria set out above and there are concerns about publishing the information provided. Information included in KBA proposals on sensitive trigger species will be made available to the KBA Secretariat (including KBA RFPs) and possibly to IBAT subscribers, but will not be published on the KBA website. If KBA Proposers have any concerns about sharing sensitive data, they are asked to discuss these with their RFP. 9.2 Data quality 9.2.1 Observing and inferring the proportion of the global population size at a site For some of the species-based criteria (i.e. A1, B1-3), the proportion of the global population size at a site may be observed or inferred based on one or more assessment parameters. For D1-3, the proportion of the global population size at a site may be observed based on the number of mature individuals. How can the proportion of the global population size at the site be \u201cobserved\u201d? The population size at a site may be observed17 from well documented recent direct observations of mature individuals (e.g., the number of sea lion females observed nursing sea lion pups at a site). Animal tracking data collected using devices with high location accuracy (e.g., global positioning system, GPS) and camera traps are considered equivalent to direct observations. Population size may be based on counts of all mature individuals at a site or on counts of mature individuals in representative sampling areas (e.g., points, transects, quadrats) together with statistical assumptions about sampling (e.g., point sampling, distance sampling). Any statistical assumptions regarding the representativeness of sampling or detectability should be justified in the documentation. Statistical habitat models may be needed if densities within the site vary as a function of topographical or environmental covariates (see Appendix III.2).

How recent do data need to be when used to observe or infer the proportion of the global population size or global extent of an ecosystem type at a site, or ecological integrity? Estimates of abundance and distribution are likely to become less accurate over time. Data that were collected more than 8-12 years before the assessment should be used cautiously and only if there is no information suggesting that there has been significant relevant change in global or site-level population size or distribution patterns (i.e. a change likely to affect KBA qualification or delineation). Thus, for example, older data may be acceptable in a remote wilderness area that has seen little change in the last 50 years, but not in one that has seen recent extensive habitat transformation, or where trigger species may have suffered significant decline due to factors such as disease, invasive species, or over-exploitation. See Section 9.2.3 below for confirmation of presence. 9.2.2 Known, inferred and projected occurrences Range is defined as the current known limits of distribution of a species, accounting for all known, inferred or projected sites of occurrence (IUCN, 2012a). What are \u201cknown sites of occurrence\u201d? \u201cKnown\u201d sites of occurrences are known localities based on well documented recent direct observations (i.e. recent enough to give confidence that the biodiversity elements are still present, given the history of land-use change in an area, see IUCN, 2016, p. 7), excluding vagrancies. Note that the confirmed presence of proposed trigger species is required for all sites identified as KBAs under species-based criteria, except for species listed as CR (PE) or CR( PEW) at sites where they trigger KBA Criterion A1e (see Section 2.4.5). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 159 What are \u201cinferred sites of occurrence\u201d? \u201cInferred\u201d refers to the use of information about habitat characteristics, dispersal capability, rates and effects of habitat destruction and other relevant factors (such as exploitation), based on known localities, to deduce a very high likelihood of presence (IUCN SPC, 2022, Section 4.10.7). Note that inferred occurrences may be used to estimate the proportion of the global population size found at a site, but a KBA must include at least one known locality (i.e. confirmed presence, see Section 9.2.3). What are \u201cprojected sites of occurrence\u201d? \u201cProjected\u201d refers to spatially predicted occurrences based on habitat maps or models (IUCN SPC, 2022, Section 4.10.7). Any projected occurrences beyond the spatial extent of known localities (as defined by a minimum convex polygon based on known localities) should have a very high likelihood of presence, based on known localities and the species\u2019 dispersal capability. When used to estimate AOO, projected occurrences are subject to the three conditions outlined in Appendix III. Note that projected occurrences may be used to estimate the proportion of the global population size found at a site, but a KBA must include at least one known locality (i.e. confirmed presence, see Section 9.2.3). 9.2.3 Confirmation of presence and reproductive units For all sites proposed as KBAs, with the exception of sites identified under subcriterion A1e for species listed as CR (PE) or CR (PEW), the presence of the KBA trigger biodiversity elements at the site must be confirmed and documented (see the KBA Proposal Process guidance). This is especially important where KBA identification relies on area-based parameters (i.e. AOO, ESH, or range). How can presence be confirmed for species that are listed as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) or Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct in the Wild)? In the case of CR (PE) or CR (PEW) species, the proposed KBA should be the site where the species is most likely to occur, if it still exists.

Presence cannot be inferred simply from the presence of habitat, or habitat maps or models, with the exception of CR (PE) or CR (PEW) species under subcriterion A1e. What types of data can be used to confirm that the reproductive-units threshold is met? Wherever possible, confirmation that the reproductive-units threshold is met should be based on direct observations of the required number of reproductive units or mature individuals. Where this is not possible, some forms of inference may be used as described below: (i) Direct observations: Animal tracking data collected using devices with high location accuracy (e.g., GPS) and photographic data (collected in-person, by drone or camera trap) are considered equivalent to direct observations. (ii) Indirect observations: Indirect evidence of the minimum number of reproductive units or mature individuals may be used for cryptic species (e.g., active burrows indicating the threshold number of breeding pairs). Presence of immature individuals may be used if parental care is required (e.g., presence of pups for seals) or if both mature and immature individuals are sedentary (e.g., presence of tadpoles for frogs or toads). (iii) Information in the IUCN Red List account indicating that the species likely occurs in numbers that exceed the reproductive-units threshold at the site: For example, the species is described as \u201dabundant\u201d, \u201ccommon\u201d or \u201cfrequent\u201d at the site. (Note that relevant information may be found in sections on Geographic Range, Population, Habitat and Ecology, or Conservation Actions.) Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 161 (iv) Inference based on continuous presence: The species has been present at the site for multiple generations and the site population size is not declining, indicating ongoing successful reproduction. (v) Inference based on the number of mature individuals at the site: A reproductive unit is defined as 1 or 2 mature individuals and the minimum population size regularly held at the site is estimated at \u2265100 mature individuals (or \u226550 mature individuals for 5 reproductive units); (vi) Inference based on the proportion of the global population size held at the site together with the species\u2019 IUCN Red List category and criteria: In some cases, the proportion of the population size estimated to occur at the site, together with the species\u2019 IUCN Red List category and criteria indicate that it is unlikely that the site holds fewer than the threshold number of reproductive units or mature individuals. It can be inferred that a site holds at least 10 reproductive units in the following circumstances: a) the site regularly holds effectively the entire global population size of a species listed as VU, Near-Threatened (NT) or Least Concern (LC); b) a reproductive unit is defined as 1 or 2 mature individuals and the species has been assessed as EN (but not under IUCN Red List Criterion D), indicating a minimum global population size of at least 250 mature individuals, and the site holds at least 40% of known localities or AOO (for 5 reproductive units); c) a reproductive unit is defined as 1 or 2 mature individuals and the species has been assessed as VU (but not under IUCN Red List Criterion D1), NT or LC, indicating a minimum population size of at least 1,000 mature individuals, and the site holds at least 20% of known localities or AOO. (vii) Inference based on geographically separate occurrences: If occurrence records represent observations of mature individuals and the species is sedentary, territorial or otherwise of limited mobility (such that it is unlikely that different occurrences represent the same individuals), then the minimum number of reproductive units at the site may be inferred from the number of known geographically separate occurrences at the site. The definition of \u201cgeographically separate\u201d will depend on the mobility of mature individuals and other relevant aspects of the behaviour, ecology and reproductive system of the species and should guide the number and spatial dispersion of known occurrences required Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 162 to infer that the reproductive-units threshold is met.

Any inference should include confirmation that adequate habitat exists at the site to support the species in numbers meeting or exceeding the reproductive-units threshold and that there is no reason to expect that the species does not occur at the site in such numbers (for example, as a result of pressure from hunting, fishing, invasive predators or competitors, inadequate prey, disease). How recent do data need to be when used to confirm species presence or reproductive units at a site? The data used to confirm presence and the number of reproductive units (where required) should be recent \u2013 ideally collected within the last 8-12 years before KBA identification. Older data should be used conservatively, especially for species listed as globally threatened under IUCN Red List Criterion A2, A3 or A4, for other species known to have suffered recent population declines, or if the site has suffered significant habitat loss or other types of degradation in the intervening period. Clear justification should be given in the documentation for using older data, up to a maximum of 50 years (except for CR (PE) or CR (PEW) species). Data older than 50 years may only be used to confirm the presence of species at sites where the species triggers subcriterion A1e and the species has not been assessed as CR (PE) or CR (PEW). KBA Proposers should confirm that adequate habitat persists at the site and explain why the species may have escaped detection if it still exists. The logic for allowing older data in this context is as follows: If a site is thought to hold effectively the entire global population size of a species, but the species has not been listed as CR (PE) or CR (PEW) even though it has not been observed at the site for more than 50 years, it can be inferred that the IUCN Red List assessors believe the species still occurs at the site. If older data were not allowed in this context, then it Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 163 would not be possible to confirm any site as a KBA for some CR or EN species that would otherwise trigger subcriterion A1e. This would be contrary to the intent of the KBA Standard and inconsistent with the guideline that KBAs can be identified under subcriterion A1e for species listed as CR (PE) or CR (PEW) without confirmation of presence. Surveys to confirm the presence of trigger biodiversity elements should be conducted during the 8-12 years between initial KBA confirmation and reassessment and between reassessments, so that presence can be confirmed based on recent data at the time of reassessment. Data used to confirm presence and reproductive units (where required) in KBA reassessments should not be older than 8-12 years unless the justification for older data is very strong and it is very unlikely that the species has been extirpated. How are presence and reproductive units documented? Confirmation of presence and that the number of reproductive units at a site meets the relevant threshold (where required) should, ideally, be referenced to a publication or other publicly available data source (e.g., IUCN Red List account, a peer-reviewed journal article or publicly available site monitoring report). Where this is not possible, for options (i)-(iv) above (under What types of data can be used to confirm that the reproductive-units threshold is met?), the knowledge of one or more named biodiversity knowledge-holders may be used instead. Biodiversity knowledge-holders should have sufficient expertise to provide reliable confirmation of species identification. Ideally, the biodiversity knowledge-holder(s) will have made a recent visit to the site, but expert review of data recently collected at the site may also be used. In particular, species that are challenging to identify in the field may be confirmed later through expert verification of specimens, photographs, video or other evidence collected at the site. Experts should provide a brief explanation of the data used to confirm presence and/or that the number of reproductive units meets the threshold (see examples in Appendix VIII). For option (v) above, it is only necessary to indicate the basis for inference (e.g., with a reference to (a), (b), (c), (d), or (e) ), as calculations can be made automatically in the WDKBA when it is fully functional.

See Sections 4.3.4 and 4.4.4. 9.3 Uncertainty 9.3.1 Types of uncertainty There are two main types of uncertainty that may affect KBA identification: \u25cf Measurement uncertainty, such as uncertainty about the true number of mature individuals at any point in time, can often be reduced by collecting more data (for example, by increasing the sample size or number of sampling occasions) using appropriate sampling, measurement and estimation methods. \u25cf Ecological variation (often called \u201cprocess variation\u201d), such as interannual variation in the true number of mature individuals at a site, can be a source of uncertainty as to whether a site qualifies as a KBA, even if the number of mature individuals is counted precisely each year. 9.3.2 Dealing with uncertainty In many cases, the population size at a site will be either well above or well below the threshold for qualification as a KBA. Uncertainty is only significant for KBA identification when the estimated site-level population size lies close to the relevant threshold, such that there is uncertainty about whether or not the site qualifies. For example, if the minimum site-level population-size estimate exceeds the relevant threshold based on the maximum global population-size estimate, then the site would qualify as a KBA regardless of uncertainty. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 165 In the process of identifying sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity, it is important to balance the risks of omission and commission errors, i.e. the risks of failing to identify a site that actually qualifies (omission error) and the risks of identifying a site that does not actually qualify (commission error). High rates of omission error may lead to biodiversity loss, but high rates of commission error could deflate the value of identifying KBAs and may dilute conservation resources. Note that the low thresholds for Criteria A1 and A2 relative to the other criteria provide a built-in precautionary approach to identifying sites of importance for globally threatened species and ecosystem types. How to deal with measurement uncertainty? The general principle for handling measurement uncertainty is to balance the risks of omission and commission error. In the context of measurement uncertainty, a site should be proposed if it is more likely than not that it meets the relevant threshold. For example, if the global population size is 10,000 mature individuals, and the site- level population size is most likely greater than 1,000 individuals, then the site population most likely exceeds a 10% threshold. In other words, the site would qualify if there was a greater than 50% chance that it exceeds 1,000 mature individuals. Consider the data summarised in Table 9.3.2.1 \u2014 in this case, the site would qualify because the median estimate exceeds the threshold (i.e. there is a greater than 50% chance that the site population exceeds the threshold). The determination of whether a site is more likely than not to meet the relevant threshold may be based on quantitative or qualitative analysis (e.g., a statistical analysis or an expert-based weighing of various types of evidence).

Where there is a choice, the order of preference is as follows: maximum likelihood estimate, \u201cbest\u201d, median, mean, midpoint of the maximum and minimum. 18 If the only data available are presence/absence data, then KBA Proposers will need to infer the proportion of the global population size at the site based on one of the area- based assessment parameters, which include number of localities. How to deal with ecological variation? Ecological variation (e.g., fluctuations in a species\u2019 population size or the extent of ecosystem type attributable to random environmental variation) is distinct from long- term trend (see Section 3.1 for guidance on handling trends). It likely occurs to some extent for all species at all sites, as well as for dynamic ecosystem types (e.g., kelp forests). Ecological variation is often substantial for sites important for biological processes, such as demographic aggregations (D1), ecological refugia (D2) and recruitment sources (D3). The general principles for handling ecological variation are based on the application of Ramsar Criteria 5 and 6 (Ramsar, 2018). A site predictably holds the threshold population size if the following conditions are met: (i) Interannual variation: the number of mature individuals at the site is known to have met or exceeded the threshold population size in at least two thirds of the years for which adequate data are available for the relevant season (e.g., the breeding season in the case of a breeding aggregation); the total number of years considered should not be fewer than three; or (ii) Intra-annual variation: the mean of the maximum number of mature individuals at the site during the relevant season meets or exceeds the threshold population size; the mean should be taken over at least five years.19 For example, adult female marine turtles return to specific nesting beaches to lay their eggs, but, in most cases, individual females do not return every year, so that the 18 If necessary, the maximum likelihood, \u201cbest\u201d and median can be compared to each other. The mean should only be compared to the maximum likelihood, \u201cbest\u201d or median if measurement error is limited. The mid-point of the maximum and minimum should not be compared to the other metrics. 19 Note that the mean may be used here, instead of the median, for consistency with the Ramsar criteria. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 167 number of nesting females that use a site over a breeding season can vary substantially from one year to the next. Suppose the site threshold under Criterion D1a is 1,000 mature females. Under (i) above, the site would be considered to predictably hold 1,000 mature females during the nesting season if it holds 1,000 mature females in at least two thirds of nesting seasons. Consider the data set out in Table 9.3.2.2. The site would qualify under D1a because the site exceeds threshold numbers in two out of three years. Table 9.3.2.2 Ecological variation.

For example, during the dry season, large flocks of a particular waterfowl species move among several distinct wetlands depending on prey availability, so that the number of mature individuals counted at a particular wetland can vary substantially from one day to the next as well as interannually. (The wetlands are too far apart to be manageable as a unit.) The population-size threshold for this species under Criterion D1a is 1,000 mature individuals. Consider the data set out in Table 9.3.2.3, comprising counts of mature individuals on a number of survey days each year over six years. Under (ii) above, the site would qualify under D1a because the mean of the maximum number of mature individuals counted at the site during the dry season over the six years with available data exceeds the population-size threshold.

Returning to the marine turtle example, consider the data set out in Table 9.3.2.4.

What happens if different assessment parameters point to different conclusions? See Section 3.1. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 169 10. Reassessment The term \u201creassessment\u201d is used synonymously with the term \u201cre-evaluation\u201d throughout the KBA Guidelines. Confirmed KBAs should be reassessed against the KBA criteria and thresholds at least once every 8-12 years, although more frequent monitoring of KBAs is recommended wherever possible. If the original KBA Proposer is no longer available, the KBA NCG or KBA RFP (in that order) may identify a group to work on reassessment. Reassessment of sites identified as KBAs is especially important in the context of climate change, as climate change may affect biodiversity to such an extent that a site increases in importance and qualifies under additional criteria or loses importance and ceases to qualify. The reassessment process also presents a good opportunity to check whether there are any additional species or ecosystem types that might trigger KBA status at the site. 10.1 Reasons for a change in KBA status Why might the status of a confirmed KBA change? The focus here is on changes in the status of confirmed KBAs and delisting of KBAs. KBA Proposers or KBA NCGs may also decide to reassess sites that almost qualified in previous KBA identification processes, but information on sites that do not qualify is not stored in the WDKBA, so that process is not covered here. A site that has been confirmed as a KBA may change status for one or more of the following reasons: A.

An 8-12-year window was selected as a practical compromise; it encourages a shorter reassessment timeframe (8 years is ideal), while recognizing that it will often take longer and some flexibility will be needed (12 years is the maximum). For each KBA trigger biodiversity element, the baseline for the 8-12 year window is the previous assessment for that element, not the year when data were collected. A site will be retained in the WDKBA after 12 years, but flagged as \u201cneeds updating\u201d. A confirmed KBA will not lose its KBA status solely on the basis of old data or the need for reassessment.20 Earlier updates to documentation and reassessment, if appropriate, is encouraged in the case of: \u25cf a taxonomic change to a trigger species; \u25cf a change in threat category of a trigger species or ecosystem type for a site confirmed as a KBA under Criterion A1 or A2. 20 New data showing that the site does not qualify would be required in any KBA Appeals process. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 171 Earlier reassessment is also encouraged if: \u25cf new information becomes available \u25cf a site suffers a catastrophic event (i.e. a genuine change) leading to the irreversible loss of a trigger species or ecosystem type or to loss of a site\u2019s ecological integrity. Earlier reassessment is required if: \u25cf there is a change to the site boundary. Ideally, all trigger biodiversity elements will be reassessed at the same time on 8-12 year cycles, even if some have been added more recently. Interim reassessments of particular species (e.g., following a taxonomic change, change in threat category, or new information affecting a particular species) can be conducted individually without reassessing all other trigger biodiversity elements. What about AZE sites, IBAs or other KBAs identified under previously published criteria? AZE sites, IBAs or other KBAs identified under previously published criteria that are shown to meet the criteria and thresholds in the KBA Standard, and for which minimum documentation requirements have been met, will be recognised as global KBAs. Those that may meet global KBA criteria and thresholds, but for which the data have not yet been compiled to demonstrate the case, will be flagged as \u201cglobal/regional status not yet determined\u201d and considered a priority for update. Those that do not meet global KBA criteria and thresholds but which do meet previously established regional criteria and thresholds will be recognised as regional KBAs. The start date for the 8-12 year reassessment period for AZE sites, IBAs or other KBAs identified under previously published criteria is the publication date of the KBA Standard (i.e. April 2016). 10.3 Reassessment process What does KBA reassessment involve? During the reassessment process, KBA NCGs or KBA Proposers should use the following checklist: \u25cf For sites that were confirmed as a KBA under any of the species-based criteria (i.e. A1, B1-3, D1-3, E), check whether there have been any taxonomic changes to trigger species (see Section 2.2.1). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 172 \u25cf For sites that were confirmed as a KBA under Criterion A1 or A2, check whether there has been any change in the threat category of the trigger species or ecosystem type, such that the site no longer qualifies as a KBA under Criterion A1 or A2. \u25cf For each KBA trigger biodiversity element, check whether there has been a change in the global or site-level values of assessment parameters (e.g., based on new or more reliable information), such that the biodiversity element no longer meets relevant thresholds. \u25cf For each KBA trigger biodiversity element, reconfirm the KBA trigger biodiversity element\u2019s presence at the site, in numbers that meet or exceed the reproductive- units threshold, where applicable. It is recommended that data used to confirm presence in KBA reassessments under any of the criteria should not be older than 8-12 years. \u25cf For each confirmed KBA, check whether there have been any changes in manageability or other changes indicating that KBA delineation should be re- visited.

Reassessment will generally follow similar lines to the original assessment (e.g., in terms of the set of ecological integrity indicators), but may expand on the original assessment if additional relevant data are available. How are KBAs identified under Criterion E reassessed? For sites identified as KBAs under Criterion E, reassessment needs to be conducted at the network level, as irreplaceability is the property of a site within a network rather than an individual site in isolation (see Section 6). Reassessment may be based on the same geographic extent and taxonomic scope and methods as the original assessment. In this case, reassessment will generally involve a review of datasets and species representation targets followed by re-analysis. However, KBA Proposers are encouraged to expand the taxonomic scope if newly available data allow for the Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 173 inclusion of additional species. KBA Proposers are also encouraged to check the set of recommended decision support tools (Section 6.2.5) and update the methods used, if appropriate. What happens if a KBA no longer qualifies because of a genuine increase in the global population size? (i) Effective conservation of a trigger species at a KBA may contribute to an increase in the global population size. In that case, the proportion of the global population size held at the site would be expected to increase. The KBA would only lose its status if successful conservation of a globally threatened trigger species led to its downlisting on the IUCN Red List and a change in the relevant KBA criteria or thresholds (e.g., KBA Criterion A1 no longer applies). In this case, the site should be reassessed against all the KBA criteria to clarify its status. The site may be highlighted as a conservation success on the IUCN Green List, subject to meeting the IUCN Green List criteria. (ii) Effective conservation of a trigger species elsewhere in its range may also contribute to an increase in the global population size. The proportion of the global population size held at the site may decrease and/or a globally threatened trigger species may be downlisted on the IUCN Red List, leading to a change in the relevant KBA criteria or thresholds. In this case, the site should be reassessed against all the KBA criteria to clarify its status. If it no longer qualifies under any global KBA criteria, it will no longer be a global KBA, but may still qualify as a regional KBA following guidelines for regional application of the KBA criteria and thresholds (to be developed in due course). What happens if a KBA no longer qualifies because of a genuine reduction in site-level population size? The reassessment process may indicate that a site no longer qualifies as a global KBA because of a genuine reduction in the site-level population size, ecosystem extent or ecological integrity. If this reduction could be reversed in the next 8-12 years through proposed restoration activities, the site will be flagged as \u201crestoration dependent\u201d in the WDKBA to allow for restoration. The KBA NCG or KBA Proposer should review the site\u2019s status in two years. If restoration activities are not underway by that time, the site\u2019s change in status will be confirmed (i.e. after two years). If restoration activities are underway but do not enable the site to recover its KBA status by the next reassessment, then the change in status will be reviewed and confirmed at that time (i.e. after 8-12 years). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Version 1.2 174 Conversely, if the reduction in the site-level population size, ecosystem extent or ecological integrity is unlikely to be reversed through proposed restoration activities in the next 8-12 years (i.e. before the next reassessment), the site should be reassessed against all the KBA criteria to clarify its status. The site\u2019s change in status will be indicated in the WDKBA immediately after it has been reviewed and confirmed and on the KBA website at the next update. If the site no longer qualifies under any global KBA criteria, it will no longer be a global KBA, but may still qualify as a regional KBA following guidelines for regional application of the KBA criteria and thresholds (to be developed in due course).
