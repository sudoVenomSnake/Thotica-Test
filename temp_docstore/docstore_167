Turning out to be a learning experience for IUCN too, the trainer discovered that a lot of time was spent discouraging the use of jargon and overly technical, academic or scientific language. Significant efforts were made to make reports less intellectual and more reader-friendly. Trainees (R) strive to improve their writing under the guidance of journalism trainer - Jack Laurenson (L) \u00a9 ATZ 5 The enthusiastic participants were mentored and supported as they tackled complex issues such as drought, mangrove conservation, river pollution and sustainable farming, as well as protected area management and deforestation. By the workshop\u2019s end, participants could better report on the initiatives they were involved with and demonstrated significant progress with their understanding of journalistic writing and how it can be applied to their own communications strategies. CHALLENGING ISSUES & IMPORTANT STORIES The attendees, who are all working in important advocacy, research and outreach projects around Myanmar, did not shy away from engaging with difficult subject matter. Despite English not being their first language and Burmese being of most use on a day-to-day basis, the writers dived straight into the process of writing articles about complex but compelling issues. Friends of Wildlife (FOW) produced an important article titled Saving Burma\u2019s Deep Forest. The author, Khant Nyar Aung, explored the conservation challenges faced by one of his country\u2019s most biodiverse forests. Covering over 1,181 square kilometers, Mahamyaing is home to many endangered species, including the elusive clouded leopard. Another FOW participant, Thawdar Nyein, wrote about how her organization is engaging communities in the Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary. Conservationists there are striving to help villages balance their need for wood, food and other forest resources with Myanmar\u2019s conservation goals. Through education and engagement, locals are starting to realize it\u2019s logical to conserve the sanctuary for later generations. Yuzana Wai and Khin Yae Kyi Tar from MERN worked together on a compelling piece about the white-browed nuthatch; endemic to Myanmar but now only surviving in a handful of locations. It\u2019s classed as Endangered by IUCN. MSDN writers are pleased to present to a larger audience a report that highlights a concerning example of what can happen to communities when they lose their mangrove forests. In many Myanmar coastal villages, is it has had shocking results on both nature and communities. Thiri Sandar Zaw, writing for BANCA, documented the surveying efforts being undertaken by researchers as they better determine the conservation status of the Baer\u2019s Pochard; a migratory duck that\u2019s listed as Critically Endangered by IUCN. Seinne Lai of DEAR decided to write about an interesting success story, bringing attention to how small-scale sustainable crab farming is having beneficial effects on fishing communities that his organization works with. 6 And finally, Kyaw Thet Naing, a field research officer from FREDA, presents a troubling summary of important findings in his article, Assessing a Threat: Mercury in the Irrawaddy River. MOVING FORWARD Building on the experience in Yangon, IUCN moved ahead with a similar event in Phnom Penh, Cambodia in March and will return to Myanmar in April for follow-up input with participants. Whilst participants made real, tangible progress with their understanding of journalistic writing approaches and their ability to apply them to their own work, IUCN views this as the start of an ongoing process of improvement that will require further commitment. STORIES IN DETAILS: 1.1. Saving Burma\u2019s Deep Forest Trainee: Khant Nyar Aung - Friends of Wildlife Myanmar is one of the most beautiful and biodiverse countries in Southeast Asia. We are surrounded by lush green forest, deep blue ocean and rugged mountains that are home to many varieties of animal species, which are mostly able to live peacefully together with humans.

There are many banteng too, also known as wild cattle, and guar - the tallest species of wild cattle in Southeast Asia. They are working-animals which have been domesticated in several places in Southeast Asia, but in Mahamyaing they remain wild and free. Serow, curious goat-like mammals that are used for the sign of Capricorn in zodiac astrology, are also native to this wonderful forest. But at the boundary of the forest, where many villages are located, threats to the future of Mahamyaing are looming. Over recent years, many local people have extracted timber, bamboo and hunted inside the forest. But nowadays, the forest has also become a golden-chest for various logging businesses that are moving in. Local people have also become involved in the illegal wildlife trade and extraction of timber and bamboo. Their daily income is high by doing such illegal activities and, lacking good alternatives, many are happy to work for these shady businessmen. Moreover, even women and young adults have started to work for them. Loading wood or bamboo to trucks in exchange for a small payment. Sadly, many appear to not realize the value of their forest. Few in these villages advocate strongly for forest conservation. New generations must be engaged with and educated about the importance of conservation, in order to help communities better understand and value sustainability, conservation and biodiversity. That's why the Forest Department and the Nature Wildlife Conservation Division are trying to protect the forest by setting up systematic approaches to conservation and effective protected area management. But it's impossible without local people\u2019s participation. 8 In order to achieve more local people\u2019s involvement, Friends of Wildlife (FOW) continues to carry out activities that relate to community relations, education and engagement. Meetings with village authorities and community leaders for example, are arranged regularly to enable discussion of pressing issues and to find solutions. Local people here are starting to adapt their lifestyles to better accommodate the deep forest that surrounds them and sustains them. Working with experts and the authorities, these communities will improve the ways they can protect their forest for their future generation. 1.2. Community Challenges in Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary Trainee: Thawdar Nyein - Friends of Wildlife Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary in Kanbau Township, Sagaing Division, is one of Myanmar's most important reserves for threatened wildlife, including one of the largest populations of Eld\u2019s deer left in the world. The endangered Eld\u2019s deer is one of Chatthin\u2019s most vulnerable species. Friends of Wildlife are working with local communities to promote the importance of local conservation. (Photo: Wikimedia) 9 The park was established in 1941 and covers an area of 268 sq. km that's covered in dense vegetation, such as low, high and flooded indaing forests, as well as mixed deciduous forests and grass savanna matrix forests. There are 25 villages surrounding the border of Chatthin and three villages located inside the Sanctuary\u2019s borders, meaning that Chatthin is the primary source of forest products for many local communities who are detached from other markets and resources. Many local residents rely on the protected area for food, timber, shelter and also for their livelihoods. In the last decade, the dam named Thaphanseik was built nearby, where villages had been settled, resulting in many having to move and resettle near or inside the Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary. Many of the villagers lost their farm land, job opportunities and sources of income, meaning that they now need to rely more on the abundant resources provided by the sanctuary to make a living and support their families. Another reason that the villagers are increasingly relying on Chatthin is that there was a destructive drought in the area a few years ago, which continues to affect the region. Villagers say that they can\u2019t farm effectively and efficiently and that the yield of their harvests is often poor, in terms of both quality and quantity. As a result, many have begun undertaking illegal activities, such as poaching of protected Eld\u2019s deer and other protected wildlife, as well as the extraction of timber, orchids, charcoal and other forest products. The Eld\u2019s deer\uf0beone of few deer species indigenous to Southeast Asia\uf0behas seen its population decline substantially in recent years, resulting in its assessment as Endangered by IUCN. Populations of Eld\u2019s deer and other wildlife, as well as other important natural resources that form a vital part of Chatthin's threatened ecosystems, are decreasing year by year, according to research.

Friends of Wildlife (FOW) works with local communities to understand the challenges they face, while improving conservation capacity and bettering environmental education. 10 Nature classes in local schools are a vital part of this outreach. In addition, FOW has established community forestry and support the villagers with livestock challenges, such as helping them to acquire farmable animals like pigs and chickens. Another priority is setting up home gardens to reduce dependence on forest fauna, and providing stoves that reduce reliance on fuelwood extracted from the wildlife sanctuary. Although some local people understand and know the vital role that forests play, they are hesitant to change their way of life because of possible financial implications and the needs of their families. But communities here are, over time and with the help of partners such as FOW, embracing change and learning to protect their environment. But if people continue to misuse and abuse Myanmar\u2019s forests in an unregulated and unsustainable way, they will disappear in the future. With them, the Eld\u2019s deer and many other endangered species that depend on them will be gone forever too. 1.3. Lending a Hand to the White-browed Nuthatch Trainee: Yuzana Wai and Khin Yae Kyi Tar, Myanmar Environment Rehabilitation- conservation Network, MERN The White-browed nuthatch, one of the many endemic bird species of Myanmar, is on the verge of extinction. Now found only in the Northern Chin Hills, a mountainous region of Chin State near the Indian border, the little bird is engaged in an ongoing battle for its very existence. The bird\u2019s population has been decimated by deforestation and habitat degradation and remaining numbers of this beautiful bird are also rapidly declining in its final stronghold of Chin State. Assessed as Endangered by IUCN in 2000, the White- browed nuthatch population in Myanmar is estimated to consist of fewer than 10,000 mature individuals, according to surveyors. Now, the main driver of potential extinction is shifting cultivation and agricultural systems where plots of land are cultivated temporarily, then abandoned and allowed to revert to their natural state while the cultivator moves to another location. A camera-trap photo shows a white- browed nuthatch from Nat Ma Taung National Park, Chin State 11 This transient system of farming is effective when eco-systems are treated responsibly and given enough time to recover. Often however, such activities can greatly disturb the bird\u2019s natural habits, degrade its habitat whilst interrupting breeding and other natural activities. The Chin Hills provide several ecological diversities due to their tropical climate, meaning many endangered species such as the nuthatch can be found there in locations such as Nat Ma Taung National Park. But shifts in land use from utilizing forested land to cleared agricultural land have caused serious degradation and loss of habitat to species that depend on the forests. \u201cWe found that forests up to 2000 m of Chin Hills are almost totally destroyed by shifting cultivation\u201d said Mr. Yan Aung, the Field Officer of Myanmar Biodiversity Conservation Network, a researcher looking into endangered species in Chin Hills. \u201cMore than two third of local residents depend on the agriculture for their livelihood and basic needs,\u201d he added. Gradual decreases in forested area have affected the availability of food, nesting areas and rate of infant mortality of the white-browed nuthatch, resulting in a significant impact on overall population numbers. \u201cWe have become familiar with this bird over the past 20 years, they\u2019re noticeable because of their colorful appearance, but they are rarely found these days,\u201d said a 40 year-old local villager. Although Chin State is home to important areas of conservation such as Nat Ma Taung, there is little in the way of effective protection strategies for conserving endangered species. According to experts, it is now vital to conduct detailed population surveys and research in the southern Chin Hills to determine the exact range, status and requirements for conservation of many endangered birds. Promoting better conservation awareness and knowledge of the law in Chin Hills communities is also required to reduce habitat loss, according to many researchers. \u201cIf the government implements enforcement of regulations on logging, shifting cultivation and hunting within Nat Ma Taung National Park, we can definitely conserve this beautiful endemic species and begin to control the decreasing population\u201d said Dr. Phyoe, a researcher working for the park.

What Happens When You Lose Your Mangroves Trainee: Ain Din - MSDN 12 Many countries in Southeast Asia have learned the hard way that the loss of their mangrove forests can have damaging and surprising repercussions, for both wildlife and communities. Countries such as Thailand, Cambodia and Malaysia face their own daunting mangrove challenges; in Myanmar, the vast majority of coastal mangroves have been cleared or severely depleted. According to WWF, Myanmar's coastal mangroves are some of the most degraded or destroyed mangrove systems in the Indo-Pacific region, facing threats from human activity such as forestry, agriculture and development as well as natural occurrences such as increasing sedimentation of the Irrawaddy River. In Ain Din, a coastal village in Ye Township, Mon State, a 500-acre mangrove forest used to protect Ain Din, as well as Hnikroke and Yaepawthaung, two nearby villages with a combined total population of about 7,000. But as has happened in so many parts of Myanmar, the mangroves were encroached upon and cut down. The loss of these mangroves had immediate impacts for both wildlife and nearby communities. Without the protective mangrove forest, a mile-long stretch of the coastal embankment has collapsed, resulting in over 200 acres of paddy being contaminated by sea water. The land now lies infertile and empty. Coastal mangrove forests often provide vital resources and protection from flooding for nearby human populations. Communities that lose them, such as many in Myanmar, are learning tough lessons.(Photo: Wikimedia) 13 Incomes have declined, jobs have disappeared, and families are struggling to educate their children. Many people have moved away from this area altogether, in search of new employment and better opportunities. Habitats too are struggling as a result of the lost mangroves. There are fewer shrimp and crabs now. They previously depended on mangroves as a nursery habitat. As a result, there are also fewer birds too. Having seen the effects caused by their loss, many local people now better understand the value of conserving mangroves but need outside help to restore them. In response, monks and community leaders have recently organized meetings between all three affected villages, resulting in the formation of a 15-member committee that met the township authorities to discuss getting external assistance with replanting the mangroves, rebuilding the embankment and helping their struggling community. They also contacted Myanmar Social Development Network (MSDN), which organized a workshop in the Ain Din monastery. At this event, participants agreed to contribute money and time to restoration projects. This is vital because government and international donors are much more likely to invest in restoration and recovery if they see that the beneficiaries are making a contribution themselves. While the future still remains unclear for Ain Din\u2019s mangroves, the community now better understands their importance and has committed to work with outside partners to restore this vital habitat. 1.5. Assessing and Monitoring the Baer\u2019s Pochard in Central Myanmar Trainee: Thiri Sandar Zaw - BANCA In Myanmar, one of Southeast Asia\u2019s wildest countries, a total of 188 water bird species, including 88 migratory species, have been recorded to date. The Baer\u2019s Pochard is a much-welcomed winter visitor to Myanmar. Once abundant globally, in 2012 the diving duck was downgraded to Critically Endangered by IUCN leading to increased surveying and monitoring of the troubled bird. The acceleration of decline has been determined by measuring the fewer and fewer numbers at breeding grounds. The current global population is estimated to have fallen dramatically to between 150 and 700 mature individuals, according to studies. 14 The Baer\u2019s Pochard tends to breed around lakes with rich aquatic vegetation, in dense grass or in rivers and ponds surrounded by forest. Such areas in Russia and China are often their preferred breeding grounds, but in China the duck has been hunted to the brink of extinction. In winter, they appear around freshwater lakes and reservoirs, such as those in Myanmar, India and Vietnam. The 2004 Wetland Inventory for Myanmar reported nine inland lakes with records of Baer\u2019s Pochad; Indawgyi, Inlay, Taung-tan, Moeyungyi Wetlands Wildlife Sanctuary, Paleik Inn, Kalartan River, Kyee-ni Inn and Myithar Lake.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "32aeaf7a-ad48-424c-927f-ffa0a4d6b27a": {"__data__": {"id_": "32aeaf7a-ad48-424c-927f-ffa0a4d6b27a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/results-yangon-writing-workshop", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Results of Yangon writing workshop", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/results-yangon-writing-workshop", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "863c5ed9c10c4047c60320fb182dac7bf0fcb37e722a9209a49e07b15d575114"}, "2": {"node_id": "5a8426fc-88b0-4270-8fb5-45282a6d9b44", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/results-yangon-writing-workshop", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "850043e1289fc673e249ddd033760e6238bd18e4f00a6ab562b9e06db5be5162"}}, "hash": "919c34fa24147bd4caa7817241dec5c1f9e3bb9a27d273f5c7d5cddd03d9d140", "text": "Baer\u2019s Pochard or Ferruginous Pochard?

Surveying the Baer\u2019s Pochard Vital population surveys undertaken in January 2016 have provided vital lessons to researchers and communities in central Myanmar. Nature reserve staff, birdwatchers, conservation organizations, field researchers, local communities and irrigation departments were also engaged as part of the survey. As part of community engagement strategies, fishermen were given educational materials about adapting their livelihood to better protect local bird populations. The survey also worked to begin identifying new potential sites, vital to bird populations, to be protected in Myanmar, such as new Ramsar sites for example. Findings of such surveys have been identified as very important in developing new action plans for the conservation of animals such as the Baer\u2019s Pochard. Better understanding of the causes of decline represent a vital component in addressing the most critical threats to species in Myanmar. 15 During the survey, understanding was improved of the bird\u2019s population status, as was knowledge of ecological requirements, status of habitat loss and degradation and also the water bird distribution, not only Baer\u2019s Pochard but also other species. Acting upon insight such as the kind gained from these surveys enhances the capabilities of conservationists who are striving to move the Baer\u2019s Pochard from Critically Endangered to Endangered within 10 years, not only in Myanmar, but globally. This story is based on the results of a small grant project financed by the EU through its Non-State Actors project Building Capacity and Strengthening Voice of Local NGOs for Improved Environmental Governance in Myanmar (DCI-NSAPVD/2013/316-838), which is implemented by IUCN and MERN. 1.6. Crab Farming: Small but Beautiful Trainee: Seinne Lai, DEAR - Development for Environmental-friendly Agriculture and Rural Life, Myanmar \u201cWe had never thought that such a thing could bring additional income for us,\u201d reported the villagers who first experimented with crab farming in Kwin Yar. These were just the first families in Kwin Yar involved in crab farming, an activity which seems set to become more popular, after turning out to be practical and very useful, according to recent training participants. Vital Training When the village leaders announced crab farming training last year, no one was particularly interested. It was just another opportunity to use up some free time. But when the training took place in August 2015, delivered by DEAR Myanmar, many participants from both Kwin Yar and Tha Byay Chaing, turned out to learn about crab farming. After the training, other villagers visited some demonstration farms owned by one of the participants from Kwin Yar. There they learned how to organize the crab farms and how to raise the crabs. They were trained in how to modify the structure of the crab farms to prevent them escaping back to the sea. The new crab farmers, much to their relief, also don't have to worry about food for crabs as they can eat small fish and prawn, minimising their expenses too. Crab Pioneers Some of the other villagers were at first skeptical about the crab farms. But with the support of NGO staff, the \"crab pioneers\" persevered. They built the crab farms and the whole family collected unused fish and prawns. They also find bigger crabs in farms which is an added bonus. They know how to identify the mature crabs by pressing the ventral surface to see if it gave firm or soft sensation. 16 A crab mature with eggs and fat is firm to the touch, and also more profitable to the farmers. After selling mature crabs, the new farmers had recovered their investment cost within 3-4 months. Supporting the Farmers To assist the operations of the crab farms, DEAR Myanmar established a saving fund overseen by forest management committees in Kwin Yar and Tha Byay Chaing. Investing 2,500,000 kyat ($2,000) into the fund for each village to help operate their mud crab farm activities has been vital in providing ongoing support. Apart from that, with the rotation of that fund, they can also manage the other mangrove conservation activities which include natural regeneration methods and growing new trees.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "93fffc9c-ea1a-4438-a15a-13ff4f959494": {"__data__": {"id_": "93fffc9c-ea1a-4438-a15a-13ff4f959494", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/results-yangon-writing-workshop", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Results of Yangon writing workshop", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/results-yangon-writing-workshop", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e6a6a14c275153b22fe51d311c217044083520dbbe04d830dc8eb5e35b493de4"}, "2": {"node_id": "f3a8829f-95eb-45a2-845c-3f541be43c0a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/results-yangon-writing-workshop", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "50447a6018062e46fec950f9915cbda0ed9dd0d28322fa6057ae30698d95f275"}}, "hash": "85cea4cd17c7d0471d7eeef5fe044e827e9c206a7fa686efea63a9f40fd0a621", "text": "Visible Benefits to Villagers \u201cMy wife takes care of the crab farms,\u201d explained Saw Ta Thaw. \u201cBut we don\u2019t need to spend our whole time there.

Assessing a Threat: Mercury in the Irrawaddy River Trainee: Kyaw Thet Naing - FREDA 17 An important survey is now being carried out to better understand the extent of mercury contamination in the Irrawaddy, Myanmar\u2019s largest and most important river. At present, mining of gold is being widely carried out in the watershed area of the river, resulting in mercury used in this process being directly discharged into the water, following the extraction process during the mining. Further research into the issue has been regarded as vital. As mercury contamination in the river increases, determining exact levels of the pollution is more and more important. Further study of the issue is also important because if mercury contamination in the Irrawaddy is indeed worsening, local people who depend upon the water will experience health problems and side-effects. Our project on mercury analysis aims to increase testing of the amount of mercury that\u2019s present in the Irrawaddy and surrounding waterways and to begin reducing such mercury contamination. Through collection and laboratory testing of water, soil, abiotic and biotic samples along the river from Mandalay to Bhamo, the survey aims to better determine mercury concentrations. Through outreach and engagement, we then hope to reduce the systematic use of mercury in gold mining along the river, and to thereby reduce the rate of contamination in water that\u2019s vital to local people and the gold-mining workers themselves. The vast and beautiful Irrawaddy River in Myanmar. This important and impressive waterway is increasingly threatened by higher levels of pollution from industry, according to ongoing surveys by environmentalists. (Photo: Wikimedia) 18 Surveying along Irrawaddy River When the survey began late last year, we firstly went and conducted research along the Irrawaddy River to measure mercury contamination. Our team collected water and sediment samples, which would later be tested for mercury concentration, at a rate of one sample for every hour along the river bank. Our survey team also studied how to extract the gold amalgam in a mining area and improved our knowledge of how mercury is used in extracting the precious metal. During initial survey trips, we found that gold mining is frequently being carried out along the Irrawaddy River. Our team also discovered that waste water from mining is being directly channeled into the river without being cleaned or processed in any way. There has also been an enormous increase in the number of stone and sand extraction enterprises in some areas of the Irrawaddy River, exacerbating the pollution challenges. It is essential to give more time to studying the effects of mercury on communities, the local gold mining workers and their families. Through this study, and specifically by analyzing water and soil samples, our knowledge of the amounts of mercury in the Irrawaddy and its effects on people are improving dramatically. Environmental & Socioeconomic Importance According to our ongoing studies, mercury levels in the waters of the Irrawaddy are certainly increasing and consequently causing mercury poisoning in humans and animals that depend upon the river. Further study will allow for more refined and accurate data to be presented and used. Our researchers think that there is also need to give more attention to mercury and heavy metal contamination in Myanmar\u2019s waterways. Organizations need to explain to gold mining workers and local communities that mercury used in mining can cause environmental pollution and health hazards. People along this great river, the mighty Irrawaddy, depend on it for their livelihoods. 19 Fishing, agriculture, tourism, industry, transportation and so on: all are dependent on healthy and safe rivers. The Irrawaddy especially plays an important role in the lives of Myanmar\u2019s people. We all need to do what we can as a society to conserve the blood of Myanmar.

Background The arid Horn of Africa is considered a biodiversity hotspot due to the high number of endemic species of fauna and flora that it contains. These include five species of antelopes. Information on the biodiversity of the region is rather scarce, especially on Somalia because of long standing issues of security. Greater stability in the northern part of the country, Somaliland, has allowed some data to be collected, although recent visits have mainly been short. This report collates the results of one field trip and other visits and is intended to summarise the current status of antelopes in Somaliland and to synthesise the available historical information, as a baseline for further and more detailed research. 1.2. Somaliland The British Protectorate of Somaliland gained independence on 26 June 1960 and joined together with former Italian Somaliland on 1 July 1960 to form the Republic of Somalia. In 1991 the central government collapsed and Somaliland declared its independence. It has been a self-governing territory since then, though it is not recognized internationally. Somaliland lies between about 8000-110N and 42030-490E and covers an area of approximately 137,600 km2. It shares land borders with the Puntland region of Somalia on the east, Ethiopia on the west and south, and Djibouti on the north-west. There is a 750-km coastline along the Gulf of Aden. The human population is estimated at 3.5 million (www.unpo.org). 1.2.1. Geographical regions The three principal geographical zones are: a coastal plain, backed by a range of hills and mountains, and an interior plateau (Haud). 1. The narrow coastal plain (Guban) along the Gulf of Aden reaches up to 35 km in width. 2. A range of hills and mountains known variously as Ogo and the Golis Range, runs west-east; it is lower in the west, reaching its highest point of 2408 m at Shimbiris in the east. In places there are steep escarpments and dramatic cliffs hundreds of metres high, notably at Ga\u2019an Libaax and Daallo. 3. To the south of the mountains, a plateau slopes gently southward towards the Ogaden region of Ethiopia with an elevation generally over 1200 m. Hargeisa the capital is situated at 1348 m. The plateau, or the southern part of it is known as the Haud. 1.2.2. Climate There are four seasons: The main rains (gu) fall in April\u2013June and shorter rains (dair) in September- October. Precipitation ranges from 200-500 mm across much of the country, reaching 800 mm on the highest parts of the Golis range. July and August are the hottest months. The coastal plain is much hotter than the highlands and the plateau. 1.2.3.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d86bfbe9-79ce-444e-a10c-0dc28d065e4f": {"__data__": {"id_": "d86bfbe9-79ce-444e-a10c-0dc28d065e4f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/current-status-antelopes-somaliland", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Current status of antelopes in Somaliland", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/current-status-antelopes-somaliland", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "69fd63c17b5a4e387c9a45b74a989126dfa0953213385c39f649528299ba5d96"}, "2": {"node_id": "c781c3ec-2186-44ef-824c-1e697a87dc7a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/current-status-antelopes-somaliland", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "62caf4cbec83d0078f06052501fe26ed00255b1819a03a69f3743426cf268b29"}}, "hash": "ac0303842abc6bdcded36ac96e72c05e7e4c4887685390b717fdb3164a78af78", "text": "1.2.3.

This zone is subject to heavy grazing and there is very little regeneration of juniper. Below the junipers is a zone of evergreen shrubs consisting mainly of Buxus hildebrandtii, Cadia purpurea and Dodonaea viscosa, usually in mixed stands, but monodominant stands of Buxus also occur. On the northern side of the escarpment at Dallo Forest is species-rich mixed forest that in addition to the species above contains Dracaena ombet, Euphorbia abyssinica, Rhus somalensis, Aloe eminens (a tree aloe) and other Aloe spp. Plateau South of the main highlands and below the evergreen scrub zone is a band of Acacia etbaica bushland and woodland, occurring mainly on limestone soils. The many flat-topped limestone hills on the plateau with scattered A. etbaica trees form a typical habitat of beira. Below that is a very widespread zone consisting of open woodland, dominated by A. bussei and also containing A. tortilis, and species of Commiphora and Balanites. Open grasslands or \u2018bans\u2019 are found within this zone. The largest of these plains are Ban Tuyo (670 km2) and Aroori plains south of Burco (570 km2). Perennial grasses such as Chrysopogon plumulosus, Dactyloctenuim scindicum Sporolobus spp. and other grasses have been heavily grazed by livestock. Haud mixed bush This zone covers a small area in the south of Somaliland and extends east into Puntland and south through the Ogaden to north-east Kenya. It is characterised by Acacia-Commiphora woodland and bushland and contains other trees such as Albizzia anitihelmintica, Delonix elata, D. baccal, Terminalia orbicularis and species of Grewia and Boswellia. In Somaliland, much of this zone is underlain by reddish calcareous sands, forming the \u2018red sand bush\u2019 preferred by the Dibatag. Nugaal Valley The upper part of the valley consists of a gypseous plain in the south-east of Somaliland running east into Puntland. There are sparse trees, mainly Acacia tortilis and Commiphora spp. as well as shrubs such as Cadaba heterotricha. 2. Methods Information was gathered on a field trip in July 2010, other recent trips, from a search of the literature and from web sources. 2.1. Field trip A field survey was carried out 3-17 July 2010 by AAJ (Nature Somaliland) and DM (IUCN/SSC Antelope Specialist Group). The objective was to make a rapid assessment survey of antelope status, with a focus on the near-endemic Speke\u2019s Gazelle and Beira. The route (Fig. 1) began at Loyada at the border with Djibouti, crossed the Giriyaad Plains and ascended onto the plateau and headed eastwards to Hargeisa. Some time was spent in the \u2018Beira Hills\u2019 to the east of the city in search of Beira, before continuing to Inafmadobe and Burco. From there, we investigated the Aroori plains to the south and then travelled further south to Qorilogud, towards the Ethiopian border. From there we returned north and travelled across the vast Ban Tuyo and Ban Cade plains to Ceerigabo and up to Daallo Forest at the top of the escarpment in the north- east and down to the coastal plain at Maydh and back. From Erigavo, we crossed the Sarar plains to 5 Burco and thence north to the Busti hills on the coast, then to Berbera, before returning on the main road to Hargeisa and flying to Djibouti.

One species has been extirpated and two more have not been recorded in recent years and are also considered locally extinct. Eight species are still present, having been recorded on the 2010 field trip and by other recent observers, and two more species appear to be still present, on the basis of field signs and local reports.

Funaioli and Simonetta (1966) mapped the distribution west to about 440E but Simonetta 1988 indicated that the western limit had retreated to c. 460E. On the 2010 field trip, a total of 145 Speke\u2019s Gazelles were seen in groups numbering 1-9 animals. The westernmost sightings were on the lower slopes of Ga\u2019an Libaax at 09039\u201949\u201d N, 44035\u201942\u201d E and at 09039\u201954\u201d N, 44037\u201912\u201d E on the Ban Ounounouf plain, at the western edge of the Ban Tuyo. Speke\u2019s Gazelle was also observed on the Ban Cade and Sarar plains. AAJ observed 40 Speke\u2019s Gazelles on the Aroori plains in late July 2010 and another group there in June 2012. A Birdquest group saw 155 Speke\u2019s Gazelles in small groups in September 2012, mainly on Ban Cade (N. Redman in litt.); in February 2010 up to 30/day were seen on a similar itinerary (H. Buck, in litt.). Speke\u2019s Gazelle appears to is still widely but thinly distributed on the open plains of Somaliland, west at least to 44035\u201942\u201d E (Fig. 3). It is not clear whether the westernmost sightings in 2010 represent recent reoccupation of this part of the former range or if they had in fact been overlooked previously. In at least two villages, elders reported that the species \u2018was coming back\u2019. Lorenz (2010) recorded the species in Puntland along the road between Garowe and Galkayo, including one herd of 30-40 near Burtinle, and 5-6 groups in the Nogaal valley. Speke\u2019s Gazelles were seen on open grassy plains with grass and sparse shrubs; occasionally in open Acacia bussei bush; stony hillsides with sparse Acacia etbaica and Buxus hildebrandtii bushes at 1650 m on Ga\u2019an Libaax. Three groups of gazelles were seen feeding close to houses indicating a lack of regular persecution. We saw no Speke\u2019s Gazelles in the \u2018red sand bush\u2019 of the southern Haud, in line with Hunt\u2019s (1951) observation that Speke\u2019s Gazelle is not common where Dibatag occurs. East (1999) estimated the total population in the tens of thousands. There is no estimate for the Somaliland sector of the range. Speke\u2019s Gazelle is traditionally not hunted by pastoralists in some parts of their range but they have been eliminated by soldiers and paramilitaries along roads in areas of conflict, such as along the Ethiopian border and other areas of civil conflict (Thurow 2013). There is also evidence of increased trade in live animals to the Gulf countries facilitated by the introduction of new trapping techniques and wooden transport crates since the 1990s (Amir 2006).

Funaioli and Simonetta (1966) showed the species ranging across northern Somalia from the east coast, including many localities in Puntland. 11 In Somaliland recent records have been obtained from several sites on the plateau and in the main mountain range. Beira have been regularly observed in the \u2018Beira Hills\u2019 east of Hargeisa. On the 2010 field trip Beira were seen at five sites in low hills on the plateau and field signs and local reports were recorded in three more, including the coastal hills at Busti. The localities were widely distributed from the NW border eastwards to Hargeisa and Ga\u2019an Libaax, farther east along the Golis range and in the coastal zone at Busti. It seems reasonable to assume that Beira distribution remains much the same as described by Drake-Brockman (19110) and Hunt (1951) and that it is occurs widely but locally in suitable habitat. In Puntland 11 (7+4) Beira were seen in Cal Madow in 2009 and local people reported their presence between Eldohar village and Badgan district (A. Hersi, in litt.). According to local reports, Beira occurred in 1997 in limestone hills north-east of Garowe, approx. 8017.407N, 48017.036E (P. Moehlmann, in litt.). The species\u2019 presence in Djibouti was only confirmed in 1993, when they were observed on hillsides at two sites in the south-east of the country, close to the borders with Somalia and Ethiopia (K\u00fcnzel and K\u00fcnzel 1998). Recent surveys have shown that the area of distribution in Djibouti is about 250 km\u00b2 and located in the mountainous Ali Sabieh-Arrey-Assamo region (Laurent et al. 2001, Giotto et al. 2013). In Ethiopia the only localities where it has been reported are near Aroweina and Bio Anot in the Marmar mountains, bordering Somaliland. The last confirmed records are from 1976 and no information on its current status in Ethiopia is available (Bekele and Yalden 2013). Funaioli and Simonetta (1966) said Beira was nowhere common. Simonetta (1988) cited reliable reports that a marked local decrease took place in the 1975 drought and that numbers had not recovered. East (1999) estimated the global Beira population in the low thousands, based on an average density of 0.2/km2. In Djibouti numbers have been estimated at 50\u2013150 with local densities reaching 7/km2 (Giotto et al. 2013). However, extrapolating from either of these figures is problematic because the species is local and patchily distributed in suitable habitat and there is no reliable figure for the area of occupancy. It seems likely that the total population still numbers several thousand. Typical Beira habitat on the plateau consists of flat-topped hills with steep slopes covered in loose stones and scree and containing Acacia etbaica, Commiphora spp. and shrubs such as Croton somalensis. Such habitat occurs widely across the north of Somaliland. Sites in the main Golis range tend to more rugged but there are no reports from the steepest sites. Ten groups of Beira (numbering 2-6) were seen during the field trip and observed at length, allowing some observations on behaviour. Beira are wary and run in a very agile way over loose stones and scree once alarmed. Groups often rested in the shade of A. etbaica and other trees. One group was first seen at 11:20 on a slope at the foot of a steep hill and observed for 1.5 hours as they moved slowly upwards, grazing and browsing occasionally on Commiphora sp. and Acacia etbaica.

Mallon/ASG 14 Salt\u2019s Dik-dik Madoqua saltiana (Somali: sagaro) A common and widespread species, seen on every day of the 2010 field trip and widely reported by other recent groups. Its latrines are visible almost everywhere. It was recorded on the coastal plains and up to 2129 m in the evergreen scrub zone at Daallo Forest; in Acacia bussei and Acacia- Commiphora bush, red sand bush, rocky scrubland and degraded scrub, but not in the most open low grass plains. It occurs wherever some cover exists and is reportedly seen in larger gardens of Hargeisa. Hunt (1951) said the species occurred almost everywhere with low cover and speculated that there must be a million in Somaliland. Lorenz (2010) saw this species regularly in Puntland between Garowe and Galkayo. It is highly likely that the near-absence of village dogs is another very positive factor. Five subspecies were described by Yalden et al. (1984), based on phenotype, though Yalden (2013) admitted these forms may be clinal. M. s. phillipsi is the form most often recorded in Somaliland (Yalden et al. 1984), though hararensis and saltiana were also mapped on the border with Djibouti. All animals seen by us except one matched the phenotype of phillipsi showing conspicuous orange brown or rufous on the undersides, throat, inside legs and extending onto the flanks in a wedge shape that sometimes reached the shoulder. The exception was a single individual with coat showing darker orange to chestnut red, closely matching the description of hararensis. Guenther\u2019s Dik-dik Madoqua guentheri (Somali: ghussleh) Drake-Brockman (1910) said this species occurred in southern Somaliland and Funaioli and Simonetta (1966) mapped the species only in the extreme south-eastern corner. Yalden et al. (1984) did not report any records or sites in Somaliland. Simonetta (1988) mapped M. guentheri, M. saltiana and M. kirki together and showed a wide combined distribution, covering most of central and southern Somaliland, plus a strip on the coast north of Erigavo. This map is presumably the source of the wider distribution of Guenther\u2019s Dik-dik in Somaliland, including the north coast, shown by later authors: however, there are no confirmed records of this species outside the south. The only locality where Guenther\u2019s Dik-dik has been recorded recently is near Hurayda in southern Somaliland (around 8047\u20193\u201d N, 46013\u201940\u201dE). On the 2010 field trip, eight groups of 1-5 individuals were seen in that area in low, stony hills covered with patches of dense thorn scrub. This is similar to the habitat preference described for the species by Hoppe & Brotherton (2013). Several other tour groups have also seen the species in this area. Local people at Hurayda referred to Guenther\u2019s as ghussleh and Salt\u2019s as sagaro) and described the two species by their appearance, saying that Gunther\u2019s was only found in the hilly areas. At all other locations, local people reported only one kind of dik-dik (sagaro) present and did not recognize the name ghussli, including in the Cerigaabo- Daallo area of the north.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5dbec7d8-1740-4aca-84be-3f066ce0d4ba": {"__data__": {"id_": "5dbec7d8-1740-4aca-84be-3f066ce0d4ba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/current-status-antelopes-somaliland", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Current status of antelopes in Somaliland", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/current-status-antelopes-somaliland", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aab219900f95138cfa17f98cb74651f2a631d183551e7cc31a8195aa8cda949b"}, "2": {"node_id": "a259a1fc-167e-4cd6-956c-71314a471363", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/current-status-antelopes-somaliland", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a6f70a08e6803e6c2868783140735c0c8b9d5baa00293670557cbc4ee5df5f52"}}, "hash": "bedae3023f457e6849ecda77d7da1deebc904c06f8f7e6a221923fc2035f0bbc", "text": "Guenther\u2019s Dik-dik is easily distinguished from Salt\u2019s Dik-dik (which occurs in the same locality) by its larger size, grizzled, grey-brown coat lacking any trace of rufous, and an elongated muzzle.

Funaioli and Simonetta (1966) mapped a similar but rather more extensive range. Simonetta (1988) showed it as no longer occurring in Somaliland. There have been no recent reports. We visited localities within the known former range near Qorilogud, about 60 km from the Ethiopian border in the \u2018red sand\u2019 habitat characteristic of the species. Local people said that Dibatag had not been seen in the region for the last 40 years. Other local reports suggested Dibatag may still be present farther east in the Nogaal valley and near Las Anood, but it was not considered safe to survey that area. Pearce (1913) noted that it often occurred where patches of tall duur grass (Andropogon) were frequent. Hunt (1951) said only that it was found in similar situations to Gerenuk and Lesser Kudu. Figure 12. Former distribution of Dibatag in Somaliland (after Yalden et al. 1984). 16 Gerenuk Litocranius walleri (Somali: garanug) Gerenuk was described as the commonest antelope in Somaliland by Drake-Brockman (1910) and very common in thick bush by Hunt (1951). Funaioli and Simonetta (1966) described the Gerenuk as the commonest and most widespread species across the whole of Somalia. Gerenuk were observed at seven locations during the 2010 field trip, in groups numbering 1-20, from west of Hargeisa eastwards in Acacia and mixed bush. The species has been reported by other recent groups and it appears to remain widely but thinly distributed. In Puntland, Lorenz (2010) recorded Gerenuk regularly along the road between Garowe and Galkayo. Klipspringer Oreotragus oreotragus (Somali: alikut, alakut) This species is distributed on steep slopes along the main mountain range (Hunt 1951). A group of three was observed in July 2010 on the north slope of the Daallo escarpment at around 1500 m elevation on steep, rocky slopes in thick bush. The animals were observed from a distance of 50 m for 10 minutes. Klipspringers have also been seen recently at the Ga\u2019an Libaax escarpment in February 2010 and west of Hargeisa and on the Sheikh escarpment in 2012. Klipspringers in Somaliland have been assigned to O. o. somalicus but the validity of this subspecies has not been confirmed genetically. Fig. 11. Klipspringers below Daallo escarpment. \u00a9 D. Mallon/ ASG. Greater Kudu Tragelaphus strepciseros (Somali: godir) Drake-Brockman (1910) said the Greater Kudu was numerous all along the Golis range and Yalden et al. (1984) show widely spread localities. Hunt (1951) said it did not occur in great numbers except in the mountains north of Borama. There are no recent sightings but the species is reported to occur around Ga\u2019an Libaax according to Mirreh (2012), and there are persistent local reports from the area. In 2010 we found tracks and droppings in dense bush at Ga\u2019an Libaax that were a good match for this species. Lesser Kudu T. imberbis (Somali: arreh godir) Not uncommon in thick bush according to Hunt (1951) and mapped at five localities in western Somaliland by Yalden et al. (1984). None were seen on the 2010 field trip and no recent sightings have been reported by other groups. However, photographs of captive Lesser Kudu kept as pets at hotels in Hargeisa were shown by Mirreh (2012) and photos of another captive specimen in Hargeisa were shown to DM by Eric Ruivo, Lisbon Zoo, in 2012. 17 Swayne\u2019s Hartebeest Alcelaphus buselaphus swaynei (Somali: sig) Formerly occurred on open plains west and south-west of Hargeisa as far as the Tuyo plains where they were seen in the thousands (Swayne 1895; Drake-Brockman 1910).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5f9d8b1-18d3-4921-88f7-193f8642eb19": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5f9d8b1-18d3-4921-88f7-193f8642eb19", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/current-status-antelopes-somaliland", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Current status of antelopes in Somaliland", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/current-status-antelopes-somaliland", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "082d25e37e66aa14942e0f48365851cd9521047823608d30a2b9069571f754b5"}, "2": {"node_id": "5a4e95bc-c548-4cd2-a528-fe897dd3d806", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/current-status-antelopes-somaliland", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dcfa95a13f638822e50e5d00186ea4b4ef13feaf2800b7956c9d5f922d1734dc"}}, "hash": "9fb04078d56afc1a50737a9d13e9846486b660dd498956d2223f82b0b9ae5fc2", "text": "The species became extinct in Somaliland in the early 1900s due to rinderpest, according to Hunt (1951).

Beisa Oryx Oryx beisa (Somali: bi\u2019iid, beid) Formerly common and widespread (Drake-Brockman 1910). Hunt (1951) said the species used to be common in all the plains and bushy parts of the Haud and that former \u2018huge herds\u2019 on coastal plains behind Bulhar and Zeila had been reduced to two small groups at Qabri Behar and Jideh; it was most frequently seen on the gypseous plains of the south-east. None were seen on the 2010 field trip and there are no other recent records or local reports. It appears that the species no longer occurs in Somaliland.

Mallon/ASG Predators: Lion Panthera leo (Somali: libaah) Lions were once widespread in Somaliland but according to Drake-Brockman (1910) \u2018..now seldom seen far distant from the Haud and Nogaal Valley\u2019 (i.e. only in remote areas) and he described them as comparatively rare, but occasionally wandering to the Golis range. However, Hunt (1951) said Lions were quite common and widely distributed. The current status is unclear and there are no recent reports. Two young animalsons have been confiscated but their origin is unknown. 18 Common Leopard Panthera pardus (Somali: shebel) Formerly plentiful (Drake-Brockman (1910). Hunt (1951) said that leopards were becoming rare owing to the high price of the skins. About 2000 skins exported from Somaliland to Aden in 1928, when there were quite a lot in the Berbera lowlands; the sale of leopard skins was prohibited in 1928 because people were using the telephone wires between Berbera and Sheikh for snares (Hunt 1951). There are far fewer now and not many recent reports. Leopard presence was reported by local people at Daallo Forest and Ga\u2019an Libaax where a possible scat was found. Cheetah Acinonyx jubatus (Somali: harimad) Drake-Brockman (1910) said the Cheetah was widespread but most common on the Haud. Hunt (1951) said the species was \u2018fairly common\u2019. There are few recent records and it was feared the species was extinct. However, local people in the \u2018Beira Hills\u2019 east of Hargeisa claimed that Cheetahs were still present and AAJ spent 3 days in September 2010 following up these reports. In a small village he found an adult female captured after attacking goats. He purchased the animal and released it 40 km away. In early October 2010 he located two cheetah cubs that had been caught by a poacher in the same general area. He purchased these too and returned them to the site where they had been captured. Two days later, tracks of an adult and two young were found and it was hoped that the female had located the cubs. Since then there have been several confiscations of adult and young cheetahs in Somaliland but it is not clear how many of these are locally caught or have been traded from elsewhere. Other carnivores: Common Jackal Canis aureus has recently been reported at many several sites and it appears to be widespread; Bat-eared Fox Otocyon megalotis has been seen twice on the Aroori plains; Spotted Hyena Crocuta crocuta: reported in 2012 and one was possibly seen while driving at night in July 2010; Aardwolf Proteles cristata has been seen twice. Other species: Hamadryas Baboon Papio hamadryas (Somali: dayer): About 150 were present at the rubbish tip outside Burco in July 2010 and small groups were seen in the forest below the Dallo escarpment and elsewhere. Abyssinian Hare Lepus habessinicus Plain Ground Squirrel Xerus rutilus are also widespread and the endemic Speke\u2019s Pectinator Pectinator spekei was seen in a few localities. Fig. 14.

The first wave of trophy hunting from about 1885-1910 caused a rapid decline in the larger fauna, notably Black Rhino Elephant and Lion, but with an unknown impact on antelope populations. In more recent times, wars and civil conflicts surely had a serious negative effect. Thurow (2013) noted that across its range Speke\u2019s Gazelle had been reduced in areas of conflict. At one village on Ban Tuyo, a local elder recalled the days when the surrounding plains teemed with Beisa Oryx, Soemmerring\u2019s Gazelle, Speke\u2019s Gazelle, and Wild Ass and lamented \u201c\u2026the arrival in the 1970s of the Kalashnikov that began the destruction of these herds\u201d adding that Speke\u2019s Gazelle seemed to be returning and that they had resolved not to hunt them as they had enough sheep and goats for food.

Species such as Beira may be favoured by their small size making them an unattractive target and their habitat and wary nature offering some protection. 4.2. Wildlife trade Antelopes are sometimes caught and kept as pets by VIPs and in hotels: e.g. Mirreh (2012) showed photos of captive Lesser Kudu, Gerenuk, Speke\u2019s and Dorcas Gazelles at establishments in Hargeisa. A bigger threat is likely to be posed by live capture of animals for trade to the Gulf countries where the many private collections provide a ready market for wildlife. Amir (2006) reported on the expanding illegal wildlife trade from southern Somalia that affected many species including Speke\u2019s Gazelle and which had been facilitated by the advent of new trapping techniques and specialised wooden boxes for transport. Trapping of animals in Somaliland for export has also increased considerably. One report in the International Business Times stated that Somaliland has become a regional centre for illegal trade in cheetahs (www.ibtimes.co.uk 5 July 2014). Thirty-nine cheetahs were confiscated by the UAE customs in 1998-2002, mainly originating from \u2018Somalia\u2019. YouTube videos showing a captive cheetah on a leash in Hargeisa were circulated on 2 October 2009. Five cubs were confiscated in Hargeisa and sent to a rescue centre in Ethiopia (www.bornfree.org.uk 6 May 2012) and three more captive cubs were confiscated in 2015 and taken to the same rescue centre (www.somalilandpress.com 01 May 2015). According to a CITES review of the illegal cheetah trade (Nowell 2015) over 40 cheetahs were confiscated in the Horn of Africa 2011-2013, most of them in Somaliland. It is not known how many of these cheetahs originated in Somaliland or were imported from Ethiopia or elsewhere. 4.3. Habitat degradation About 36% of Somaliland has been degraded by loss of vegetation, gully erosion, loss of topsoil, and invasive plants (FAO-SWALIM 2008). M.M. Mirreh (former Director of the Range Training Institute in Burco) visited Aroori Plains in 2012 and reported that in 30 years, the habitat had in places become unrecognisable: perennial grasses were almost completely gone and trees and scrub were encroaching on the former grasslands: such a change would favour browsers such as Gerenuk and Lesser Kudu at the expense of gazelles and other grazers. A decline in rangeland quality and the disappearance of the most palatable perennial grasses due to overgrazing has been reported by several authors (e.g. Hemming (1998). 20 4.4. Drought Arid areas are always susceptible to variations in sparse rainfall. Somaliland experienced a severe drought in 2015 following failure of rainfall in two consecutive gu seasons, linked in part to El Ni\u00f1o. This drought has affected more than 240,000 people and killed 35%\u201340% of the livestock. (www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/nov/25/somaliland-drought/ 25/11/2015). It is difficult to assess the effect on wild antelopes, though Simonetta (1988) noted that marked local decreases in Beira were caused by drought in 1975. 4.5. Charcoal production Charcoal is a traditional source of fuel, but after controls collapsed in 1990, the rate of production surged, as the population grew and to meet demand for exports. Sacks of charcoal are seen by the roadside awaiting transport almost everywhere and charcoal pits and cut and burned trees are common sights. FAO-SWALIM (2008) and Ibrahim (2011) reported uncontrolled cutting of A. bussei and excessive cutting of other trees for charcoal. A study by MOPD&E and Candlelight NGO (2004) showed that 65% of charcoal in Hargeisa and Berbera and 25% in Burco came from live trees; unsustainable utilization of tree resources for charcoal production had led to a significant depletion of acacia trees, e.g. in the last six months of 2003, 516,990 sacks of charcoal were produced, representing 323,118 trees of 70-90 cm, half of them probably live trees. The government has recently made attempts to control tree cutting and charcoal production.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e6df2c4b-3515-48a4-9888-7f9db1cc74d3": {"__data__": {"id_": "e6df2c4b-3515-48a4-9888-7f9db1cc74d3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/current-status-antelopes-somaliland", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Current status of antelopes in Somaliland", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/current-status-antelopes-somaliland", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9aa97b3fb01e34cd91cf7ba210a879b1bfc27f5709255d3bdfa4d98b4365ce56"}, "2": {"node_id": "638e8265-fb72-4599-8fcb-1e877f55d158", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/current-status-antelopes-somaliland", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4ada5a61805b3919f6be357bfc3563980fcb2d1678044fd983c4c41dab3174eb"}}, "hash": "e135599425f5991d5786102d7af77d9968a710b6d8ab5c4c6c3f59b155e9cfea", "text": "The government has recently made attempts to control tree cutting and charcoal production. The negative effects on the environment and sustainability of forest resources are clear.

Conclusions The results of the field trip and the ancillary information gathered are too sparse and too fragmentary to make estimates of antelope population sizes or trends or to draw many conclusions. In effect the results provide no more than a \u2018snapshot of the conservation landscape\u2019 but can at least serve as an indication of current status and a partial baseline for further studies. Beisa Oryx, Hartebeest and Dibatag have all been extirpated from Somaliland. Comparing the current status of antelopes with descriptions made over a hundred years ago leaves no doubt that the abundance and distribution of all species, except for Salt\u2019s Dik-dik, have greatly declined in the past 130 years. For example, Pearce (1898) described \u2018huge herds of oryx mingling with even larger herds of aul [Soemmerring\u2019s Gazelle]\u2019 and \u2018hundreds and hundreds of hartebeest\u2019. Herbert (1908) said \u201c..huge herds of buck were met on every march.,.\u201d and described Speke\u2019s Gazelle as \u201cvery numerous\u201d and Soemmerring\u2019s Gazelle as \u201c..a very common gazelle in all open parts of the country..\u201d. Antelopes face several threats as enumerated above, though the current scope and severity of these are unquantified. There are some favourable factors, for example a general absence of village dogs which must have a positive effect on dik-diks especially, and other species: the only domestic dogs seen on the 2010 field trip consisted of a small feral pack at Hargeisa airport. The tradition of eating wild meat (mammals or birds fish) seems not to be well-developed and e.g. several species of bustards (Otididae) were seen regularly. Daallo Forest is a reserve on paper but needs adequate funding and effective management. Developing a national protected area network is urgently needed to protect representative ecosystems and key species and is envisaged by the government: The Somaliland National Vision 2030 (MoN&PD 2011) contains five pillars including Pillar 5: Environmental Protection. This states that \u201cThe government considers the national flora and fauna as invaluable assets which must be conserved and managed for current and future generations. It will establish national reserves and game parks to allow surviving species to flourish and even reintroduce extinct ones. The government will also enact and enforce anti-poaching laws. The local community will be at the centre of these conservation measures\u201d. Acknowledgements We are very grateful to the Mohammed bin Zayed Species Fund for separate grants to DPM and AAJ.

The Poweshiek skipperling (Oarisma poweshiek) and Dakota skipper (Hesperia dacotae) are important examples of this worrisome trend. Both species are native to mixed-grass to dry tallgrass prairie, moist meadow, and prairie fen ecosystems of the north-central United States and south-central Canada. The destruction of tallgrass prairie in this region began in the early 1800s, and by the mid-1990s nearly all of this habitat had been converted to agricultural lands in Minnesota, Iowa, North and South Dakota, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Manitoba. Mixed-grass prairies suffered the same fate during this period. As a result, the Poweshiek skipperling may now be extirpated from Minnesota, the Dakotas, Iowa and Illinois and is restricted to a single site in southern Manitoba, a single prairie site in south-central Wisconsin, and four isolated prairie fen sites in eastern Michigan. While more widely distributed, the Dakota skipper has been lost from Illinois and Iowa and is now found only in isolated sites in Minnesota, the Dakotas and southern Canada. Recent surveys at many of these isolated sites reveal only a few adults. In addition to implementing active habitat and population management efforts on the ground, experts managing both the Poweshiek skipperling and the Dakota skipper are now exploring options for intensive ex situ population management to improve the long-term status of these species in their native habitats. The range of ex situ scenarios and tools currently available to the species conservation community is diverse and can target different conservation needs and roles. In order to be successful, ex situ programs need to be carefully assessed, planned and implemented in a way that provides conservation benefit. In addition, as conservation challenges become more complex and urgent, the need to further develop scientifically based and innovative approaches to ex situ conservation will increase. To assist in this planning and implementation process, the IUCN\u2019s Species Survival Commission has created a document, titled Guidelines on the Use of Ex Situ Management for Species Conservation (IUCN/SSC 2014). This document provides practical guidance on evaluating the suitability and requirements of an ex situ component for achieving species conservation objectives. The Workshop Process The United States Fish and Wildlife Service, in collaboration with the Minnesota Zoo, invited the IUCN/SSC\u2019s Conservation Breeding Specialist Group (CBSG) to plan and facilitate a participatory workshop process designed to use the Ex Situ Guidelines as an aid to evaluate the feasibility of incorporating an ex situ management element into the broader conservation activities for both Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper. The workshop was hosted by the Minnesota Zoo on 20-22 October, 2015 and was generously supported by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the Minnesota Zoo Foundation. The workshop was facilitated overall by Dr. Philip Miller of CBSG, with his colleague Dr. Kathy Traylor-Holzer leading the participants through the application of the Ex Situ Guidelines to the specific conservation issues facing the two focal species. Participants in the meeting included 20 experts on species biology and management, with a few individuals with expertise on conservation of closely- related species participating by conference telecommunications.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cfd2bb0e-f40c-4139-918a-303970295528": {"__data__": {"id_": "cfd2bb0e-f40c-4139-918a-303970295528", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/poweshiek-skipperling-and-dakota-skipper-ex-situ-assessment-and-planning", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper : ex situ assessment and planning workshop", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/poweshiek-skipperling-and-dakota-skipper-ex-situ-assessment-and-planning", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b39635fd8f4ec7cc657a5c4d370edf6c2fe418bc8802e375789d3c3d60fd6f39"}, "2": {"node_id": "c2accf9d-284c-4319-83ab-3af64a0b10cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/poweshiek-skipperling-and-dakota-skipper-ex-situ-assessment-and-planning", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b08e23bb76983583fab8ce4925a1825a54000d222d5e8a4ef66cd332ca5893ec"}}, "hash": "5fcaa12e63f74d641f9039606a11306c5abfb29a646ee799c02d68c4baf013ef", "text": "2 Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper: Ex situ assessment and planning Detailed workshop objectives were as follows: \u2022 Review the status of species (threats, current conservation activities, and key data gaps) to set the proper context for the workshop activities. \u2022 Define the role(s) that ex situ management could play in the overall conservation of the species. \u2022 Determine the characteristics and dimensions of the ex situ population needed to fulfil the potential conservation role(s). \u2022 Define the resources and expertise needed for the ex situ management program to meet its role(s) and appraise the feasibility and risks. \u2022 Make a decision for each species that is informed and transparent (i.e. demonstrates how", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "287381a4-b37e-493a-8ceb-377eca3755dd": {"__data__": {"id_": "287381a4-b37e-493a-8ceb-377eca3755dd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/poweshiek-skipperling-and-dakota-skipper-ex-situ-assessment-and-planning", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper : ex situ assessment and planning workshop", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/poweshiek-skipperling-and-dakota-skipper-ex-situ-assessment-and-planning", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f3b3653b194844f235df6993c88fe697150287f97e674b38f2c524f1958ba41d"}}, "hash": "f3b3653b194844f235df6993c88fe697150287f97e674b38f2c524f1958ba41d", "text": "and why the decision was taken). \u2022 Develop an ex situ Action Plan for each species based on the decision. Create explicit timelines for activities that make up the Plan. The workshop began with a set of background presentations on the status of the two species, followed by a review of the early ex situ work currently underway targeting both species at the Minnesota Zoo. Presentation of the Guidelines included a discussion of the various ex situ management options that could be implemented to advance conservation of endangered species. These options range from creating a long-term ex situ breeding program aimed at preventing species extinction, to a head-start program featuring removal of individuals from the wild so that survival of a given life-stage can be improved with later release of individuals back into the wild, to the creation of an ex situ research population designed to improve in situ species conservation. Additionally, a set of in situ population management roles were discussed, including various forms of in situ intensive protection schemes and translocation of individuals among wild populations, and how these relate to the IUCN Guidelines for Reintroduction and Other Conservation Translocations (IUCN/SSC 2013). Following these presentations, the workshop participants began the process of identifying threats to long- term viability for each of the two species. Two working groups were then formed, corresponding to each of the two species of interest, and each group then amplified the basic threat analysis as appropriate for their focal species. For each threat, the working groups identified the demographic rates that would likely be impacted, as well as the more general population characteristics (abundance, degree of population fragmentation) that would be affected by the threats. With the above information in hand, the groups identified which of the various ex situ and in situ population management options could potentially be beneficial to the long-term conservation of their species. Each option was then evaluated in a thorough analysis, including a detailed characterization of each option, the requirements for their proper implementation, and the relative risks and benefits of their adoption. Using the findings from this analysis, each working group concluded their activities by making a recommendation on whether to adopt an ex situ program as part of a larger species conservation strategy and, if adopted, creating an Action Plan for implementing the program. Summary of Workshop Findings The Poweshiek skipperling group adopted an ex situ program based on a mixed approach of concurrent and consecutive activities. Key features of this approach are: 1. Establish a head-start program to augment extant locations through reinforcement (intra-site). Eggs from females will be collected on-site from a proportion of the individuals observed during a given flight period. Females will be released back to the site of capture within 72 hours (egg- laying time of approximately 48 hours). Eggs will be reared at the Minnesota Zoo and will be released post-overwintering as late-instar larvae or pupae. The program would begin in 2016 and will utilize two wild founder source populations from Michigan (Brandt Road and Long Lake Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper: Ex situ assessment and planning 3 Fen). It is recommended that the Assiniboine Park Zoo or another Canadian partner start a similar head-start program utilizing founders from two separate sites within the Tall Grass Prairie Preserve (8 and J67) starting in 2017. 2. Conduct research on a surrogate species population. Research will be conducted concurrently \u2013 primarily on breeding and husbandry techniques \u2013 using a closely related species. Additional research (e.g., habitat) will occur at extant sites and potential reintroduction sites to determine suitability for reintroductions. 3. Consider establishment of an insurance population to enhance long-term survival of the species. If the surrogate husbandry research is successful, an insurance population may be created using captive-reared (F1 generation) individuals. The ex situ population would be maintained to maximize genetic and demographic stability. 4. Reintroductions to locations with historical records of the species (inter-site), but where the species is thought to be extirpated (long term). If the head-start program is successful and produces large numbers of healthy larvae, a decision point can be triggered regarding whether to reintroduce those larvae to previously extirpated sites (inter-site). The Minnesota Zoo would take the lead in developing the ex situ rearing and husbandry methods, with other candidate institutions in both the US and Canada providing collaborative capacity as required. The US Fish and Wildlife Service would coordinate data collection and assembly on current and future site characteristics, prioritize research needs, and assist with organizing releases of individuals from the head- start program back to the wild. The head-start program would be initiated", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3bceba85-409b-41db-ad2d-32a28f4c20b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "3bceba85-409b-41db-ad2d-32a28f4c20b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/poweshiek-skipperling-and-dakota-skipper-ex-situ-assessment-and-planning", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper : ex situ assessment and planning workshop", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/poweshiek-skipperling-and-dakota-skipper-ex-situ-assessment-and-planning", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3497998b400e0bf7723f337856e40fd28c0c87f0ad54033acdc5c2415dd06d88"}}, "hash": "3497998b400e0bf7723f337856e40fd28c0c87f0ad54033acdc5c2415dd06d88", "text": "by summer 2016, with release of late-instar larvae beginning in spring 2017. Challenges to successfully implementing the proposed program include the difficulty in collecting the required number of adults to initiate a head-start program, a limitation in funding and staffing that is required to keep the program viable, and the presence of considerable uncertainty in our knowledge of proper husbandry techniques and infectious disease dynamics. The issue of disease may be especially serious, given the potential threats posed by infection by the Wolbachia bacterium and its many diverse strains. The Dakota skipper group also adopted a mixed approach, featuring the following components: 1. Restoration of Dakota skipper at sites within the species\u2019 historical range where it has been extirpated. The specific objective for this management component is to establish at least one new population in the wild by 2021. Larvae for reintroduction will be produced primarily by headstarting \u2013 collecting eggs from wild females and rearing the eggs at the zoo to produce larvae or pupae for release. Some larvae or pupae may be produced from mating of captive-reared adults at the Minnesota Zoo. This may consist largely of individuals that survive research projects (see below) and become adults at the zoo, but captive rearing and breeding to produce an F1 generation may also be used to generate a sufficient number of offspring to establish a reintroduced population 2. Provision of Dakota skippers for research projects that are integral to the species\u2019 conservation. The research program would focus on gaining a better understanding of the number of larvae/pupae that must be released to reestablish a viable population of the Dakota skipper. A viable population would be one with consistent evidence of recruitment. To accomplish both the research and restoration components of the overall program would require producing at least 800 post-diapause larvae and/or pupae. A minimum of 175 larvae would be used in a larval food plant study at the Minnesota Zoo, while an additional 30 larvae would be used in a pesticide study, also conducted at the Zoo. Upon completion of those studies, all larvae produced ex situ would be available for population restoration unless additional research needs are identified. 4 Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper: Ex situ assessment and planning 3. Completion of a management protocol that could be used by zoos or other facilities to successfully house the Dakota skipper ex situ. This would likely take the form of a comprehensive husbandry manual describing the procedures and methods necessary to achieve success in management ex situ populations of the Dakota skipper. The US Fish and Wildlife Service will consult with species and subject matter experts to help develop a process for selecting and ranking potential reintroduction sites within the historic range of the Dakota skipper. The Service will also convene a team of species experts to determine the most appropriate developmental stage when head-started or captive bred larvae or pupae will be released. Larvae may be ready for release from the Minnesota Zoo in the summer of 2016, although a systematic review of potential reintroduction sites may not be complete before then. Therefore, this release site may best be described as a trial release. A number of challenges may stand in the way of successfully implementing the proposed ex situ program for the Dakota skipper. For example, there are only a few Dakota skipper populations that are large enough to safely remove eggs while avoiding effects to their viability. This may be a primary factor limiting the number of larvae that can be produced for restoration and research projects. Additionally, the number of suitable sites where reintroduction may have a high probability of success may be limiting. Finally, as with the proposed ex situ program for the Poweshiek skipperling, there are real limitations to the amount of funding and staff available for proper program implementation and management. These shortcomings could seriously impede progress towards reaching program goals. Overall, this workshop was seen by all participants as a valuable contribution to the collaborative efforts directed towards effective conservation of these two natives of the central North American prairie. The integration of both in situ and ex situ approaches to conservation, as practiced in this workshop, represents an increasingly important strategic step in the evolution of effective conservation management of endangered species (Traylor-Holzer et al. 2013). Moreover, the design of this workshop is a clear example of the Conservation Breeding Specialist Group\u2019s One Plan Approach philosophy (Byers et al. 2013), which considers all populations of an endangered species, both inside and outside of their natural range, and under all conditions of management, while engaging all responsible stakeholders", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "742f90bc-942d-44dc-8e4d-48f2bb160849": {"__data__": {"id_": "742f90bc-942d-44dc-8e4d-48f2bb160849", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/poweshiek-skipperling-and-dakota-skipper-ex-situ-assessment-and-planning", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper : ex situ assessment and planning workshop", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/poweshiek-skipperling-and-dakota-skipper-ex-situ-assessment-and-planning", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4ce38b353655265cc867ec4c58e6a7175a081028da9ac5f470b90fd998b1cf59"}, "3": {"node_id": "792a98cc-0edf-4540-b5d6-88e58b1e33ea", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/poweshiek-skipperling-and-dakota-skipper-ex-situ-assessment-and-planning", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b9f08058f5e6b5b57d4e8ac59853ea39ca5e0a7f56dafaa5166e25cf20c34994"}}, "hash": "85668bab4259f37f16c94047fee221d232ea139bab2734b49cbfaa50d5ead93c", "text": "and all available resources in the planning and implementation of any species conservation initiative.

Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper: Ex situ assessment and planning 5 Threat Assessment for Poweshiek Skipperling and Dakota Skipper As a preamble to discussing the potential roles that ex situ management can play in conservation of the Poweshiek skipperling and the Dakota skipper, workshop participants were asked to brainstorm and categorize threats to each of the species, and the aspects of the species\u2019 life history and/or population status that are targeted by those threats. The threats were not yet categorized by their impact on a given species, but were instead considered at the more broad level of currently impacting either species. The identification of species-specific threats was considered as an early task in the species-based working groups, whose reports are to be found later in this report. The threats are defined here in terms of their impact on specific life-history stages that define the biology of these two species. Specifically, we define the following stages: \u2022 Egg survival \u2022 Pre-hibernation larval survival \u2022 Overwinter (hibernation) larval survival \u2022 Post-hibernation larval survival \u2022 Adult survival \u2022 Adult reproductive success (fecundity) The early life-stages were separated out as above because many different threats operate only on specific stages comprising the early phases of the species\u2019 life-cycle. In addition, the group considered higher- order, population-level characteristics that are impacted by threats, namely the abundance of individuals in small populations and the degree of population fragmentation. Note that the threat assessment here is neither exhaustive in its scope nor detailed in its treatment of specific mechanisms. The goal here was to provide a rather high-level overview of the threats to the species, particular in the context of their impact on the species\u2019 life-history and how ex situ options can help to ameliorate those threats. The threat assessment is summarized below in Table 1. 6 Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper: Ex situ assessment and planning Table 1.

These specific alternatives are tailored for their application to the two butterfly species of interest to workshop participants. Insurance Population Maintain a long-term, genetically diverse ex situ breeding population of the species to prevent regional or global species extinction and preserve options for future conservation strategies Source for Population Restoration Maintain a (long-term) ex situ population as a source of individuals to re-establish the species into part of its former range from which it has disappeared (reintroduction) and/or to reinforce an existing population (reinforcement); can be for demographic and/or genetic reasons Head-start Program Remove individuals from the wild into captivity to increase survival during a specific life stage(s) and then subsequently return these individuals to the wild Maternity Ward Remove gravid wild females from the wild into captivity to lay eggs, releasing offspring to the wild at some life stage Temporary Rescue (Salvage) Temporary removal of individuals from the wild to protect them from predicted imminent threat(s) (e.g., extreme weather, fire) Research Population Research on ex situ population that will directly benefit conservation of the species in the wild (e.g., life history, plant/habitat requirements, pesticide impacts, parasites, potential inbreeding or outcrossing effects, developmental thresholds) In addition to the ex situ roles identified above, the participants considered a trio of potential in situ population management conservation roles, listed below. Protected in the Wild Provide some level of buffer from threats as a modified ex situ condition in the field (e.g., larvae rearing pens in the field) Wild-to-Wild Translocation Remove individuals from one wild location and release into another wild location (occupied or unoccupied by conspecifics); can be for demographic and/or genetic reasons Wild-to-Wild Rescue (Salvage) Similar to Wild-to-Wild Translocation, but in response to imminent threat(s) in original location 10 Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper: Ex situ assessment and planning Figure 1 below shows where the various ex situ and in situ population management conservation roles are best implemented in the context of a diagrammatic representation of the process of species endangerment and extinction. The \u201cextinction vortex\u201d refers to the heuristic model of population decline brought about by demographic and genetic instability in small, declining populations. This diagram provided by Conservation Breeding Specialist Group staff was helpful in identifying the appropriate choice of population management options as a function of the degree of endangerment of a given species. Figure 1. Diagram relating the optimal application of population management options to the extent of extinction risk for a given endangered wildlife species. Management options are on the right side of the diagram; un-italicized options refer to programs focused on ex situ activities, while italicized options refer to programs focused on in situ activities. See accompanying text for more information on each of these management options. Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper: Ex situ assessment and planning 11 Species-Specific Identification of Potential Population Management Options Following the discussion on alternative population management conservation roles presented in the last section, the workshop participants divided themselves into two working groups corresponding to the two butterfly species of interest in this analysis. The two groups then combined the information on species threats to long-term demographic and population stability (Table 1) with the list of potential population management conservation roles and their effective application to endangered populations (Figure 1) to derive a matrix of applicable population management conservation roles for each species. The combined information is presented in Table 2.

It is also perhaps worth noting that the Dakota skipper working group identified four population management options with the greatest potential to contribute to effective conservation across the life- cycle of the species: Population Restoration Source, Head-Start Program, Research Population, and Protected in the Wild. This is in line with the information presented in Figure 1, where the risk of imminent extinction for the Dakota skipper \u2013 while still threatened with continued population fragmentation and decline due to existing and future threats \u2013 is not as high as that for the Poweshiek skipperling. The following sections of this report feature detailed reports from each of the two species-specific working groups. The reports outline a more detailed threat assessment, discuss at length the characteristics of each potential population management conservation role laid out in Table 2, and ultimately present the groups\u2019 recommendations for developing an intensive population management program as a component of the general species conservation strategy. 12 Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper: Ex situ assessment and planning Table 2.

Where desired, additional stressors were added to the threats originally defined in plenary. Each stressor under each component was then evaluated to see what contributes to each component. We estimated which aspects of the life history are under the greatest threat to ensure long-term viability. The results are presented below in priority of main categories, with the group score in parentheses (scoring done by each group member through a process of assigning points to those threat components they believed were of greatest concern). 1.

Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper: Ex situ assessment and planning 15 Notes from the discussion accompanying the threat evaluation: \u2022 In much of our discussion for the three larval stages, the threats were almost identical. For this reason, we lumped the three stages into one category, while also recognizing that ex situ management techniques may not apply to all three stages. \u2022 There is a lot of uncertainty around these threats and which life stages are most important, but the proposed ex situ management alternatives cut across many of these problems. \u2022 Patch size relates more to in situ management and can have a positive and/or negative effect (Allee effect or stochastic effect). \u2022 Egg survival \u2013 was considered to be a lower priority because the larval stage is of the longest duration. \u2022 It may be very valuable to weigh the stressors within a given threat, but that is outside the scope of this workshop and could be done at a later date if desired. \u2022 The Dakota skipper group also talked about threats initially. They prioritized pre-and post-diapause and pupal stages. Pre-hibernation larval stage was highest priority, small population size, population fragmentation, larval survival, adult survival and egg survival was the last priority. Lots of repetition of ex situ and in situ techniques for the various categories. Combination of lab and field \u2013 pots in field \u2013 protected conditions in the wild \u2013 post hibernation larval survival. Adult reproduction \u2013 need a lot more research on how to prioritize these things. Overwinter and egg survival ended up at the bottom of the prioritization list. Identification of Potential Population Management Roles to Address Threats With the threat assessment for Poweshiek skipperling in hand, and the set of potential ex situ and in situ management options available to us, we identified which option(s) would be effective in addressing each of the identified species threats. This information is summarized in Table 3 below. Table 3. Applicability of population management alternatives to conservation of the Poweshiek skipperling.

Those ex situ methods would not address habitat. A Deliberative Analysis of Each Population Management Alternative A more detailed study of all the options relevant for Poweshiek skipperling appears below. This study includes an examination of the pros and cons of each program alternative. Where feasible, specific \u201cfixes\u201d were identified that could alleviate any one of the weaknesses (\u201ccons\u201d) of a given program management alternative. The working group decided to focus their attention on the ex situ program(s) that would be most valuable because of the high extinction risk facing the species. This meant that the three in situ management options \u2013 Ex Situ Protected Conditions in the Field, Wild-to-Wild Translocation, and Wild-to-Wild Rescue (Salvage) \u2013 were not considered for Poweshiek skipperling in this workshop. It is imperative that species management is implemented in a way to bring the species out of the extinction vortex. After examining the threats and management options that were presented to workshop participants in plenary, the working group concluded that the most appropriate management alternatives to consider would be (1) creation of an insurance population, (2) developing a head-start program, and (3) the temporary rescue (salvage) option. Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper: Ex situ assessment and planning 17 Insurance Population Goal and Purpose: Prevent the Poweshiek skipperling from becoming extinct. Discussion notes: When initiating a captive population, the amount of genetic variation (heterozygosity) captured from the wild population is approximately Hc = 1-(1/2NF) where NF is the number of founders (i.e. unrelated individuals that produce surviving offspring). We may not have to collect 20 all at once, instead we can collect a smaller number (e.g., 5 per year) to maintain genetics. We may have to supplement a population every other year. Can we change the slope of the line? Need to equalize family sizes by good genetic management. NF = number of founders unrelated must contribute equally to offspring generation. Assumption that we would only breed animals within the same population or those with known Wolbachia strains. We assume that we will have genetic structure of Wolbachia known to us after this winter. Structure: 1. Rearing and breeding program. Build insurance population over time. Take the highest viable number of wild individuals (exactly which population(s) will be determined based on known information (genetics, Wolbachia) and assumptions). Supplement yearly as viable. 2. Population size to be maintained, life stage, types of facilities needed, etc. a. Life Stage: All b. Type of Management: Maintain population at all life stages. Collect adults. c. Facilities: Multiple rearing facility locations to diversify. Table 4: Needs, risks, and feasibility of an insurance population program for the Poweshiek skipperling.

The group questioned at which stage that release should occur. It likely doesn\u2019t make sense to release eggs or early larvae; instead, it may be best to protect the individuals through diapause and release late-stage larvae, pupae or adults. At what stage is the margin of success the highest compared to success in the wild? \u2022 How many individuals would we bring into captivity? Example - Need to find 25 Dakota skippers for within 24 hours to remove a certain number of individuals. Knowledge gaps identified during the discussion of head-starting (may apply to multiple programs) 1. A lack of understanding of the strains of Wolbachia in the positive samples from Michigan, Wisconsin, and Manitoba. a. Do these strains cause sterility in males? b. Are there cross-infectivity issues emerging from a consideration of genetic mixing among populations? 2. The mortality/survivorship rates for all life stages in the wild are unknown. 3. We do not have a good understanding of the thresholds relating to numbers of individuals that could reasonably and feasibly be removed from wild populations. 4. There is a need for decision-making criteria. 5. The current state of knowledge on captive breeding programs at the Minnesota Zoo on Poweshiek is not informative for a head-starting program at this time. 6. The success rate of any type of ex situ or in situ program is unpredictable, and at this stage, any adopted program would be experimental on Poweshiek. Therefore, there is an unknown likelihood of success. 7. We do not have a good understanding of the underlying factors that are affecting population declines. 8. We currently have an inability to directly measure the success of a head-starting program. 9. The cost of handling individuals is unknown, although some observations suggest that adult handling may affect behavior, potentially negatively affecting reproduction and population size. 10. There is a need for a decision-making matrix that applies to populations/habitats/sites on the receiving end of any adopted ex situ program. 26 Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper: Ex situ assessment and planning Plenary discussion notes \u2022 Robert Dana: Unless we can establish a success rate that is higher than that in the wild \u2013 to avoid a sink \u2013 this might not work. We didn\u2019t decide whether we would be doing this program \u2013 yet to be determined. \u2022 We need to develop criteria or decision matrix \u2013 (e.g., to determine the appropriate number of individuals to use and the effect on the recipient population). \u2022 Scott Swengel: Impacts of handling individuals in the field: o 2.1% recapture but 21% recapture rate that the butterfly was marked while it was asleep (didn\u2019t know when they\u2019ve been handled). Butterflies never handled (not knowing) vs. handled (comparing legs vs wings may not mean much \u2013 both handled) o Extreme decline since 2012 may be due to handling stressor added to extreme heat and other stressors. Be careful when handling. Big Valley, Brandt Road/Holly, Long Lake sites \u2013 handled and decline; Halstead Lake site \u2013 not handled, no decline, slight increase; Scuppernong site \u2013 handled, 100% decline; Puchyan Prairie site \u2013 not handled, no decline. o Robert Dana\u2019s reply \u2013 50+ sites for Poweshiek in Minnesota, no individuals handled, all populations disappeared. So Scott\u2019s comment may be circumstantial evidence. o Take home message - the species is under a lot of stressors, so we need to be extremely careful when handling. Training is strongly advised.

Insurance program needed but not sure how successful we will be the first iteration of the program. For example, if the result of the insurance program was only a few individuals, all one sex, etc. then those individuals may be used differently, e.g, released. \u2022 Where is the best site for collecting founders? How many individuals would be appropriate to collect? \u2022 Head-starting, retaining some for restoration, considering insurance if enough individuals in the long-term goal. \u2022 \u201cPolicy\u201d level decision on where to grab sites \u2013 those with \u201crobust\u201d structure or from a site like Puchyan Prairie\u2013 to do this without being confident in our ability.

Ann commented that it will likely be very difficult to collect any adults at Puchyan Prairie, and we were not likely to get them all \u2013 it is a difficult site in which to work. \u2022 Should we implement one program with different sub-components and goals? Or several programs with different goals? For example, establish an insurance population that could also serve as a source population. Need to be explicit about each goal.

Based on this detailed analysis, this working group recommends short- and long-term plans with mixed ex situ strategies. The short-term plan focuses on head-starting for reinforcement of extant sites and surrogate research, while a long-term plan includes an insurance program and reintroductions to extirpated sites. Both the short- and long-term plans may act concurrently \u2013 certain decision points will trigger movement between programs (see Figure 2). The strategies will require cooperation between FWS and the state of Michigan, Michigan Natural Features Inventory, the Minnesota Zoo, the Nature Conservancy of Canada, Michigan landowners, and other partners and zoos (Table 9). Goals of the Mixed-Programs Approach: 1. Establish a head-start program to augment extant locations for reinforcement (intra-site). 2. Conduct research on a surrogate population. 3. Establish an insurance population (long term). 4. Reintroductions to locations with historical records (inter-site), but are thought to be extirpated (long term). Head-Start Program Head-start Program Vision \u2013 An increased population size and recruitment of the Poweshiek skipperling in the wild. Head-start Program: A head-start program for the Poweshiek skipperling is recommended, beginning in 2016, utilizing two wild founder source populations from Michigan (Brandt Road and Long Lake Fen). Propagules will be used to reinforce the populations where the collections were made (intra-site). It is recommended that the Assiniboine Park Zoo or other Canadian partner start a similar head-start program utilizing founders from two separate sites within the Tall Grass Prairie Preserve (8 and J67) starting in 2017, using time in 2016 to obtain permits, prepare facilities, and obtain training (from MN Zoo). 2016 Methods - Eggs from females will be collected on-site from a proportion of the individuals observed during the flight period.

Additional Programs Short- and Long-Term Goals: \u2022 Build up insurance program, until we have enough numbers for reintroduction (long-term). \u2022 Conduct research on a surrogate species to inform all ex situ programs. Also conduct habitat research and management of sites (short-term). Research Program: Research will be conducted concurrently, primarily on breeding and husbandry technique, using a closely-related species. Additional research (e.g., habitat) will occur at extant sites and potential reintroduction sites to determine suitability for reintroductions. Reintroduction Program: If large numbers of larvae survive the head-start program, it will trigger a decision whether to reintroduce those larvae to extirpated sites (inter-site). Insurance Program: If the surrogate husbandry research is successful, an insurance program may be created using captive-reared individuals (F1). Challenges for All Programs: Limited funding and staffing. Limited number of individual Poweshiek skipperlings available for collection. Uncertainty in husbandry techniques. Uncertain causes of decline. Uncertain risk of disease transmission.

Dave Cuthrell thought this site may be at its carrying capacity \u2013 may be a good source but we might want to think about releasing elsewhere (reintroduction) (e.g., Liberty Fen). \u2022 May want to focus our initial efforts at Holly Fen (Brandt Road) and Long Lake? These sites have relatively higher numbers (than Puchyan Prairie in WI and Buckhorn Lake in MI). Collection may not be practical at Puchyan Prairie or Buckhorn. Might be able to incorporate this into our decision tree. Head-start \u2013 start at Brandt Road (Holly Fen) and Long Lake Fen. \u2022 Are the small numbers observed a function of detectability? Su and Dave thought not, at Long Lake and Scuppernong, they observed the population coming together to one area (the population having shorter dispersal distances) during population lows. \u2022 Head-start for intra-site reinforcement and use the insurance program for source of reintroductions - to avoid the disease spread issue. \u2022 Wolbachia strain information \u2013 Even same strain may be deleterious. May be a limiting factor. So intra-site only until research indicates that inter-site is okay. Need a temporal decision tree. \u2022 Puchyan Prairie was discussed as a potential collection site but Ann raised the question of practicality \u2013 not likely to catch all individuals, if any, since the numbers observed has been so low over the last 4 years. Puchyan may be used for inter-site reinforcement (medium-long term goal depending on # of restoration animals available, outcome of Wolbachia strain determination, possibly surrogate research, population trend at Puchyan based on continued monitoring results, and consensus from advisory group). This was discussed in the context of an option to consider instead of trying to collect animals as a rescue. This may be best treated as a research question. \u2022 Adaptive management strategy \u2013 conducting research while conducting these programs and management actions. It may be difficult to monitor the outcomes. \u2022 We have agreed that Long Lake Fen, Brandt Road, and two locations within the TGG may be reasonable source populations. There was some discussion to try starting out with a population with low numbers as a \u201ctest\u201d? We may not be able to collect enough individuals to start the program, so that option didn\u2019t seem like a viable option. \u2022 Disease transmission \u2013 stress factors that would make them more susceptible to fungus, etc. Pick anything up from host plants in the lab.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a26d713-f2fa-4053-961a-3765f953790c": {"__data__": {"id_": "7a26d713-f2fa-4053-961a-3765f953790c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/poweshiek-skipperling-and-dakota-skipper-ex-situ-assessment-and-planning", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper : ex situ assessment and planning workshop", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/poweshiek-skipperling-and-dakota-skipper-ex-situ-assessment-and-planning", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e992d682ac89d33030d1dd0a4528583c3a6b9275987afe7fdac3d36afd6288a5"}, "2": {"node_id": "06f868d2-91d1-425a-8a7a-e7c7126abb72", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/poweshiek-skipperling-and-dakota-skipper-ex-situ-assessment-and-planning", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "62f8fae1b149de8f41ed264dcd7ccc4e00fc9ddbfdb6c67dd14ab9cfa81b951d"}}, "hash": "68b659f7c28e60e5774c84a1042b3833ee64764b5d174acd70b3e5beb97ed07f", "text": "Pick anything up from host plants in the lab.

Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper: Ex situ assessment and planning 39 Discussion: What is the numerical benefit we can expect to observe from a head-starting program? Assumptions: \u2022 Even sex ratio observed in the field \u2022 20% capture rate of individuals in the wild (Given 30 individuals, Su felt that she could capture about 6 females) \u2022 Total female egg productive estimate = 100 eggs \u2022 30 eggs collected per female per 48-hour egg-laying period after capture \u2022 Hatch rate of collected eggs = 80% \u2022 Egg-to-adult survivorship in the wild = 3% \u2022 Egg-to-pupa survivorship in captivity = 30% \u2022 Pupa-to-adult survivorship in the wild = 95% Scenario 1: No ex situ management a. 10 females in the wild, each lays 100 eggs = total production of 1000 eggs. b. If we assume 3% survival of those eggs to the adult stage, we then estimate 30 adults are produced in wild conditions. Scenario 2: Ex situ management \u2013 head-starting a. We collect eggs from 20% of wild females. If we assume a total adult female population of 10 individuals as before, we will collect 60 eggs from two individuals during the egg-laying period after capture. b. From 60 eggs we will expect 48 to successfully hatch. c. From 48 newly-hatched individuals we will expect 14 pupae. d. From 14 pupae we will expect 13 adults to successfully emerge. e. The two females captured for egg-laying are returned to the wild. We expect each of those females to lay an additional 70 (100-30) eggs in the wild, for a total of 140 eggs. We expect a total of 4 adults to survive from this second batch of eggs. f. The remaining 8 individuals in the wild will lay 100 eggs each, for a total of 800 eggs. We expect a total of 24 adults to survive from this third batch of eggs. g. The total numbers surviving would be 13+4+24 = 41 adults produced under a combined program incorporating a head-starting component. Scenario 2 results in a nearly 40% increase in the recruitment of adults to the wild population, compared to a scenario where ex situ management activities are not included. These calculations, of course, are based on a series of assumptions \u2013 but assumptions that are largely supported by field observations and ex situ management experience. 40 Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper: Ex situ assessment and planning Discussion Notes on Roles and Responsibilities 1.

We asked: which parts of the life history are under the greatest threat to ensure long term viability?

Pre-diapause larval survival (7) a. Ant predation between hatching and shelter construction b. Abundance of (preferred) food plants c. Pesticides d. Extreme weather events \u2013 hailstorms, flooding 2. Habitat fragmentation (6) a. Populations vulnerable to extinction by stochastic events, poor management even at small scales b.

See Habitat fragmentation \u2013 we considered these two threats tightly linked 6. Egg survival (0) a. Summer burns; grazing b. Early haying 7. Diapausing larvae (0) a. High overwinter mortality b. High mortality due to temperature or humidity extremes Notes from the discussion accompanying the threat evaluation: \u2022 Larval stage most important and most mortality in captivity seen in early part of larval stage. Overwintering is long, but there is little perturbation (haying, etc.) during that time. Most fire management and flooding (e.g., in Manitoba) occurs post-diapause. \u2022 Grazing \u2013 private is typically season-long; removes nectar; cattle not likely eating DS larvae, but may trample them; may cause adults to leave affected patch; and only depriving larvae of food when very overgrazed; may have secondary effects on habitat quality (e.g., reducing near-soil and soil humidity/moisture levels and altering plant composition); DS still extant on some grazed sites, but extirpated from others; \u2022 Egg stage \u2013 probably a low priority, initially. \u2022 Ex situ takes a lot of resources, so we may have to be very targeted to have an impact. \u2022 What is feasible in terms of reintroduction based on ex situ? Release of pupae or moving adults; numbers would have to be in 100\u2019s or 1000\u2019s; if adults are moved, nectar resources would have to be sufficient and larval host plants would have to be present in sufficient abundance; \u2022 Research as a purpose for ex situ management \u2013 recognized as important by group. \u2022 Multi-colored Asian lady beetles \u2013 how can we handle this type of threat in this discussion? \u2022 Late-stage larvae would rebuild shelter if reintroduced at that stage \u2013 potentially costly to survival. \u2022 Where would we reintroduce? o Sites where fire has caused extirpation? \uf0a7 Tall Grass Prairie Preserve (Manitoba) \uf0a7 Lostwood NWR \uf0a7 Cayler Prairie Preserve \uf0a7 Where management will be conducive to conservation of species \u2013 planned fire management must be conducive to species\u2019 conservation. \u2022 How would we reintroduce? o Translocation of adults: May be less expensive (e.g., in MB could easily move 100s of adults) Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper: Ex situ assessment and planning 43 Identification of Potential Population Management Roles to Address Threats With the threat evaluation for Dakota skipper in hand, and the set of potential ex situ and in situ management options available to us, we identified which option would be effective in addressing each of the identified species threats.

Extinction risk from stochastic events or poor management (even at small scales) could be addressed by augmentation using an ex situ population as a source for restoration. Translocation among wild populations could address the negative impacts of a reduction in occupied range, and a wild-to- wild rescue could reduce the probability of a pending local extinction of a very small population. Inherently low reproduction in small populations could potentially be addressed through both a maternity ward approach and through protected conditions in the wild. \u2022 Threats from extreme fire in important habitats could be addressed through release from an ex situ source populations, adult translocations from other wild populations, and a head-start program. These methods would have to be timed very carefully in case the habitat is not suitable for a few years. 44 Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper: Ex situ assessment and planning \u2022 Low reproductive success in the wild may benefit from an in situ protected condition in the wild, in order to artificially concentrate adults to increase mating. Augmentation from an ex situ source population can supplement natural reproduction. \u2022 Overwinter survival could be enhanced through protected conditions in the wild, e.g., manipulation of snow cover to provide optimal conditions. A research population could also be used to determine developmental thresholds, which may vary geographically. \u2022 Egg survival could be enhanced through a head-start program, but the length of time that a female should be held in unknown, as is the proportion of eggs that should be collected.

This study includes an examination of the pros and cons of each program alternative. Where feasible, specific \u201cfixes\u201d were identified that could alleviate any one of the weaknesses (\u201ccons\u201d) of a given program management alternative. Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper: Ex situ assessment and planning 45 Insurance Population Goal and Purpose: Prevent the Dakota skipper from becoming extinct Table 12: Pros and cons of an insurance population program for the Dakota skipper. Pros Cons 1. Remove individuals from a potential threat. 2. Ability to maintain a population over time. 3. Potential to ramp up numbers quickly with breeding. 1. Concerned with our ability to maintain a viable captive population in the long- term. 2. The current status of the species in the wild does not suggest that this option would be a high priority for long-term conservation. Notes & Discussion Points: \u2022 Based on this analysis, the group decided to discard the Insurance Population option for Dakota skipper. 46 Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper: Ex situ assessment and planning Source for Population Restoration Goal: Maintain a population of Dakota skippers at a propagation facility to serve as a source for reintroduction, with at least one generation of captive breeding. Structure: 1. Initial process would resemble head-start program, but with continued infusion of new genes. Would also have to have agreements in place similar to what would be needed for headstarting to collect females, transport eggs, etc. Table 13: Pros and cons of a source for population restoration program for the Dakota skipper. Pros Cons 1. Able to know the lineage of offspring to inform genetic concerns related to reintroductions. 2. Could facilitate reintroduction. 3. Cross populations to simulate gene flow. 4. Facilities outreach to public (e.g., to zoo visitors). 5. Could increase survival relative to wild individuals. 1. Potential loss of genetic diversity and/or selection for captive conditions. 2. Labor intensive. 3. Costly. Notes & Discussion Points: \u2022 There is a need to introduce genes from the wild periodically to maintain diversity of captive population. \u2022 Replicate wild conditions as much as possible. \u2022 There is a potential risk \u2013 potential for loss of wild adaptations and genetic diversity.

Pros Cons 1. Potential for increasing survival of offspring relative to what would occur in the wild. 2. May increase number of eggs laid if life of female is extended compared to natural survival. 3. Could facilitate reintroduction or augmentation. 4. Could reduce adverse or avoid impacts on source population if some offspring are returned to the source site. 5. Facilities outreach to public (e.g., to zoo visitors) 1. Reduce egg contribution to wild population \u2013 would be more adverse effect in small populations. 2. To be useful, there would have to be a viable site for their release. 3. Costly \u2013 costs increased with duration of time offspring kept in captivity. 4. Timing of release may conflict with other work \u2013 e.g., capture, holding and release of adults would have to take place during time with other work is underway. 5. Permanent removal of females from the wild could introduce the need to transport the female soon after its capture to an area where offspring can be housed. Permanent removal may not be pursued, however, with females likely to be returned to site of capture after collection of a portion of her eggs. 6. A chance of releasing offspring into habitats where they will not lead to establishment or will not effectively augment a population \u2013 need to address factors that would adversely affect population viability at release site. 7. Do not know male lineage of eggs \u2013 could figure this out retrospectively with dead larvae, but that is expensive. 8. Introduce/transmit disease, especially if placing into an area where a population is still present. 9. Impossible to measure success if augmenting established population with life stages that could not be tracked or resighted. Notes & Discussion Points: \u2022 There is a need to document carefully all procedures and structure program as a research project to learn from outcomes of releases. \u2022 There needs to be an accepted system of ranking sites for reintroduction/augmentation \u2013 include a set of criteria that would indicate likelihood of success. This could include survey data; presence and status of important stressors (e.g., invasive species, management, etc.) \u2022 There may be research needs to better understand how to rank sites for reintroduction. \u2022 It is important to set up program to monitor and evaluate success of reintroduction efforts based on criteria established before the reintroduction \u2022 There is a risk of keeping offspring to adult stage of having few in developmental synchrony \u2013 release of larvae may reduce this risk by allowing them to acclimate to local conditions.

Wolbachia research is ongoing. Disease issues may only be a significant issue when releasing individuals where they could mix with existing wild populations. No disease issues evident thus far with Dakota skipper at Minnesota Zoo. \u2022 Likelihood of success \u2013 Unknown. Success would be dependent on our ability to determine whether a site contains the features necessary to support a viable population; on the subsequent behavior of the released individuals; and, on the production of a sufficient number of individuals. \u2022 Likely future for the wild population in the absence of ex situ or translocation activities \u2013 Recovery may be unlikely without our ability to reestablish populations in areas from which the species has been extirpated. A significant number of populations face significant threats and have an uncertain future. There are sites from which the Dakota skipper has been extirpated where habitat conditions are likely suitable to support the species if it can be reintroduced (e.g., Tall Grass Prairie Preserve in southern Manitoba). 50 Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper: Ex situ assessment and planning Temporary Rescue (Salvage) Goal: Prevent extirpation or high mortality of Dakota skippers \u2013 temporarily - due to predictable imminent threats. The Temporary Rescue (Salvage) option for the Dakota skipper was briefly considered then discarded as a feasible conservation option. Events that would trigger the implementation of this option are quite unpredictable. Additionally, such a salvage operation could only occur during the short flight period. Finally, the release site would have to pre-identified, which would be difficult to implement in practical terms. Taken together, these issues prompted us to remove this option from consideration. Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper: Ex situ assessment and planning 51 Research Population Goal: to address key research and information needs to contribute to the species\u2019 conservation, including: \u2022 Development of a protocol for rearing Dakota skippers in captivity \u2013 protocol should be feasible for use by other institutions \u2013 to produce animals for research and conservation activities \u2022 To test methods to successfully release individuals into the wild to contribute to species\u2019 recovery. For example, we could experimentally release a certain number of head-start larvae and then monitor the reintroduction site to determine whether a population becomes successfully established Structure: 1. Would depend in part on the research question; maintain individuals at propagation facility by using methods similar to the head-start and the source population programs. Wild females would be captured to collect eggs. Animals used in research would be those derived from captive rearing of individuals (eggs) removed from the wild as well as those obtained from captive breeding. Table 15: Pros and cons of a source for research population program for the Dakota skipper. Pros Cons 1. Would facilitate increase in our understanding of species\u2019 life history, behavior, etc. by conducting research that may not be feasible with wild individuals. 2. Would provide more useful information than research using surrogate species. 3. Would increase knowledge base for improving captive rearing practices. 1. Would divert individuals from potential release into the wild for reintroduction. 2. Could decrease sizes of populations from which eggs are diverted \u2013 could release some of propagated larvae to offset this. 3. Funding may be difficult to obtain for research as opposed to rearing that is done with the intention of reintroducing populations \u2013 could resolve with public education/outreach.

Structure: 1. A wide variety of possibilities \u2013 could include preventing combustion of portions of habitats during prescribed burns (e.g., mowing firebreaks around selected habitat patches); grazing exclosures; minimizing predation within exclosures; putting adults into tent in field to increase proportion of females that are mated (i.e., minimizing effects of Allee effect); capture adults and put them in cool and/or shaded spot to reduce heat stress. Table 16: Pros and cons of an ex situ protected conditions in the field program for the Dakota skipper. Pros Cons 1. Reduce mortality due to land management practices. 2. May facilitate some research projects. 1. Generally difficult, labor intensive, and not feasibly implemented except in small areas \u2013 except for management of prescribed fire or grazing. 2. High cost-benefit ratio. 3. Generally more appropriate for research purposes. Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper: Ex situ assessment and planning 53 Wild \u2013 to \u2013 Wild Translocation Goal: Promote population viability through genetic and/or demographic augmentation of existing population and by increasing the number of populations through reintroduction. Structure: 1. Capture of adults and moving them to sites from which the species has been extirpated. For example, in Canada \u2013 capture adults in SW Manitoba and move to Tall Grass Prairie Preserve where they appear to have been extirpated by fire management. Table 17: Pros and cons of a wild-wild translocation program for the Dakota skipper. Pros Cons 1. Less costly than captive rearing. 2. Could facilitate reestablishment of populations in areas from which species has been extirpated. 1. Reduce sizes of source populations. This may be resolved by augmenting source site with captive-reared larvae/pupae. 2. Requires intensive work during the flight period. 3. Does not take advantage of captive rearing infrastructure that is already in place. Notes & Discussion Points: \u2022 There is a need for research to understand how likely adult translocation is to succeed relative to placing larvae or pupae into the reintroduction site. \u2022 We need to have a site to put them or a legitimate use (e.g., research). \u2022 There is also a need for a system to identify and rank potential reintroduction sites. \u2022 The phenology of recipient sites may be out of synch with the source sites. 54 Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper: Ex situ assessment and planning Wild \u2013 to \u2013 Wild Rescue (Salvage) Goal: To remediate the emergency loss of a population and to prevent an inevitable loss of a population. This strategy would have to be limited to adults during their flight period and only to situations where the need for salvage would have to be prompted by something that anticipated before flight occurs.

Larvae for reintroduction will be produced primarily by head-starting \u2013 that is, by collecting eggs from wild females and rearing the eggs at the zoo to produce larvae or pupae for release. Individuals used for controlled experiments will be derived from captive stock to the maximum extent practicable; up to 25% of larvae obtained from wild eggs, however, may be used for research (Fig. 4). Some larvae or pupae may be produced from mating of captive-reared adults at the Minnesota Zoo. This may consist largely of individuals that survive research projects and become adults at the zoo, but captive rearing and breeding to produce an F1 generation may also be used to generate a sufficient number of offspring to establish a reintroduced population. Figure 4. Schematic diagram of ex situ management proposed for the Dakota skipper. 56 Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper: Ex situ assessment and planning The US Fish and Wildlife Service will consult with species- and subject matter experts to help develop a process for selecting and ranking potential reintroduction sites within the historical range of the Dakota skipper. USFWS will coordinate the selection of team members and the ranking of sites in collaboration with Minnesota DNR and Minnesota Zoo; other entities will be consulted, as appropriate. The Service will also convene a team of species experts to determine the most appropriate developmental stage when head-started or captive bred larvae or pupae will be released. This team will also develop the methods for release and will ensure that planned activities are appropriately permitted and that the public and any stakeholders are informed appropriately. Larvae may be ready for release from the Minnesota Zoo in the summer of 2016, although a systematic review of potential reintroduction sites may not be complete before then. Therefore, this release site may best be described as a trial release. The detailed methods to be followed for site selection and release techniques will form the basis of a reintroduction plan to be developed in accordance with the USFWS Policy Regarding Controlled Propagation of Species Listed under the Endangered Species Act (http://www.fws.gov/endangered/laws- policies/policy-controlled-propagation.html). This reintroduction plan will also follow relevant IUCN guidelines, including the 2013 Guidelines for Reintroductions and Other Conservation Translocations. In addition to the information contained in this action plan, the reintroduction plan will include the following components: \u2022 A justification for controlled propagation of the Dakota skipper; \u2022 Descriptions of the methods to be used to select reintroduction sites; \u2022 A description of monitoring to be carried out; \u2022 Descriptions of sites to be used as egg sources; \u2022 A description of the facilities to be used for ex situ management; \u2022 Genetic considerations; \u2022 A description of the risks associated with the planned activities; and, \u2022 A description of alternatives to ex situ management. Responsibility Agencies and individuals that will be responsible for general tasks are described below. Persons named in parentheses were present during the workshop held at Minnesota Zoo on October 20-22, 2015 and were members of the Dakota Skipper planning team. \u2022 USFWS (Phil Delphey) will organize reintroduction activities in collaboration and communication with partners, including Minnesota DNR, Minnesota Zoo, and others. \u2022 Minnesota DNR (Robert Dana) will carry out or oversee monitoring of the Minnesota source population, Felton Prairie, and any reintroduced populations in Minnesota. \u2022 Minnesota Zoo (Erik Runquist) will be the primary entity to carry out ex situ management (headstarting, captive breeding, etc.) and will also carry out research. Additional responsibilities are shown in the timeline below (Table 19). The Reintroduction Working Group will be an ad hoc group convened by members of the planning team to assist with the development of the proposed program.

Table 20. Estimated annual budget for project activities. Description Cost ($)/year Egg collection, ex situ management (MN Zoo) ~200,000 Monitoring/Surveys (MN DNR) Partners In addition to the members of the planning team that were present at the workshop, the following groups and individuals are essential to accomplish the action. Additional partners are likely to be needed and added as the project progresses. \u2022 Minnesota Zoo \u2022 Minnesota DNR \u2022 USFWS \u2022 Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate \u2022 The Nature Conservancy \u2022 Dennis Skadsen \u2022 South Dakota Department of Game, Fish, and Parks Obstacles The following are some of the hurdles that must be overcome to reach the project\u2019s goals. \u2022 The number of Dakota skipper populations that are large enough to safely remove eggs while avoiding effects to their viability may be limiting. This may be the primary factor limiting the number of larvae that can be produced. \u2022 Sites where reintroduction may have a high probability of success may be limiting. It may be difficult to identify one or more sites where habitat conditions and other factors are suitable to ensure that viable populations of the Dakota skipper would be supported. Management activities or research may be necessary to ensure that we find sites suitable for reintroduction. \u2022 Personnel available for ex situ management, including husbandry at zoo and fieldwork, is currently limiting. The zoo may need at least one more person on the project to ensure that project goals may be met. \u2022 Our attempts to determine the number of Dakota skippers that are needed to reestablish the species in formerly occupied habitats and to evaluate potential reintroduction sites may rely on finding and funding researchers to address important research questions. Funds for research are often limiting and could limit our ability to maximize reach our goals. 60 Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper: Ex situ assessment and planning Measurable Outcomes \u2022 Production of at least 800 post-diapause larvae and/or pupae for reintroduction and research each year. \u2022 Completion of husbandry manual (likely to be approximately March/April 2016) \u2022 A description of the number of larvae/pupae that must be released to reestablish a viable population \u2013 consistent evidence of recruitment would be the basic criterion for population viability.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4005364a-3b2e-4520-85b8-c02a46eb7bf2": {"__data__": {"id_": "4005364a-3b2e-4520-85b8-c02a46eb7bf2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/poweshiek-skipperling-and-dakota-skipper-ex-situ-assessment-and-planning", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper : ex situ assessment and planning workshop", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/poweshiek-skipperling-and-dakota-skipper-ex-situ-assessment-and-planning", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4284847a1a08bb1b49b7b2056fc397322e8c877b3de40d2dacfb884531ff76e7"}, "2": {"node_id": "b83d6f2f-870f-45a6-b9e8-37d035166e2f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/poweshiek-skipperling-and-dakota-skipper-ex-situ-assessment-and-planning", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bcec24b068aad7a162ed6d9efca080f446613a38208c259b3d35eb85b902188f"}}, "hash": "1fefe20a09bc45bf7f9d6e8b32c4e3f79ae80df43332993e08e4d6f1bf6a3b79", "text": "\u2022 At least one viable population reestablished in the wild by 2021. \u2022 Contributed at least 175 larvae to the larval food study and 30 for \u2018soybean aphid\u2019 pesticide study.

Drafting process and acknowledgements A working group was established to revise the IUCN Technical Guidelines on the Management of Ex Situ Populations for Conservation to clarify the process and bring the guidelines into line with developments that had taken place since their publication in 2002. This process started with an analysis of decision-making steps for evaluating ex situ activities for conservation benefit during the Annual Meeting of the IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC) Conservation Breeding Specialist Group (CBSG) in Cologne, Germany in October 2010. This analysis was undertaken by individuals involved in a range of taxonomic and disciplinary SSC Specialist Groups, in situ conservation organisations, and the zoo and aquarium community. Subsequently, a drafting team was formed under the auspices of CBSG, comprising Kristin Leus (CBSG Europe, Copenhagen Zoo), Kathy Traylor-Holzer (CBSG), and Philip McGowan (Galliformes Specialist Group). They were supported by representatives from all SSC Subcommittees, namely Mike Maunder (Plant Conservation Subcommittee), Yvonne Sadovy (Marine Conservation Subcommittee), Paul Pearce-Kelly (Invertebrate Conservation Subcommittee), Topiltzin Contreras MacBeath (Freshwater Conservation Subcommittee), and Mark Stanley Price (Species Conservation Planning Subcommittee).

We also acknowledge the support of home institutions and organisations of all contributors for allowing them the time to carry out this work. We hope that these guidelines contribute to the evaluation and, where appropriate, application of ex situ management for effective species conservation. i Guidelines Section 1: Introduction As habitats and ecosystems become increasingly altered and populations evermore impacted by human activities, a growing number of species will require some form of management of both individuals and populations to ensure their survival. Effective species conservation planning should consider all options when assessing what actions are necessary to address the conservation pressures facing a particular species. Ex situ management (see Section 2 for definition) is one possible option that can contribute to the conservation of threatened species. The range of ex situ scenarios and tools is diverse and can target different conservation needs and roles and, therefore, serve various purposes. Ex situ management has been used to deliver conservation benefit for threatened species. Species extinctions have been prevented and for an increasing number of species there have been conservation restorations or introductions following periods of ex situ management. However, the need for, and suitability of, an ex situ programme must be carefully evaluated as part of an integrated conservation strategy. In order to be successful, ex situ programmes need to be carefully planned and implemented in a way that provides conservation benefit. In addition, as conservation challenges become more complex and urgent, the need to further develop scientifically based and innovative approaches to ex situ conservation will increase. Not all species will require an ex situ component as part of their conservation strategy, and not all ex situ populations will have a direct conservation purpose. These guidelines are intended to be used in situations in which ex situ management is being considered as part of an overall integrated species conservation strategy. The aim of these guidelines is to provide practical guidance on evaluating the suitability and requirements of an ex situ component for achieving species conservation objectives. They should not be misconstrued as promoting ex situ management over any other form of conservation action, and specific elements should not be selected in isolation to justify ex situ management for conservation. Indeed they are intended to ensure that proposals for any such activities are rigorously designed and scrutinised, whatever the taxon or scale of operation. Accordingly, the need for risk assessment and sound decision making processes in all ex situ management for conservation is emphasised, but with the level of effort in proportion to the scale, risk and uncertainties around any such activity. These guidelines replace the 2002 IUCN Technical Guidelines on the Management of Ex Situ Populations for Conservation. In addition, aspects of these guidelines merge with many other disciplines in contemporary conservation, which also have their own guidelines or policies. Within IUCN, these guidelines should be seen as complementary to, and consistent with, the following key works: \u2022 IUCN Guidelines for Reintroductions and Other Conservation Translocations (2013)1. In those cases where individuals are used for population restoration or conservation introduction following a period of ex situ management, these guidelines should be consulted together. \u2022 IUCN Guidelines for the Prevention of Biodiversity Loss Caused by Alien Invasive Species (2000)1. \u2022 IUCN (2008). Strategic Planning for Species Conservation: A Handbook1. 1 http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/species/publications/iucn_guidelines_and__policy__statements/ 1 \u2022 IUCN (2000). The IUCN Policy Statement on Sustainable Use of Wild Living Resources1 \u2022 OIE and IUCN (2014). Guidelines for Wildlife Disease Risk Analysis1 \u2022 IUCN World Commission on Protected Areas (2012). Ecological Restoration for Protected Areas: Principles, guidelines and best practices2 \u2022 IUCN Red List3 It should also be noted that many other organisations have developed their own guidelines for activities in the spectrum from species reintroduction to ecosystem restoration.

While we encourage the evaluation of the full \u201cin situ to ex situ\u201d spectrum of population management options in the process of identifying the most suitable conservation strategies for a species, these guidelines are designed to provide guidance for situations towards the ex situ end of the spectrum. For the purpose of these guidelines, \u201cex situ\u201d is defined as conditions under which individuals are spatially restricted with respect to their natural spatial patterns or those of their progeny, are removed from many of their natural ecological processes, and are managed on some level by humans. In essence, the individuals are maintained in artificial conditions under different selection pressures than those in natural conditions in a natural habitat. These are generally circumstances in which humans exercise control over many of the natural dynamics of a population, including control of climate and living environments, access to nutrition and water, shelter, reproductive opportunities, and protection from predation or certain other natural causes of mortality. Ex situ management may take place either within or outside the species\u2019 geographic range, but is in a controlled or modified environment. This may include highly artificial environments where individuals are stored as dormant in subzero conditions (e.g. seedbanks, genome resource banks), or semi-natural conditions where individuals are subject to near natural environments. 2 http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/gpap_home/gpap_capacity2/gpap_bpg/?10734/Ecological-Restoration- for-Protected-Areas 3 http://www.iucnredlist.org/ 2 These guidelines are specifically intended for situations in which individuals (or live bio- samples) of any species (or other taxonomic unit) are present ex situ for any period of time for a clearly defined conservation purpose. For simplicity, the guidelines use the terms of \u201cindividual\u201d to represent both individuals and live bio-samples and \u201cspecies\u201d to represent any taxonomic unit of conservation interest. These guidelines apply to: Ecological contexts - All taxonomic groups (animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, protozoa, etc.); - All taxonomic levels (e.g. species, subspecies or different groupings of these); - All population levels (e.g. all individuals of a species, single population, multiple populations); - All live entities (not only whole living organisms, but also gametes, seeds, living cell lines, etc.); and - All geographic levels (e.g. local, national, global). Management contexts - Both situations in which individuals need to be taken from the wild and brought under ex situ management, and situations in which the management of existing ex situ populations may be utilized or adapted for conservation benefit; - The complete spectrum of very short term to very long term ex situ phases that may or may not include all life stages or reproduction; and - Only ex situ populations with clearly defined conservation goals and objectives that contribute to the viability of the species as a component of its overall conservation strategy. While many different types of ex situ populations exist, with many different and sometimes overlapping roles and contexts, ex situ management for conservation only applies to those ex situ populations that have conservation as their primary aim. The ex situ activities must benefit a population, the species, or the ecosystem it occupies and the primary benefit should be at a higher level of organisation than the individual. The conservation goals and objectives can be diverse and may include not only providing individuals for reintroduction or other conservation translocations, for genetic rescue or as insurance against extinction, but also for allowing tailored conservation education, conservation research and training that targets the reduction of threats or the accruement of conservation benefits for the species. This does not preclude these ex situ populations for conservation from having additional roles that are not necessarily, or only indirectly and generally, related to conservation. Section 3: Ex situ management as a conservation tool Not all species conservation strategies will require an ex situ component, in the same way that other management interventions may or may not be required to conserve a species.

It is in such instances that intensive management, including but not restricted to ex situ management, can be of particular conservation value if deemed appropriate for the species and situation. 3 Ex situ conservation has the potential to: Address the causes of primary threats Ex situ activities can help reduce primary threats such as habitat loss, exploitation, invasive species or disease when specifically designed conservation research, conservation training or conservation education activities directly and effectively impact the causes of these threats (e.g. training in the recognition of specific life stages or gender characteristics for preferential exploitation, education to limit the spread of an invasive species, or research into disease epidemiology or treatment). Offset the effects of threats Ex situ activities can improve the demographic and/or genetic viability of a wild population by ameliorating the impacts of primary or stochastic threats on the population. Small populations that are vulnerable to primary threats and stochastic processes may require some form of intensive management of individuals and populations to improve demographic and genetic viability and avoid extinction. Challenges faced by small populations (e.g. reduced survival, reduced reproduction, decreased population size, and genetic isolation) can be counteracted by a range of population management options, such as head start programmes to address high juvenile mortality, or population reinforcement to balance age and sex distribution. Buy time Establishment of a diverse and sustainable ex situ rescue or insurance population may be critical in preventing species extinction when wild population decline is steep and the chance of sufficiently rapid reduction of primary threats is slim or uncertain or has been inadequately successful to date. Examples include ex situ populations in response to severe disease threat, catastrophic events or continued habitat degradation. Restore wild populations Once the primary threats have been sufficiently addressed, ex situ populations can be used for population restoration (reinforcement or reintroduction) or conservation introduction (assisted colonisation or ecological replacement). As such, these guidelines should be seen as complementary to, and consistent with, the IUCN Guidelines for Reintroductions and Other Conservation Translocations1, and any ex situ programme for conservation that includes a return of individuals from ex situ conditions to natural conditions must equally refer to these. For a growing number of taxa ex situ management may play a critical role in preventing extinction as habitats continue to decline or alter and become increasingly unsuitable. Furthermore, it should be acknowledged that even under the most optimistic of climate change impact and adaptation scenarios, an increasing percentage of species (for example, polar and mountain species; reef corals and their dependent species) may have little likelihood of long-term persistence in the wild, despite the option of assisted colonisation in certain carefully selected cases. At present, many threat assessment processes are inadequate in predicting the complex impacts of climate change and ocean acidification on the potential persistence of a species in situ (either within its current or a new range). 4 Section 4: Integrating in situ and ex situ conservation planning There is an increasing need to ensure the integration of in situ and ex situ conservation planning to ensure that, whenever appropriate, ex situ conservation is used to support in situ conservation to the best effect possible. These guidelines would therefore ideally be used as an integral part of, and complementary to, existing species conservation planning processes (Figure 1). Any ex situ conservation support should follow a logical process from initial concept to design, feasibility, risk assessment, decision-making, implementation, monitoring, adjustment and evaluation. Furthermore, the Species Survival Commission\u2019s approach to conservation planning for species1 requires the specification of goals, objectives and actions: \u2022 A goal is a statement of the intended result in terms of conservation benefit; \u2022 Objectives give clear and specific details for how the goal will be realised; and \u2022 Actions are statements of what should be done to meet the objectives. When used strategically ex situ conservation can be a potent tool for species conservation that does not undermine, but complements, the imperatives of field conservation. Potential ex situ goals, objectives and actions should therefore be evaluated alongside potential in situ activities in the process of conservation planning to ensure that they are used appropriately and to best effect. More specifically, before an ex situ conservation programme is developed or continued, it is important to consider the roles it can play, the characteristics and dimensions it should take, and what factors will impede or likely contribute to conservation success. As is the case for conservation planning in general, these evaluations are ideally made by a multi-stakeholder group, including both in situ and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "80548c15-0dc2-4fdb-adf4-26fc74507e0f": {"__data__": {"id_": "80548c15-0dc2-4fdb-adf4-26fc74507e0f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/poweshiek-skipperling-and-dakota-skipper-ex-situ-assessment-and-planning", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper : ex situ assessment and planning workshop", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/poweshiek-skipperling-and-dakota-skipper-ex-situ-assessment-and-planning", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "80b1f906a72c2928bfe070d7808727eb266399ba187280ff2bd88866453327d6"}}, "hash": "80b1f906a72c2928bfe070d7808727eb266399ba187280ff2bd88866453327d6", "text": "ex situ expertise and experience. These guidelines outline five steps (Figure 1) to evaluate the appropriateness of ex situ management as part of a comprehensive species conservation strategy. They explore the conservation role and design, feasibility, and risk assessment, and guide a final decision on whether or not to proceed with an ex situ programme for conservation. The five-step process also provides input for the formulation of clear goals, objectives and actions for any ex situ conservation programme undertaken after the decision making process. FIVE-STEP DECISION MAKING PROCESS to decide when ex situ management is an appropriate conservation tool Ex situ management should be applied to the conservation of a species where, on balance, stakeholders can be confident that the expected positive impact on the conservation of that species will outweigh the potential risks or any negative impact (which could be to the local population, species, habitat or ecosystem), and that its use will be a wise application of the available resources. This requires an assessment of the potential net positive impact, weighted by how likely it is that this potential will be realised, given the expertise, level of difficulty or uncertainty, and available resources. The following five-step outline provides a logical decision-making process that can be applied to evaluate the appropriateness of ex situ management as a tool to support the conservation of a species and to identify the form that such management would need to take. All steps of the process should be documented for transparency and clarity. 5 STEP 1. Compile a status review of the species, including a threat analysis. A detailed review should be undertaken of all relevant information on the species, both in the wild and ex situ, with the aim of assessing the viability of the population(s) and to identify and understand threats that affect the species. This is a normal step in any conservation planning process and may therefore for some species already be available in existing conservation strategies or action plans. If not, this process would ideally be conducted in the wider framework of the creation of one integrated conservation strategy for a species. a. The status review should contain information on all factors that are appropriate to the life history and taxonomy, current population status, and other factors that are relevant to the demographic and genetic viability and ecosystem function of the species being considered. The structure of the status review (and threat analysis \u2013 see b. below) should, wherever possible, be consistent with IUCN processes that also compile information on status, such as the IUCN Red List Assessments3 and the IUCN/SSC Species Conservation Planning approach1. The character and scale of the status review will vary depending on the precise circumstances, including data availability and relevance. Important information gaps concerning the status should be noted. b. A threat analysis should be undertaken to identify the specific historical, current and likely future primary direct and indirect threats as well as stochastic threats facing the species in the wild and the constraints limiting its viability and conservation. This analysis should, wherever possible, utilise the rapidly growing data knowledge on anticipated climate change scenarios to predict likely changes in status. This provides the framework for evaluating specifically how ex situ management of the species may contribute to its conservation. c. Genetic and demographic modelling should where possible be used to assess the viability of the wild population. This can be very valuable to guide population management by identifying the effects and relative importance of threats (including stochastic processes) and the strategies that may address them effectively. d. The status of any free-living populations living outside of the species\u2019 indigenous range, as well as the status of existing ex situ population(s) (if any), should be reviewed, including current population size, demographic and genetic characteristics, provenance and history, taxonomy, and any programme goals and management methods if applicable. e. In the absence of sufficient data for a thorough assessment, other information may be considered as evidence suggestive of current or impending population decline or reduced viability, such as population trends, likelihood of future habitat loss, vulnerability to climate change, projected impact of invasive species, and restricted range to one or few locations. 6 STEP 2. Define the role(s) that ex situ management will play in the overall conservation of the species. The potential ex situ management strategies proposed should address one or more specific threats or constraints to the species\u2019 viability and conservation as identified in the status review and threat analysis, and target improvement of its conservation status. a.

When sufficient data and expertise are available, population modelling can be effective in assessing the potential impact of the ex situ programme on the viability of the wild population. b. Potential roles (purpose/function) that an ex situ programme might serve for the conservation of a species generally fall into the four categories of Addressing the causes of primary threats, Offsetting the effects of threats, Buying time, and Restoring wild populations (see Section 3) and more specifically include but are not restricted to: \u2022 Insurance population (maintaining a viable ex situ population of the species to prevent predicted local, regional or global species extinction and preserve options for future conservation strategies); \u2022 Temporary rescue (temporary removal from the wild to protect from catastrophes or predicted imminent threats, e.g. extreme weather, disease, oil spill, wildlife trade). This could be appropriate at either local or global scale; \u2022 Maintenance of a long term ex situ population after extinction of all known wild populations and as a preparation for reintroduction or assisted colonisation if and when feasible; \u2022 Demographic manipulation (e.g. head-start programmes that remove individuals from the wild to reduce mortality during a specific life stage and then subsequently return them to the wild); \u2022 Source for population restoration, either to re-establish the species into part of its former range from which it has disappeared, or to reinforce an existing population (e.g. for demographic, behavioural or genetic purposes); \u2022 Source for ecological replacement to re-establish a lost ecological function and/or modify habitats. This may involve species that are not themselves threatened but that contribute to the conservation of other taxa through their ecological role; \u2022 Source for assisted colonisation to introduce the species outside of its indigenous range to avoid extinction; \u2022 Research and/or training that will directly benefit conservation of the species, or a similar species, in the wild (e.g. monitoring methods, life history information, nutritional requirements, disease transmission/treatment); and \u2022 Basis for an education and awareness programme that addresses specific threats or constraints to the conservation of the species or its habitat. c. One ex situ programme may serve several conservation roles \u2013 either simultaneously or consecutively. It is recognised that an ex situ population can also serve to avoid extinction of a species that has no chance in the foreseeable future for persistence in the wild (for example in the face of climate change). In such circumstances a careful appraisal of the allocation of available resources should be made, and a prioritization based on conservation benefits and other values may assist in the decision making. 7 STEP 3. Determine the characteristics and dimensions of the ex situ population needed to fulfil the identified conservation role(s). The identified conservation purpose and function of the ex situ programme will determine its required nature, scale and duration. a. Biological factors that are important in assessing requirements for achieving the programme\u2019s aim and objectives include: \u2022 The number of founders (unrelated individuals of wild origin) required to attain the genetic and demographic goals of the ex situ population. This may involve making use of founders (and their descendants) of existing ex situ populations and/or sampling (additional) individuals (and where appropriate propagules or biomaterials from individuals) from the wild, across different habitat types, populations, etc.; \u2022 The number of individuals or bio-samples to be maintained or produced ex situ; \u2022 Whether reproduction or propagation is required during the duration of the programme; \u2022 The likely required length of programme (in generations and in years) where possible; \u2022 The relative risk for artificial selection/adaptation (genetic, phenotypic, etc.) during consecutive generations in ex situ conditions; \u2022 Whether the ex situ phase is envisaged to be followed by a release (which has consequences for the required characteristics of the ex situ environment); and \u2022 The type of environment required to maintain the individuals in a suitable condition during the length of the programme. b. These lead to the following practical considerations that should be evaluated: \u2022 The most suitable geographic location and scale for the ex situ activities (for example, inside vs. outside of the current/indigenous range; a centralized vs. a multi-facility programme; etc.). Where possible ex situ management should be undertaken within the range states and under similar climatic regimes to the wild population.

Population models may be used to determine the necessary population size, composition and level of management needed to meet the conservation role(s) of the population. 9 STEP 4. Define the resources and expertise needed for the ex situ management programme to meet its role(s) and appraise the feasibility and risks. It is not sufficient to know the potential value of an ex situ programme designed to meet a specific conservation role \u2013 it is also critical to evaluate the resources needed, the feasibility of successfully managing such a programme, the likelihood of success at all steps of the programme, including where relevant any subsequent return to the wild, and the risks, including risks to the species in the wild and to other conservation activities. These should be balanced against the risks of failing to take appropriate conservation action. a. It is essential to assess the resources required to establish and maintain an ex situ population with the characteristics defined in Step 3 in order to achieve the aims and objectives stated in Step 2. These should be considered in detail at this stage. Some of the practical factors that will determine the overall scale of resources required include: \u2022 The facilities, infrastructure and space required; \u2022 The staffing required (in terms of numbers, skills and continuity); \u2022 The risk for the spread of disease (need for biosecurity, quarantine, diagnostics, research on pathogens and disease, etc.). \u2022 The risk of catastrophes impacting the ex situ programme (natural or human- caused catastrophes, such as fire, civil unrest, etc.); and \u2022 The finances required for all essential activities over an adequate period of time (in proportion to the expected total length of the programme). b. Other factors that need to be determined to investigate the feasibility and risks of the proposed project include: \u2022 The probability of obtaining the required resources, including technical experts and project managers with the required skill sets. Effective ex situ management for conservation will require effective multidisciplinary teams within the biological, technical and social skill sets; \u2022 Competition for resources with other programmes for the same or other taxa as well as opportunities for cost sharing; \u2022 Available expertise in husbandry/disease control/cultivation/propagation/banking for relevant life stages for this and/or for related/comparable taxa. In some areas of the world, particularly in regions facing the highest rates of biodiversity loss, the capacity for skills in ex situ conservation may need to be strengthened. Similarly, the increasingly diverse range of candidate species and challenges to be addressed may require additional tools and techniques; \u2022 The degree of stability in, or level of agreement about, the taxonomy of the taxon in question and the degree of knowledge on evolutionary significant units, genetic population structure and risks for inbreeding and outbreeding depression; \u2022 The critical governmental and non-governmental partner institutions and the probability of successful collaboration among these (including partners", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "964ff752-016f-4686-802f-e9f1a053df40": {"__data__": {"id_": "964ff752-016f-4686-802f-e9f1a053df40", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/poweshiek-skipperling-and-dakota-skipper-ex-situ-assessment-and-planning", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Poweshiek skipperling and Dakota skipper : ex situ assessment and planning workshop", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/poweshiek-skipperling-and-dakota-skipper-ex-situ-assessment-and-planning", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "476c18be9c3bb813b49458ac118301b123464ad1fa0869bc2f12f30d7a6c5bd9"}}, "hash": "476c18be9c3bb813b49458ac118301b123464ad1fa0869bc2f12f30d7a6c5bd9", "text": "responsible for field conservation); \u2022 The degree of compatibility of the ecological, demographic, behavioural or other characteristics of the species with the type of ex situ management proposed; \u2022 Requirements to ensure the welfare of any living individuals ex situ. Ex situ conservation programmes should adhere to internationally accepted standards for welfare, and efforts should be made to reduce stress or suffering; \u2022 All legal and regulatory requirements for the project (so that the intended ex situ management is approved and supported by all relevant agencies) and how likely 10 they can be fulfilled. An ex situ conservation programme may need to meet regulatory requirements at any or all of the international, national, regional or sub- regional levels. This may among others involve regulations for the capture or collection of individuals from the source populations, for the movement of individuals across international borders (e.g. CITES) and across jurisdictional or formally recognised tribal boundaries, for dealing with benefits arising from the use of genetic resources and/or traditional knowledge (e.g. Nagoya Protocol), for veterinary and phyto-sanitary aspects, and for the holding of wild individuals in ex situ conditions; \u2022 Any formal endorsements required for the project from relevant in situ and/or ex situ entities, and how likely they can be obtained; \u2022 Where relevant, assessment of the impact of the removal of individuals from the wild on the remaining wild source population (e.g. through modelling); \u2022 The likely impact on the remaining wild population and its habitat of establishing, or not establishing, an ex situ population. Special consideration may be given to situations in which all remaining wild individuals may need to be removed due to a very high probability of extinction in the wild that cannot be mitigated in time; \u2022 The ecological risks (e.g. containment of potentially invasive species, hybridisation risks) and what is required to minimise them; \u2022 Any health and safety risks (for people and/or other species) and what is required to minimise them; and \u2022 Any potential political, social or public conflicts of interest and how they can be dealt with. A review of the cultural status of the species should be conducted to ensure that any ex situ conservation management is compatible with local traditions and values and supported by local communities at the source location(s) and/or the ex situ location(s). Mechanisms for communication, engagement and problem-solving between the public (especially key individuals most likely affected by or concerned about the removal of individuals from nature or the maintenance of individuals ex situ) and ex situ managers should be established. A review of the factors mentioned above will allow the assessment of an overall probability of the ex situ programme achieving the intended results in terms of conservation benefit. The scope of the risk assessment should be proportional to the level of identified risk. Where data are poor, the risk assessment may only be qualitative but it is necessary, as lack of data does not indicate absence of risk. 11 STEP 5. Make a decision that is informed (i.e. uses the information gathered above) and transparent (i.e. demonstrates how and why the decision was taken). The decision to include ex situ management in the conservation strategy for a species should be determined by weighing the potential conservation benefit to the species against the likelihood of success and overall costs and risks of not only the proposed ex situ programme, but also alternative conservation actions or inaction. The relative importance (weight) of potential conservation benefit vs. likelihood of success, costs and risks will vary for each species and situation, according to factors such as, but not limited to: \u2022 The severity of threats and/or risk of extinction of the wild population; \u2022 The significance of the species (ecological, cultural, sociological, economic or evolutionary distinctness, value of the species in leveraging large scale habitat conservation, etc.); and \u2022 Legal and political mandates. In general, any conservation management strategy including ex situ management is warranted when potential conservation benefit is both high and likely to be achieved. Similarly, ex situ management is not warranted if there is little conservation benefit, feasibility is low, and costs and risks (especially to the wild population) are high. If the decision to implement ex situ management of a species is left until extinction is imminent, it is frequently too late to implement effectively, thus increasing the chance of failure and risking permanent extinction of the species. This reinforces the need for comprehensive strategic planning for species to be undertaken as early as possible.

Archiving of documents in publicly accessible libraries and on public web sites is recommended. 12 SECTION 5: Programme implementation, monitoring, adjustment and evaluation Implementation If a decision is made to establish or continue an ex situ management programme, further considerations that are important in the development of this programme include: \u2022 Actions needed to achieve the identified goals and objectives of the programme should be formulated and implemented (including actions to mitigate the most important risks identified in Step 4). Actions should be specific, measurable, have time schedules attached, and indicate the resources needed and parties responsible for their implementation; \u2022 Data collection and management protocols for all important aspects of the programme should be developed in order to enable adequate monitoring; \u2022 Any ex situ management programme should be developed within national, regional and international conservation infrastructure, recognizing the mandate of existing agencies, legal and policy frameworks, organisational conservation strategies, national biodiversity action plans or existing species recovery plans. Of noteworthy mention in the context of these guidelines are the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the International Agenda for Botanic Gardens in Conservation, the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation, the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, the World Zoo and Aquarium Conservation Strategy, the Global Plan of Action for Animal Genetic Resources and the Interlaken Declaration; \u2022 Any ex situ conservation programme should adhere to national and international obligations with regard to access and benefit sharing (as outlined in the CBD); \u2022 The ex situ programme should consult during its planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation stages with all relevant stakeholder groups, professional associations and organisations, both with regard to the indigenous range of the species and the location of the ex situ programme; \u2022 The ex situ programme personnel should stay up to date with relevant scientific work and scientific publications; \u2022 Where multiple bodies such as government agencies, non-government organisations, academia, private organisations, informal interest groups, etc. all have statutory or legitimate interests in an ex situ programme, it is essential that mechanisms exist for all parties to play constructive roles. This may require establishment of special teams working outside formal, bureaucratic hierarchies that can guide, oversee and respond swiftly and effectively as management issues arise. Different parties involved in an ex situ project may have their own mandates, priorities and agendas that need to be aligned through effective facilitation and leadership in order not to undermine the success of the project. A memorandum of understanding with appropriate parties defining the collaboration structure, ownership issues and responsibilities may be beneficial. Inter-project, inter-regional or international communication and collaboration is encouraged as relevant. The programme should consult with external experts as needed; \u2022 The ex situ project should have a clear and appropriate time frame established. Monitoring, adjustment and evaluation There should be regular evaluations of the ex situ programme, not only of its own success, but also of its role within the overall conservation strategy for the species, which is likely to change over time. 13 The management of an ex situ programme is a cyclical process of implementation, monitoring, feedback and adjustment of both biological and non-biological aspects until either the goals are met or the ex situ programme is deemed unsuccessful. Despite thorough planning and design, inherent uncertainty and risk will lead to both expected and unexpected situations. The monitoring is the means to measure the performance of the ex situ programme against objectives, to assess conservation impacts, and provide the basis for adjusting objectives or adapting management regimes or activating an exit strategy. In addition to refining an ongoing ex situ programme, the conclusions from monitoring may guide other ex situ programmes. Adequate resources for monitoring should be part of financial feasibility and commitment. The purpose and duration of monitoring of the ex situ populations and the species\u2019 situation in the wild (especially those aspects that that the ex situ population is trying to address) should be appropriate to each situation. Learning from ex situ conservation programme outcomes can be improved through application of more formal adaptive management approaches, whereby alternative models are defined in advance and are tested through monitoring. This process means that the models used to decide management are based on the best possible evidence and learning.

The species' precise historical range is not known; early accounts failed to distinguish rhinos to specific level, due to partial sympatry with the other two Asian rhino species (Rhinoceros unicornis and Dicerorhinus sumatrensis). Beginning in the middle of the 19th century, the species was extirpated from most of its historical range. The subspecies Rhinoceros sondaicus inermis formerly occurred in northeastern India, Bangladesh, and Myanmar, but is now extinct (Nowak, 1999). The subspecies Rhinoceros sondaicus annamiticus formerly occurred in Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Cambodia, and eastern Thailand. The last individual of this subspecies was poached in May 2010 in the Cat Loc part (Dong Nai province) of Cat Tien National Park in Viet Nam (Brook et al 2011). The subspecies Rhinoceros sondaicus sondaicus formerly occurred from Thailand through Malaysia, to the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra. The Javan rhino now only occurs at one site, in Indonesia\u2019s Ujung Kulon National Park (UKNP) in the very westernmost portion of the island of Java (Figure 1).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "14eddcc3-8710-4c53-9741-d6970508f4f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "14eddcc3-8710-4c53-9741-d6970508f4f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/javan-rhino-population-habitat-viability-assessment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Javan rhino population & habitat viability assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/javan-rhino-population-habitat-viability-assessment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ee7542e026c80f9c2aea5bb8c0692d04386388e1c77a8b6b05e78b5f06ebb614"}, "2": {"node_id": "3f20656a-33be-4037-82d5-3e1181451717", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/javan-rhino-population-habitat-viability-assessment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dff5422f4771b86f3d261a7e71793d5c01dce9ba7b2e046be65bfc71078876cd"}}, "hash": "1c73cdb4adb655b193e9a8a339f76f2855a30cc3b5f05caeabe92133ab781c48", "text": "Ujung Kulon National Park The area now known as Ujung Kulon National Park (UKNP) was declared as a Hunting Reserve in 1910, has been a protected area since 1921 and was gazetted as a national park in 1980.

The population of Rhinoceros sondaicus has been restricted to Ujung Kulon since the 1930s. Rhino numbers have hovered at about 40 or 50 individuals for several decades. The Javan rhino is a lowland species that typically occurs up to 600 m (Sectionov and Isnan, pers. comm.), but has been recorded above 1,000 m (Nowak, 1999). Javan rhinos have been monitored and protected by the UKNP park authority, the World Wildlife Fund - Indonesia (WWF - Indonesia) and/or Yayasan Badak Indonesia (YABI or the Rhino Foundation of Indonesia) over a period spanning 3 decades, using foot patrols and more recently, video camera traps. During this time, there have been no recorded rhino poaching events. (The last rhino poaching incident was reported in the early 1970s.) The population appears to be stable, perhaps even increasing, based upon the most recent field research results. Recent video camera trap data analyzed by the UKNP authority indicates that there are at least 60 animals in the population, including three relatively young calves. These data were verified by an independent team from the IUCN/SSC Asian Rhino Specialist Group. However, the park probably is nearing carrying capacity and the rhino population is unlikely to increase without more intensive management efforts. Available rhino habitat is limited by two major factors: (1) human encroachment and (2) the predominance of an invasive palm (Arenga obtusifolia), known locally as langkap and which is rampant in UKNP, that dominates the forest canopy in many locations and inhibits the growth of rhino food plants. Ujung Kulon also is home to an estimated 25 other threatened mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians (Appendix 1), including the Javan gibbon (Hylobates moloch), ebony leaf monkey or Javan lutung (Trachypithecus auratus), Javan leopard (Panthera pardus melas), and Javan banteng (Bos javanicus), a species of wild cattle. UKNP is bordered by water to the north, west and south (Figure 1). Its eastern boundary adjoins agricultural lands and one of Indonesia\u2019s most heavily populated regions in Banten Province (the 2014 estimated population was more than 11.8 million), which results in continuous human pressure on protected lands and wildlife. Several years ago, the Indonesian government removed more than 300 illegal settlers living within UKNP\u2019s eastern boundary in the Gunung Honge area. This reduced, but has not eliminated, threats due to a low level of illegal activities engaged in by communities, largely for subsistence reasons, i.e., fishing, small-scale timber extraction, and the gathering of forest products. Javan rhinos have persisted in UKNP because they are carefully monitored and guarded around-the-clock by a combination of Rhino Protection Units (RPUs) and Indonesian government personnel working in the park. Javan Rhino Study and Conservation Area In May, 2008, as the Strategy and Action Plan for the Conservation of Rhinos in Indonesia (Directorate General of Forest Protection and Nature Conservation, Ministry of Forestry of the Republic of Indonesia, 2007) was beginning implementation, the IUCN Asian Rhino Specialist Group convened a meeting to discuss conservation action progress for the Javan rhino in UKNP and to set immediate goals and actions. Population and Habitat Viability Assessment for the Javan Rhino: February 2015 3 Whereas it was formerly believed that Ujung Kulon had the holding capacity for more than 100 Javan rhino, it was then suggested that the park\u2019s carrying capacity may have diminished to as low as 70 due to habitat changes and possible food competition with Javan banteng. One of the strategies outlined in the 2007 action plan was to translocate a subset of population to another area in its historic range to to increase carrying capacity and to sustain overall health of the population. At the March 2009 meeting, it was agreed that habitat surveys, along with a rhino and banteng census, were an immediate priority (Talukdar et al., 2009). An independent expert was enlisted to lead habitat assessments for both UKNP and possible second habitat-relocation sites outside Ujung Kulon peninsula to ensure critical information would be unbiased.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3f295cad-aac7-409d-8f6c-d016090ec7dc": {"__data__": {"id_": "3f295cad-aac7-409d-8f6c-d016090ec7dc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/javan-rhino-population-habitat-viability-assessment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Javan rhino population & habitat viability assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/javan-rhino-population-habitat-viability-assessment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eeb43feb28a6ed56fbd4cf2e9d9e220da43ab57e09a85765f871b2a0784a405d"}, "2": {"node_id": "4a5f68c2-e665-495d-b202-ce6432a7ead9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/javan-rhino-population-habitat-viability-assessment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f74af5dbc2349ded1c3aab6059bc765e4c95f102c950d1ba5049a30edffd293e"}}, "hash": "9a269e0ac57accacf74edbc6f0cf2abaecd3b5b142e3be01926e7e858ce7cb94", "text": "Field surveys were conducted on the Ujung Kulon peninsula and proposed relocation sites on the island of Java in Gunung Honje, Gunung Halimun, Masigit Kareumbi and Leuweung Sancang.

While vegetation and elevation are clearly important determinants of rhino habitat, their influence is strongly modified by proximity to water, to mineral salt and especially to site conditions that favor the maintenance of long-term wallows (Ramono et al., 2009). In times of drought, water scarcity can become problematic as indicated in the history of UKNP and may severely restrict rhino movement. Historic patterns of both natural and human disturbance in Ujung Kulon have generated a mosaic of successional stages of vegetation regeneration in which the early to mid-pioneer stages were valuable sources of food-plants and where patches of mature forest provided cover (Ramono et al., 2009). Examination of vegetation cover on ground and via remote-sensing suggest that these mosaics are becoming increasingly homogeneous as succession moves toward closed forest. As a result, it was concluded that food-plant availability may be decreasing, especially where closed forest is being invaded by Arenga (Ramono et al., 2009). In Gunung Halimun, Masigit Kareumbi and Leuweung Sancang, where human activity has greatly restricted access to favorable habitat, rhino food plant resources are extremely minimal. Taking into account the various biophysical elements, including the influence of human activity, it was concluded that while conditions in UKNP and adjacent Gunung Honje were not entirely optimal for sustained management of the Javan rhino, they were considerably better than those offered in Gunung Halimun National Park or the other two areas, where translocation would almost certainly lead to failure (Ramono et al., 2009). In 2010, Yayasan Badak Indonesia (YABI or the Rhino Foundation of Indonesia), the International Rhino Foundation (IRF), the UKNP authority and local partners launched the 5,000-ha Javan Rhino Study and Conservation Area (JRSCA) in the Gunung Honje region on the eastern side of the park. This project includes constructing an electric fence intended to reduce the entry of domestic cattle into the park from surrounding villages, as well as habitat restoration efforts involving the removal of the invasive Arenga obtusifolia. The JRSCA area is planned to be a staging ground for translocation of a subset of the population to a suitable site in the species\u2019 historic range. As of early 2015, YABI had hired more than 120 local people to clear 78 ha of Arenga palm in the JRSCA. Nine rhinos (roughly 15 percent of the population) now are regularly using the area, which 4 Population and Habitat Viability Assessment for the Javan Rhino: February 2015 bodes well for further Arenga palm management within the park and its positive effects on rhinos. Additional funding is being sought for more extensive Arenga management. The PHVA Workshop From 11-13 February 2015, a Javan Rhino Population and Habitat Viability Assessment workshop was convened at Taman Safari in Cisarua, West Java. The workshop was collaboratively organized by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, Yayasan Badak Indonesia (YABI or the Rhino Foundation of Indonesia, WWF-Indonesia, the International Rhino Foundation, the IUCN Asian Rhino Specialist Group, the US Fish & Wildlife Service and other partners. The IUCN Conservation Breeding Specialist Group (CBSG) facilitated the workshop, which was generously hosted by Taman Safari and funded by a USFWS grant to WWF. The CBSG facilitated an earlier PVA workshop for Javan rhinos in 1989 (Seal & Foose, 1989). The purpose of the Workshop was utilize available biological data and expert knowledge to assess the risks of extinction for the critically endangered Javan rhino, which is now found only in UKNP. Stochastic simulation models incorporating this information were used to assess the risk of extinction, to identify critical factors through sensitivity analysis, and to examine the effectiveness of suggested management scenarios in reducing the risk of extinction. Additionally, specific activities, whereby domestic and international cooperation and assistance can be mobilized to assist in the efforts to prevent the extinction of the Javan rhino, have been identified. The initial task of the workshop participants was to assemble and evaluate the biological and ecological data needed for the Population Viability Analyses (PVA) of the species. The focus was on data needed to estimate the risk of extinction over the next 50 -100 years.

The groups were: Javan Rhino Population Management; Javan Rhino Habitat Management; Population Modelling; and Stakeholder Engagement. Each working group began by developing goal statements. Conservation Goal Statements Once the working groups had developed all of their goals (see working group reports on the following pages for details), they presented and discussed these goals with the rest of the workshop participants in plenary so that all participants were able to have input into all issues and goals. Goals were examined across the three working groups and, if necessary, were consolidated, split, or otherwise refined to equalize the level of action and to increase clarity. This resulted in a total of 11 goals endorsed by the workshop participants, all of which are recommended to improve the long-term viability of the Javan rhino in Indonesia. 6 Population and Habitat Viability Assessment for the Javan Rhino: February 2015 An overall prioritization of all workshop goals helps to guide working groups in developing recommended actions, especially if resources (funding, time, personnel) are limited, and can help focus attention on the primary issues of concern. Once the goals were finalized, the participants were asked to consider the importance of each goal in terms of its expected impact on Javan rhino conservation management. The goals were displayed on flip charts, and participants were asked to prioritize these goals with respect to a common criterion: The greatest immediate positive impact on Javan rhino conservation in Indonesia. The goal statements presented below are listed in order of priority as determined by the workshop participants, with the number of votes given for each following the statement. It is again important to recognize that all conservation goals have been endorsed and seen as important to achieve within the larger context of Javan rhino conservation. The relative ranking presented here gives a sense of the urgency and/or priority of all goals when compared as a whole. The goal statements were: \u2022 The Javan rhino population is managed to achieve genetic and demographic viability through increasing the abundance of rhino to at least 80 individuals, in at least two sites, by 2025.

[1] Population and Habitat Viability Assessment for the Javan Rhino: February 2015 7 Creating a Vision for Javan Rhino Conservation in Indonesia Near the start of the workshop, the participants were asked to identify the key components of a vision statement for Javan rhino conservation in Indonesia. A vision is a short statement that outlines the desired future state of the species. It is meant to be ambitious and inspire all those reading it to clearly understand the ideal future condition for the species. After a plenary discussion on identification of key themes, a smaller group of participants were selected to create a draft vision statement. Over the next 2 days of the workshop, the team requested feedback from all workshop participants and ultimately presented a final statement that the participants could support. The Vision Team was composed of: \u2022 Widodo Ramono (YABI) \u2022 Moh. Haryono (Ujung Kulon National Park, PHKA) \u2022 Yuyun Kurniawan (WWF) \u2022 Ofat Sofatudddin (Friends of the Rhino) \u2022 Enah Suhenah (Dishutbun Propinsi Banten) \u2022 M. Agil (FKH IPB/YABI) The final vision statement was: Secure the habitat and develop three well-managed sites for in situ populations to ensure an increase to at least 150 Javan rhinos by 2040.

Global warming and severe environmental conditions (such as rising sea levels, drought, food scarcity), result in additional pressure on the rhino population. Data Assembly Following the identification and prioritization of threats, the group characterized each threat by clearly identifying known information (facts), assumptions, and information gaps. Threat 1: Javan rhino population abundance is believed to be at a standstill due to insufficient habitat and population management, inbreeding depression, limited carrying capacity and disease. Facts Assumptions Information Gaps Population abundance is stagnant: Population size = 55-58 Previous population size fluctuated Survey methods accurately depict current population size and trends Habitat and population management has been insufficient to stimulate increased population abundance. \u2022 The cause of the stagnant population abundance trend: are inbreeding depression, limited carrying capacity, and disease impacting population growth? The population contains breeding rhinos. Young rhinos are surviving to reproduce. \u2022 Are all rhinos of breeding age actually breeding? \u2022 Is there any reproductive pathology among adult females that is reducing their breeding potential? Rhino deaths have been recorded. All deaths have been detected and recorded. \u2022 Cause of death \u2022 Average longevity in the wild Demographic information / age structure / sex ratio is known in the wild. Age class / structure has been correctly defined. \u2022 Inter-birth interval \u2022 Age of reproductive maturity \u2022 Youngest/oldest breeding age \u2022 Social structure / mating relationships \u2022 Intra- and interspecific competition Population and Habitat Viability Assessment for the Javan Rhino: February 2015 11 Threat 2: There is inadequate management capacity to respond to the increased risk to the rhino population (e.g., from disturbance, disease, poaching, habitat degradation, stress) caused by an increasing human population. Facts Assumptions Information Gaps Human population increase in the UKNP buffer zone is higher than the national average. Human population will continue to increase and, as a result, threats to rhinos and their habitat will also increase. There is no mapping of encroachment (area, people) Many people are involved in illegal harvesting of forest products in and around the UKNP. There is inadequate and ineffective local law enforcement to combat illegal harvesting. Domestic cattle grazing exists in the National Park Domestic cattle carry and transmit diseases to rhinos. Incidence of disease in cattle, and risk of disease transmission to rhinos. There is poor local knowledge and awareness of the National Park, as well as a general negative attitude among local people towards the Park. Community education and awareness-raising about the National Park is limited. Socio-economic factors defining the local human populations are not well understood. The local National Park management authorities and the local government are reluctant to address encroachment and resource extraction problems. The Special Zone within the National Park is not properly managed. Proper management of this Zone will alleviate identified problems. 12 Population and Habitat Viability Assessment for the Javan Rhino: February 2015 Threat 3: The ever-present risk of poaching due to the rising demand for rhino horn in Asia is not sufficiently addressed by current protection and conservation management. Facts Assumptions Information Gaps The rate of rhino poaching has increased globally, but the level of protection in UKNP has not changed to addreess this threat. The current level of anti- poaching effort is adequate to prevent poaching in the face of increased poaching risk. Currently, there are no rhino poachers in the area of the National Park. We don\u2019t know if the area around the National Park is targeted by organized poaching gangs (an unquantified threat) because there is no intelligence network in place around the Park. The global demand for rhino horn has increased. The demand for rhino horn will stay the same or increase in the future. Is Asian rhino horn really in demand in the markets? The price of rhino horn has increased. The price of rhino horn will stay the same or increase in the future. How will the price of rhino horn affect Javan rhino populations? Organized crime syndicates focusing on rhino poaching are targeting rhino populations around the world. UKNP will almost certainly be targeted at some point in the future. Level of anti-poaching staffing needed to adequately protect Javan rhinos in UKNP. Any kind of disruption in poaching protection efforts immediately leads to increased levels of poaching and human encroachment (examples of this seen in South Africa, Bukit Berasan Selatan in Sumatra) Community engagement in wildlife conservation and Park management could help to mitigate the threat of rhino poaching. Level of interest from local communities in wildlife conservation.

Population and Habitat Viability Assessment for the Javan Rhino: February 2015 13 Identification of Conservation Goals For each of the problem statements described earlier in this section, the working group participants developed management goals to address these problems. Finally, the group placed these goals in order of priority in terms of their effectiveness in advancing Javan rhino conservation in Indonesia. 1. The Javan rhino population is managed to achieve genetic and demographic viability by increasing population abundance to a total of at least 80 individuals in at least two sites by the year 2025. 2. Local authorities work to maintain zero poaching of Javan rhino through 2025 and beyond. 3. Encroachment, poaching, human disturbance and risk of disease transmission from domestic cattle are reduced by at least 50% by 2025. Identification of Conservation Actions Threat 1 Javan rhino population abundance has stagnated due to insufficient habitat and population management, inbreeding depression, limited carrying capacity and disease. Goal 1 The Javan rhino population is managed to achieve genetic and demographic viability by increasing population abundance to a total of at least 80 individuals in at least two sites by the year 2025.

The impact of climate change can already been seen in Ujung Kulon. It affects the movement of rhinos, the availability of wallows and food which results in rhino mortality. In addition sea-level rises due to climate change could also reduce rhino habitat and threaten the survival of the species. \u2022 Natural disasters - Ujung Kukon National Park is located south of Anak Krakatoa.

The optimum population that can be supported by the habitat is still unknown. \u2022 Competition with Javan banteng - The existence of the endangered Javan banteng (Bos javanicus) within Ujung Kulon reduces the availability of space and food for rhino. Lack of banteng population estimates means it is difficult to quantify the level of competition between the two species. \u2022 Forest succession \u2013 Forest succession leads to tree growth which creates a dense forest canopy that reduces light to the forest floor, and limits the growth of secondary forest and the availability of rhino food. \u2022 Habitat encroachment - Human encroachment will reduce the size of the habitat which will negatively impact the carrying capacity of the park. In addition, other illegal activities negatively impact the habitat. The group then identified and prioritized the three top threats to Javan rhino habitat: 1. Limited habitat availability 2. Arenga palm invasion 3. Competition with Javan banteng 22 Population and Habitat Viability Assessment for the Javan Rhino: February 2015 Data Assembly Following the identification and prioritization of threats, the group characterized each threat by clearly identifying known information (facts), assumptions, and information gaps. Threat 1: Limited habitat availability \u2013 The population is believed to have reached its maximum level in the current habitat and probably cannot grow any larger without intervention. The habitat carrying capacity for UKNP is still unknown. Facts Assumptions Information Gaps \u2022 Population abundance has remained relatively unchanged. \u2022 Rhino occupancy data indicate that not all of the National Park is used by Javan rhino. \u2022 The carrying capacity of the park has been reached. \u2022 The rhino habitat in Ujung Kulon is limited. Not all the habitat is suitable for rhinos because of food/water availability etc \u2022 No comprehensive data to estimate the carrying capacity of the park. Threat 2: Arenga Palm invasion \u2013 the suitability of the habitat in Ujung Kulon for Javan rhinos is deteriorating because of the spread of the invasive and dominant Arenga palm (Arenga obtusifolia). It is thought that the fertility of the soil improved following Krakatau\u2019s eruption; this may have led to the rapid growth of Arenga palm in the area. Due to its fast growing nature, Arenga palm now dominates other plant species that provide vital food sources for the rhino. National regulations currently prohibit the removal of Arenga palm in the core zone of UKNP. Facts Assumptions Information Gaps \u2022 Over 60% of the peninsula of UKNP is dominated by Arenga palm. \u2022 Arenga palm suppresses the growth of rhino food. \u2022 There is some research on Arenga palm eradication. \u2022 The distribution of Arenga palm has significantly increased year by year. \u2022 Reduced food availability due to Arenga palm limits population growth. \u2022 Lack of data and information on Arenga palm density and distribution time-series \u2022 Lack of regulation for controlling Arenga palm in core zone area. Population and Habitat Viability Assessment for the Javan Rhino: February 2015 23 Threat 3: Competition with Javan banteng - The existence of the endangered Javan banteng (Bos javanicus) within Ujung Kulon reduces the availability of space and food for rhino. Lack of banteng population estimates means it is difficult to quantify the level of competition between the two species. Facts Assumptions Information Gaps \u2022 There is research on competition between banteng and rhino using space and food. \u2022 There is some research on banteng populations. In 1997, 800 individuals were recorded. In 2002, there was less than 100 using the concentration count method. In 2013, the number is 124 with a similar method. \u2022 There is less grazing areas for banteng. \u2022 The population of banteng is increasing at a faster rate than rhino. \u2022 The feeding behaviour of banteng is changing, moving from grassland to more forested areas \u2022 There is comprehensive data series on banteng population using a consistent method \u2022 There is a lack of comprehensive research on competition between banteng and rhino.

The habitat carrying capacity for UKNP is still unknown. Goal 1 The habitat quality of Javan rhino is improved in Ujung Kulon National Park, and additional habitat in a second site is identified and managed to accommodate growth of the Javan rhino population to at least 80 individuals by 2025. Action 1: Collect baseline data on habitat conditions and rhino ecology in UKNP and identify priority areas for enrichment. Responsible Parties: UKNP-Daryan and WWF-Indonesia-Yuyun. Timeline: 2016. Outcome: Habitat baseline data are available to support management decisions. Collaborators: Local communities / YABI Obstacles: Action 2: Enrich habitat within Ujung Kulon National Park by improving the availability of wallows, food, water, minerals, etc. Responsible Parties: UKNP-Daryan and WWF-Indonesia-Yuyun. Timeline: 2017. Outcome: Improved rhino occupancy rates in enriched areas. Collaborators: Local communities; YABI; UKNP Obstacles: Funding for habitat improvement. Important considerations: Inclusion of local communities is important, but must be done in a way that does not disturb the rhinos nor lead to an increased potential for poaching. Action 3: Conduct second habitat assessments for potential translocation sites, using a multidisciplinary team in promising areas (Cikepuh, Cikeusik, Cikamurang). Responsible Parties: WWF-Indonesia-Yuyun; IRF-Inov Timeline: 2015/2016. Outcome: Field assessment studies of promising sites in Cikepuh, Cikeusik, Cikamurang. Collaborators: UKNP; WWF; IRF; YABI; IPB; UNTIRTA; local government and communities both in Banten province and at similar translocation sites Obstacles: Areas surveyed may not be of sufficient size to support a wild rhino population. Additionally, political support from local government/local communities may be a challenge. Finally, two priority second habitat sites are not formally gazette as protected area Population and Habitat Viability Assessment for the Javan Rhino: February 2015 25 Important considerations: Are we aiming for a wild population or one that is in a sanctuary-type setting? This will be an important consideration when choosing a site.

Responsible Parties: WWF-Indonesia-Yuyun; YABI/IRF-Sectionov Timeline: 2016. Outcome: Field assessment studies of Way Kambas, Harapan Forest, Bukit Barisan Selatan and others TBD (must be within the species\u2019 historic range). Evaluation report with site comparisions. Collaborators: IRF, YABI, IPB, UNTIRTA, local government and communities both in Banten province and at similar translocation sites Obstacles: Endorsement from Director General for site not in Java. Political support from local government/local communities. Important considerations: We do not want to translocate Javan rhinos to a site where they might compete with Sumatran rhinos. If no site is large enough to accommodate a wild population of Javan rhinos, and the conclusion is to set up a captive population, perhaps expanding the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary to accommodate Javan rhinos is a cost-effective solution since expertise and infrastructure are already there. Alternatively an SRS-like facility could be constructed for Javan rhinos. Action 5: Identify and implement habitat improvement measures in second habitat to improve suitability for Javan rhinos.

Threat 2 Arenga palm invasion \u2013 the suitability of the habitat in Ujung Kulon for Javan rhinos is deteriorating because of the spread of the invasive and dominant Arenga palm (Arenga obtusifolia). It is thought that the fertility of the soil improved following Krakatau\u2019s eruption; this may have led to the rapid growth of Arenga palm in the area. Due to its fast growing nature, Arenga palm now dominates other plant species that provide vital food sources for the rhino. National regulations currently prohibit the removal of Arenga palm in the core zone of UKNP. Goal 1 Regulations are revised on habitat management in the core zone of Ujung Kulon National Park to control the spread of Arenga palm. By 2025, 10,000 hectares of Arenga palm are removed to expand the suitable habitat available to Javan rhino and to increase the Park\u2019s carrying capacity.

Census data suggest that the population has been oscillating around its current size for some time. o It is assumed that the current carrying capacity of the park has been reached. o The Javan rhino population at UKNP is potentially threatened by: encroachment of Arenga palm reducing available habitat; diseases transmitted by cattle (Javan banteng and domestic cattle that graze in the park) such as anthrax and brucellosis; environmental catastrophes; inbreeding depression and the possibility of resumed poaching. \u2022 At the rates modelled all of these threats put downward pressure on the population but none resulted in extinction except for poaching. \u2022 To improve population resilience to all threats the population needs to grow.

Understanding more about the number of actively breeding females at the UKNP site would help refine model estimates. \u2022 Models also indicate that in the absence of external threats, five females and three males should be sufficient to found a new population provided that supplementation downstream from UKNP remains possible. Any second site where a wild population would be established would ideally be large enough to support at least 50 rhinos to provide for long-term stability. \u2022 Modelled translocation strategies should be revisited once more details have been agreed with regard to the logistics, health/injury and behavioural challenges, of capturing, translocating and integrating rhinos into a second site. \u2022 Once two sites are established, strategic exchanges of animals would be expected to benefit gene diversity within each sub-population and to slow inbreeding accumulation. There is much uncertainty concerning the biology of Javan rhinos and the environmental pressures at Ujung Kulon National Park; model parameters were based on recent and past survey data, estimates used in previous population viability analyses and the views of experts present during the workshop. Model outputs should be reviewed as more information becomes available. 30 Population and Habitat Viability Assessment for the Javan Rhino: February 2015 Introduction There remains uncertainty around the biology of Javan rhinos and the impact of environmental and human-mediated threats on the population. However, to prevent further decline of the species, management decisions need to be made urgently and in the context of this uncertainty. Computer simulation models, though not expected to be an accurate depiction of wild rhino populations, can inform decisions by: identifying key aspects of life history that correlate with performance; clarifying the relative impact of different threats; and comparing the likely performance of alternative management strategies. Computer modelling is a valuable and versatile tool for quantitatively assessing risk of decline and extinction of wildlife populations, both free ranging and managed. Complex and interacting factors that influence population persistence and health can be explored, including natural and anthropogenic causes. Models can also be used to evaluate the effects of alternative management strategies to identify the most effective conservation actions for a population or species and to identify research needs. Such an evaluation of population persistence under current and varying conditions is commonly referred to as a population viability analysis (PVA). The software used in these analyses is the simulation program Vortex (v10.0.7.9) (Lacy & Pollack, 2014). Vortex is a Monte Carlo simulation of the effects of deterministic forces as well as demographic, environmental, and genetic stochastic events, on small wild or captive populations. Vortex models population dynamics as discrete, sequential events that occur according to defined probabilities. The program begins by either creating individuals to form the starting population, or by importing individuals from a studbook database. It then steps through life cycle events (e.g., births, deaths, dispersal, catastrophic events), for each individual and typically on an annual basis. Events such as breeding success, litter size, sex at birth, and survival are determined based upon designated probabilities that incorporate both demographic stochasticity and annual environmental variation. Consequently, each run (iteration) of the model gives a different result. By running the model hundreds of times, it is possible to examine the probable outcome and range of possibilities. For a more detailed explanation of Vortex and its use in population viability analysis, see Lacy (1993, 2000) and Lacy et al. (2015). Baseline Models Few species-specific data were available to inform the development of models for Javan rhinos; therefore, baseline model parameters were initially based on: \u2022 limited data from previous population viability analyses; \u2022 real data on other rhino species, mainly from captive populations of Asian one-horned rhinoceros, Rhinoceros unicornis. In addition, the following revisions were made during the workshop, based on expert judgment. \u2022 Participants at the meeting considered the current population (58-61 individuals) to have reached the carrying capacity of the environment. This represents a reduction in previously estimated carrying capacity from 70 to 60 individuals. \u2022 Model mortality was reduced from 6% to 4% in the adult age-classes to align more closely with the rate of observed adult deaths in Ujung Kulon (though this may also be influenced by the difficulty of locating carcases). \u2022 Initial population size was increased from 56 to 58 (to reflect the lower end of the 2014 estimate). \u2022 Average", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d8e39351-d9ee-44a5-a228-635d32c9da0d": {"__data__": {"id_": "d8e39351-d9ee-44a5-a228-635d32c9da0d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/javan-rhino-population-habitat-viability-assessment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Javan rhino population & habitat viability assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/javan-rhino-population-habitat-viability-assessment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bd903264bf4d1c1fa540eb699949790b074ab3ccdfd650b5087144397aabd62e"}, "3": {"node_id": "920845db-e8f8-4788-9364-c11f657e2d7c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/javan-rhino-population-habitat-viability-assessment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0d16890f5d7c535e1457d5b111f665d3a30d8e07418a73682aabcc9fb0a33ce5"}}, "hash": "30d5a37c63c26006c756b2f88899d6c5e59eab2535e72e89fbcabb1abe8bd463", "text": "kinship in the population was set to an initial vale of 0.0255 (the average in modelled populations run from 1970, for 45 years, beginning with 30 unrelated founders) Further information about model input parameters is provided in Appendix 1.

Model behaviour was compared to available field estimates of the actual population over the same period. To take account of participants\u2019 current working hypothesis, that the Ujung Kulon population has reached carrying capacity, the models used in this analysis were modified from the baseline to include a density dependent relationship between carrying capacity (estimated at K=60) and breeding rate (set at 16% at high density and at 33% at low density). The results of the comparison are depicted in Figure 3. It should be noted that survey methods at Ujung Kulon have changed over time and the older survey estimates are considered less reliable than more recent estimates (Widodo Ramono, pers. comm). Despite this, and though the models are not expected to provide either accurate or precise estimates of wild population behaviour, the analysis supports their further (though cautious) use as a reasonable working representation of Javan rhino population dynamics at the Ujung Kulon site. Sensitivity testing With so few species-specific data there remains much uncertainty around the values used in the models. Some model parameters are more influential than others in shaping population performance and understanding which these are can help us to determine priorities for future action, for research and for monitoring. Vortex can help by providing a simple and quick way to test the sensitivity of the baseline models to uncertainty in each individual parameter. One parameter at a time was selected in the baseline model (e.g. age at first breeding, inter-birth interval, sex-ratio etc.) and was varied across a plausible range of values, keeping all other parameters constant. The size of the impact of this variation on key performance indicators was recorded and compared to that of other parameters. The values tested are shown in Table 2 and the main results illustrated in Figure 4. Across the range of values considered, shifts in adult mortality rate had the largest impact on growth rate, closely followed by female annual breeding rate. Inbreeding and carrying capacity also show an effect but this is milder across the range of values considered.

Each risk is explored in isolation and then in combination with others. Arenga palm The encroachment of Arenga palm reduces habitat quality for Javan rhinos. To give an indication of the potential threat that this could pose to rhino population viability at UKNP, Arenga palm encroachment was modelled as a reduction in carrying capacity over the next 20 years, of 1% and 2% per year, from a starting point of K=70. The modelled risk of extinction remained low across both encroachment scenarios (P(Ex) at 100 years < 0.01) suggesting that the population could withstand a threat of this magnitude. However, average population size over time is reduced from that of the baseline and average growth rate is negative, potentially increasing vulnerability to threats not considered here. [Note that the mechanism through which Arenga palm interacts with rhinos is likely to be more complex than that modelled here and more information on the impact of its removal in recently cleared areas should help clarify this].

However, the models do not include \u201cdisease outbreaks\u201d; occasional disease events that result in mortality rates outside the \u201cnormal\u201d range. Javan banteng (Bos javanicus) are known to be present in significant numbers in UKNP. Direct competition with rhinos may operate but this remains uncertain. However, several disease agents are known to be transmissible between bovids and rhinos and two of these (anthrax and bovine tuberculosis) are potentially fatal. A number of recorded deaths of Javan rhinos in 1981-1982 were attributed to anthrax (Ramsay and Zainuddin 1993) and this was used as the basis for exploring additional disease-related risks. The 1981-82 Anthrax outbreak resulted in five deaths; approximately 10% of the rhino population at that time. Assuming that this has been the only outbreak in the past 50 years, and in the absence of further information, this was ascribed a 2% probability of occurrence, with no impact on reproduction and a 10% reduction in survival.

However, as illustrated, this kind of event could depress average population size. Environmental catastrophes Participants registered concern about the potential impact of an environmental catastrophe on the population of rhinos at UKNP, such as a tsunami or earthquake. The park is low-lying and vulnerable to inundation. The likely impact of these potential catastrophes on the resident rhino population was not discussed in detail.

Models were constructed to explore the potential resilience of the UKNP population to low levels of poaching. Following the approach taken for the 1989 PVA models (Seal and Foose 1989) poaching was treated as frequency-dependent; that is, the rate of poaching was assumed to increase with increasing population size. The 1989 PHVA records 15 animals killed over a 10 year period. Over the period considered this was roughly 2-3% of the population each year. Poaching rates of 2 and 3% per year were modelled from year 1. The results are illustrated in Figure 8. The impact of this level of extraction is not sustainable over the long-term at current population size. Average growth rates are negative (r= -0.010 at 1% and r= -0.031 at 2%) and 100-year extinction risks are elevated, especially at the 2% rate (P(Ex) at 100 years = 0.063 at 1% and 0.680 at 2%). Combined risks So far each of the threats has been considered in isolation. A series of scenarios were also run to explore the impact of multiple threats operating on the population; threats are added one at a time to the baseline and the results tracked. In these scenarios each threat is included at the more conservative end of the range of values considered, as follows: 1. Arenga palm encroachment (at 1% per year, for 20 years). 2. Disease risk (once every 50 years causing 10% mortality) 3. Environmental catastrophe (once every 100 years causing 50% mortality) 4. Poaching (1% harvested per year) As illustrated in Figure 9, the modelled populations are sent into decline (negative growth) over the 100 year period in all cases. Extinction risk over the 100-year period is low in the presence of only Arenga palm and disease (P(Ex)=0.001), but increases where an occasional catastrophe is included to P(Ex)=0.062 and again to P(Ex)=0.354 with the addition of 1% poaching per year. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 0 6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60 66 72 78 84 90 96 Mean Population Size Year Javan_Baseline_DD Poach 1% per year Poach 2% per year Figure 8.

For example, some of the 30 animals thought to exist in Ujung Kulon at that time may have been related; or some of the males in that populations may have been disproportionately successful breeders, leading to a higher than expected level of relatedness in the following generation. A series of models were run to consider this possibility. Starting levels of relatedness were set as follows: \u2022 0.0255 (relatedness generated from retrospective models) \u2022 0.0625 (equivalent to relatedness between first cousins) \u2022 0.1250 (equivalent to relatedness between half-siblings) \u2022 0.2500 (equivalent to relatedness between full-siblings) The impact on population performance of applying these starting levels of relatedness is illustrated in Figure 11. As shown in the Figure, population performance declines as starting relatedness increases. Extinction probability is zero for the 0.0255 and 0.0625 starting levels, increasing to P(Ex) = 0.001 and 0.005 for the 0.125 and 0.2500 levels respectively. Based on what is known about the Ujung Kulon population, relatedness seems more likely to be sitting at the more optimistic end of this range but this is an area of uncertainty. 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 1 6 11 16 21 26 31 36 41 46 51 56 61 66 71 76 81 86 91 96 101 Population Size Year Baseline with inbreeding Baseline without inbreeding Figure 10.

Impact on population performance of elevating the relatedness of the starting population. Population and Habitat Viability Assessment for the Javan Rhino: February 2015 39 In other contexts, three broad strategies might be considered for reducing the accumulation of inbreeding in a population: 1) increasing population size; 2) introducing unrelated rhinos from outside the population; and 3) manipulating breeding within the population to favour less related pairings. In the Javan rhino context options 2) and 3) are not real options at this time; UKNP hosts the only population of this species so no unrelated animals are available, and intensive management of pairings is not currently an option. This leaves only increasing population size as a potential strategy for mitigating inbreeding depression and this is considered in the next section. In summary, at its current size and with the likely constraints on further growth, the population of rhinos at UKNP is vulnerable to a range of threats potentially operating in the park. Participants discussed potential strategies for reducing this vulnerability and these are described below. Strategy-Based Scenarios Participants considered strategies for reducing the vulnerability of the remaining population at Ujung Kulon. Maintaining full protection against poaching and increasing the current population size were the two highest priorities identified. Increasing population size could be achieved by one or both of the following: 1) Increasing the carrying capacity at UKNP through: a. reducing Arenga palm encroachment; or b. otherwise improving habitat quality for Javan rhinos. 2) Establishing a second site for Javan rhinos outside UKNP. Impact of increasing carrying capacity at UKNP Figure 12. Illustrates the impact over 100 years on the modelled populations, of increasing carrying capacity on year 1 from 60 (current estimate) to 65, 70, 75, and 80.

This analysis is confined to the following questions that relate to population viability: \u2022 How many rhinos can we safely remove from UKNP to found a second population? \u2022 How many founders do we need to give a second population a good chance of establishment? How many rhinos can we remove from Ujung Kulon? Factors likely to impact on the number of rhinos able to be removed safely from Ujung Kulon, that is, without threatening its viability, include the following: \u2022 The age and sex-ratio of the individuals removed relative to the source population. For example, if the UKNP population is short of females, or is short of reproductively capable females, it will be less able tolerate female-biased harvest of breeding age individuals. \u2022 The timing of removals. For example, the population may be more able to tolerate two smaller harvests spread several years apart, than a single, large harvest which could leave the population particularly vulnerable to demographic and genetic uncertainty. \u2022 The mechanism underpinning the current lack of growth in the population. This is assumed to be density related due to the proximity of current population numbers to the Park\u2019s (estimated) carrying capacity. If this is the case, the removal of some individuals should provide space that will allow growth to resume. If this is not the case, growth may not resume and the population will be left even more vulnerable than before. Single harvest, year 1 Figure 13 below illustrates the impact on modelled populations of harvesting for translocation groups of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 adults of even sex-ratio, on year 1 of the program. As can be seen, in the absence of threats (e.g. further Arenga palm encroachment, disease outbreaks, catastrophes, poaching) modelled populations eventually recover from all of these harvest levels and return to roughly the same trajectory as they would be expected to have followed in absence of any harvest. However, the larger the harvest, the longer the period of recovery and, therefore, of increased vulnerability to other threats; harvests of 2, 4, and 6 return to a common trajectory around year 15, whereas harvests of 8, 10 and 12 take 5-10 years longer to \u201ccatch up\u201d.

Population and Habitat Viability Assessment for the Javan Rhino: February 2015 41 numbers of individuals involved the differences are small and all five scenarios returned an extinction risk of zero for the period considered. However, it should be stressed that this is in the absence of human- mediated threats and environmental catastrophes and it assumes that growth will increase immediately following harvest because of the increase in habitat availability. Multiple smaller harvests Figure 14 explores the impact of spreading the harvest across years. Two harvest sizes are considered: one of 8 individuals in total and one of 12 individuals in total. For N=8, one scenario involves taking all 8 rhinos out in year 1, the other takes 4 in year 1 and 4 more in year 3. For N=12, one scenario takes all 12 rhinos out in year 1, the other takes 4 individuals in year 1, 4 in year 3 and 4 more in year 8. All of the scenarios considered take the same average trajectory from approximately year 30. As might be expected, scenarios involving removal of 12 rhinos result in the maintenance of a lower population size at Ujung Kulon, for longer than those in which only 8 animals are removed. Due to the growth in between removal events, scenarios involving several smaller harvests maintain larger average sizes throughout. In addition to the slightly larger average population size expected, taking multiple smaller harvests has the advantage of a precautionary approach, in which the impact of the smaller harvest can be assessed before further animals are taken, and translocation protocols can be tested and refined. Female-biased harvest We expect that any population translocated to a second site will grow faster if it carries more females.

However, harvesting more females from Ujung Kulon would be expected to reduce productivity there, potentially exposing the population to additional risk. Figure 15 compares the relative impact on the UKNP population, of three translocation scenarios with biased sex-ratios, all of which involve the movement of 8 rhinos spread across two translocation events, spaced 2 years apart. The ratios considered were as follows (Figure 15): 1) 4 males and 4 females (blue line) 2) 3 males and 5 females (orange line) 3) 1 male and 7 females (grey line) 40 42 44 46 48 50 52 54 56 58 60 1 6 11 16 21 26 31 36 41 46 51 56 61 66 71 76 81 86 91 96 101 Population Size Year Harvest 8 yr1 Harvest 12 yr1 Harvest 4 yr1, 4 yr3 Harvest 4 yr1, 4 yr3, 4 yr8 Figure 14: Comparison of model performance under a single harvest on year 1 versus the same-sized harvest spread across multiple harvest events, for harvests of 8 and 12. 42 Population and Habitat Viability Assessment for the Javan Rhino: February 2015 As illustrated, taking extra females out of the population has a small but visible impact on the average trajectory of modelled populations, with the scenario in which 7 females are removed taking noticeably longer to recover than those in which 4 and 5 are removed. Note that the models may underestimate this impact as all females in the model are assumed to be in the breeding pool. If in reality only a proportion of the females in Ujung Kulon are capable of breeding then the removal of any of those could have a disproportionate impact on the population\u2019s ability to recover post-harvest which is not illustrated here. This could be further explored using the models if relevant data become available. How many rhinos do we need to establish a new population? A newly formed population founded with 8 rhinos would be expected to grow more quickly with a larger proportion of females than males. However, the larger the skew, the greater the chance of losing all breeding males in the early years of the program due to chance demographic events, and the faster the accumulation of inbreeding due to the high level of relatedness expected in the first generation. The three harvesting scenarios considered in the previous section were reconsidered from the perspective of their suitability for founding a new population and the results are illustrated in Figure 16: 1) 4 males and 4 females (blue line) 2) 3 males and 5 females (orange line) 3) 1 male and 7 females (grey line) 46 48 50 52 54 56 58 60 1 7 13 19 25 31 37 43 49 55 61 67 73 79 85 91 97 Population Size Year Harvest 4F + 4M Harvest 5F + 3M Harvest 7F + 1M Figure 15: Impact on the model populations of applying a female bias to the sex-ratio of rhinos harvested for translocation. Population and Habitat Viability Assessment for the Javan Rhino: February 2015 43 The population founded with 5 females and 3 males (orange line) performs best all round, showing a lower extinction risk, higher average population size over the longer term and lower inbreeding accumulation at 100 years. The faster early growth of the population founded with 5 females appears to offset any genetic (inbreeding-related) advantages of the population founded on an even sex-ratio (blue line). The population founded with 7 females (grey line) performs better for the first few decades but begins to decline, on average, around year 40 primarily due to inbreeding which accumulates faster because of the close relationships amongst all first generation offspring. In reality it may be possible to low inbreeding accumulation at a second site by periodic movement of individuals from UKNP. However, the extent of mitigation possible would be influenced by a number of factors including feasibility, logistical difficulty, social and behavioural obstacles and health/injury implications in the context of capture, translocation and integration of wild Javan rhinos. These aspects of founding and managing a second site were not discussed in detail at the workshop but models could be revisited with additional scenarios once more boundaries have been set around these considerations. The impact of carrying capacity on the performance of a second population is illustrated in Figure 17, for the more optimistic of the founding strategies considered (5 females and 3 males). Carrying capacities of 10, 20, 50 and 100 are considered.

Extinction risks for these populations are 0.816 and 0.215 respectively. A carrying capacity of 50 allows growth to continue for approximately 40 years before plateauing and a carrying capacity of 100 allows growth to continue throughout the 100 year period. Extinction risk for these two scenarios are relatively low and would be reduced further by periodic supplementation from Ujung Kulon. The second population scenarios described above may be optimistic as they do not include threats such as poaching, disturbance, habitat degradation, or disease outbreak. No specific sites were discussed during the workshop but should potential sites be identified it might be useful to revisit the models with additional information about site-specific conditions. Poaching tolerance at second site Figure 18 illustrates the response of the modelled second population to poaching at a rate of 0-4 adult rhinos every year. Carrying capacities of 10, 20, 50 and 100 are considered but as can be seen, populations are driven to extinction too quickly to expand into the space available.

Population and Habitat Viability Assessment for the Javan Rhino: February 2015 45 Summary Javan rhinos are potentially at risk to a number of threats: Arenga palm encroachment, cattle-mediated disease outbreaks, environmental catastrophes, inbreeding depression and poaching. At the impact levels simulated, poaching was the greatest threat to the modelled populations. Increasing population size would be expected to increase resilience to all of the threats considered. Options for achieving this are: 1) increasing carrying capacity at Ujung Kulon (through, for example, clearing Arenga Palm or otherwise improving habitat) and 2) establishing rhinos at a second site outside UKNP. Assuming that the lack of growth observed at UKNP over the past decades is the result of the population having reached carrying capacity, removing animals to seed another site should restore growth, allowing the population to recover from the harvest. Models indicate that in the absence of other threats the population could withstand a harvest of 12 individuals, though a precautionary approach would remove fewer until the expected impact on growth was confirmed. The population would be expected to take 20-30 years to recover from a harvest of this size. A population of around 8 individuals, 5 females and 3 males, should be sufficient to seed a new population successfully provided that additional supplementation downstream remains an option. A new site expected to provide long-term stability would ideally provide space for at least 50 individuals and would need to be completely protected from poaching to secure establishment and growth. Constraints around site-specific risks, logistics, rhino behaviour, health/injury risks and general feasibility would be major influences in any project aiming to capture, translocate and establish rhinos at a new site. These issues were not discussed in detail at the workshop.

Population and Habitat Viability Assessment for the Javan Rhino: February 2015 51 Javan Rhino Stakeholder Engagement Working Group Report Working Group members: Challenges to stakeholder engagement for Javan rhino conservation The group first identified the following challenges to stakeholder engagement for Javan rhino conservation: 1. Human population growth without the availability of alternative livelihoods, combined with a lack of integration, participation and synergies amongst all stakeholders in economic development of the buffer zone, increases pressure on UKNP and increases the conflict between the national park and the local communities. This increased level of conflict leads to a degradation of support for Javan rhino conservation. 2. Lack of knowledge and perception in the local community creates low support of the local community for Javan rhino conservation as it creates resistance to the implementation of the Javan rhino conservation program. 3. Communities are not supportive of Javan rhino conservation because they are not involved and empowered in the program. This leads to a low level of support for Javan rhino conservation efforts amongst local stakeholders. 4. Slow policy decision making due to many and often conflicting interests leads to delays in implementing the Javan rhino conservation program which needs to be implemented fast as the situation is critical for the species. 52 Population and Habitat Viability Assessment for the Javan Rhino: February 2015 Data Assembly Threat 1: Human population growth without the availability of alternative livelihoods, combined with a lack of integration, participation and synergies amongst all stakeholders in economic development of the buffer zone, increases pressure on UKNP and increases the conflict between the national park and the local communities.

Finally, the group placed these goals in order of priority in terms of their effectiveness in advancing stakeholder engagement for the purpose of Javan rhino conservation in Indonesia. 1. By 2025, no illegal activities by local communities inside UKNP and the second habitat occur due to a close, trusting and mutually beneficial partnership between communities and the park authorities. 2. By 2025, communities no longer extract natural resources from the rhino zone within UKNP due to the implementation of a whole-of-government green economic development masterplan across the park buffer zone that increases local livelihoods. 3. By 2025, all communities champion the Javan rhino conservation program due to active involvement in (50% of the 2 adjacent villages) and high knowledge of (100% of 19 buffer zone villages) the conservation program activities. 4. By 2025, all relevant stakeholders are fully supportive of the Javan rhino conservation program because they are empowered to be involved in the most appropriate way. 5. The Javan rhino conservation program is implemented in full and on time. 56 Population and Habitat Viability Assessment for the Javan Rhino: February 2015 Identification of Conservation Actions Action 1: Design and conduct a study to investigate the level of stakeholder support and involvement in conservation.

Je continue aujourd\u2019hui \u00e0 ressentir une profonde affection pour ce continent de contrastes, berceau de notre humanit\u00e9 et gardien d\u2019un patrimoine naturel d\u2019une incroyable richesse. En Afrique, plus qu\u2019ailleurs, la biodiversit\u00e9 subit de plein fouet les cons\u00e9quences d\u2019une avidit\u00e9 humaine sans limite, semant peine et d\u00e9solation, et hypoth\u00e9quant chaque jour un peu plus l\u2019avenir du continent. Car c\u2019est bien le futur qui est en train de se d\u00e9terminer. Les changements climatiques vont venir bouleverser les \u00e9cosyst\u00e8mes et malmener les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s humaines. La rar\u00e9faction des ressources naturelles frappera, en premier lieu, les populations les plus vuln\u00e9rables. Cela va donc ajouter de l\u2019in\u00e9galit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019in\u00e9galit\u00e9, de la mis\u00e8re \u00e0 la mis\u00e8re et de l\u2019injustice \u00e0 l\u2019injustice. Face \u00e0 la destruction de la for\u00eat, la d\u00e9sertification ou encore l\u2019\u00e9rosion de la biodiversit\u00e9, nous pouvons choisir de sacrifier l\u2019avenir au pr\u00e9sent ou, au contraire, dresser les contours d\u2019un futur souhaitable et possible. Partout, des hommes et des femmes se consacrent au quotidien \u00e0 construire un id\u00e9al, celui de pr\u00e9server ce formidable patrimoine mondial tout en am\u00e9liorant le bien-\u00eatre des populations. Car la Nature est notre \u00e9pargne pour l\u2019avenir et le bien-\u00eatre de l\u2019Homme est intimement li\u00e9 \u00e0 la biodiversit\u00e9. La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 civile invente et construit ce nouveau monde. Elle est audacieuse et envoie un message d\u2019espoir qui contraste avec l\u2019immobilisme, voire le cynisme, auxquels c\u00e8dent souvent les d\u00e9cideurs politiques.

L\u2019Union des Associations Villageoises de Gestion des R\u00e9serves de Faune (U-AVIGREF) a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e dans un contexte montrant clairement l\u2019\u00e9chec de la gestion unilat\u00e9rale des r\u00e9serves de faune par l\u2019Etat et les institutions \u00e9tatiques. En effet, jusqu\u2019aux ann\u00e9es 1990, les populations riveraines \u00e9taient exclues de la gestion de la R\u00e9serve de Biosph\u00e8re de la Pendjari (RBP). Afin de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 l\u2019ambivalence n\u00e9e de cette situation et de contrer les menaces croissantes pesant sur la biodiversit\u00e9 de la r\u00e9serve, l\u2019Etat B\u00e9ninois, s\u2019appuyant sur la convention sur la Diversit\u00e9 Biologique adopt\u00e9e \u00e0 Rio en 1992, a initi\u00e9 une approche de gestion participative des ressources naturelles. Les populations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accompagn\u00e9es et se sont organis\u00e9es pour partager le pouvoir, les responsabilit\u00e9s et les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices de la gestion des aires prot\u00e9g\u00e9es avec l\u2019Etat. Ainsi, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mises en place, par d\u00e9cret en 1996 les AVIGREF et le Centre National de Gestion des R\u00e9serves de Faune (CENAGREF) ayant pour mission \u201cla gestion rationnelle des r\u00e9serves de faune (\u2026) en liaison avec les populations riveraines et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 civile\u201d (art 3). Ce cadre institutionnel a \u00e9t\u00e9 op\u00e9rationnel \u00e0 la Pendjari \u00e0 partir de 2000 avec plusieurs appuis. Les capacit\u00e9s de 23 AVIGREF et du Bureau de l\u2019Union furent ainsi renforc\u00e9es et ce processus de professionnalisation a abouti \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation du Secr\u00e9tariat Ex\u00e9cutif de l\u2019U-AVIGREF. Le renforcement de capacit\u00e9s se poursuit par un syst\u00e8me d\u2019encadrement mis en place pour le suivi au quotidien du fonctionnement des AVIGREF, l\u2019obligation de planification et surtout de pr\u00e9sentation annuelle des bilans en assembl\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.

En effet, aujourd\u2019hui, le braconnage n\u2019est plus alimentaire. Il est devenu commercial et est amin\u00e9 par de puissants r\u00e9seaux locaux, nationaux et internationaux. Les r\u00e9seaux de trafic d\u2019ivoire sont aujourd\u2019hui la menace la plus s\u00e9rieuse sur la survie des \u00e9l\u00e9phants par exemple. En rapport avec son statut de domaine class\u00e9, les pesticides et autres produits de synth\u00e8ses, nuisibles \u00e0 la biodiversit\u00e9 ne devraient pas \u00eatre utlis\u00e9s. Malheureusement, la pratique agricole en cours \u00e0 la p\u00e9riph\u00e9rie de la r\u00e9serve est bas\u00e9e sur l\u2019utilisation des engrais, pesticides et insectides. Ce qui peut influer sur la sant\u00e9 humaine et la biodiversit\u00e9. Au d\u00e9but de la mise en place de la Zone d\u2019Occupation Contr\u00f4l\u00e9e (ZOC), la revendication des terres cultivables \u00e9tait communautaire. Mais au fil des ans, certaines personnes \u00e9mergent en tant que propri\u00e9taires fonciers emp\u00eachant les autres d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 la terre. Ces menaces trouvent en partie leur fondement dans le contexte \u2013 et le pr\u00e9texte - de pauvret\u00e9 des populations riveraines, parmi les plus d\u00e9munies du pays (70 000 FCFA contre \u00e0 116.000 FCFA en moyenne au B\u00e9nin). Toutefois tous les actes illicites ne peuvent s\u2019expliquer par la pauvret\u00e9. Le statut de la r\u00e9serve n\u2019est pas connu par tous les acteurs.

L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de l\u2019agriculture biologique \u00e0 la p\u00e9riph\u00e9rie de la r\u00e9serve est de r\u00e9duire les risques \u00e9cologiques et sanitaires li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation des pesticides de synth\u00e8se tout en am\u00e9liorant les conditions de vie des petits producteurs et des femmes, de m\u00eame en tenant compte des adaptations aux changements climatiques. Les impacts \u00e9conomiques se ressentent essentiellement par l\u2019augmentation des revenus des b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires, en particulier des femmes (\u00e9volution de 5 millions en 2008-2009 \u00e0 pr\u00e8s de 164 millions en 2013-2014). Si le rendement du coton biologique est faible, il constitue tout de m\u00eame un march\u00e9 de niche avec un prix plus r\u00e9mun\u00e9rateur. Ces actions ont \u00e9galement un impact important en mati\u00e8re de conservation. Ainsi, sur 34.000 ha de superficie totale de la ZOC, 7.762 ha (23 %) sont exploit\u00e9s par 2.210 agriculteurs. 217,25 ha sont exploit\u00e9s pour le coton dont 81,15 ha (37,35 %) convertis en coton biologique. L\u2019effort de conversion de la ZOC du syst\u00e8me conventionnel en syst\u00e8me biologique r\u00e9pond non seulement aux prescriptions l\u00e9gales par rapport aux textes qui r\u00e9gissent la r\u00e9serve, mais aussi un apport important r\u00e9pondant \u00e0 la r\u00e9duction de l\u2019utilisation des pesticides dont le corollaire est la r\u00e9duction des polluants pouvant \u00eatre une menace sur la biodiversit\u00e9. Les perspectives se rapportent \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9gration de la strat\u00e9gie de production du coton biologique d\u2019une part dans la production globale du coton, mais aussi d\u2019autre part dans une politique environnementale harmonis\u00e9e au plan sectoriel.

Braconnage, pacage ill\u00e9gal, feux de brousse et d\u00e9friches jusque dans les aires de conservation s\u2019\u00e9taient accentu\u00e9s au rythme de la croissance d\u00e9mographique, de l\u2019expansion des cultures de rente (coton essentiellement) et de l\u2019accroissement du b\u00e9tail. Cette situation d\u00e9coulait surtout du fait que les populations ne reconnaissaient pas les lois \u00e9tablies par l\u2019Etat central et que les approches de conservation jusqu\u2019alors d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es ne prenaient pas suffisamment en compte leur vision, qui consid\u00e8re la conservation des ressources naturelles et le d\u00e9veloppement local comme deux pr\u00e9occupations indissociables. Face \u00e0 ce constat, l\u2019objectif de l\u2019AFAUDEB est de contribuer \u00e0 inscrire la conservation dans la perspective d\u2019une meilleure gouvernance, d\u2019une \u201cgestion conjointe\u201d et d\u2019une prise de d\u00e9cisions promouvant le partage des retomb\u00e9es \u00e9conomiques. L\u2019essentiel de l\u2019appui d\u2019AFAUDEB porte sur trois domaines : la conservation des ressources naturelles (mise en place de ZOVIC et d\u00e9veloppement d\u2019activit\u00e9s de reboisement); le d\u00e9veloppement des comp\u00e9tences (formations, voyages d\u2019\u00e9changes, dotation en \u00e9quipements et infrastructures collectifs) et la diversification et l\u2019accroissement des revenus (transformation et valorisation de PFNL, cr\u00e9dit, mara\u00eechage).

La RBMH, a \u00e9t\u00e9 class\u00e9e r\u00e9serve de biosph\u00e8re par l\u2019UNESCO en 1987 puis inscrite comme site Ramsar en 1990. Cet \u00e9cosyst\u00e8me comprend 660 ha de mares et 864 ha de plaines d\u2019inondation. Le reste de la r\u00e9serve comprend 1.756 ha de for\u00eat galerie et 11.000 ha de savane bois\u00e9e.

Pouvez-vous nous dire un mot sur cette AP, ses caract\u00e9ristiques, son importance aussi bien au niveau \u00e9cologique que pour les communaut\u00e9s riveraines mais \u00e9galement les pressions pesant sur cette derni\u00e8re ? Je vous remercie d\u2019abord de me donner l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de parler du PNW, cette Aire Prot\u00e9g\u00e9e (AP) sur laquelle j\u2019ai men\u00e9 un certain nombre des travaux de recherche et o\u00f9 je travaille avec mon association ACODED sur les conflits entre hommes et \u00e9l\u00e9phants. Le PNW, abrite une importante population faunique, dont des \u00e9l\u00e9phants, et connait deux probl\u00e8mes majeurs \u00e0 savoir le braconnage et la destruction de ses ressources hydriques et naturelles. Sa position limitrophe au Nigeria et au Tchad et les fronti\u00e8res poreuses l\u2019expose \u00e0 toute sorte de pressions de ce type. Cette situation est \u00e0 l\u2019origine de migration de certains animaux tels que lions, \u00e9l\u00e9phants ou antilopes en dehors du parc, ce qui les rend particuli\u00e8rement vuln\u00e9rables au braconnage et aux conflits avec les populations. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un cercle vicieux d\u00e9licat \u00e0 briser. L\u2019interaction entre les populations riveraines et le PNW est depuis longtemps conflictuelle, et cause dans le m\u00eame temps l\u2019appauvrissement des populations riveraines, celles-ci \u00e9tant directement d\u00e9pendantes de ces derni\u00e8res pour leur survie. Pour inverser la tendance, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 test\u00e9 en 1997 un mod\u00e8le de cogestion qui, pour \u00eatre honn\u00eate, n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ellement fonctionn\u00e9 sur le terrain. Les populations n\u2019y \u00e9taient pas pr\u00e9par\u00e9es, n\u2019avaient pas la m\u00eame vision du processus et le m\u00e9canisme de mise en \u0153uvre n\u2019\u00e9tait pas adapt\u00e9 au contexte local. Le parc continue de subir de fortes pressions, aussi bien par des populations riveraines exploitant frauduleusement et de mani\u00e8re non durable ses ressources que des braconniers \u00e9trangers. Le PNW abrite donc une importante population d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9phants. Quelle est la situation actuellement observ\u00e9e dans l\u2019AP mais \u00e9galement en p\u00e9riph\u00e9rie de celle-ci, concernant cette esp\u00e8ce embl\u00e9matique dont la survie est fortement menac\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019heure actuelle ?", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "89df028c-c38b-4079-b596-8fdc7a5b55db": {"__data__": {"id_": "89df028c-c38b-4079-b596-8fdc7a5b55db", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enjeux-de-conservation-et-societe-civile-africaine-paroles-dacteurs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enjeux de conservation et soci\u00e9t\u00e9 civile africaine : paroles d'acteurs = Conservation issues and African civil society : local players' view", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enjeux-de-conservation-et-societe-civile-africaine-paroles-dacteurs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6c0864b6fe405f709166f8ed9dde59ab5de6d44744e45f270e502722e79ce65b"}, "2": {"node_id": "f673d157-1580-44cc-a80b-d0ec558b0fbd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enjeux-de-conservation-et-societe-civile-africaine-paroles-dacteurs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "313213b6364e3f36a90ec1860038f936fbd13ebb61d889e56134056c313a2463"}}, "hash": "6c62e1725e9b6811a3193201ed423878235f228b8df44de9c44083d160dd30f6", "text": "Le PNW compte actuellement une population d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9phants de pr\u00e8s de 900 individus se r\u00e9partissant en deux grands groupes ayant des migrations saisonni\u00e8res diff\u00e9rentes. Un groupe d\u2019environ 400 individus se d\u00e9place du PNW vers le nord, au Parc National de Kalamalou\u00e9 entre novembre et f\u00e9vrier. Un second groupe d\u2019environ 480 individus migre du PNW vers la R\u00e9serve foresti\u00e8re de Kalfou, situ\u00e9e plus au sud dans la r\u00e9gion. Mais l\u2019\u00e9cologie de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est en train de changer et depuis 2008, le groupe d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9phants migrant au sud, vers la R\u00e9serve de Kalfou n\u2019est revenu au PNW qu\u2019\u00e0 la suite d\u2019une op\u00e9ration de battue administrative organis\u00e9e par l\u2019Administration foresti\u00e8re en d\u00e9but d\u2019ann\u00e9e 2014. Au regard de l\u2019ampleur du ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne de braconnage en Afrique Centrale depuis quelques ann\u00e9es, les \u00e9l\u00e9phants du PNW sont plus que jamais vuln\u00e9rables. Cependant, eu \u00e9gard aux dispositions prises par le Gouvernement camerounais avec l\u2019aide de la communaut\u00e9 internationale, notamment du FFEM \u00e0 travers notre projet, le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne de grand braconnage li\u00e9 au trafic d\u2019ivoire n\u2019est pas encore ressenti dans la zone du PNW. La mise en place de notre r\u00e9seau d\u2019informateurs locaux semble donc porter ses fruits. Une autre menace existe n\u00e9anmoins, car il ressort des enqu\u00eates que nous avons men\u00e9es que la cohabitation entre hommes et \u00e9l\u00e9phants n\u2019est pas facile. Des conflits dus aux d\u00e9g\u00e2ts constat\u00e9s sur les cultures, les vergers, les canaux de p\u00eaches, les mares d\u2019abreuvement de b\u00e9tail ont ainsi entrain\u00e9 mort d\u2019homme et menacent dans le m\u00eame temps directement la survie de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Parmi les raisons pouvant expliquer la hausse de l\u2019intensit\u00e9 de conflits, particuli\u00e8rement observ\u00e9e dans la zone de Kalfou, on peut \u00e9voquer la disponibilit\u00e9 en eau, la pr\u00e9sence de zones d\u2019ombrage et de p\u00e2turage int\u00e9ressantes pour les \u00e9l\u00e9phants, dans un contexte de densit\u00e9 d\u00e9mographique importante.

La conservation des mammif\u00e8res marins au Cameroun est entrav\u00e9e par le d\u00e9ficit de donn\u00e9es disponibles sur la distribution et la taille des populations, les dynamiques de migration et les interactions avec les populations humaines. Ceci est d\u00fb au faible nombre de chercheurs sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s mais aussi \u00e0 l\u2019absence de moyens logistiques et financiers permettant de travailler sur la question. En l\u2019absence de ce type de donn\u00e9es, il est difficile de prendre des d\u00e9cisions de conservation efficaces permettant la gestion effective et durable de ces esp\u00e8ces.

Could you tell us a word about the story, vision and objectives of this civil society organization since its creation ? I work for CAD as Coordinator since its creation in 2003 as a conservation and development organization working with local communities in the South West Region of Cameroon. Our goal is to strengthen local capacities through education and promotion of activities that support both local livelihoods and biodiversity conservation. We attempt to achieve this goal via our intervention in areas such as sustainable natural resources management, agriculture and community health education. As a botanist, I started working on environment issues as a student and I fell in love with nature. I later worked for a conservation NGO based in the South West of Cameroon for four years, with many communities, particularly in the Bakossi area and saw much misery and suffering among rural populations. In 2002, my urge to contribute to conservation and curbing human misery increased and this led to the creation of CAD.

Why did you begin to work on this issue, what are the main threats observed for this tree, their reasons and how CAD did try to solve this problem ? Besides P. africana conservation, CAD is equally involved in forest policy dissemination, campaigns against bush meat hunting, livelihood support activities and capacity building of community groups. That said, CAD started working on P. africana following a reconnaissance visit to the Muanenguba Mountain forest in 2010 to witness the state of exploitation of this species and what we saw was shocking. The harvesting methods are quite poor and unsustainable. Whole trees are debarked from the roots to the smallest branches or completely cut down prior to debarking. It leaves many trees dead and is coupled with forest clearance due to agricultural expansion and frequent bush fires by the resident Mbororo herdsmen in search of fresh pastures for cattle. The main driver for the over exploitation of P. africana all over the planet is linked to its global medicinal value and the rising demand of Prunus bark extracts in foreign markets for eventual use to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia. The collection of mature bark resulted in the species becoming threatened with extinction. This explains why Prunus africana is placed under Appendix II of CITES as a species whose trade must be regulated and described in the IUCN Red List of Classification as vulnerable. Commercial exploitation of P. africana in the Muanenguba started in 1972 by PLANTECAM MEDICAM. At that time, local people employed as harvesters were trained to harvest Prunus bark without killing the tree. A harvester could harvest 70-80kg of Prunus bark a day and sold it at 150FCFA/kg. After the departure of the company, other economic operators came, set in much rivalry among harvesters and harvesting proportions were no longer respected. This led to continuous unsustainable practices such as cutting of trees and peeling entire stems. It is common to see dead trees standing in the forest canopy. Looking to this, what does CAD try to implement to solve this problem in the Muanenguba Area ? In 2012, CAD, developed a participatory pilot project titled \u201cPromoting Prunus africana Domestication within Existing Farming Systems and Woodlots\u201d with financial support from the Peoples Trust for Endangered Species and the French Embassy in Cameroon. This project aims at promoting P. africana conservation through direct regeneration, envi- ronmental education and promotion of sustainable harvesting practices. CAD is raising community awareness on the socio-economic importance and plight of P. africana and the legal rights and obligations in the use of this resource. In addition, we identify those with interest in the species, both harvesters and potential farmers, building their organizational and technical capacities on domestication and proper harvesting techniques as well as facilitate joint periodic forest visits with the local forestry administration to monitor and control illegal activities. Martin ETONE - CAD Coordinator What are your main achievements on this issue ? I think we have interesting results. Over 1.500 people have been kept aware about socio-economic and ecological importance of P. africana and the threats it faces in the Muanenguba. We have organized a series of community sensitization meetings, produced and distributed 1.000 posters on proper Prunus bark harvesting techniques. Some of these people have begun engaging in Prunus conservation activities. Moreover, we established 17 nurseries with 11.000 seedlings in 9 village communities. So far, over 7.500 Prunus trees have been planted within existing farming systems and woodlots. We conduct forest control trips with staff of the Ministry of Forestry and Wildlife against illegal exploitation of Prunus in the Muanenguba forest. Notwithstanding, there is a need to scale up these activities, conduct an inventory of wild populations and monitor the exploitation of this resource. In the same time, as many places of the country, people living in rural areas face important poverty and socio-economic problems. How protecting trees as P. africana contribute to socio-economic development of the Bakossi people ? Domesticating P. africana is a long-term investment. The plant takes a long time of about 12 to 15 years before it gets to maturity, producing barks for business and income generation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ef43857e-7394-4139-9e6c-f6481568d848": {"__data__": {"id_": "ef43857e-7394-4139-9e6c-f6481568d848", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enjeux-de-conservation-et-societe-civile-africaine-paroles-dacteurs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enjeux de conservation et soci\u00e9t\u00e9 civile africaine : paroles d'acteurs = Conservation issues and African civil society : local players' view", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enjeux-de-conservation-et-societe-civile-africaine-paroles-dacteurs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "327bce8f7cee36d9c4bb77063dbb7b066fb4d1831055cdd379ed64cb9b619371"}, "2": {"node_id": "b44c8e71-1f44-43aa-9b5e-9efc199ef5d1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enjeux-de-conservation-et-societe-civile-africaine-paroles-dacteurs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9ad6937dae2e302846f4b37fb3c593c363f89d76c9c670227b82f57ad4bfeb21"}}, "hash": "438ce7ef3e02512844ee2738cf426362e7a8dae52c18e3cf935a8dca1c4226a1", "text": "For this reason we employ an integrated farming system.

Working as a national NGO is not always an easy task. CAD is now more than 10 years old and what are the main difficulties you have to deal with as an NGO ? The first is staff instability. This comes because staffs jump out of CAD in search of better pay packages elsewhere. Each time staffs leave us, they go with skills, thus weakening our technical and institutional capacity. Another is financial insecurity, depending solely on donor support for our work and operations. We also receive so many requests from our target populations than we can support due to inadequate resources. Talking about the future\u2026 What are your concrete perspectives and objectives for years coming ? CAD recently finalized business and strategic plans to give our strategic direction from 2015-2019. Components of the strategic plan include sustainable natural resources management, sustainable agriculture, community health services and support to enhance advocacy for women and girls programmes. Prunus conservation remains an integral part of this plan. In addition, we look forward to strengthening partnership with other organizations and networks as well as improving CAD\u2019s institutional and technical capacities.

This community forest has a special story; can you tell us something about this one ? The Kilum-Ijim forest area covers two divisions of the North West Region and three tribes (Nso, Oku and Kom) with different languages but similar cultures living here. This forest has the largest remaining Bamenda Highland Montane Forest with a large crater lake called Lake Oku. It is rich in Non Timber Products and has trees that cannot be exploited for timber. The 18 community forests part of the Kilum-Ijim forest constitute the first community forests created in Cameroon, with the Birdlife International support in 1987. The forest is the largest remaining habitat for Bannermans Turaco, a red feathered bird endemic to the Bamenda Highland Region and classified by IUCN Redlist as endangered. Kilum Mountain is the second highest mountain of the country after Mount Cameroon and Prunus Africana is a native tree which is found in this forest. A lot of honey is produce in this area and it is white in colour, commonly called Oku White Honey. It is certified by African Intellectual Property Right Organisation as Geographical Indication Product and is cherished nationally and internationally. The white colour is a result of dominant white flowers produced by trees in this forest. To finish, the Kilum-Ijim forest trees are medicinal and this makes Oku White honey medicinal. This forest area is also a touristic destination. The Kilum-Ijim forest hosts a tree species important for many reasons, Prunus Africana. What is it interest and what are the threats on it at the moment in Cameroon ? Yes, Prunus Africana is a native tree of the Kilum-jim forest and is important for many reasons. It produces white flowers that are bee loving helping for white honey production. It is a watershed tree which generates revenues because of its medicinal value. The bark of this tree is harvested to produce drugs used to treat prostate cancer and herbalists use the barks of these trees to produce various traditional medicines. Prunus Africana suffers from bushfire in the Kilum-Ijim forest, sometimes caused by cigarette smokers or honey harvesters who use poor methods of honey harvesting. It has also suffered from over exploitation and poor harvesting from local people who wanted to sell barks to international companies using this to produce drugs. In addition, domestic animals like goats are kept in this forest and these animals eat young planted Prunus trees making forest regeneration difficult. The number of Prunus trees in the forest is reducing and there is a real need to plant and to protect this valuable tree.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "05883b4a-043b-4e60-a8a9-989fa397e9ed": {"__data__": {"id_": "05883b4a-043b-4e60-a8a9-989fa397e9ed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enjeux-de-conservation-et-societe-civile-africaine-paroles-dacteurs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enjeux de conservation et soci\u00e9t\u00e9 civile africaine : paroles d'acteurs = Conservation issues and African civil society : local players' view", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enjeux-de-conservation-et-societe-civile-africaine-paroles-dacteurs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7adc7909cdb4254961668c0c5fd86f7122fc4b97a7e955ff2e43a85d63ebdec8"}, "2": {"node_id": "d4d23c4e-f6a8-42eb-8fa8-8b707451aa8d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enjeux-de-conservation-et-societe-civile-africaine-paroles-dacteurs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "56ca2cd55eff501fed1cc1ace3a16ee98234e9d15eccd3cae887bea33ac6bcdc"}}, "hash": "afe272a914b60d3efeff51c93fa4c8b51221a5c925a75ff3342a9b3b73a47cef", "text": "Wirsiy Emmanuel BINYUY - CAMGEW Director on bee farming and 417 beehives were constructed and distributed at subsidised rates.

CAMGEW have also been carrying out environmental education in schools to instil in students the need to grow up with love for forest and mature community members to change their behaviour toward the forest. What are CAMGEW prospects for coming months ? For coming months, CAMGEW needs to take care of the 44.000 trees planted in the forest during the last years. We will train more or less 180 new people on bee farming and construct 100 beehives that will be distribute to trained persons for colonization and mounting in the forest. Environmental education will continue and 150 farmers will be trained on agro-forestry techniques in order to better manage the forest surrounding landscape to get more food, promote bee farming and prevent erosion. Support will be provided to bee farmers to create and manage 4 new honey cooperatives in order to improve honey quality and marketing. A support will also be provided to help bee farmers market their bee wax from the forest. Looking to this, what actions CAMGEW implements on the field to change this situation ? CAMGEW carries out activities in three main domains. It involves forest regeneration through tree planting, environmental education with community and schools and community engagement in apiculture. Agroforestry is linked to apiculture as forest peripheries need to produce flowers for forest bees when there is flower shortage in the forest. At the moment, CAMGEW has regenerated the Kilum-Ijim forest with about 44.000 trees, 33.000 being Prunus Africana and 11.000 being of 11 other tree species. On the whole, with support of World Bank (2012), PPI-FFEM (2013), MINFOF, Koning schools and BOTH ENDS, more that 500 community members participated to these plantation activities. These activities continue and in 2015, CAMGEW planted 23.500 trees of various types with funds of several partners, still with the same community based approach. Activities marking the regeneration of the Kilum-Ijim forest start yearly from June to August with tree launching by planting of a symbolic tree and ends with crowning ceremony by various community leaders. The tree planting exercise always involves clearing, transportation of seedlings to the forest and planting. The various authorities take part in planning meetings and field visits to identify the site in the Kilum-Ijim forest for the tree planting exercise. The regeneration exercise always end on the last day with forest sensitisation messages from community leaders calling on community members to protect their forest. CAMGEW engages local people to own beehives in the forest after receiving training on how to better manage the forest. Beekeeping is a real incentive to protect the forest because ownership of hives by people in Kilum-Ijim forest pushes them to avoid bushfire and forest destruction as they protect beehives as sources of incomes. Bee farming gives them a source of livelihood from the sale of honey and makes them see the importance to protect the forest. 347 persons from groups, especially women and children were trained Contacts: Telephone : +237 699 122 904 E-mail : hq@erudef.org Website : www.erudef.org Cameroon South West These mountain ecosystems supply over 30% of the Cameroon food needs and harbor a population of the indigenous Mbororo community.

Efforts to counter the pervasive threats to biodiversity in the region are probably best focused at the community level in the areas surrounding existing and proposed protected areas, where it is important that people understand and appreciate the contribution that these areas can make to environmental stability, human health and local economies. Louis . the Cameroon South West region, where ERuDeF works, is very rich in biodiversity. What is the ecological importance of this region , and the main threats for biodiversity ? These region\u2019s forests and highlands have for long been recognized as being biologically diverse and is a center of high endemism for a wide variety of taxa including primates, anuran amphibians, birds, freshwater fishes, butterflies, dragonflies, and trees. The Guinean Forests hotspot is home to an estimated 9,000 vascular plant species, about 20 percent of which are thought to be endemic. Nearly 2,500 plant species have been recorded on Mount Cameroon alone and Mount Bamboutos landscape is home to an exceptional biodiversity that spans from endemic and globally threatened plants to primates such as Cross River gorilla, Nigeria-Cameroon Chimpanzee and birds as Tauraco bannermani. These mountains have been identified as some of Africa\u2019s most critical primate conservation areas. As many as nine species are endemic to the forests of Nigeria and Cameroon border region. The hotspot also has populations of two of Africa\u2019s great apes, including remaining scattered populations of chimpanzees and Cross River gorillas endemic to this area and claims one-third of Africa\u2019s primate species. African Forest Elephant still occur here in reasonable numbers with a notable mountain subpopulation found on Mt Cameroon. While reptiles are not adequately documented in West Africa, preliminary analysis suggest that more than 200 species, a quarter of which are endemic, are found in the region. The study of Mt Nlonako showed this mountain to be the most species rich single-locality in reptilian fauna in Africa and possibly worldwide. Amphibians are also poorly documented in the region but it is estimated that almost 225 amphibians inhabit the hotspot, including more than 80 endemics. And many additional species are likely to be discovered. For example, 11 new frog species have been discovered in the last decade alone. These montane uplands are one of the most important centers of endemism of the African continent and are considered as a priority area for conservation globally. Louis NKEMBI - ERuDeF Executive director What is the vision of your organization about conservation? What were your greatest successes ? My organization sees conservation as a secured route to sustainable development not only in Cameroon but also in the whole world. Consequently, we tackle conservation from a holistic point of view. ERuDeF entry point into conservation is through saving IUCN listed endangered species through the use of holistic approaches. Since creation, ERuDeF had been focused first on identifying and conserving the endangered species and plants and then working to create the first system of protected areas across the Lebialem highlands and Cameroon mountains. ERuDeF is also supporting the implementation of a mountains agroforestry development program, impacting over 2 millions Cameroonians. Our key successes included designating a system of proposed protected areas across the highlands, creating the Lebialem highlands conservation complex in 2010, discovering the Cross River gorillas in the Tofala rainforest in 2004, winning the Whitley Award in 2010 and launching the first pilot project on Access and Benefits-Sharing in Cameroon in 2012 with signature of the first ABS agreement with the government in 2014. ERuDeF is the first national NGO to have created a protected area in Cameroon and is working towards creating and managing a system of protected areas. Other successes include MoU with Government of Cameroon and managing a sub-national program on agroforestry development. Specifically concerning Cross River Gorilla on which the NGO focus it action, what are the main threats for this specie? As a researcher and NGO manager, what recommendations would you like to make to decision-makers and government of Cameroon ? The main threat for this important specie is habitat fragmentation and degradation resulting from creation of farms and logging. Poaching of gorillas and chimpanzees while no longer being a major problem, the poaching of other mammals is still a major issue.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a6cf35f2-b598-4b4d-b015-365a9aca5ee4": {"__data__": {"id_": "a6cf35f2-b598-4b4d-b015-365a9aca5ee4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enjeux-de-conservation-et-societe-civile-africaine-paroles-dacteurs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enjeux de conservation et soci\u00e9t\u00e9 civile africaine : paroles d'acteurs = Conservation issues and African civil society : local players' view", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enjeux-de-conservation-et-societe-civile-africaine-paroles-dacteurs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f7d90f68d3c1441c05fef1cf9f9f18fa92f44e219b9e19257670402466963427"}, "2": {"node_id": "25ee6204-ba50-4493-8e42-028a56ad24cb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enjeux-de-conservation-et-societe-civile-africaine-paroles-dacteurs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "711ee89e11e42e5178574fc817e4ae7a9eb5f1533f1cebcc17422549a8576340"}}, "hash": "2add1feb3991aaff537a20d96ee2b78429aff9d0a32a5c27ee7a444be3833d67", "text": "In my opinion, the main recommendations that could be done to the government of Cameroon would include creating an Inter-Ministerial Commission for Protected Areas and Biodiversity Hotpots Management that will help solve the key social, economic and land-use planning issues around these areas, creating a fund for protected areas and biodiversity hotspots management in Cameroon,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f0197bfb-5bbf-4b06-928a-55f54f902b8c": {"__data__": {"id_": "f0197bfb-5bbf-4b06-928a-55f54f902b8c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enjeux-de-conservation-et-societe-civile-africaine-paroles-dacteurs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enjeux de conservation et soci\u00e9t\u00e9 civile africaine : paroles d'acteurs = Conservation issues and African civil society : local players' view", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enjeux-de-conservation-et-societe-civile-africaine-paroles-dacteurs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c6ad036433271fe93cfe6d52e190d8246876b932116e69a38598b667ad2e01a0"}, "3": {"node_id": "ffaef011-3326-467a-b814-d779aaa46a6c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enjeux-de-conservation-et-societe-civile-africaine-paroles-dacteurs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5849b751c56e39f14b22fc27c4cd0f7805eaab9e6cf3a9ccfc0f40f073b61a8a"}}, "hash": "8895fb444c3baf01b1628116aad2c54b89788e4d89031661d257a9d1d63e4917", "text": "effectively devolving the authority to manage protected areas and biodiversity hotspots to local stakeholders and significantly increasing the private sector role in financing conservation in Cameroon.

Cette AP class\u00e9e au Patrimoine Mondial de l\u2019UNESCO depuis 1987, subit actuellement des pressions multiformes. Pouvez-vous nous dire un mot sur ces derni\u00e8res ainsi que sur la valeur de cette AP ? La valeur patrimoniale de la RBD peut \u00eatre vue sous des angles diff\u00e9rents. Au niveau \u00e9co-syst\u00e9mique, l\u2019AP couvre 526.000 ha d\u2019\u00e9cosyst\u00e8mes forestiers \u00e0 forte diversit\u00e9 floristique et faunique et constitue actuellement un des blocs forestiers les plus importants et les mieux pr\u00e9serv\u00e9s d\u2019Afrique Centrale. Plus de 109 esp\u00e8ces de mammif\u00e8res, 360 esp\u00e8ces d\u2019oiseaux et 62 esp\u00e8ces de poissons y sont r\u00e9pertori\u00e9es et de nombreuses ethnies, aux us et coutumes tr\u00e8s sp\u00e9cifiques et li\u00e9es \u00e0 la for\u00eat, vivent \u00e9galement dans la r\u00e9serve. Au regard de ces valeurs multiples, l\u2019\u00e9cotourisme, l\u2019exploitation durable des PFNL et la p\u00eache sur la rivi\u00e8re Dja sont selon moi des opportunit\u00e9s \u00e9conomiques importantes \u00e0 essayer de d\u00e9velopper. Concernant les pressions, une importante menace r\u00e9side comme pour la plupart des AP de la sous-r\u00e9gion dans le braconnage commercial et le trafic de faune sauvage. En deux mois \u00e0 peine fin 2014, 226 pointes d\u2019ivoires en provenance de la r\u00e9serve ont \u00e9t\u00e9 saisies par les services de conservation. La d\u00e9forestation observ\u00e9e en p\u00e9riph\u00e9rie de l\u2019AP constitue \u00e9galement une menace directe et indirecte, certaines externalit\u00e9s n\u2019\u00e9tant pas g\u00e9r\u00e9es et se r\u00e9percutant sur la r\u00e9serve. Le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne s\u2019explique \u00e0 la fois par le d\u00e9veloppement de l\u2019exploitation foresti\u00e8re et mini\u00e8re, de l\u2019agro-industrie mais \u00e9galement d\u2019activit\u00e9s d\u2019orpaillage. La pollution et la prolif\u00e9ration de maladies constituent \u00e9galement des risques pour l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de la r\u00e9serve et pour les communaut\u00e9s vivant en p\u00e9riph\u00e9rie de celle-ci.

Un mot \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent sur la conservation de la nature en Afrique Centrale, de fa\u00e7on un peu plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Quelles sont selon vous les plus grandes menaces ? Quel constat tirez-vous en tant que responsable d\u2019une association active depuis maintenant presque 10 ans ? Je vous r\u00e9pondrais que les principales menaces qui p\u00e8sent sur notre plan\u00e8te en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale sont malheureusement d\u2019ordre anthropique. Que ce soit pour des besoins imm\u00e9diats en ressources naturelles, en espace, ou en raison des impacts indirects li\u00e9s au d\u00e9veloppement, nous, \u00eatres humains, exploitons et r\u00e9duisons de fa\u00e7on alarmante toutes les richesses que la nature nous offre. Au Congo, les communaut\u00e9s rurales vivent pourtant en \u00e9troite relation avec leur milieu naturel et d\u00e9pendent encore tr\u00e8s largement des ressources et des biens qu\u2019ils peuvent en tirer. La gestion durable de ces \u00e9cosyst\u00e8mes est donc un enjeu majeur pour leur avenir. Ce constat peut certainement \u00eatre g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019Afrique Centrale mais je ne connais pas les autres r\u00e9alit\u00e9s.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6aec5ff2-bed8-4f2d-b87a-2badb2cb039a": {"__data__": {"id_": "6aec5ff2-bed8-4f2d-b87a-2badb2cb039a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enjeux-de-conservation-et-societe-civile-africaine-paroles-dacteurs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enjeux de conservation et soci\u00e9t\u00e9 civile africaine : paroles d'acteurs = Conservation issues and African civil society : local players' view", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enjeux-de-conservation-et-societe-civile-africaine-paroles-dacteurs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "df9e25cc5a98a59930fb5a29301df3656bd66d3d6783b21792fb3c8012422c07"}, "2": {"node_id": "7b1de77b-565b-4dae-979e-9d75bf37dffc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enjeux-de-conservation-et-societe-civile-africaine-paroles-dacteurs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4e546bf0e46e267525def7b3f774ad4de07994568201e8e59c183f8d03f065f6"}}, "hash": "3666223f6b4c908f343b5ca4daab2c10f73513b0c9bddbb21ba557964a4514c8", "text": "Concernant le constat que je pourrais \u00e9tablir apr\u00e8s plus de 10 ans de travail dans la conservation, je dirais que mon exp\u00e9rience m\u2019a montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il est possible d\u2019agir localement de fa\u00e7on efficace, \u00e0 condition de prendre en compte tous les acteurs. S\u2019appuyer sur les traditions est \u00e9galement un atout tr\u00e8s important.

Nathalie BREHERET - RENATURA Directrice Face \u00e0 ce constat, quel r\u00f4le doit selon vous jouer la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 civile africaine pour contribuer \u00e0 la conservation de la biodiversit\u00e9 dans la sous-r\u00e9gion ? La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 civile doit \u00eatre un partenaire des Etats. Elle repr\u00e9sente les communaut\u00e9s avec lesquelles elle travaille mais joue \u00e9galement le r\u00f4le de relais pour faire comprendre le bien fond\u00e9 de certaines d\u00e9cisions \u00e9tatiques. Elle a pour r\u00f4le dans tous les cas, de d\u00e9fendre l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, selon moi. Les organisations locales ont par cons\u00e9quent besoin de soutiens cons\u00e9quents et nous voyons depuis un certain nombre d\u2019ann\u00e9es des programmes d\u2019appui \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 civile se d\u00e9velopper sur le continent. Qu\u2019attendez-vous de cela ? En effet, ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, plusieurs programmes d\u2019appui \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 civile ont vu le jour et ont su s\u2019adapter aux r\u00e9alit\u00e9s de la situation de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 civile sur le continent. Pendant longtemps, de nombreux bailleurs proposaient des financements avec de gros montants mais avec un niveau d\u2019exigence administrative ne permettant pas aux petites ONG locales de postuler. Le PPI-FFEM a par exemple \u00e9t\u00e9 une initiative louable. En permettant \u00e0 des associations de postuler \u00e0 des bourses qu\u2019elles devaient ensuite g\u00e9rer, ces derni\u00e8res ont pu d\u00e9velopper leurs comp\u00e9tences et renforcer leurs capacit\u00e9s. L\u2019accompagnement de l\u2019\u00e9quipe de l\u2019UICN a ainsi contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 renforcer ces structures qui peuvent ensuite envisager postuler sur d\u2019autres fonds plus importants. C\u2019est ce qui est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 RENATURA. Le volet de renforcement des capacit\u00e9s mis en place va dans ce sens et je ne peux que f\u00e9liciter cette initiative.

Pour conclure, parlez nous un peu plus de cet Ecocentre \u00e0 Pointe Noire... Pointe-Noire est une ville d\u2019un million d\u2019habitants manquant cruellement d\u2019espaces verts et de lieux o\u00f9 le citadin renoue avec son environnement. Un \u00e9cocentre est un espace d\u00e9di\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019environnement qui ne remplace en rien des lieux publics bois\u00e9s mais a pour objectif d\u2019offrir un centre de ressource sur ces th\u00e9matiques. Cet \u00e9cocentre regroupera toutes les techniques innovantes en mati\u00e8re de construction \u00e9cologique, il sera ainsi une sorte de vitrine des techniques de constructions \u00e9conomiques en \u00e9nergie et ayant un impact environnemental le plus faible possible (r\u00e9cup\u00e9ration des eaux de pluies, a\u00e9ration naturelles, etc). Il renfermera nos bureaux et un espace d\u2019accueil pour nos volontaires ou stagiaires et notre volont\u00e9 est qu\u2019il soit un lieu d\u2019accueil du public. Une exposition sur les tortues marines y est pr\u00e9vue ainsi qu\u2019un espace pour des expositions temporaires et pour recevoir d\u2019autres membres la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 civile de Pointe-Noire. Nous sommes convaincus des bienfaits de la synergie entre acteurs et offrir un centre de ressources pour d\u2019autres ONG permettra de renforcer les capacit\u00e9s de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 civile locale, nous esp\u00e9rons \u00e9galement que ces rencontres seront sources de nouvelles initiatives. Comme vous le voyez, ce projet est ambitieux et a finalement plusieurs objectifs. C\u2019est un aboutissement qui apportera une v\u00e9ritable assise \u00e0 notre structure. Jos\u00e9 . pouvez-vous nous dire, en tant qu\u2019administrateur , de l\u2019association SOS Dassioko bas\u00e9e \u00e0 Abidjan, quelques mots sur votre organisation ?

Jose M.P. GOMEZ - SOS DASSIOKO Administrateur Les tortues marines \u00e9tant des esp\u00e8ces tr\u00e8s mobiles, des actions \u00e0 plus large \u00e9chelle, impliquant des acteurs de diverses r\u00e9gions semblent n\u00e9cessaires. Quelle est votre opinion sur la question, quels types d\u2019action pourraient \u00eatre men\u00e9s entre acteurs travaillant sur la conservation de cette esp\u00e8ce en Afrique ? Un des moyens possibles pour rendre efficaces les actions men\u00e9es pour la conservation des tortues marines est selon moi le partage d\u2019exp\u00e9riences. Malheureusement, nous, acteurs locaux de la conservation, notamment dans les pays du Sud, n\u2019avons souvent pas les moyens pour prendre part aux rencontres d\u00e9di\u00e9es \u00e0 cette th\u00e9matique, \u00e0 l\u2019exemple du symposium international sur les tortues marines se tenant tous les 2 ans. Il faudrait par cons\u00e9quent soutenir cela. Par ailleurs, je pr\u00e9coniserais \u00e9galement la mise en place d\u2019un r\u00e9seau qui ferait le lien entre tous les projets li\u00e9s \u00e0 la conservation des tortues dans une m\u00eame r\u00e9gion. Cela semble d\u00e9j\u00e0 bien fonctionner en Am\u00e9rique Centrale avec le r\u00e9seau WIDECAST (Wider Caribbean Sea Turtle Conservation Network). En Afrique Centrale, ce type de r\u00e9seau semble \u00e9galement se mettre en place progressivement. En revanche, les tentatives de mise en place d\u2019un tel r\u00e9seau sont encore rest\u00e9es tr\u00e8s timides en Afrique de l\u2019Ouest. Ce genre d\u2019initiatives devra \u00eatre encourag\u00e9. Des appuis, sur de plus longues dur\u00e9es, et/ou des montants plus cons\u00e9quents sont attendus de nos partenaires techniques et financiers. Dans le m\u00eame temps, je pense que c\u2019est \u00e9galement aux acteurs de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 civile travaillant dans la conservation de rechercher des synergies d\u2019actions pour construire des projets plus ambitieux.

Contacts: Phone : +233 302 222417 E-maill : ghana@arocha.org Website : www.arocha.org/ghana Ghana Lake Bosumtwi Jacqueline ..A ROCHA Ghana already experienced creation of CREMAs as an initiative , to promote better management of natural resources by local communities. Could you briefly explain us how a CREMA does work and why to encourage such an approach ? CREMA is an acronym standing for Community Resource Management Areas. Physically, CREMAs represents a geographically delineated area, where one or more communities have come together to manage resources in a sustainable manner. Institutionally, it is a community-based organization that is built on existing community decision making structures, with an executive body and a constitution that guides the activities and regulations of the CREMA. A District Assembly by-law legitimizes the constitution. From a community perspective, it is a structure that enables collective decision making for \u2018common\u2019 resources. The incentive in the approach is both f inancial and tenurial as communities are able to sell wild products in the market as well as control access to the area by outsiders. Since the inception of the CREMA approach, initiatives have showed clear improvement in the way communities interact and manage natural resources in their communal lands.

Lake Bosumtwi in the South East of Kumasi seems important for your organization as you are developing activities in order to preserve that site. Could you tell us why that lake is so particular... Lake Bosumtwi is very important because as a meteorite lake, it is one of its kind in Ghana and West Africa. Furthermore, it has a unique flora and fauna biodiversity with a combination of a forest and a wetland ecosystem. With 11 known fish species, the lake has a high degree of endemism mainly among the Cichlids. Unfortunately, the lake seems threatened: can you tell us a word about those threats... Fringed by 26 communities, about 11.800 people depend directly and indirectly on the lake for their livelihood. Key threats include; weakening traditional resource management systems, unsustainable land use, mismanagement of waste disposal, lack of alternative livelihoods and particularly inadequate local level capacity and participation for resource monitoring and protection. This has resulted in increased anthropogenic threats such as habitat destruction, fishing, farming, infrastructural development and high rate of pollution which has contributed to a drastic reduction in the water level. How do you plan to overcome the destructive activities the lake is facing... ? A Rocha Ghana\u2019s strategy is collaborative action with the communities. Planned activities include creation of a Community Resource Management Area (CREMA) with legal frameworks for sustainable land utilization, capacity building and equipment of volunteers groups for long term biodiversity monitoring and organization of public awareness campaigns in all 26 communities and schools. Communities will also be provided with waste bins for a better waste disposal management and beneficiary community members set up in small scale enterprises, just to name a few. Jacqueline KUMADOH - A ROCHA GHANA Fundraiser/Scientific Officer A Rocha Ghana is also embarked in a lobbying action for the preservation of Atewa Range Forest Reserve. Can you tell us a bit more on the reasons of your initiative ? Atewa Range Forest Reserve is the only remaining upland evergreen forest in Ghana that can still boast of retaining some semblance of its pristine nature. Ecologically and socially, this forest provides exceptional ecosystem functions and services and cultural value. A lot of research has found Atewa Range Forest to be the home of an unprecedented record number of spectacular plants and animals with high endemicity. The reserve is also a rich source of Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFP). Deservedly, Atewa Range Forest Reserve has received several designations not limited to; forest reserve (1926), Special Biological Protection Area (1994), Hill Sanctuary (1995), Globally Significant Biodiversity Area (GSBA) (1999) and an Important Bird Area (IBA)(2001). In 2007, a Rapid Assess- ment conducted by Conservation International (CI) confirmed Atewa as an extremely important site for global biodiversity conservation. Geologically, the range has also been identified to have high deposits of bauxite, of significant commercial value and which has been on the extractive plans of governments past and present. These functions and services and the legal protection status notwithstanding, Atewa forest is critically threatened by illegal chainsaw activities, artisanal mining, and unsustainable NTFP collection. Atewa also faces great pressure from plans by governments to mine the site for its bauxite deposits. A Rocha Ghana in collaboration with the Coalition of NGOs Against Mining in Atewa (CONAMA) is petitioning the Government of Ghana to raise the protection status to a National Park to halt and address the above mentioned threats in the future. What do you plan as actions to sustain the preservation of that forest on the short to middle terms ? A Rocha Ghana\u2019s Atewa Critical Conservation Action Programme seeks to draw global awareness to the threats and pressures facing Atewa, garner public support and consensus for the conservation of the natural heritage of Atewa, and initiate livelihood support programs that will contribute to sustainable economic activities focused on green enterprises and forest-based employment opportunities within the catchment of Atewa. The program will also explore the potential for payment for ecosystem services (PES), learning good models of such approaches in other countries. Additionally, A Rocha Ghana will work to provide the government with sufficient information and ideas to make informed and conservation-oriented decisions regarding this range.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "264218ab-07fc-4f68-9585-538f2ed1a167": {"__data__": {"id_": "264218ab-07fc-4f68-9585-538f2ed1a167", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enjeux-de-conservation-et-societe-civile-africaine-paroles-dacteurs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enjeux de conservation et soci\u00e9t\u00e9 civile africaine : paroles d'acteurs = Conservation issues and African civil society : local players' view", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enjeux-de-conservation-et-societe-civile-africaine-paroles-dacteurs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "89df50b2c688ebccdc9f1744f0025c6344e70056dbc41dbb6bbdb46fda474ac8"}, "2": {"node_id": "1146542e-97bf-4afa-90a3-e2a7e0c02c02", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enjeux-de-conservation-et-societe-civile-africaine-paroles-dacteurs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "32b6609da6a0d0d7e9616580942b068075e50d365f61a0bb827ef8cb3bd9ab59"}}, "hash": "ee37e50779e71222970ef56f0480d1539d55824361183a60027ada8f5fc4154f", "text": "A Rocha is currently undertaking an Economic Valuation of the Ecosystem Functions and Services that Atewa provides, to match the economic valuation of the commercial mining of Atewa Forest.

Can you describe the NCRC orientations and activities related to CREMAs development and strengthening ? NCRC endorses a simple core philosophy that conservation is best pursued in settings where there are economic and cultural incentives to its implementation. In line with this philosophy, NCRC seeks to use positive cultural practices and income generation potential to achieve conservation and economic development objectives. The underlying philosophy of CREMA and our conservation initiatives is that when natural resources are given value and communities are given the authority to manage them, then local people inhabitants of surrounding areas will have the incentive to sustainably manage and conserve natural resources. We also note that natural resource utilisation is a legitimate form of land use; hence the objective should be to reconcile resource exploitation with urgent need for conservation. In my efforts to implement CREMA framework hence, I have first and foremost identified the motivating incentives that will draw communities into conservation and secondly figured out how the CREMA operation can be aligned with the societal power structure and social dynamics. Hence socioeconomic opportunities are identified and the communities are rallied around sustainable using and managing of these opportunities. CREMA organization relies on individual farmers, resource users and landowners who are the members. Through the Community Resource Management Committees (CRMCs) individual farmers and land users determine the policies and activities of the CREMA and hold the Community Executive Committee (CEC) accountable through their own structure at the community level. The CECs are responsible for formulating and amending the constitution to ensure the effective operation of the CREMA. A third party which in this case is NCRC is akin to a referee in this matrix. NCRC collaborates as a technical support arm to the CREMA. We facilitate the building of governance and livelihood structures for CREMAs. We work through the CREMA representatives to create opportunities and consensus. This continuous involvement is a key issue to ensure sustainability of CREMAs. The Wechiau Community Hippo Sanctuary (WCHS) is one of the pioneers community-based management protected areas in Ghana. Can you tell us the context and main reasons that led to its creation ? The Wechiau Community Hippo Sanctuary (WCHS) CREMA established in 1998 by the Paramount chief of the Wechiau Traditional Area, Na Bayon Doguah II, with the sub chiefs elders and opinion leaders, with a functional management board, comprising an executive board and two representatives from each of the seventeen (17) communities making up the sanctuary management. Prior to the decision to collectively conserve the area, there had emerged potential threats to the hippo and natural resources from poaching, bushfires and land encroachment by farmlands. The main goal for the establishment of the sanctuary was to afford the local community members the opportunity to participate in the conservation of their natural resources and also improve their standard of living through the equitable sharing of benefits accruing from the sanctuary as a result of a collective conservation effort. This approach also avoided the \u201coutside\u201d control of community resources and put resources management in the hands of local communities. The WCHS was convinced that if the local communities come together with the support of techni- cal know-how, then they can protect their landscape and resources while ensuring that the full benefits come to the local communities. The administrative costs of managing forest and landscape is relatively low since most workers are largely volunteers and get satisfaction from managing their own resources for livelihoods and future generations. WCHS is a practical example of the local community based approach to conservation. It has for the past twelve years become a model for community conservation in Ghana. The WCHS has served as a community based ecotourism destination and has been managed along an adaptive model to achieve sustained results. Martin YELIBORA - NCRC Project coordinator CREMAs After 15 years of existence of the WCHS, what are the main benefits in term of conservation and livelihoods ? The greatest success achieved by the CREMAs is improved governance and conservation awareness and increased collective community action and unity. These have resulted in reduced incidence of fire in particular. This phenomenon has also contributed to a number of benefits including ecologically sensitive areas being well protected to the extent that native wild animals are increasing and hippo numbers in particular have been seen to increase from a peak 13 in December 2007 to peak 33 in February 2014. Other successes are livelihood benefits such as ecotourism and social infrastructure development.

Other successes are the livelihood benefits that some of the CREMA constituents are entitled include the beekeeping enterprises introduced in late 2014. This enterprise has enormous potential to benefit over 1,500 households when in full operation. Among the various actors involved in the CREMA process, what is the specific role of traditional chiefs in the management and decision making process of CREMAs in Ghana ? In terms of approach, the CREMA framework mobilises local people into an organizational structure that is based on the existing local decision making system. This organization is then blended with democratic virtues in other to ensure inclusion. The CREMA recognises and respects local governance systems, cultures and resources tenure relationships such as land tenure and decision making on land-use; functions and duties of chiefs in respect of traditional roles like - allocation of land to \u201cstrangers \u201cor peripheral stakeholders; settlement of land disputes by traditional authority (chiefs and elders); pouring of libation and the pacification of the land when sacrilege has been committed; taking appropriate sanctions against trespassers and for anti-social behaviour\u2026 Traditional chiefs are the custodians of the land. They therefore are powerful stakeholders and without their support the CREMA will not operate smoothly. Traditional authority serves as advisors and patrons to the CREMA. They assist to mobilize the community for CREMA activities and mediate conflicts that arise in the CREMA operation.

Il faut noter d\u2019abord que la vie des ONG tient par la qualit\u00e9 de leurs ressources humaines et leurs dispositions \u00e0 consentir des sacrifices pour le d\u00e9veloppement de nos communaut\u00e9s. En ce sens, je dirai que le renforcement des capacit\u00e9s pour une ONG, c\u2019est d\u2019abord l\u2019am\u00e9lioration de la connaissance de ses ressources humaines. Ensuite vient l\u2019appui structurel qui consiste \u00e0 accompagner l\u2019ONG sur le plan de l\u2019organisation et du fonctionnement en la dotant d\u2019outils de gestion efficaces, de mat\u00e9riel et de ressources financi\u00e8res pour r\u00e9pondre aux sollicitations de d\u00e9veloppement des communaut\u00e9s. En un mot, c\u2019est appuyer l\u2019ONG \u00e0 \u00eatre professionnelle, efficace, capable de d\u00e9velopper des partenariats et de mener des actions concr\u00e8tes sur le terrain.

Y\u2019a-t-il d\u00e9j\u00e0 des retomb\u00e9es significatives en termes de pr\u00e9servation des ressources naturelles et d\u2019am\u00e9lioration des conditions de vie des populations ?

Sur le premier plan, nos actions de sensibilisation ont permis de toucher plus de 32.400 personnes (dont un tiers de femmes) dans les cinq communes de la zone girafe. Des formations et des voyages d\u2019\u00e9tude dans les pays voisins ont \u00e9t\u00e9 organis\u00e9s au profit des \u00e9lus municipaux sur les th\u00e9matiques de gestion des ressources naturelles, du foncier, des dispositions du code rural et de l\u2019\u00e9cotourisme. Ces actions de sensibilisation, de formation des communaut\u00e9s villageoises et des \u00e9lus locaux ont eu un impact certain sur le changement de comportement de ces derniers vis-\u00e0-vis de la conservation des ressources naturelles. Les nombreuses sessions de concertation engag\u00e9es entre des acteurs dont les int\u00e9r\u00eats divergent ont permis de s\u2019entendre sur des r\u00e8gles de gestion rationnelle et durable des ressources naturelles. Ces r\u00e8gles qui, pour l\u2019essentiel, sont issues des textes et lois nationaux, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 act\u00e9es par la signature, sous l\u2019\u00e9gide de la commune, de conventions locales d\u2019utilisation durable des ressources naturelles dans les cinq communes concern\u00e9es. Elles sont appliqu\u00e9es par des commissions fonci\u00e8res de base (COFOB), qui constituent de v\u00e9ritables outils de partage du pouvoir de d\u00e9cision et de gestion des ressources naturelles. Depuis l\u2019adoption des conventions locales et la mise en place de COFOB dans 24 villages, on a remarqu\u00e9 une diminution significative des actes frauduleux d\u2019exploitation de bois vert.

La corruption est \u00e9galement un probl\u00e8me majeur qui influe les aspects relatifs \u00e0 la conservation, notamment en autorisant des actions \u201cill\u00e9gales\u201d et dommageables \u00e0 l\u2019environnement. De plus, des valeurs ancestrales favorables \u00e0 la conservation sont en train de disparaitre, notamment en raison de l\u2019adoption de comportements dits \u201cmodernes\u201d, plus individualistes.

L\u2019IFEPAD \u0153uvre initialement dans le d\u00e9veloppement et la promotion des droits des femmes mais certains probl\u00e8mes auxquels font face celles-ci sont expliqu\u00e9s par les perturbations observ\u00e9es dans des milieux en raison de la pression anthropique. A titre d\u2019exemple, la diminution de la production agropastorale suite aux perturbations environnementales affecte les activit\u00e9s des femmes, celles-ci s\u2019occupant de l\u2019agriculture et de l\u2019\u00e9levage. Ainsi, dans le territoire de Kalehe, on observe ces derniers temps de longues p\u00e9riodes de saison s\u00e8che et une saison pluvieuse relativement al\u00e9atoire, provoquant la destruction des champs et des herbes servant \u00e0 nourrir le b\u00e9tail.

Les pressions anthropiques constituent la menace principale pesant sur sa biodiversit\u00e9, notamment via le braconnage et la coupe du bois. Ces activit\u00e9s provoquent la disparition de certaines esp\u00e8ces animales et la destruction des habitats.

Le contexte dans lequel vous intervenez est particuli\u00e8rement complexe. Qu\u2019en est-il sur le terrain ? Quelle menace additionnelle cette instabilit\u00e9 fait-elle peser le PNKB ? Nous intervenons en effet dans un contexte difficile, notamment en raison des pressions qu\u2019exercent les conflits arm\u00e9s entre FDLR, Ma\u00ef-Ma\u00ef et Ra\u00efa Mutomboki. Des groupes arm\u00e9s violents se cachent dans le PNKB et y puisent une grande partie de leurs ressources. D\u2019autre part, une partie du parc est depuis longtemps envahie par la population autochtone et l\u2019\u00e9tat congolais et ses partenaires ne sont toujours pas parvenus \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre ce probl\u00e8me li\u00e9 \u00e0 des raisons historiques.

Que retenez-vous de la mise en \u0153uvre de ce projet, d\u00e9sormais termin\u00e9 ? Le projet s\u2019est r\u00e9alis\u00e9 dans un contexte de tr\u00e8s fortes pressions sur le PNKB et a \u00e9t\u00e9 accueilli par les communaut\u00e9s locales comme un bon instrument pouvant potentiellement r\u00e9duire ces activit\u00e9s dommageables.

Cette collaboration a permis aux communaut\u00e9s locales d\u2019avoir un espace o\u00f9 se procurer du bois au lieu d\u2019aller couper les arbres dans l\u2019AP. Le plus grand d\u00e9fi pour le reboisement est l\u2019absence de terrains \u00e9tatiques pour accueillir les germoirs et plantations. Le recours aux propri\u00e9taires priv\u00e9s reste donc la solution interm\u00e9diaire.

L\u2019activit\u00e9 se heurte au probl\u00e8me de manque de boucs pour accoupler les femelles distribu\u00e9s en raison des pillages de b\u00e9tail ayant eu lieu dans presque tous les villages. Le projet n\u2019ayant pas pr\u00e9vu la distribution de boucs, ceci reste un d\u00e9fi. Pour le petit commerce, les subventions accord\u00e9es aux femmes ont permis d\u2019augmenter leur capital et de pratiquer la vente des produits autre que la viande de brousse. Le plus grand d\u00e9fi est que parmi les femmes vendeuses de viande de brousse existent des \u00e9pouses de militaires prot\u00e9g\u00e9es par leurs maris.

Quelles sont-elles et quelles en sont les raisons ? Le PNVi subit des pressions relativement \u00ab classiques \u00bb pour une AP africaine o\u00f9 la densit\u00e9 d\u00e9mographique atteint parfois 400 habitants par km\u00b2 en p\u00e9riph\u00e9rie. Nous assistons ainsi \u00e0 la pratique d\u2019activit\u00e9s anthropiques \u00e0 fort impact telles que la carbonisation, la d\u00e9forestation li\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019agriculture itin\u00e9rante sur br\u00fblis, le braconnage. L\u2019envahissement des terres par des populations en conflits avec les services de conservation, notamment pour des raisons historiques et sur des aspects fonciers, est \u00e9galement probl\u00e9matique. Ce n\u2019est h\u00e9las pas tout. La RDC fait partie des pays africains o\u00f9 les droits des populations locales et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 des AP sont menac\u00e9s par les industries extractives. Ainsi, depuis maintenant deux ans, le lac Edouard, \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur m\u00eame du PNVi, est directement vis\u00e9 par des activit\u00e9s d\u2019exploration p\u00e9troli\u00e8re men\u00e9es par la compagnie p\u00e9troli\u00e8re SOCO.

Selon moi, nous devons viser la durabilit\u00e9 \u00e9cologique, \u00e9conomique et sociale. En bref le d\u00e9veloppement durable\u2026 Dans notre contexte, cela sous-entend travailler prioritairement sur l\u2019am\u00e9lioration de la gouvernance, notamment via l\u2019appui \u00e0 l\u2019application des lois, la lutte contre l\u2019impunit\u00e9 et la promotion des activit\u00e9s communautaires.

Il faut tout faire pour parvenir \u00e0 cr\u00e9er un mod\u00e8le o\u00f9 le PNVi devient moteur d\u2019un d\u00e9veloppement durable et inclusif et o\u00f9 l\u2019existence m\u00eame du parc n\u2019est plus ressentie comme une contrainte par les communaut\u00e9s locales, mais bien comme une opportunit\u00e9 extraordinaire.

Face \u00e0 ces enjeux syst\u00e9miques, il m\u2019a sembl\u00e9 difficile d\u2019envisager changer les choses par une approche individuelle, isol\u00e9e et j\u2019ai souhait\u00e9 aider \u00e0 mobiliser toutes les \u00e9nergies positives au sein d\u2019un cadre structurant, expliquant ma volont\u00e9 de m\u2019impliquer dans la cr\u00e9ation du R\u00e9seau CREF en collaboration avec d\u2019autres acteurs.

Pouvez-vous nous dire quelques mots sur les enjeux actuels de conservation du PNOK et les acteurs impliqu\u00e9s dans ce processus ? Le PNOK est un parc de savane soudano-guin\u00e9enne \u00e0 l\u2019histoire mouvement\u00e9e. Son extension d\u00e9mesur\u00e9e dans les ann\u00e9es 1970 s\u2019est accompagn\u00e9e de l\u2019expulsion des populations vivant dans la zone allou\u00e9e \u00e0 la conservation. L\u2019\u00e9poque faste, durant laquelle l\u2019aire prot\u00e9g\u00e9e \u00e9tait encore consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme l\u2019un des plus beaux parcs d\u2019Afrique de l\u2019Ouest, ne durera que jusqu\u2019au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 90, p\u00e9riode \u00e0 laquelle le PNOK et sa zone p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique seront progressivement d\u00e9truits lors des troubles sociopolitiques que le pays a connu. A l\u2019\u00e9poque, les populations expuls\u00e9es reprirent ce qu\u2019elles consid\u00e9raient comme leur appartenant et r\u00e9investirent le parc. Les cons\u00e9quences de ce ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne furent d\u00e9sas- treuses et se manifest\u00e8rent par un accroissement de la pression sur les espaces forestiers prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, notamment pour l\u2019agriculture, le d\u00e9veloppement et l\u2019exten- sion des superficies destin\u00e9es \u00e0 la monoculture de rente (coton), le braconnage des esp\u00e8ces, la disparition des formes traditionnelles d\u2019exploitation des terres, l\u2019accroissement des conflits li\u00e9s \u00e0 la transhumance, la destruction des infrastructures et la perte progressive du potentiel touristique de la zone. Combin\u00e9 \u00e0 cela, le PNOK souffre d\u2019une gestion d\u00e9faillante due notamment \u00e0 l\u2019insuffisance du personnel forestier et son manque de comp\u00e9tences. Il faut \u00e9galement souligner l\u2019absence d\u2019implication et de responsabilisation des populations locales dans la gestion des ressources du parc, ces derni\u00e8res concevant toujours la gestion et la conservation des ressources naturelles de leur terroir rel\u00e8ve comme relevant de l\u2019administration centrale; ce qui n\u2019est plus le cas au regard de la d\u00e9centralisation pr\u00e9vue par la loi togolaise. Les instruments politiques et l\u00e9gislatifs devant faciliter la mise en \u0153uvre des diff\u00e9rents projets sur le terrain sont \u00e0 ce jour faiblement appliqu\u00e9s et certains doivent \u00eatre actualis\u00e9s et compl\u00e9t\u00e9s, en particulier l\u2019application des politiques de d\u00e9centralisation au niveau local.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "893b4191-ee1e-4ed5-9592-3c45deb1173e": {"__data__": {"id_": "893b4191-ee1e-4ed5-9592-3c45deb1173e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enjeux-de-conservation-et-societe-civile-africaine-paroles-dacteurs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enjeux de conservation et soci\u00e9t\u00e9 civile africaine : paroles d'acteurs = Conservation issues and African civil society : local players' view", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enjeux-de-conservation-et-societe-civile-africaine-paroles-dacteurs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7f69c6ed99edb40a11a5c5552331c0b80ebb8467dce1f3d61ea65e17f68d1edb"}, "2": {"node_id": "d3578ed7-f62a-435d-9d74-b391a8925fb3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enjeux-de-conservation-et-societe-civile-africaine-paroles-dacteurs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4395119143f9cfb3abb2027a83663c504384315d29e2e618e5ba60af6e119829"}}, "hash": "63105eb2204f24d15ef4e2da9ec8ea06f8a67ff6fdd6d215415eddee7ab762de", "text": "Globalement le manque de concertation entre les acteurs \u00e9tatiques et les utilisateurs locaux des ressources naturelles, l\u2019inefficacit\u00e9 des m\u00e9canismes d\u2019implication des populations locales, l\u2019application arbitraire de mesures de gestion \u201ctop down\u201d conduisent \u00e0 l\u2019heure actuelle \u00e0 de m\u00e9diocres r\u00e9sultats en mati\u00e8re de gestion des aires prot\u00e9g\u00e9es togolaises et de conservation du patrimoine que ces espaces contiennent.

This process involved a team of experts representing the following organizations: Shark Advocates International, the Shark Trust, TRAFFIC, Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), and World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) International. The co-chairs of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Shark Specialist Group served as technical advisors and contributors to the planning process. This document presents a summary of the global priorities for shark and ray conservation that have been identified through this collaborative process. Fundamental elements of the strategy include: improvements in governance frameworks and regimes for shark and ray conservation; data collection and scientific investigation to further the understanding of sharks and rays and the pressures on their populations; development and deployment of tools to strengthen technical capacity; and fostering increased commitment, including political will and financial investment, across multiple sectors. The NGOs that have partnered to develop the global shark and ray conservation strategy are committed to its implementation, through a Global Sharks and Rays Initiative (GSRI). However, it is clear that such an ambitious effort involves a much broader range of private and public sector organizations, agencies, and institutions.

There is much to learn from the chondrichthyans about how complex life has evolved and adapted to changing conditions on Earth over many millennia. Sharks and rays are irreplaceable components of the world\u2019s biodiversity and perform vital ecological roles. They also have significant economic and cultural values in many societies. However, these animals are at great risk; a recent analysis by the IUCN Shark Specialist Group3 estimated that 24% of chondrichthyan species are likely threatened with extinction. This high rate of risk, caused primarily by overfishing, distinguishes this group of fishes as among the most threatened of the world\u2019s vertebrate groups.

This Global Strategy aims to end this overexploitation and build the foundation for a global transformation in the conservation outlook for these species. vision: Sharks and rays throughout the world are fulfilling their ecological roles, sustaining well-managed fisheries, and are valued by all for their critical contribution to ecosystem health and human well-being. goal: By 2025, the conservation status of the world\u2019s sharks and rays has improved \u2013 declines have been halted, extinctions have been prevented, and commitments to their conservation have increased globally.

A global expansion of shark and ray fishing has been underway for several decades, as populations of more favored food fish have been depleted and/or become subject to more stringent fisheries restrictions. While other factors, particularly habitat loss, also play a part, the primary cause of declining shark and ray populations is quite simply the fact that they are being fished at rates that exceed their capacity to replenish. Sharks and rays typically grow slowly, mature late, and produce few young. These life history traits render them particularly vulnerable to overfishing and slow to recover from depletion. As a result, whole families of shark and ray species are today threatened with extinction. Indeed, reported global landings of sharks and rays peaked in 2003 and have since dropped by approximately 20%, most likely due to declining populations5. Of the 1,038 species of sharks and rays currently assessed for the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species6, 181 are listed in one of the three threatened categories, including 20 species classified as Critically Endangered, another 127 are categorized as Near Threatened. A full 45% (472 species) are classified as Data Deficient, and many newly discovered species have not yet been assessed. Overall, less than 25% of sharks and rays are assessed as of Least Concern, meaning that the great majority of these species are in need of conservation attention. Furthermore, the conservation status of rays (including skates, sawfishes, and guitarfishes) is worse than that of sharks, but they are generally afforded less attention than their better-known, and more charismatic, relatives. This Global Strategy explicitly addresses the need for concerted action for the rays as well as the sharks.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b77e588-5fc5-45f7-b1fa-b1bd9d4f3c2b": {"__data__": {"id_": "7b77e588-5fc5-45f7-b1fa-b1bd9d4f3c2b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-priorities-conserving-sharks-and-rays-2015-2025-strategy", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global priorities for conserving sharks and rays : a 2015-2025 strategy", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-priorities-conserving-sharks-and-rays-2015-2025-strategy", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dcbd56744710db384adb465d9c1446be5533d1bf53c0a98e6098009d1cc71060"}, "2": {"node_id": "d9173210-36e8-49d7-88c6-6be0aa750ade", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-priorities-conserving-sharks-and-rays-2015-2025-strategy", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e6b912efe479906b583cc70aba5825470699379e72177984e465168b629b56bf"}}, "hash": "2e303d433ca3292938996479ed3d32f4bf4537c4cf7a702e1742197f62440c8d", "text": "This Global Strategy explicitly addresses the need for concerted action for the rays as well as the sharks. 5 FAo (2014), davidson et al.

The large number of sharks and rays classified as Data Deficient highlights the fundamental need for focused research on these species and the threats that they face. 8 Threats Since less is known about sharks and rays than many other vertebrate groups, and because it offers a basis for prioritizing actions to conserve these species, the IUCN Red List assessment process is crucial to conservation efforts. As the world\u2019s most authoritative list of threatened species, it provides the foundation for setting priorities, informing implementation of conservation efforts, and galvanizing interest around the plight of the world\u2019s sharks and rays. It is therefore vital that Red List assessments are continually updated to include newly discovered species, report changes in species\u2019 conservation status, and allow the impact of interventions undertaken as part of this Global Strategy to be monitored and evaluated. As implementation of the strategy progresses, actions will adapt to new knowledge or changing circumstances reflected through this \u201cliving\u201d list. Inadequate governance of fisheries at national and international levels poses a particular challenge to the conservation of sharks and rays. Many species migrate across national boundaries, often into international waters, and are landed in multiple fisheries that vary significantly in scale and control. Meanwhile, the international trade in shark and ray products involves numerous centers of demand and complex flows between and within countries, regions, and continents. These challenges are exacerbated by institutional gaps, including: insufficient data on the biology, population status, and threats to different species in different regions; and inadequate funds, technical capacity, and political will to properly monitor, manage, and control shark and ray fisheries and trade. Conservation efforts for these species have been fragmented, dispersed, and under-resourced. This Global Strategy aims to mitigate these challenges under a comprehensive and unifying framework for collective action. Sharks and rays face a precarious future \u2013 with serious consequences for marine and freshwater ecosystems and the human communities and economies that depend on them. Based on substantial expertise from key disciplines, this holistic Global Strategy represents an unprecedented, coordinated initiative to brighten that future. 7 A total of 1,038 shark and ray species have been assessed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as of november 2015, but this includes eight lC or dd deepwater epipelagic sharks which do not fit within a single habitat type designation. Although these eight species are currently eluding fisheries and other anthropogenic impacts, the status of all chondrichthyans will be monitored as part of the ongoing Red list assessment process, and any changes in status will be addressed through adaptive implementation of the Global Strategy.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "957ef185-58a2-4bb8-8b93-4f746e4523be": {"__data__": {"id_": "957ef185-58a2-4bb8-8b93-4f746e4523be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-priorities-conserving-sharks-and-rays-2015-2025-strategy", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global priorities for conserving sharks and rays : a 2015-2025 strategy", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-priorities-conserving-sharks-and-rays-2015-2025-strategy", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2bffb00a6611f5a4c841c5be2d47608e811dd7cf9354a44963a570e44df2f7a3"}, "2": {"node_id": "bc2a6b34-ea96-4d41-897e-9026de9512ce", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-priorities-conserving-sharks-and-rays-2015-2025-strategy", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "45154e75c89e10edbbc9092d6fec81aea5af8144f2f622f7582c9f34a39f654d"}}, "hash": "c958b22479ecfeeeae4456e1318eb69e599681edb2776e51b6124761952773e0", "text": "hAMMeRheAd eMbRyoS, APex PRedAtoRS PRoGRAM/neFSC/noAA. conservation Status by habitat Type (Total no. of species = 1,0307) Iucn Red List Status (2015) ThReATeneD CR EN VU NT DD LC Coastal Continental (494) 16 28 83 75 188 104 Pelagic (39) 0 3 15 12 4 5 Deepwater (465) 1 7 17 39 258 143 Freshwater (32) 3 7 1 1 18 2 ToTAL (1,030) 20 45 116 127 468 254 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species Status CR=Critically Endangered; EN=Endangered; VU=Vulnerable; NT=Near Threatened; DD=Data Deficient, and LC=Least Concern) Adapted from dulvy et al.

Opportunity The 2013 listing of seven commercially exploited species of sharks and rays on cITeS (the convention on International Trade in endangered Species of Wild fauna and flora) Appendix II8 was the latest in a series of international policy milestones which together create an opportunity to turn the tide towards major conservation improvements. The policy milestones include: \u2022\ufffd the\ufffd1994\ufffdCITES\ufffdResolution\ufffdon\ufffdthe\ufffdStatus\ufffdof\ufffd International Trade in Shark Species; \u2022\ufffd the\ufffd1999\ufffdFAO\ufffd(United\ufffdNations\ufffdFood\ufffdand\ufffdAgriculture\ufffd Organization) IPOA-Sharks (International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks); and \u2022\ufffd the\ufffd2010\ufffdCMS\ufffd(Convention\ufffdon\ufffdthe\ufffdConservation\ufffdof\ufffd Migratory Species of Wild Animals) Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks. Momentum for change was also boosted by numerous national efforts and ground-breaking measures adopted by Regional Fishery Bodies (RFBs), including Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs). These advances were in direct response to the growing recognition of the threats to sharks and rays and \u2013 bolstered by awareness-raising campaigns and new governmental conservation commitments \u2013 constitute a promising enabling environment in which to launch a Global Strategy. While only 17 species of sharks and rays are currently listed on the CITES Appendices9, these listings have great potential to advance efforts to transition the international trade in all shark and ray products towards sustainability. The effective implementation of CITES is ultimately the responsibility of individual countries, but many of the 181 CITES Parties have not yet put in place the necessary laws, regulations, and procedures to achieve this for the listed sharks and rays. To accelerate implementation, and seize the CITES opportunity, significant investment is needed to empower governments to meet their national and international commitments to the shark and ray species under their jurisdiction. Whereas CITES is predominantly focused on trade, the FAO IPOA-Sharks provides important guidance for more comprehensive shark and ray fisheries management, and lays out a clear process for countries to develop their own management regimes and regularly revised National Plans of Action (NPOAs). Progress on this voluntary international instrument has been exceptionally slow, with few countries producing a comprehensive plan; indeed, despite IPOA-Sharks\u2019 recognition of the urgent need for action, 15 years after its adoption only 9% of the global live weight shark and ray catch is taken by countries that have produced an adequate NPOA10. In many cases, this is due to a lack of expertise and capacity, illustrating the huge challenge faced in transforming international commitments into action. There is currently an unprecedented window of opportunity to transform the conservation of the world\u2019s sharks and rays, supported by increased public and government interest in these species. This Global Strategy capitalizes on these heightened levels of support to drive fisheries policy reform, establish effective trade controls, build technical and other capacities, and facilitate the engagement of more stakeholders in shark and ray conservation.

For example, very different approaches in promoting responsible consumption are likely to be successful in countries where traceable and certified seafood are available, accepted and affordable, compared with those in countries where they are not. The order in which the four strategies and selected activities are presented here does not reflect any chronological or priority ranking. Prioritization of interventions will take place on an ongoing basis, to respond to the realities of the political environment and changes in capacity, to build on successes, and to take advantage of new opportunities and address challenges as they arise.

MARkET FIShERIES TRADE SOURCE 12 A global effort to conserve sharks and rays must include not only actions to prevent extinctions of the most threatened species, but also investigation of the status and conservation needs of poorly known species, and ongoing progress made in conserving all species. The Saving Species Strategy sets priority species based on: IUCN Red List of Threatened Species11 conservation status; population trends; and evolutionary distinctiveness. Geographic priorities are based on: species richness; threat; levels of endemism12; and likelihood of conservation success. Analysis of related criteria reveals several particularly important countries, regions and territories. Urgent interventions are needed to prevent the extinction of threatened endemic coastal shark and ray species, including the Critically Endangered Brazilian guitarfish (Rhinobatos horkelii) and ornate sleeper ray (Electrolux addisoni) and the Endangered angular angel shark (Squatina punctata), and to conserve the most threatened families of sharks and rays. Securing the future of these species requires active interventions in several \u201chotspot\u201d countries, regions and territories: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, Japan, Madagascar, Mozambique, South Africa, Uruguay and Taiwan. Because many more wide-ranging species also rely on these \u201chotspots,\u201d interventions carried out in these locations are likely to benefit numerous other threatened species.
