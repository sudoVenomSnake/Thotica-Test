Some of these data may need to be digitised for use in a geographic information system (GIS). 2.3.3 Identify the existing/potential sites where each potential trigger species may occur in significant numbers. One possible approach is to develop a species/site table (e.g., Table 2.3) by overlaying site boundaries on spatial data for each species in a GIS. Boundaries of existing sites (e.g., existing KBAs, other sites of importance for biodiversity, protected or conserved areas) can be overlaid on species\u2019 spatial data to develop a list of existing sites where each potential trigger species is known to occur (e.g., based on recent well documented locality data or validated AOO maps), or inferred or projected to occur (e.g., based on ESH or range). (See the WDKBA, Plantlife IPA Database, Ramsar Sites Information Service, and the Protected Planet Database for GIS data on existing sites.) Table 2.3 Example of a species/site table used to identify sites that might qualify under Criterion A1. Additional columns could be added to identify sites under other criteria (e.g., restricted-range for B2, ecoregion- or bioregion-restricted for B3, forms an aggregation at the site for D1). The information in a species/site table can be updated as more information becomes available, with information on the proportion of the Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 20 global population size held at a site replacing initial notes on known or inferred/projected occurrence.

These boundaries may need to be refined later to yield practical KBA boundaries (see Section 7.3). KBA Proposers should review the Justification, Geographic Range and Population sections of IUCN Red List for listed species, as well as available spatial data on range, ESH, AOO and localities for all proposed trigger species to ensure that KBA proposals are consistent with this information. For many species, available data will be limited to range and/or localities. Sites proposed as KBAs for a species must fall within the species\u2019 range (at least partially) and/or include at least one locality (see also Section 9.2.3 on confirmation of presence and reproductive units). If there are recent known localities that fall outside the mapped range, the range should be updated before proceeding (see Sections 3.1 and 3.5). Note that old records are excluded from known localities and may fall outside the current range if the species has been extirpated from the area. If ESH or AOO maps are also available, KBA Proposers should also check that proposed sites fall within the mapped ESH or AOO (at least partially) for proposed trigger species. For some species and regions, available spatial data may substantially overestimate the area occupied by a species, leading to many false occurrences. In this context, it is Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 21 recommended that KBA Proposers work with local experts to review the list or table of existing/potential sites to confirm likely occurrences before proceeding further. Species lists for existing sites may also be useful, but note that species lists are often partial and biased towards charismatic species that are easy to identify and may include vagrants. 2.4 Applying Criterion A1 to identify KBAs for threatened species 2.4.1 Identify globally threatened species that may trigger Criterion A1.

Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 22 IUCN Red List Criteria that have not been updated may trigger KBA Criterion A1, but it is strongly recommended that such species are reassessed prior to KBA identification to confirm that they fall into the same categories under the current criteria and update population and distribution information. Similarly, if an IUCN Red List assessment is flagged as \u201cneeds updating\u201d, it is strongly recommended that all efforts are made to update the IUCN Red List assessment prior to KBA identification. KBA NCGs and KBA Proposers are encouraged to develop a list of assessments that need updating early in the KBA identification process. They may then ask the KBA Secretariat (through their RFP) to request that the IUCN SSC Red List Authorities update assessments for these species. Can species assessed as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) or Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct in the Wild) trigger a KBA? For species listed as CR(PE) or CR(PEW), only the site at which the species is most likely to occur (if it still exists) can trigger KBA Criterion A1 under subcriterion A1e. For many species listed as CR(PE) or CR(PEW), this corresponds to the locality of the last recorded population. There is no reproductive-units threshold for Criterion A1e. Can species assessed as Extinct in the Wild (EW) trigger a KBA? Sites that hold populations of species listed on the IUCN Red List as EW that are in the process of reintroduction within their natural range may trigger KBA Criterion A1a, c, or e, as appropriate. Reintroduction efforts should either be underway at the time of the KBA assessment or planned to take place within the next two years. The site will be flagged as \u201crestoration dependent\u201d in the WDKBA until the reintroduced population has produced viable offspring at the site and at least five years have passed since reintroduction (see Section 2.2.4). 2.4.2 Check the relevant subcriterion and population-size threshold for each potential trigger species given its threat category. For each species that can trigger Criterion A1, the relevant subcriterion and threshold depends on its category on the IUCN Red List (e.g., CR, EN, VU). A site qualifies as a KBA under Criterion A1 because it regularly holds one or more of the following: a) \u22650.5% of the global population size AND \u22655 reproductive units of a CR or EN species; b) \u22651% of the global population size AND \u226510 reproductive units of a VU species; Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b98de090-723d-4828-a9d2-4e7095e31592": {"__data__": {"id_": "b98de090-723d-4828-a9d2-4e7095e31592", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c37989f3092cbd578f01c852ed6f56995627eb58a2d3f3c9dc0b43d27c8d6cb2"}, "2": {"node_id": "d5a52315-bfdd-4d9c-b5bf-d0da08a50b3c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f7f907d551b25770e7b9ef0bb93a150dc0ba7229c9c30add43b0e3eabbc0794e"}}, "hash": "ac0ebfbc56933b07fed098f4fa025d27a7d65b0b8dca971918ddb19893ba5592", "text": "1.1 23 c) \u22650.1% of the global population size AND \u22655 reproductive units of a species assessed as CR or EN due only to population size reduction in the past or present (as indicated by the IUCN Red List assessment); d) \u22650.2% of the global population size AND \u226510 reproductive units of a species assessed as VU due only to population size reduction in the past or present (as indicated by the IUCN Red List assessment); e) Effectively the entire global population size of a CR or EN species.

When are subcriteria A1c and A1d applicable? KBA subcriteria A1a and A1b are intended for general applicability across all globally threatened species; whereas subcriteria A1c and A1d are intended for limited application to species that have experienced, or are currently experiencing, rapid decline in population size. Thus, KBA subcriteria A1c and A1d apply only to species listed as globally threatened under Criterion A (population size reduction) only. The species must have already experienced or be experiencing this rapid decline, so KBA subcriteria A1c and A1d apply only to species listed under IUCN Red List subcriteria A1, A2, and/or A4 (population size reduction including the past). Species listed only under IUCN Red List subcriterion A3 (population size reduction in the future only) cannot serve as trigger species for KBA subcriteria A1c and A1d. For example:. \u2022 KBA subcriterion A1c would apply to a species listed only as CR A2, but not to a species listed as CR A2; C2; D. \u2022 KBA subcriterion A1c would apply to a species listed as CR A2+A3+A4, but not to a species listed only as CR A3. These guidelines are based on the current IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (Ver. 3.1; IUCN 2012a); KBA subcriteria A1c and A1d cannot be applied to species assessed against earlier versions of the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria. What is meant by \u201ceffectively the entire global population size\u201d in KBA subcriterion A1e? A site is considered to hold \u201ceffectively\u201d the entire global population size of a CR or EN species if it holds more than 95% of the global population size. This is the threshold used in identifying AZE sites (Ricketts et al. 2005). The entire global population size Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 24 refers to the population in the wild, not including individuals in captivity. (Please see Section 2.2.3 for application to migratory species.) 2.4.3 For each potential trigger species, identify assessment parameters for which reliable global and local level data are available, and estimate these parameters at the global and site level for all sites where the species may meet the relevant threshold. For each potential trigger species, review the available data at global and local levels and decide which assessment parameters to use, then estimate global and site-level values for those parameters. For Criterion A1, the proportion of the global population size at a site can be observed or inferred through any of the following: (i) number of mature individuals, (ii) area of occupancy, (iii) extent of suitable habitat, (iv) range, (v) number of localities, (vi) distinct genetic diversity. See Section 3.1 for guidelines on selecting among assessment parameters. 2.4.4 Assess whether each potential trigger species meets the relevant population- size threshold at each existing/potential site. For each globally threatened species, KBA Proposers should calculate the proportion of the global population size that regularly occurs at each site based on the estimated global and site-level values for each assessment parameter, and then compare that to the relevant population-size threshold for the species given its threat category. This calculation will be checked in the WDKBA when it is fully functional. 2.4.5 Confirm the presence of each potential trigger species that meets the relevant population-size threshold at each proposed site. The final step in assessing a site against KBA Criterion A1 is to confirm the presence of each potential trigger species at the site by reviewing recent data, requesting information from local biodiversity knowledge-holders or conducting new field surveys if necessary. For subcriteria A1a-d, the species must be regularly present in numbers that meet or exceed the relevant reproductive-units threshold (see Section 3.3). The reproductive- units thresholds are an intrinsic component of the A1 thresholds and are intended to ensure that trigger species occur at sites in sufficient numbers to reproduce and maintain the population at the site beyond the current generation.

See the KBA Proposal Process guidance for required and recommended documentation for Criterion A1. 2.5 Applying Criterion B1 to identify KBAs for individual geographically restricted species 2.5.1 Identify species that may trigger Criterion B1. Any species whose population or distribution is so concentrated that 10% or more of the global population size regularly falls within a site can trigger a KBA under B1. How are geographically restricted species identified for the purposes of applying KBA Criterion B1? For the purpose of identifying KBAs under Criterion B1, any species is considered geographically restricted if it meets the threshold for B1, regardless of whether the species is identified as restricted-range (as per Criterion B2) or restricted to an ecoregion or bioregion (as per Criterion B3), and regardless of whether it is globally threatened. Some species with broad global distributions have many individuals concentrated in just a few areas within their range limits and may therefore trigger Criterion B1. Any species whose population or distribution is so concentrated in certain places that \u226510% of the global population size regularly occurs in a single site may trigger a KBA under Criterion B1. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 26 Can migratory species trigger Criterion B1? The KBA Standard states that \u201cthe regular occurrence of all life stages of a species at a site distinguishes Criterion B1 from Criterion D1\u201d (IUCN 2016, p. 18). Here, the KBA Guidelines clarify that Criterion B1 may apply to resident or migratory species as long as at least 10% of the global population size and at least 10 reproductive units of the species regularly occur at the site. Some sites may qualify as KBAs under B1 and D1 for the same species, provided that the aggregation definition for D1 is met. Criterion B1 should be applied separately to each spatially segregated life-cycle process. For example, a migratory species may be geographically restricted in its breeding range, but not in its non-breeding range, or vice versa. (See Appendix III for details on how range is assessed for migratory species.) In contrast, Criterion D1 is intended to apply to highly mobile species (e.g., migratory or nomadic species) that aggregate at particular sites at high densities (see Section 2.8). 2.5.2 The B1 threshold is 10% and 10 reproductive units for all species. A site qualifies as a KBA under Criterion B1 because it regularly holds \u226510% of the global population size AND \u226510 reproductive units of a species. 2.5.3 For each species, identify assessment parameters for which reliable global and local level data are available, and estimate these parameters at the global and site level where the species may meet the 10% threshold. For each potential trigger species, review the available data at global and local levels and decide which assessment parameters to use, then estimate global and site-level values for those parameters. For Criterion B1, the proportion of the global population size at a site can be observed or inferred through any of the following: (i) number of mature individuals, (ii) area of occupancy, (iii) extent of suitable habitat, (iv) range, (v) number of localities, (vi) distinct genetic diversity.

See the KBA Proposal Process guidance for required and recommended documentation for Criterion B1. 2.6 Applying Criterion B2 to identify KBAs for co-occurring geographically restricted species 2.6.1 For each taxonomic group, identify restricted-range species that may trigger Criterion B2. The first step in applying Criterion B2 is to identify the appropriate taxonomic group for applying this criterion. A list of standard taxonomic groups for applying Criteria B2 and B3 is provided on the KBA website. The second step is to identify the restricted-range species for each taxonomic group that occur in the country or region of interest. A list of all species that have been assessed for the IUCN Red List that qualify as restricted-range3 is provided on the 3 The 10,000 km2 default threshold will be used for any taxonomic group that has not yet been comprehensively assessed. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 28 KBA website. For other species, KBA Proposers are encouraged to review the guidelines below and consult with their RFP before proceeding with site assessments. Site analysis should be conducted separately for each taxonomic group. Geographically restricted species from different taxonomic groups cannot be combined to meet Criterion B2. (For example, if 1 bird species and 1 reptile species qualify as potential B2 trigger species at a site, they cannot be combined to trigger a KBA under Criterion B2. However, a site can qualify as a KBA under Criterion B2 for both birds and reptiles, if 2 bird species and 2 reptile species qualify as B2 trigger species at the site.) How is the appropriate taxonomic group for applying Criterion B2 determined? Criterion B2 may be based on any taxonomic group above species (IUCN 2016, p. 19). Most taxonomic groups in the standard list of taxonomic groups for applying Criteria B2 and B3 have 10,000-50,000 species. Working at lower taxonomic levels would generally make it less likely that 2 or more potential trigger species would co-occur at the same site, as required by the species threshold for Criterion B2. How are restricted-range species identified for the purposes of applying KBA Criterion B2? For the purpose of identifying KBAs under Criterion B2, the KBA Standard defines restricted-range species as either species with a global range size less than or equal to 10,000 km2 or the 25% of species in the taxonomic group with the smallest ranges up to a maximum of 50,000 km2. (Please see Appendix I for the full definition.) Can KBA Criterion B2 be applied to migratory species? In the case of migratory species, Criterion B2 may be applied separately to each spatially segregated life-cycle process. For example, a migratory species that is restricted-range in its breeding range, but not in its non-breeding range, could only trigger KBAs under Criterion B2 in its breeding range; whereas a migratory species that is restricted-range in its breeding and non-breeding range could trigger KBAs under Criterion B2 in both its breeding range and non-breeding range. (See Appendix III for details on how range is assessed for migratory species.) 2.6.2 For each taxonomic group, check the relevant species threshold; the population-size threshold is 1% for all species. A site qualifies as a KBA under Criterion B2 because it regularly holds \u22651% of the global population size of each of a number of restricted-range species in a taxonomic group, determined as either \u22652 species OR 0.02% of the global number of species in Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 29 the taxonomic group, whichever is larger.

See Section 3.1 for guidelines on selecting among assessment parameters. 2.6.4 Assess whether each potential trigger species meets the relevant population- size threshold at each existing/potential site.

If the number is less than 15,000, then the species threshold is 2 restricted-range species (species thresholds are rounded down). If the number is greater or equal to 15,000, then the species threshold is 0.02% of the global number of species in the taxonomic group (e.g., a taxonomic group containing 15,000-19,999 species would require 3 restricted-range species in the taxonomic group to co-occur at the site).

The final step in assessing a site against KBA Criterion B2 is to confirm the presence of each potential trigger species at the site by reviewing recent data, interviewing biodiversity knowledge-holders, or conducting new field surveys. How can species presence be confirmed at a site for Criterion B2 given that there is no reproductive-units threshold? While there is no explicit reproductive-units threshold for Criterion B2, numbers and densities of mature individuals should be sufficient to support reproduction at sites within the breeding range. KBA Proposers must confirm the presence of potential trigger species at the site and are asked to report this in terms of reproductive units (see Section 3.3), where this information is readily available (using the 10 reproductive units threshold for Criterion B1, for example). This is especially important for threatened species, which may meet the population threshold despite very low numbers of mature individuals.

For taxonomic groups that do not have a representative sample mapped globally using a consistent methodology, the default is subcriterion B3a if ecoregion-restricted species can be identified, or subcriterion B3c otherwise. Subcriterion B3c was developed to enable identification of geographically restricted assemblages without reference to ecoregions or bioregions. For several taxonomic 5 Currently Amphibia (B3a), Aves (B3b), Chondrichthyes (B3b), Mammalia (B3b), Myxini (B3b), Sarcoptergyii (B3b). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 32 groups, including many plants, fungi, invertebrates and fishes, adequate sampling data are available to identify areas of high relative density or abundance for some species while the range outside these areas is poorly defined. Given such data limitations, it will often be impossible to apply B3a or B3b to these taxonomic groups because it is a requirement of B3a and B3b that the number of species within a taxonomic group restricted to a particular ecoregion/bioregion is known. KBA NCGs and KBA Proposers are advised to consult with their RFP before applying subcriterion B3c. Is it possible to apply different subcriteria to the same taxonomic group in different regions? For each taxonomic group, B3c should only be applied where it is not possible to apply B3a or B3b because the number of species restricted to a particular ecoregion or bioregion cannot be estimated. Thus, it is possible to apply B3a and B3c or B3b and B3c to the same taxonomic group in different regions, depending on the level of knowledge. Note, however, that B3c applies to a species\u2019 entire range (not its range within a specific ecoregion or bioregion) and the most important occupied habitat must be assessed across all regions. In contrast, it is not possible to apply B3a and B3b to the same taxonomic group in different regions because B3a is applicable to taxonomic groups with global median range size <25,000km2, while B3b is applicable to taxonomic groups with global median range size \u226525,000 km2 (IUCN 2016, p. 19). How are ecoregion-restricted assemblages identified under subcriterion B3a? The KBA Standard defines ecoregions as: A \u201crelatively large unit of land (or water) containing a distinct assemblage of natural communities and species with boundaries that approximate the original extent of natural communities prior to major land-use change\u201d (Olson et al. 2001). For relevant taxonomic groups that have been comprehensively assessed, the KBA Secretariat will generate a preliminary list of ecoregion-restricted species by overlaying ecoregion templates (Appendix V) on range maps (from the IUCN Red List). Each preliminary list of ecoregion-restricted species will be subject to expert review followed by periodic review thereafter. Following expert review, lists of ecoregion-restricted species will be provided on the KBA website. KBA NCGs and KBA Proposers interested in developing a list of ecoregion-restricted species for other taxonomic groups are asked to contact their RFP first to avoid Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 33 duplication of effort.

Can KBA Criterion B3 be applied to migratory species? In the case of migratory species, Criterion B3 may be applied separately to each spatially segregated life-cycle process. For example, a migratory species may be ecoregion- or bioregion-restricted in its breeding range, but not in its non-breeding range, in which case it can only trigger a KBA under Criterion B3 in its breeding range. (See Appendix III for details on how range is assessed for migratory species.) Can geographically restricted assemblages be identified across ecoregion or bioregion boundaries under B3a or B3b? Criterion B3 applies to individual ecoregions or bioregions. Geographically restricted assemblages cannot be combined across ecoregion or bioregion boundaries to meet the thresholds (see also Section 2.6.1). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 34 How are geographically restricted assemblages identified under subcriterion B3c? Sites qualifying under Criterion B3 hold geographically concentrated assemblages of species within a taxonomic group, but the component species do not need to be geographically restricted, unlike B3a and B3b. Data on the relative density or relative abundance of mature individuals are needed at many localities encompassing most of the species\u2019 known range, along with the expectation that unsampled areas are unlikely to hold relatively high densities. For each taxonomic group assessed against subcriterion B3c in a region, the first step in identifying geographically restricted assemblages is to identify species within the taxonomic group that have been surveyed using systematic and quantitative methods at numerous localities across most of their known range, including all suspected high-density areas. 2.7.2 For each taxonomic group, check the relevant species threshold and the population-size threshold. A site qualifies as a KBA under Criterion B3 because it regularly holds one or more of the following (IUCN 2016, p. 19, with minor edits for clarification): a) \u22650.5% of the global population size of each of a number of ecoregion-restricted species within a taxonomic group, determined as either \u22655 species OR 10% of the species restricted to the ecoregion, whichever is larger; b) \u22655 reproductive units of \u22655 bioregion-restricted species OR \u22655 reproductive units of 30% of the bioregion-restricted species known from the country, whichever is larger, within a taxonomic group; c) Part of the globally most important 5% of occupied habitat for each of \u22655 species within a taxonomic group. Subcriterion B3a: For each combination of ecoregion and taxonomic group that has been comprehensively assessed for the IUCN Red List or previously assessed for Criterion B3a, the number of ecoregion-restricted species will be provided on the KBA website, together with the number of ecoregion-restricted species that must co-occur at a site to trigger a KBA under Criterion B3a. For other taxonomic groups, KBA Proposers should estimate the number of species restricted to the ecoregion. Note that an exact number may not be required. If the number is less than 60, then the threshold is simply 5 ecoregion-restricted species. Conversely, if the number is greater than or equal to 60 then the species threshold is 10% of the number of species restricted to the ecoregion. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 35 Subcriterion B3b: For each combination of bioregion and taxonomic group, KBA Proposers should estimate the number of species within the taxonomic group that are both restricted to the bioregion and known from the country (i.e. the number known from the country is per bioregion not for a combination of bioregions). Note that an exact number may not be required. If the number is less than 20, then the threshold is simply 5 bioregion- restricted species.

See Section 3.1 for guidelines on selecting among assessment parameters. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 36 Subcriterion B3b: For each proposed site, first assess whether the threshold number of bioregion- restricted species co-occurs at the site. For subcriterion B3b, the threshold is defined in terms of reproductive units (see Section 3.3). Note that the 5 reproductive units threshold applies regardless of whether the species threshold is 5 bioregion-restricted species or 30% of bioregion-restricted species known from the country. (This is a clarification of the text in the KBA Standard (IUCN 2016, p. 19).) Subcriterion B3c: Under subcriterion B3c, \u201cthe globally most important occupied habitat\u201d can be observed or inferred through the following: (i) density of mature individuals, (ii) relative abundance of mature individuals. Note that (i) may refer to relative densities as well as absolute densities. Subcriterion B3c is designed to identify sites that are disproportionately important within the set of sites where species within a taxonomic group are known to occur (e.g., sites with exceptionally high productivity). Subcriterion B3c does not target geographically restricted biodiversity \u2014 individual geographically restricted species and co-occurring geographically restricted species are the focus of Criteria B1 and B2 respectively. Analysis of relative densities or abundance should be based on a set of theoretical sites of similar size. Where possible, it is recommended that KBA Proposers use grid cells or polygons with a spatial resolution close to the average size of manageable units within the region of interest. Grid cells may be better suited to species with continuous distributions, especially in areas with few existing sites; whereas other polygons may be better suited to species with patchy distributions. If polygons vary in size, then relative densities should be used, rather than abundance. The grid or set of polygons should extend across most of the known ranges of each of the species in the analysis, including all suspected high density areas. For each species, relative density or abundance estimates should be available for a large number of cells or polygons (generally greater than 100) \u2014 species recorded at fewer than 20 cells or polygons should be excluded. The relative density or abundance of each species included in the analysis is tabulated for each cell or polygon. If sampling has been conducted at a finer resolution than the cells or polygons used in this analysis, then the average relative density or abundance should be estimated for Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 37 each cell or polygon. For highly mobile species, sampling data should be averaged over multiple sampling seasons. For each species, cells or polygons are ranked from the most important (i.e. highest relative density or abundance) to least important; ranks are then divided by the number of cells or polygons with the species present. For example, if a species occurs at 50 sites, the proportional ranking for the three most important sites is 1/50, 2/50, and 3/50 (i.e. 2%, 4%, 6%), and therefore the two most important sites are included in the most important 5% of habitat for the species. A cell-by-species or polygon-by-species matrix is thereby constructed with cells or polygons in the most important 5% of habitat for each species identified. For each cell or polygon, it is then possible to count the number of species for which the cell or polygon is in the most important 5% of habitat. The \u22655 species threshold is then applied to identify cells or polygons that could form the basis for delineating a KBA. 2.7.4 Assess whether each potential trigger species meets the relevant population- size threshold at each existing/potential site.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9713d772-85b6-4e5f-a171-ea1b704fbd3c": {"__data__": {"id_": "9713d772-85b6-4e5f-a171-ea1b704fbd3c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8c1661e41a32f67df746c55c0e3b94dafe647b0637725eb1c1332d3fc22a447f"}, "2": {"node_id": "340ffa8a-1e08-42a4-af0b-0963d4edb0d7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "09b0e76744593148c2548d2193e5bc92be30669d29af27d22770cca0c3d79d78"}}, "hash": "e72fd56fd3500f6d188b54b94ea7e91c9a8f721a1a194796e3f4c54f12b6e352", "text": "Subcriterion B3a: For each potential trigger species under subcriterion B3a, KBA Proposers should calculate the proportion of the global population size that regularly occurs at each site based on the estimated global and site-level values for each assessment parameter, and then compare that to the 0.5% population-size threshold for subcriterion B3a.

The final step in assessing a site against KBA Criterion B3 is to confirm the presence of each potential trigger species at the site by reviewing recent data, interviewing biodiversity knowledge-holders, or conducting new field surveys. For subcriterion B3b, the species must be regularly present in numbers that meet or exceed the relevant reproductive-units threshold (see Section 3.3). While there is no explicit reproductive-units threshold for subcriteria B3a and B3c, numbers and densities of mature individuals should be sufficient to support reproduction at sites within the breeding range. KBA Proposers are encouraged to confirm the presence of potential trigger species at the site in terms of reproductive units, where this information is readily available, using the 5 reproductive units threshold for Criterion B3b, for example. 2.7.6 Refine ecological boundaries, if necessary, to yield practical KBA boundaries. KBA delineation is not complete until ecological boundaries have been evaluated and refined, if necessary, to yield a manageable site or sites (see Section 7.3 for guidelines on delineation). 2.7.7 Compile required and recommended documentation under Criterion B3. See the KBA Proposal Process guidance for required and recommended documentation for Criterion B3. 2.8 Applying Criterion D1 to identify KBAs for demographic aggregations 2.8.1 Identify species that aggregate at specific sites and may trigger Criterion D1. Criterion D1 is triggered by demographic aggregations of species, typically occurring during a specific life-cycle process. When applying Criterion D1, KBA Proposers first need to confirm whether the population at the site represents a demographic aggregation. The trigger species must aggregate at the site \u2014 it is not sufficient that a species is recognized as congregratory and aggregates somewhere within its range. Many congregatory species aggregate for some life-cycle processes, but disperse widely for others. For example, many shorebird species (family Scolopacidae), aggregate for specific life-cycle processes (e.g., during migration or to over-winter) and are more Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 39 widely dispersed at lower densities during other seasons. Albatross and petrel species typically aggregate in breeding colonies, but many species disperse widely at sea, even though foraging aggregations may occur at specific oceanographic sites such as seamounts6. A few species, such as the Lesser Flamingo (Phoeniconaias minor), are aggregated through most or all of their life-cycles. Criterion D1 may be applied to species that aggregate for some or all of their life-cycle (IUCN 2016a, p. 22) if they form an aggregation at the site. Sites that support \u22651% of the global population size of a species but where the species is not aggregated do not qualify as KBAs under Criterion D1. For example, almost the entire global population of Kirtland\u2019s Warbler (Setophaga kirtlandii) breeds in a very limited area in north and central Michigan (USA), but does not aggregate to breed, so does not trigger D1. (It could, however, trigger KBAs under Criterion B1 for any site that regularly holds \u226510% of the global population size an \u226510 reproductive units.)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a77dd720-e004-48aa-bd4a-4ff4a27d5c37": {"__data__": {"id_": "a77dd720-e004-48aa-bd4a-4ff4a27d5c37", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a77e14f67592e37c1e1bc388fc9f57a8958efa95817ec375d5b5e3e6a7511328"}, "2": {"node_id": "5149b28b-d1c5-443f-8870-0d56614fa46e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1f556a964fe89a3f6f25734477aa9b1fc03b91a0f7c71a09ddd092c099390fde"}}, "hash": "2f44d596adefdd26e2c37ba118027f8f56c5903fd04b72ef6a6806f0c61b29ab", "text": "Information indicating that the species forms an aggregation at the site must be included in KBA proposals under Criterion D1.

For example, nearest- neighbour distances measured in body lengths have been used to describe aggregations in a wide range of species, including fish spawning aggregations, dolphin schools, waterbird feeding flocks, and herds of foraging ungulates. A characteristic of aggregations is that the concentration of a significant proportion of a species\u2019 global population size in space and time (i.e. at a specific location, either 6 Note that this differs from the comment in the KBA Standard that albatrosses and petrels remain aggregated throughout most or all of their life cycles as they move between sites (IUCN 2016a, p. 22). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 40 simultaneously or over a short period of time) increases the species\u2019 vulnerability to exploitation or other threats. In some cases, an aggregation occupies a relatively small area in a larger site because the aggregation moves unpredictably within a broader predictable space or because site delineation accommodates additional biodiversity elements or manageability considerations. Where this is the case, KBA Proposers are asked to note this in the KBA proposal. Can foraging areas for species that aggregate to breed qualify as KBAs under Criterion D1? Many congregatory species aggregate to breed, but disperse widely while foraging (e.g., some seabird and pinniped species). For such species, a site that holds a breeding colony or rookery of 1% or more of the global population size would be expected to meet the aggregation requirement and qualify under D1a. By extension, a site that includes a colony or rookery and associated marine area (perhaps encompassing an important staging or foraging area) would also be expected to meet the D1 aggregation requirement because it includes the colony or rookery as well as staging or foraging aggregation areas. For some species, a separate foraging area might meet the aggregation requirement in its own right \u2014 for example, the highly social Guanay Cormorant (Leucocarbo bougainvilliorum) forages in large dense foraging flocks, especially at locations where oceanographic processes predictably concentrate prey near the surface. A site that predictably holds dense foraging flocks would meet the aggregation requirement and qualify under D1a if the population-size threshold is also met. In contrast, a separate foraging area would not meet the D1 aggregation requirement if the species does not predictably form dense foraging flocks at the site, even if the species aggregates elsewhere in its range in the same season (e.g., many gadfly petrel species, genus Pterodroma). How are migratory stop-over or bottleneck sites identified? Along migration routes, KBAs should be identified at key stop-over or bottleneck sites, as stated in the KBA Standard (IUCN 2016a, p. 22), rather than over entire migration corridors. Distinguishing stop-over or bottleneck sites may be challenging, especially for species that do not fly. Individuals are expected to accumulate as the movement process slows, so stop-over and bottleneck sites may be distinguished using survey data by higher than average densities along a migration corridor. In animal tracking datasets, stop-over sites may be identified by a switch from fast directed movements to slower more tortuous movements. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 41 Can Criterion D1 be applied to resident species or populations? The KBA Standard states that \u201cCriterion D1 is not meant to identify sites that hold all key stages of a species\u2019 life-cycle; those sites may be triggered by criteria A1, B1, B2 or B3.\u201d Thus, Criterion D1 is not generally intended to apply to resident species or the resident components of partially migratory species, where they can be discerned, although it may be triggered by resident species that aggregate in specific areas within their range for specific life-cycle processes (e.g., at lekking areas or in spawning areas).

What is meant by \u201cpredictably holds\u201d? For Criterion D1, a site predictably holds a species if the species is known to have occurred at the site in at least two thirds of the years for which adequate data are available for the relevant season (e.g., the breeding season in the case of a breeding aggregation); the total number of years considered should not be fewer than three. For example, a site would qualify if a species occurs there at threshold numbers during the breeding season in 2 out of 3 years or 7 out of 10 years. This is consistent with the definition of \u201cregularly\u201d in the application of Ramsar Criteria 5 and 6 (Ramsar 2018). What is meant by life-history stage in the threshold for D1a? The term \u201clife-history stage\u201d here is intended to be synonymous with life-cycle process (e.g., breeding, feeding, migration) and does not refer to developmental stage (e.g., pup, juvenile, adult). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 42 What does \u201cover a season\u201d mean in the threshold for D1a? \u201cOver a season, and during one or more key stages of its life cycle\u201d refers to a specific period of the year when some or all members of a population predictably aggregate to perform some life-cycle process(es), such as breeding, moulting, or over-wintering. Under subcriterion D1a, the threshold population size may be met cumulatively \u201cover a season\u201d. This is especially relevant to stop-over or bottleneck sites along migration corridors \u2014 the threshold number of mature individuals may not occur at the site simultaneously; instead, the threshold may be met over a relatively short period of time during the migration season, in a relatively small space with individuals clustered together at highly localised relative abundance. When is subcriterion D1b applicable? Subcriterion D1b is only applicable if there are insufficient data to apply subcriterion D1a. For example, even if a site ranks among the largest 10 aggregations known for the species, it cannot qualify under Criterion D if it is known to hold <1% of the global population size of the species. Can subcriterion D1b be applied separately to aggregations for specific functions? The D1b threshold (i.e. the largest 10 aggregations known for the species) applies across all life-cycle processes rather than separately for specific processes (e.g., breeding or feeding). Thus, if a species forms aggregations at one time of year for breeding and aggregations at another time of year for feeding, only the ten largest aggregations across both seasons would qualify. 2.8.3 For D1, the only assessment parameter is number of mature individuals; estimate this parameter at the global and site level for all sites where the species may meet the relevant threshold. For Criterion D1, the proportion of the global population size at a site can be observed or inferred through the following: (i) number of mature individuals. Note that the proportion of the global population size predictably held at a site cannot be inferred using area-based parameters or localities under Criterion D1. For some species, however, numbers of individuals in large aggregations are extremely hard to estimate, but the densities of individuals in aggregations of the same type may be relatively consistent (e.g., some seabird species nest pecking-distance apart). In this case, the size (i.e. area or volume) of the aggregation may be used to infer whether a Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 43 site ranks among the largest 10 aggregations known for the species under Criterion D1b.

What is necessary to confirm seasonal presence at a site for Criterion D1 given that there are no reproductive-units thresholds? While there is no explicit reproductive-units threshold for Criterion D1, KBA Proposers are encouraged to confirm the presence of potential trigger species at the site in terms of reproductive units (see Section 3.3), where appropriate (using the 10 reproductive-units threshold for Criterion B1, for example).

For each potential trigger species under Criterion D2, KBA Proposers should calculate the proportion of the global population size that has occurred at each site during periods of environmental stress, based on the estimated global and site-level values for each assessment parameter, and then compare that to the 10% population-size threshold for Criterion D2.

Any species with these characteristics, including many plants, fungi, marine invertebrates and fishes, can trigger Criterion D3. Recruitment sources include sites where plants or fungi produce a large number of seeds or spores that have a high probability of dispersing, germinating, and surviving to maturity; sites where adults deposit a large number of eggs that have a high probability of producing larvae that survive to maturity; and nursery sites where large numbers of larvae settle and have a high probability of growing into juveniles that survive to maturity. Relevant information will most likely be found through a literature search and/or expert knowledge. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 46 2.10.2 The D3 threshold is 10% for all species. A site qualifies as a KBA under Criterion D3 because it predictably produces propagules, larvae, or juveniles that maintain \u226510% of the global population size of a species. 2.10.3 For D3, the only assessment parameter is number of mature individuals; estimate this parameter at the global and site level for all sites where the contribution to recruitment may meet the 10% threshold. For Criterion D3, the proportion of the global population size can be observed or inferred through the following: (i) number of mature individuals. A significant proportion of the global population size of a species may be produced at sites identified under Criterion D3 even though there may be only a few mature individuals at the site at any given time. Hence, the threshold is based on the global population size of mature individuals produced by the site, rather than the number of immature individuals within the site. KBA Proposers should estimate the global population size and the number of mature individuals that are produced by each proposed site. Note that the proportion of the global population size produced by a site cannot be inferred using area-based parameters or localities under D3. For Criterion D3, a site predictably produces propagules, larvae, or juveniles that maintain \u226510% of the global population size of a species if it produces them in at least two thirds of the recruitment cycles for which adequate data are available; the total number of recruitment cycles considered should not be fewer than three. How can the number of mature individuals produced by a site be estimated? Estimating the proportion of the global population size of mature individuals that is produced by a site will often be challenging. For most species, it is not feasible to tag or track propagules, larvae, or juveniles from recruitment to maturity. Exceptions may include anadromous fish species with high site-fidelity (e.g., salmon), or species that produce large juveniles (e.g., sharks and rays). For some species (e.g., corals), genetic markers have been used to identify recruitment sources. Recruitment models that include the transport or dispersal of propagules, larvae, or juveniles from recruitment sources to final settlement sites have also been developed for some species (e.g., fungi, plants, corals, benthic invertebrates), but are often complex and difficult to validate. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 47 Identification of recruitment sources may therefore be based on the simplifying assumption that survival from proposed recruitment source habitat to maturity is uniform, unless reliable data or models are available to quantify an alternative distribution. Hence, in most cases, it will be sufficient to estimate the relative density of propagules, larvae, juveniles and use this information to identify recruitment sources that produce \u226510% of propagules, larvae, or juveniles, under the assumption that these recruitment sources also produce \u226510% of mature individuals. This can be achieved through direct sampling throughout the range or, more likely, a combination of sampling and spatial density modelling (see Appendix III). 2.10.4 For each potential trigger species, assess whether the contribution to recruitment meets the 10% threshold at each existing/potential site. For each potential trigger species under Criterion D3, KBA Proposers should calculate the proportion of the global population size that is predictably produced by each site based on the estimated global and site-level values for each assessment parameter, and then compare that to the 10% population-size threshold for Criterion D3.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "02ecfbd6-70cb-4041-8ad7-d9fbe4e66947": {"__data__": {"id_": "02ecfbd6-70cb-4041-8ad7-d9fbe4e66947", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c41036ed8f422396b2f9501157edfbbde7b933fabb3e994c0da6f29e0f5c91e9"}, "2": {"node_id": "630785db-88fa-4560-ab56-1f317e43abb1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b63d28490873833b3be79df1357a18aae2f14463aec2b59ce0bc3d6dfefe56d1"}}, "hash": "736586f084da3570b3d5e28eb860f634e2f48c01ac04f144f7e8a3b73c74eb67", "text": "This calculation will be checked in the WDKBA when it is fully functional. 2.10.5 Confirm that each proposed site produces recruits in numbers consistent with the 10% threshold.

Assessment parameters for species-based criteria (A1, B1-3, D1-3 and E) 3.1 Selecting assessment parameters Which assessment parameters provide the best indication of the proportion of the global population size at a site? Under KBA Criteria A1, B1-2 and B3a, the proportion of the global population size at a site can be observed or inferred through any of the following: (i) number of mature individuals, (ii) area of occupancy, (iii) extent of suitable habitat, (iv) range, (v) number of localities, (vi) distinct genetic diversity (except for Criterion B3a). KBA NCGs and KBA Proposers are responsible for ensuring that KBA identification is based on the best available data for each species. The rest of this section provides an overview of what is meant by \u201cbest\u201d and \u201cavailable\u201d in this context. In brief, the \u201cbest\u201d parameter provides a measure of the proportion of the global population size at a site that is most appropriate to the ecology of the species; while an \u201cavailable\u201d parameter has already been estimated (or can be estimated) consistently at both global and site levels, is complete, recent, reliable and documented. (Distinct genetic diversity measures the proportion of genetic diversity rather than the proportion of global population size at a site and is excluded from this overview.) In principle, number of mature individuals provides the best (most direct) measure of the proportion of the global population size at a site (Fig. 3.1.1). However, in some species, the number of mature individuals fluctuates significantly among years or within seasons at the global and/or site scale. In that context, one or more of the area- based assessment parameters or localities (i.e. ii-iv) may provide a better (less direct but more stable) indicator of the proportion of the global population size regularly held by a site. However, area-based assessment parameters should be used cautiously, as species are generally unevenly distributed across their range, area of habitat or even occupancy. Estimating numbers of mature individuals should be prioritised for species that occur at highly variable densities within their range, ESH or AOO or very unevenly distributed among localities. Area-based assessment parameters and Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 49 localities should not be used for species with dynamic habitat and consequently distribution patterns that fluctuate significantly among years or within seasons, or for sites that are primarily used during migration or by nomadic populations. Species that exhibit significant fluctuations in both population size and distribution may depend primarily on conservation actions at the land-, water- or seascape scale rather than the site scale of KBAs. Figure 3.1.1 Selecting between number of mature individuals and area-based assessment parameters or localities An overview of area-based parameters and localities is provided in Section 3.4. As range is refined to ESH and then to AOO, the area covered generally decreases, leading to a better representation of the actual distribution of the species. Hence, AOO generally provides the best approximation of the proportion of a species\u2019 global population at a site, followed by ESH, then range or localities, except under the circumstances set out in Figure 3.1.2. When in doubt, KBA Proposers may choose to assess the proportion of species\u2019 global population at a site using several area-based parameters to develop multiple lines of evidence, although it is recognised that there will often be insufficient data to do this.

Using numbers of mature individuals from just a subset of known localities as a conservative estimate 7 Only populations considered \u201cwild\u201d should be included in estimates of assessment parameters (see Section 2.2.4). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 51 of the global population size would be equivalent to reducing the thresholds in the KBA Standard. Estimates of abundance and distribution are likely to become less accurate over time. Assessment parameters based on data collected more than 8-12 years before the assessment should be used cautiously and only if there is no information suggesting that there have been significant changes in global or site-level population size or distribution patterns (see also Section 9.2.1). How reliability is judged varies by parameter, but all assessment parameters should be based on a representative sampling strategy; methods for estimating the number of mature individuals need to be appropriate for the species; AOO and ESH should be validated (see Appendix III); range maps should follow the IUCN Red List Mapping Standards (see also Appendix III.1); and species identification and geographical coordinates need to be accurately recorded for localities. For documentation requirements, please see Section 3.1 for number of mature individuals and Sections 3.5-8 for area-based assessment parameters and localities. Selecting the best available assessment parameter will often be a matter of compromise; it is better to use an assessment parameter for which there are recent reliable estimates at both global and site levels than one for which the site estimate is recent and reliable and the global estimate is old or unreliable, or vice versa. KBA Proposers are asked to provide a brief explanation for their choice of best assessment parameter for each species from available options when submitting a KBA proposal. What happens if different assessment parameters point to different conclusions? Where different assessment parameters point to different conclusions, KBA Proposers should use the best available data and justify that choice. The better the data available on a population\u2019s distribution, the more likely it is that a site that actually qualifies as a KBA will meet the thresholds. What if assessment parameters derived from the IUCN Red List account need updating? For species that have been assessed for the IUCN Red List, estimates of the global number of mature individuals, range and AOO provided in the IUCN Red List account will be pre-filled in the WDKBA when it is fully functional. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 52 If any estimates of the global number of mature individuals, range or AOO provided in a species\u2019 IUCN Red List account need updating to support KBA identification, KBA Proposers should consult with their RFP who will liaise with the IUCN SSC Red List Unit. The IUCN Red List Unit will know which IUCN SSC Red List Authorities are responsible for overseeing assessments of the species and can determine whether the existing IUCN Red List assessment can be corrected or a reassessment is required. The best solution will be for the IUCN Red List account to be updated first, before the KBA proposal is submitted. If this is unlikely to happen within the next year, a new estimate of the global number of mature individuals, range or AOO may be used, but must be approved by the relevant IUCN SSC Red List Authorities before the KBA proposal is submitted. Documentation of this approval must be provided with the proposal. What if a relevant assessment parameter is not provided in the IUCN Red List account? KBA Proposers should also consult with their RFP who will liaise with the IUCN Red List Unit before submitting KBA proposals based on new estimates of global population size, range or AOO for species with an IUCN Red List account, even if there is no existing estimate in the account. In a few cases, a new parameter estimate will have implications for the current IUCN Red List status assessment. In such cases, IUCN SSC Red List Authority approval is encouraged but not required.

Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 53 3.2 Number of mature individuals (Criteria A1, B1-3, D1-3, E) For Criteria A1, B1-3, D1-3 and E the proportion of the global population size can be observed or inferred through any of the following: (i) number of mature individuals. Why focus on mature individuals? The global population size and population size at a site are both measured in terms of mature individuals because this can be measured more consistently across species than the total number of individuals, given the wide variation in life history strategies and life forms. Whenever number of mature individuals is used as the assessment parameter, the global and site-level population-size estimates submitted to the WDKBA must be provided in terms of mature individuals, even if the data used to construct these estimates were derived from a subset of mature individuals or some other index. This is the best way to ensure that population-size estimates for each species are consistent across the WDKBA and with the IUCN Red List. It also facilitates the review and confirmation process. How are mature individuals defined? The definition of mature individuals in the KBA Standard (IUCN 2016) is the same as the definition used by the IUCN Red List: \u201cThe number of individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction as defined in IUCN (2012a).\u201d For species that have been assessed for the IUCN Red List, KBA Proposers should use the definition of mature individuals in the IUCN Red List assessment. For species from taxonomic groups that have not yet been assessed for the IUCN Red List (or for which the above information is unavailable), KBA Proposers should follow the detailed guidance on defining mature individuals in the IUCN Red List Guidelines (IUCN SPC 2019). The guidance below is derived from the IUCN Red List Guidelines (IUCN SPC 2019, Section 4.3). When determining the number of mature individuals, the following points should be borne in mind: \u2022 \"Reproduction\" means production of offspring (not just mating or displaying other reproductive behaviour). \u2022 Mature individuals that will never produce new recruits should not be counted (e.g., densities are too low for fertilisation). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 54 \u2022 In the case of populations with biased adult or breeding sex ratios, it is appropriate to use lower estimates for the number of mature individuals, which take this into account. \u2022 Reproducing units within a clone should be counted as individuals, except where such units are unable to survive alone (e.g., corals). \u2022 In the case of taxa that naturally lose all or a subset of mature breeding individuals at some point in their life cycle, the estimate should be made at the appropriate time, when mature individuals are available for breeding. \u2022 Reintroduced populations must have produced viable offspring before they are included in counts of mature individuals (IUCN 2012a). What if the ratio of mature individuals to population counts varies spatially? For some species, the number of mature individuals may be estimated based on population counts or some other index that is easier to count reliably than mature individuals.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "91518b49-4d31-4fe8-943d-8f176009fbc8": {"__data__": {"id_": "91518b49-4d31-4fe8-943d-8f176009fbc8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "66f48562160e3045442d9cc3a70bbeca06d51a3b28c4acaf997f05e23e932b9e"}, "2": {"node_id": "ccadb76b-9dc9-42ec-ac19-f866d05987ef", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7e930153f0646d2f10778d6cc26308cba5909db0a272557248991a9530b13575"}}, "hash": "c77673189814cd5c6a6ad2dc764b152cd54b826302d0aac6bf82ce550b79975a", "text": "The proportion of all individuals at a site should provide a reasonable approximation of the proportion of mature individuals at a site if the mature/ immature ratio is similar at global and site levels.

In contrast, if the species distribution is characterised by spatial segregation of life stages (e.g., juveniles vs mature individuals) or the mature/ immature ratio is known to differ at global and site levels, then KBA Proposers should account for this information. Likewise, if the ratio of some other population index that is easier to count reliably (e.g., nests, pups, breeding pairs) to mature individuals is similar at global and site levels, then the relative value of the index at global and site levels should provide a reasonable approximation of the proportion of mature individuals at a site. For example, if the estimated global population size is 10,000 mature individuals, but approximately 25% of mature individuals skip breeding each year throughout the range (i.e. the annual breeding population size is 7,500 mature individuals or 3,750 breeding pairs), then a colony with more than 375 breeding pairs would meet the 10% threshold under Criterion B1. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 55 What if the sex ratio is imbalanced? If the sex ratio is imbalanced but similar at global and site levels, then KBA Proposers may use mature individuals of either or both sexes as the basis for estimating the proportion of the global population size at a site. However, if the sex ratio is imbalanced and known to differ at global and site levels, then KBA Proposers should focus on the limiting sex and use a ratio-based approach when estimating population size at both global and site levels. For species in which females bear and raise young, the limiting sex will generally be females, unless males are severely under-represented. For example, if females are the limiting sex for a species, breeding sites that regularly hold >10% of the global population size of mature females would qualify under Criterion B1, even if few mature males are present. Where can KBA Proposers find global population-size estimates for species that have been assessed for the IUCN Red List? For species that have been assessed on the IUCN Red List, KBA Proposers seeking to use mature individuals as an assessment parameter must use the global number of mature individuals in the IUCN Red List account, if provided, unless there are clear and compelling reasons for using a different estimate (see below). This estimate will be pre-filled in the WDKBA when it is fully functional. If no global estimate is pre- filled in the WDKBA, KBA Proposers should check the Justification and Population sections of the IUCN Red List account, as information may be provided there. For some species, the IUCN Red List account only provides a rough estimate of population size. In such cases, KBA Proposers may use a more precise population-size estimate, with supporting data, as long as that estimate is consistent with the IUCN Red List account and does not point to a change to the species\u2019 IUCN Red List category. (For example, if the IUCN Red List account provides an estimate of greater than 2,500 mature individuals, a KBA proposal based on a global population-size estimate of 3,000 mature individuals would be consistent with this, but not one based on 2,000 mature individuals.) Information on global population size is not available for all species assessed for the IUCN Red List. The following reasons for using a different estimate of global population size may be considered clear and compelling: i. The IUCN Red List account is flagged as \u201cneeds updating\u201d; ii. New data are available showing that the global population-size estimate has changed significantly since the most recent IUCN Red List assessment; Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 56 iii. The IUCN Red List account gives an estimate that it acknowledges is not the estimate of the total global population size but only partial and data now exist to estimate the global population size. The best solution in each case is for the IUCN Red List account to be updated first, before the KBA proposal is submitted. If this is unlikely to happen within the next year, a new global population-size estimate may be used, but must be approved by the relevant IUCN SSC Red List Authority before the KBA proposal is submitted (see Section 3.1).

Where can KBA Proposers find existing global population-size estimates for species that have not been assessed for the IUCN Red List? If an estimate of the global number of mature individuals has previously been confirmed for the species, this estimate will be pre-filled in the WDKBA when it is fully functional. In the meantime, KBA Proposers seeking to use mature individuals as an assessment parameter should check whether the species has already been confirmed as a trigger species in the WDKBA and use the same global estimate unless new data are available showing that this has changed significantly. If a global estimate of the number of mature individuals has not previously been confirmed for the species, possible sources of information on the global number of mature individuals include IUCN Red List Authorities, NatureServe Explorer, national authorities, and the scientific literature. How can KBA Proposers estimate the number of mature individuals at the global or site level? It is beyond the scope of the KBA Guidelines to provide detailed guidance on how to estimate the number of mature individuals at the global or site level, given the wide range of valid methods available. However, the following principles apply: i. For each species, the method used to determine the number of mature individuals should be scientifically valid and appropriate for the species (i.e. should be acceptable for publication in the peer-reviewed literature). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 57 ii. For some species, the number of mature individuals may be estimated based on some proxy that is easier to count reliably (e.g., nests, chicks, pups for some seabirds or seals). iii. In many cases, estimates of population size will be based on sampling, such as counts of the number of individuals in representative samples of the habitat (e.g., point counts, transects quadrats); estimates of the number of individuals in representative samples of the habitat using distance sampling (Buckland et al. 2001), individual mark-recapture (Amstrup et al. 2010), or other methods that account for imperfect detection; or methods based on indirect indicators of abundance, such as scat or footprint surveys (e.g., Jachmann 2012). iv. Methods that do not involve a count of the entire population size (at the global or site level) should take account of habitat suitability, where possible, rather than assume that densities are uniform across the site or AOO, ESH, or range. v. For each species, the method used to determine the number of mature individuals should be the same, or as consistent as possible, between the global and site levels (i.e. methods should not be expected to produce significantly different estimates for the same population (e.g., because one method accounts for imperfect detection and another does not)). For each species that has not been assessed for the IUCN Red List or for which the IUCN Red List account does not quantify mature individuals, information on how the global number of mature individuals was estimated should be documented in the KBA proposal. Should KBA Proposers use the lowest plausible estimate of the global population size as a precautionary approach? No. A precautionary approach is built into the thresholds provided in the KBA Standard. Using the lowest plausible estimate rather than the best estimate of the global population size would be equivalent to reducing the thresholds in the KBA Standard. (See also Section 9.3 on uncertainty.) What if the number of mature individuals at the global or site level is characterised by significant fluctuations or uncertainty? See Section 3.1 on selecting assessment parameters and Section 9.3 on uncertainty. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 58 3.3 Reproductive units (Criteria A1, B1, B3, E) Why are reproductive units included in the thresholds for some species-based criteria? Reproductive units are included in the thresholds for some species-based criteria because the intent of the KBA Standard is to identify sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity. KBA Proposers should therefore provide evidence that trigger species occur at sites in sufficient numbers to reproduce and maintain the population at the site beyond the current generation. The reproductive- units threshold is especially important where population size is inferred through area- based assessment parameters because it provides confirmation of the species\u2019 presence at the site and reduces the risk of including vagrant records.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a8a136b7-6428-4f40-b958-fb74794b53b6": {"__data__": {"id_": "a8a136b7-6428-4f40-b958-fb74794b53b6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7e6ec3afa437cba1f53e04dfe504f9ca67670db9d572f6ca28c91e912bb0c056"}, "2": {"node_id": "a62fb3bd-7187-4c17-b8dc-1230326cbab9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "182ff802498fd9965fffb8452f9779a742fe301c1ca8cb1ccd227cc6d8224b89"}}, "hash": "1208a37ebe166c4e86a64d394292131066a7cd5dfb66f75421c7d71629d5f66b", "text": "While some species-based criteria do not require an assessment of the number of reproductive units (e.g., Criteria B2, B3a, B3c, D1), KBA Proposers must still document the presence of the trigger species at the site (except for species listed as CR (PE) or", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "79937b6c-bd80-491b-9504-5560176db190": {"__data__": {"id_": "79937b6c-bd80-491b-9504-5560176db190", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3e2d1df9fd9a3d8bfdedf05b8a9e2efa6d7f82780f69cdc5a74a50cbd91ca0a0"}, "3": {"node_id": "4121b014-6cec-4cec-b50c-39a978b68f35", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "097b5265b45cd32432860d2133e35a3e28a23af93b0a6565cce0a86707a66a2a"}}, "hash": "9348f73ad8666459c7269a6a4e46442098f46cf81bc3877258ff25375319675d", "text": "CR (PEW) on the IUCN Red List) and are encouraged to confirm that the site holds at least 10 reproductive units if that information is readily available. It was not the intent of the KBA Standard that these criteria provide an easier alternative to Criteria A1 and B1 for safeguarding globally threatened or individual geographically restricted species. How are reproductive units defined? The KBA Standard defines reproductive units as: \u201cThe minimum number and combination of mature individuals necessary to trigger a successful reproductive event at a site (Eisenberg 1977). Examples of five reproductive units include five pairs, five reproducing females in one harem, and five reproductive individuals of a [monoecious] plant species.\u201d KBA Proposers are asked to provide a brief description of how a reproductive unit is defined for each trigger species proposed under Criterion A1, B1, B3, or E (e.g., one pair, one reproductive individual for a monoecious plant species). For each species, the definition of reproductive units should be derived from the definition of mature individuals. See IUCN Red List Guidelines (IUCN SPC 2019, Section 4.3.1) for detailed discussion of several special cases including clonal colonial organisms and sex-changing organisms. Additional examples of 5 reproductive units include: \u2022 birds: 5 active nests; 5 pairs; or 5 mature females and at least 1 mature male in lekking species; Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 59 \u2022 amphibians: 5 mature females and at least 1 mature male for most species; 5 pairs for species that provide biparental care; \u2022 turtles: 5 mature females for marine turtles on nesting beaches; \u2022 fish: 5 mature females and at least 1 mature male for most species; 5 pairs for species that form bonded pairs (e.g., some seahorse species); \u2022 insects: 5 females and at least 1 male for non-social insects; 5 colonies with a single reproducing queen each for social insects; 5 reproductive females for parthenogenetic insects; \u2022 cooperative breeders: 5 cooperative units (e.g., 5 packs of African Wild Dog, Lycaon pictus); \u2022 fungi: 5 mature individuals; \u2022 plants: 5 mature individuals for self-fertilising monoecious or hermaphroditic species; \u2022 clonal species: generally 5 distinct clones8. As with mature individuals, reproductive units should be capable of reproduction. Individuals that will never produce new recruits (for example, individuals of a species that is sedentary when mature (e.g., abalone species) where densities are too low for fertilisation) should not be counted. However, evidence of successful reproduction is not generally required. Are counts of reproductive units required? No. KBA Proposers are required to confirm that the relevant reproductive-units threshold is met (e.g., the number of reproductive units is at least 5 or at least 10 depending on the subcriterion), but are not required to provide counts of reproductive units beyond that. If actual counts are readily available, KBA Proposers can choose to provide this information as it may be useful for KBA monitoring. What if males and females cannot be readily distinguished? For species in which males and females cannot be readily distinguished, the reproductive-units threshold should be translated into the equivalent number of mature individuals (e.g., if 10 reproductive units = 10 pairs, this is equivalent to 20 mature individuals). However, if there is evidence of a severely imbalanced sex ratio, 8 Exceptions may be made for extensive clonal colonies with a high probability of individual persistence (e.g., a clonal colony of Quaking Aspen (Populus tremuloides) in Fishlake National Forest (Utah, USA) occupies nearly 50 hectares and is estimated to be several thousand years old).

For non-threatened species, it is very likely that a site that meets the population-size threshold would hold at least 10 reproductive units.

In sites where breeding occurs, numbers and densities should be sufficient to support successful reproduction and KBA Proposers are encouraged to confirm presence in terms of reproductive units if possible (e.g., at least 10 reproductive units). This information may prove useful if additional criteria are considered in the future. What types of evidence can be used to assess whether the reproductive units threshold is met? See Section 9.2.3. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 61 3.4 Overview of area-based assessment parameters and localities (A1, B1-3, E) Figure 3.4 provides a schematic demonstrating the range, ESH, AOO, and localities or occurrences. (See Appendix I for complete definitions.) Range encompasses the current known limits of distribution of a species within the major system(s) in which a species occurs, accounting for all known, inferred or projected sites of occurrence, including conservation translocations outside native habitat but excluding vagrancies. Large areas of absence resulting from unsuitable physical geography, climate or habitat may also be excluded. ESH refers to the area of habitat available to a species within its range, and thus is a refinement of range that may take additional environmental conditions and habitat information into account to exclude unsuitable areas. For some species, range may approximate ESH. AOO is the area of habitat that is presently occupied by the species, based on known, inferred and projected occurrences. Known localities are the specific points, defined by latitude and longitude, where a species is known to occur. Inferred/projected occurrences are points where the species is inferred/projected to occur. For example, a freshwater invertebrate occurs in shallow sandy habitat in freshwater lakes (Fig. 3.4). A single locality, in a distant lake with no shallow sandy habitat, is assumed to be a vagrant occurrence (perhaps dropped by a bird). All other known localities occur within a single large lake. Additional occurrences are inferred for shallow sandy habitat in the same lake as known localities, and projected for similar habitats in a neighbouring lake without known localities. The range comprises all freshwater lakes with known, inferred, or projected occurrences, and excludes terrestrial areas. The ESH comprises all shallow sandy habitats within the range. The AOO comprises 2 x 2 km grid cells with known, inferred, or projected occurrences. A few areas of shallow sandy habitat within the range are currently occupied by voracious predatory fish \u2014 the freshwater invertebrate does not occur in these areas, so they are included in ESH but not in AOO. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 62 Figure 3.4 Schematic demonstrating localities, range, ESH and AOO for a hypothetical species Can area-based assessment parameters be applied to species with spatially dynamic habitats? For species with spatially dynamic habitats, including many pelagic marine species, AOO and ESH are seasonally and interannually variable at both global and site levels. AOO and ESH will not generally provide a reliable basis for inference about the proportion of the global population size at a site in this context, and should not be used. How can area-based assessment parameters be applied to migratory species? For migratory species, estimates of known localities, AOO, ESH, or range at the global and site levels must be calculated separately for each season, such that percentages of the global population size in the site can be inferred for the relevant season. For example, a species will trigger a KBA if the ESH in its breeding range at the site exceeds the threshold percentage of the global ESH in its breeding range. Area-based parameters (i.e. range, ESH, AOO) and localities do not provide a good proxy for the population distribution of species when on migration (e.g., at bottleneck and stopover sites), so should not be used as the basis for identifying KBAs during this life-cycle process.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "addc852a-9dbe-40b9-a344-0a73ccf00deb": {"__data__": {"id_": "addc852a-9dbe-40b9-a344-0a73ccf00deb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2b02763266851f26b5fd0a0ffcafda5bbb3be46c07b6726dd8ba69aa5f6b9d90"}, "2": {"node_id": "4ad5bd9f-02aa-4056-9ce6-6a6007a09eab", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4947600d524a2392edb73523ff01b58bf726d3db78aa0d44e083aa318f63809b"}}, "hash": "a1c9bba3d0bac5dfe9544cc3a85a1fcd001afe3b519495ed975ebc350ca3982e", "text": "The proportion of the global population size held at a site cannot be inferred using area-based parameters or localities under Criterion D1.

(Note that the IUCN Red List range polygons come with an area calculation but KBA Proposers should recalculate area using the standard projection and km2.) 3.5 Range (Criteria A1, B1-3, E) How is range defined? The KBA Standard (IUCN 2016) defines range as: \u201cThe current known limits of distribution of a species, accounting for all known, inferred or projected sites of occurrence (IUCN 2012a), including conservation translocations outside native habitat (IUCN SPSC 2014)9 but not including vagrancies (species recorded once or sporadically but known not to be native to the area)\u201d (Fig. 3.5). (See Section 9.2.2 for definitions of known, inferred and projected occurrences.) For the purposes of KBA identification, range should not include areas where the species no longer exists (i.e. range refers to the current distribution, rather than the historic distribution; IUCN 2016), or where the species has been introduced (except for conservation translocations). This definition is consistent with the use of \u201crange\u201d in IUCN Red List assessments, and is represented by IUCN Red List range map polygons coded as extant and native/reintroduced/assisted colonisation. Figure 3.5 Schematic demonstrating range for a hypothetical species 9 Note that IUCN SPSC (2014) has been updated to IUCN SPS (2019). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 64 Range typically excludes large areas of absence resulting from unsuitable physical geography (e.g., altitude, bathymetry, hydrology), climate or habitat. Range may be represented by a set of polygons rather than a single polygon.10 Where can KBA Proposers find data on range for species that have been assessed for the IUCN Red List? For species that have been assessed for the IUCN Red List, KBA Proposers should use the range map in the IUCN Red List account (see Appendix III for details). For all species with range maps on the IUCN Red List, total range area (for resident species) and breeding and non-breeding ranges (for migratory species with distinct breeding and non-breeding ranges) will be calculated by the KBA Secretariat. This information will be used to pre-fill global range areas in the WDKBA when it is fully functional. In the meantime, KBA Proposers should download range polygons from the IUCN Red List account and follow the guidelines in Appendix III to estimate the range area at global and site levels. If there is no range map or the range map in the IUCN Red List account needs updating, KBA Proposers should follow the IUCN Red List Mapping Standards to develop a new distribution map for estimating range (see also Appendix III). The resulting range map should be submitted to the relevant IUCN SSC Red List Authority. If there is an existing range map in the IUCN Red List account, the relevant IUCN SSC Red List Authority must approve any updates before a KBA can be proposed that is inconsistent with the existing range map for the proposed trigger species and before range can be used as the assessment parameter. Documentation of this approval should be provided with the KBA proposal. If there is no existing range map, prior approval by the IUCN SSC Red List Authority is encouraged but not required. For taxonomic groups with no IUCN SSC Red List Authority or if the relevant IUCN SSC Red List Authority is unable to review the new range map in a reasonable timeframe, the KBA Proposer should submit the new range map to their RFP for expert review and approval. 10 Note that \u201crange\u201d differs from EOO, which is calculated as the minimum convex polygon around the range. EOO is used in IUCN Red List assessments as a measure of the spatial spread of risk. It may include large areas that are unsuitable (including marine areas in the case of terrestrial species and vice versa), and is not used in KBA identification.

The resulting range map should be flagged for expert review when the KBA proposal is submitted to the WDKBA. Following review, the range map will be available for use in future KBA proposals. When is it important to use consistent range maps for entire taxonomic groups? Consistent range maps are important for identifying restricted-range species within a taxonomic group for Criterion B2. Consistent range maps are also important as a basis for estimating the median range size for a taxonomic group for Criterion B3 (see Section 2.7.1). However, the median range size can be estimated from a representative sample of species, so data on range are not required for the entire taxonomic group. When determining either the proportion of the global population size at the site, or whether a species is restricted to an ecoregion or bioregion, KBA Proposers should use the best available data for each individual species (see Section 3.1 on selecting assessment parameters). This may be ESH rather than range, if ESH is available and provides better information on an individual species\u2019 distribution. What about migratory species? For migratory species with well-defined spatially segregated life-cycle processes, such as breeding, feeding and migration, Criteria A1, B1-3 can be triggered separately by populations in each spatially segregated life function. For species that have distinct Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 66 breeding and non-breeding ranges identified in IUCN Red List assessment maps, breeding and non-breeding ranges will typically be assessed separately. (Please see Appendix III for details.) When is it inappropriate to use range? If a species\u2019 range is poorly defined, localities may provide better information on the distribution of the global population size, especially if the species distribution is highly localised. For species whose range is well defined but that occur patchily within their range, ESH or AOO may provide better information on the distribution of the global population size. 3.6 Extent of suitable habitat (ESH, Criteria A1, B1-3) How is ESH defined? The KBA Standard (IUCN 2016) defines ESH as: \u201cThe area of potentially suitable ecological conditions, such as vegetation or substrate types within the altitudinal or depth, and temperature and moisture preferences, for a given species (Beresford et al. 2011)\u201d (Fig. 3.6). Figure 3.6 Schematic demonstrating extent of suitable habitat (ESH) for a hypothetical species Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 67 ESH refers to the extent of habitat available to a species within its range and cannot extend beyond the range (Fig. 3.6). ESH is a refinement of range \u2014 for example, a range polygon may be clipped to exclude areas that do not contain habitat, or the range may be converted into grid cells and cells that do not contain habitat may be removed. For some species, range and ESH may be similar. ESH may encompass a much larger area than AOO as ESH may include unoccupied habitat within the species\u2019 range. Note that ESH is equivalent to \u201carea of habitat\u201d (AOH, Brooks et al. 2019). However, as \u201cextent of suitable habitat\u201d is used in the KBA Standard (IUCN 2016), this term is also used in the KBA Guidelines for consistency. Where can KBA Proposers find data on ESH? ESH maps are available for several taxonomic groups, including mammals, birds amphibians and some reptiles. If a validated ESH map exists for the species, the global ESH estimate will be pre-filled in the WDKBA when it is fully functional.

When is it inappropriate to use ESH? If a species\u2019 habitat is poorly defined, range may provide better information on the distribution of the global population size. For species whose habitat is well defined but that occur patchily within their ESH, AOO may provide better information on the distribution of the global population size. 3.7 Area of occupancy (AOO, Criteria A1, B1-3, E) How is AOO defined? The KBA Standard (IUCN 2016) defines AOO as: \u201cThe area within the range of a species that is actually occupied (IUCN 2012a).\u201d It includes inferred or projected Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 68 occurrences, but does not include cases of vagrancy (Fig. 3.7). The IUCN Red List Guidelines (IUCN SPC 2019) strongly recommend a reference resolution of 2 x 2 km for all species when measuring AOO, and this is also recommended for KBA assessments. Figure 3.7 Schematic demonstrating area of occupancy (AOO) for a hypothetical species. For many species, AOO may be characterised as a refinement of range and ESH and range. However, for some species (e.g., some invertebrates), habitat may occur at much finer scales than the standard 2 x 2 km used for AOO, and ESH may be less than AOO. Where can KBA Proposers find data on AOO? For species that have been assessed for the IUCN Red List, AOO may have been defined, and possibly mapped, already. If a validated AOO map exists for the species, the global AOO estimate will be pre-filled in the WDKBA when it is fully functional. In the meantime, KBA Proposers seeking to use AOO as an assessment parameter should check whether the species has already been confirmed as a trigger species in the WDKBA and use the same global estimate and AOO map unless new data are available showing that these have changed significantly. Validated AOO maps can be obtained from the KBA Secretariat. AOO must be mapped before it can be used as an assessment parameter. If the IUCN Red List account gives an estimate for AOO, but does not provide an AOO map, KBA Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 69 Proposers seeking to use AOO as an assessment parameter are encouraged to liaise with the IUCN Red List assessment authors to obtain or develop an AOO map. If there is no validated AOO map or the AOO map needs updating, KBA Proposers should follow the IUCN Red List Mapping Standards for mapping AOO (see also Appendix III). The resulting AOO map should be flagged for expert review when the KBA proposal is submitted to the WDKBA. Following review, the AOO map will be available for use in future KBA proposals. When is it inappropriate to use AOO? KBA Proposers should avoid using AOO when there is insufficient information to distinguish occupied and unoccupied habitat (see Appendix III). In this situation, ESH may provide better information on the distribution of the global population size, even if occupation of habitat is patchy. KBA Proposers should also avoid using AOO when species are distributed on very fine scales, such that the standard 2 x 2 km is likely to significantly overestimate the area of occupied habitat. Number of localities may be a more appropriate assessment parameter in this context. 3.8 Number of localities (Criteria A1, B1-3) How are localities defined and identified? The KBA Standard (IUCN 2016) defines localities as follows: \u201cA sampling locality is a point indicated by specific coordinates of latitude and longitude. Note that the term \u2018locality\u2019, as defined here, is fundamentally and conceptually different from the term \u2018location\u2019 used in the IUCN Red List (IUCN 2012a).\u201d Known localities refer to known points of occurrence, and do not include inferred or projected occurrences. (See Section 9.2.2 for definitions of known, inferred and projected occurrences.)

The term \u2018location\u2019 defines an area in which a single threatening event (e.g., a disease outbreak or hurricane) can rapidly affect all individuals of the species present. The scale of a \u2018location\u2019 thus depends on the area covered by the threatening event, which may be smaller than, similar to, or larger than a species\u2019 population (IUCN 2012a). KBA Proposers should clarify whether each \u2018location\u2019 refers to a discrete population before using number of locations as a proxy for number of localities. Where can locality data be found? If a global estimate of number of localities has previously been confirmed for the species, it will be pre-filled in the WDKBA when it is fully functional. In the meantime, KBA Proposers seeking to use number of localities as an assessment parameter should check whether the species has already been confirmed as a trigger species in the WDKBA and use the same global estimate unless new data are available showing that this has changed significantly. If a global estimate of the number of localities has not previously been confirmed for the species (or the previous estimate needs updating), KBA Proposers seeking to use number of localities as an assessment parameter should check the data sources given below and compile locality data to estimate the global number of localities. Locality data should be checked by an appropriate species expert to ensure that the taxonomy is up-to-date and erroneous records are removed. Sources of locality data include museums, herbaria, GBIF and other citizen science platforms, Global Seabird Tracking Database, Ocean Biogeographic Information System and NatureServe\u2019s National Species Dataset (for the US and Canada). How are thresholds applied to locality data? Where the threshold is \u22651%, a site qualifies as a KBA if it represents one of 100 or fewer localities; where the threshold is \u226510%, a site qualifies as a KBA if it represents one of 10 or fewer localities. Localities may be weighted by estimated population size (e.g., based on the relative size of habitat patches) given that abundance may vary considerably across localities. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 71 When is it inappropriate to use number of localities? Locality information is most useful for species that have a highly localised distribution and for which there is insufficient information to define and delineate range, ESH or AOO (for example, there are a number of known localities but the factors underpinning the species\u2019 distribution are not yet well known). Number of localities should not be used as the basis for KBA identification if sampling effort has been opportunistic or insufficient to assume that known localities represent the species\u2019 distribution (IUCN 2016). The judgement that sampling effort has been adequate should be justified in the documentation. If sampling effort has been inadequate, additional survey work may be required before the species can trigger a KBA. 3.9 Relative density or abundance of mature individuals (Criterion B3) Under subcriterion B3c, \u201cmost important occupied habitat\u201d can be observed or inferred through the following assessment parameters: (i) density of mature individuals. (ii) relative abundance of mature individuals. When can relative density or abundance be used? The KBA Standard only specifies [relative] density or relative abundance of mature individuals as possible assessment parameters for subcriterion B3c. The relative density or abundance of mature individuals can also serve as a proxy for the number of mature individuals in cases where it is not possible to detect or count all individuals in a population (see Section 3.2). How can KBA Proposers estimate relative density or abundance? Estimates of relative density or abundance may be based on direct sampling or derived from species distribution models (SDMs). It is beyond the scope of the KBA Guidelines to provide detailed guidance on how to estimate the relative density or abundance of mature individuals at the global or site level using SDMs, but general principles are provided in Appendix III.

In addition, sampling data for estimating relative density or abundance of mature individuals must be available at a wide range of localities encompassing most of the species\u2019 known range; any unsampled areas must be unlikely to hold relatively high densities. 3.10 Distinct genetic diversity (Criteria A1, B1-2) The inclusion of distinct genetic diversity as a metric under Criteria A1, B1 and B2 is intended to identify sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of genetic diversity. How is distinct genetic diversity defined? The KBA Standard defines distinct genetic diversity as follows: \u201cThe proportion of a species\u2019 genetic diversity that is encompassed by a particular site. It can be measured using Analysis of Molecular Variance [AMOVA] or similar technique that simultaneously captures diversity and distinctiveness (frequency of alleles and the genetic distinctiveness of those alleles).\u201d How is distinct genetic diversity used to identify sites under Criteria A1, B1 and B2? Distinct genetic diversity differs from the other assessment parameters in that it refers to the proportion and unique nature of a species\u2019 genetic diversity that is encompassed by a particular area. A site holding more than the threshold proportion of a species\u2019 global genetic diversity can qualify as a KBA, even if the proportion of the species\u2019 global population size at the site is insufficient to trigger a KBA. What measures can be used to assess the proportion of a species\u2019 distinct genetic diversity that is encompassed by a particular site? AMOVA can be used to estimate the proportion of distinct genetic diversity at a given site compared to a dataset representing a species\u2019 entire range. AMOVA allows a percentage of distinct genetic diversity to be ascribed to an entire dataset or to some partitioning of that dataset. Provided sufficient sampling has been carried out, a site\u2019s Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 73 distinct genetic diversity can be measured with reference to a species\u2019 entire range by subtracting a site from the dataset and asking what proportion of the distinct genetic diversity is lost (e.g., Table 3.10). (Note that the percentage of distinct genetic diversity contributed by each of the remaining sites may change when one site is selected, depending on how each site complements the selected site.) Table 3.10. Example of AMOVA-based analysis of distinct genetic diversity used to identify KBAs for a VU species under Criterion A1b (threshold = 1%) and B1 (threshold = 10%) Distinct genetic diversity remaining (%) Difference (%) Threshold met Entire range 100 - Site 1 removed 87.8 12.2 A1b, B1 Site 2 removed 93.1 6.9 A1b Site 3 removed 98.8 1.2 A1b Site 4 removed 99.5 0.5 Analysis of allele or haplotype frequencies alone provides information on the demographic distinctiveness of a population occupying a site. For the purposes of KBA identification, analysis of genetic markers should be modified to account for the evolutionary distinctiveness of the alleles in the analysis by incorporating a measure of genetic distance in the calculation (e.g., using DNA sequence dissimilarity). Using allele or haplotype frequencies alone, the analysis may simply detect the signature of recent demographic isolation (e.g., attributable to anthropogenic barriers to gene- flow), as opposed to long-term evolutionary distinctiveness (e.g., attributable to natural barriers such as rivers, mountain ranges, etc.), which are better incorporated by accounting for the evolutionary distinctiveness of the sequences studied. The increasing use of genomics in conservation biology can provide a framework for identifying the relative importance of evolutionary, demographic and local adaptive diversity in species occupying potential KBAs (see Funk et al. 2012). The analysis shown in Table 3.10 could be applied to genomic datasets with neutral (demographic) and selected (adaptive) markers analysed separately. KBA NCGs or KBA Proposers may decide to focus KBA identification based on distinct genetic diversity that reflects long-term evolutionary processes driven by natural isolation and/or local adaptation rather than recent anthropogenic isolation and genetic drift.

However, in most cases, new data will need to be collected, based on the sampling, genetic and data analysis requirements summarised above. Are there any specific requirements for genetic data used to estimate the proportion of distinct genetic diversity at a site? Genetic datasets should be evaluated for data quality and rigour before being used for KBA identification. Where possible, genetic data should be taken from recent peer-reviewed literature. Data should ideally comprise nuclear DNA (e.g., microsatellite markers, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), or RAD-seq data) and, if appropriate, organelle DNA data (mitochondrial and chloroplast sequences). Analyses based on organelle DNA alone should be treated with caution as such studies only provide a partial genealogical history of the population(s) concerned. A robust sampling design is essential. If potentially important populations are not sampled, or sampling is uneven across the range, the results could be biased. Uncertainty can be reduced by increasing the number of independent genetic markers used and by ensuring that sufficient individuals have been sampled within each gene- pool. The balance between number of markers and number of individuals has long been debated (e.g., Beaumont & Nichols 1996), but the general consensus is that, provided enough genomic data are sampled, no more than 15 unrelated individuals need be sampled within each gene-pool to capture most of the genealogical variance present. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 75 This has led to vigorous debate about how many genomic markers are needed. Traditional AMOVA uses mitochondrial DNA sequences, often alone. This is risky because mitochondrial DNA represents a single maternally inherited haplotype and hence variation within this sequence is inherently non-independent. For traditional genetic markers (e.g., microsatellites), reputable journals have long applied a minimum number of markers required for publication11. Nuclear DNA studies sampling very few genomic markers (e.g., <8 for microsatellites; <100 for SNPs) should also be treated with caution. This debate has been largely rendered moot by the arrival of genomic and reduced representation genomic tools such as Genotype By Sequencing, RAD-seq and whole genome resequencing, which yield thousands to millions of such markers. Thus, genealogical sampling considerations are now simply a matter of acquiring a sufficient number of unrelated individuals per site. However, concerns about the number of genetic markers remain relevant when legacy datasets are being used, and the best approach will generally be to combine data from past and current studies. This can prove problematic if the sample sets are mutually exclusive, but triangulation methods can be used, even if just a few common samples are available (e.g., Carroll et al. 2018). In case of doubt, KBA Proposers are advised to consult with conservation genetics specialists (e.g., the IUCN SSC Conservation Genetics Specialist Group). Are there any specific requirements for documenting the proportion of distinct genetic diversity at a site? Aside from the above sampling requirements, the main requirement is that data should be reliable, preferably published in the peer-reviewed literature. This includes the raw allele frequencies and their sequences, where appropriate. Such data are usually deposited in databases such as the Dryad Digital Repository, GenBank, the Sequence Read Archive, or in the supplementary materials of the paper itself. When is it inappropriate to use distinct genetic diversity? Generally, distinct genetic diversity should only be used for species whose genetic diversity has been well sampled throughout the range. Distinct genetic diversity is 11 This used to be eight markers for wild animal species, and 20 for domestic animal species. These thresholds were not applied to plants because of the difficulty in obtaining markers, or to certain recalcitrant animal groups (e.g., gastropods). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 76 typically most useful as an assessment parameter for species that have one or more populations that have been genetically isolated over evolutionary time-scales.

Criterion C is also based on ecosystems but is covered separately in Section 5 because the identification process differs substantially from that used for Criteria A2 and B4. 4.1 Overview KBA NCGs and KBA Proposers are encouraged to conduct a comprehensive scoping analysis (Steps 1-3 in Fig. 4.1) to identify all potential trigger ecosystem types and potential KBAs in the region of interest. Assessing sites against multiple criteria and biodiversity elements will strengthen the robustness of KBAs to changes in the status of particular trigger biodiversity elements. The step-by-step process shown below serves to structure the guidelines and should be read as indicative. In practice, the process of KBA identification will likely vary among countries. Some KBA Proposers may wish to focus on identifying KBAs for a particular ecosystem type or determine whether a particular site qualifies as a KBA under Criterion A2 or B4. 4.2 Scoping analysis for ecosystem-based criteria (A2, B4) 4.2.1 Identify the ecosystem types that could trigger Criterion A2 or B4 in the region of interest. The KBA Standard (IUCN 2016, pp. 17, 20) states that Criterion A2 and B4 should be applied to ecosystem types \u201cat an intermediate level in a globally consistent ecosystem classification hierarchy\u201d. The RLE Committee on Scientific Standards is currently working to develop a globally consistent ecosystem classification hierarchy (Table 4.2). In this hierarchy, biogeographic ecotypes (Level 4) and global ecosystem types (Level 5) will likely be the relevant levels for KBA identification, but this needs to be confirmed through testing in multiple regions. In the meantime, KBA Proposers are requested to contact the KBA Secretariat for updates. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 78 Figure 4.1 Overview of possible workflow for applying Criteria A2 and B4 According to the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology, biogeographic ecotypes (Level 4) will be developed from the top down, by subdividing ecosystem functional groups (Level 3) using an ecoregional template (e.g., Spalding et al. 2007; Abell et al. 2008; Dinerstein et al. 2017). In contrast, global ecosystem types (Level 5) will be derived from the bottom up, by aggregating subglobal ecosystem types (Level 6) based on compositional similarities. Subglobal ecosystem types will generally be based on established local classifications (e.g., Mucina & Rutherford 2006). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 79 When applying KBA Criteria A2 and B4, NCGs or KBA Proposers may choose to use biogeographic ecotypes (Level 4), global ecosystem types (Level 5) or equivalent levels in a similar globally consistent ecosystem classification hierarchy (e.g., macrogroup or group in the EcoVeg hierarchy, Faber-Langendoen et al. 2014). Further guidance on appropriate levels in the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology and on equivalent levels in similar globally consistent ecosystem classification hierarchies will be provided following testing in multiple regions. Using biogeographic ecotypes (Level 4) will maximise global consistency as the RLE Committee on Scientific Standards plans to map and assess all biogeographic ecotypes using the RLE Guidelines (IUCN 2017) by 2025. The list of biogeographic ecotypes (Level 4) that may trigger Criterion A2 or B4 will be made available on the Red List of Ecosystems website. In some countries, global ecosystem types (Level 5) may provide a more appropriate resolution and basis for global KBA identification. For Criterion A2, global ecosystem types will need to be assessed at the global level using the RLE Guidelines (IUCN 2017) and submitted for peer review and publication on the Red List of Ecosystems. For Criteria A2 and B4, the global extent of global ecosystem types must be mapped before the relevant threshold can be applied. This may require international collaboration where global ecosystem types extend beyond national boundaries.

Spatial data showing the extent of biogeographic ecotypes (Level 4) will be made available through the Red List of Ecosystems website when these data are available. For global ecosystem types (Level 5), KBA Proposers should follow the guidelines in Appendix IV on mapping the extent of ecosystem types. Note that the global extent of any ecosystem types used for KBA identification must be mapped; a national map is insufficient for ecosystem types that extend beyond national boundaries. 4.3.3 Identify the existing/potential sites where each ecosystem type occurs in the region of interest. An ecosystem/site table may be developed by overlaying site boundaries on the distribution of each ecosystem type in a GIS. Boundaries of existing KBAs, other sites of importance for biodiversity, protected or conserved areas can be overlaid on spatial data for each ecosystem type to develop a list of existing sites where each ecosystem type occurs (see Section 7.1 for sources of GIS data on existing sites). GIS can be used to identify contiguous ecosystem areas that exceed the relevant threshold (i.e. 5%, 10% or 20% of the global extent of an ecosystem type) and have the potential to trigger Criterion A2 or B4. If there are no suitable delineated sites in areas of potential importance, initial boundaries for potential KBAs may be based on ecological considerations (see Section 7.2). These boundaries may need to be refined later to yield practical KBA boundaries (see Section 7.3). 4.3 Applying Criterion A2 to identify KBAs for threatened ecosystem types 4.3.1 Identify ecosystem types that could trigger Criterion A2 in the region of interest. Ecosystem types at an intermediate level in a globally consistent ecosystem classification hierarchy (e.g., Levels 4 and 5 in Table 4.2) that have been assessed as globally threatened using the RLE Guidelines (IUCN 2017) can trigger KBA Criterion A2.

The final step in assessing a site against KBA Criterion A2 or B4 is to confirm the presence of the potential trigger ecosystem type at the site. How is the presence of an ecosystem at a site confirmed? Most ecosystems are relatively stationary, at least in the 8-12 year timeframe for KBA reassessment. For biogeographic ecotypes (Level 4) and global ecosystem types (Level 5) that have recently been assessed for the Red List of Ecosystems, the associated geographic distribution maps may be used as confirmation of presence, unless it is likely that the distribution has changed since the map was developed (e.g., through recent ecosystem-transforming fires or landcover conversion). If it is likely that distribution changes have occurred since the most recent geographic distribution map, KBA Proposers should overlay this map on recent high-resolution satellite imagery to reconfirm presence of the ecosystem type within the proposed KBA boundaries. In the case of a forest ecosystem type, for example, KBA Proposers should confirm that the forest ecosystem type is still present within the KBA and has not been destroyed by fire or converted to other types of landcover, such as pasture or crops. This can be done using open-access tools such as Google Earth. More subtle distinctions or transformations, such the degradation of arid shrublands by overgrazing, may require targeted field-based sampling or other recent documentation. 4.3.5 Refine ecological boundaries, if necessary, to yield practical KBA boundaries. KBA delineation is not complete until ecological boundaries have been evaluated and refined, if necessary, to yield a manageable site or sites (see Section 7.3 for further guidelines). 4.3.6 Compile required and recommended documentation. See the KBA Proposal Process guidance for required and recommended documentation for Criterion A2 or B4. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 84 4.4 Applying Criterion B4 to identify KBAs for geographically restricted ecosystem types 4.4.1 Identify ecosystem types that could trigger Criterion B4 in the region of interest. How are geographically restricted ecosystem types identified for the purposes of applying KBA Criterion B4?

Identifying Key Biodiversity Areas based on ecological integrity (Criterion C) Sites qualifying as KBAs under Criterion C represent truly outstanding examples of ecological integrity at the global scale. For a site to qualify as a KBA under Criterion C, human impacts must not have eroded ecological integrity, as indicated by the full complement of native species (especially species indicative of long-term structural stability and functionality and those known to be sensitive to human impact), natural movement patterns of species, and the unimpeded functioning of ecological processes (e.g., wildfire, free-flowing rivers, and flooding patterns). 5.1 Defining ecological integrity How is ecological integrity defined? The KBA Standard defines ecological integrity as \u201cA condition that supports intact species assemblages and ecological processes in their natural state\u201d (IUCN 2016, p. 12). Intact species assemblages or intact ecological communities have \u201cthe complete complement of species known or expected to occur in a particular site or ecosystem, relative to a regionally appropriate historical benchmark, which will often correspond to pre-industrial times\u201d (IUCN 2016, p. 13). Ecological processes include species\u2019 natural movement patterns and natural disturbance regimes, and their natural state is defined relative to the same regionally appropriate benchmark. Sites qualifying under Criterion C maintain their full complement of species (including long-lived structure-forming plant species and highly mobile predators and herbivores) at natural levels of abundance or biomass sufficient to maintain key ecological functions (Soul\u00e9 et al. 2003). Sites qualifying under Criterion C are characterised by contiguous natural habitat and are large enough to maintain species populations and intact ecological communities through most natural disturbance events and sustain most broad-scale ecological processes over the long-term (Janzen 1986; Newmark et al. 1995; Balmford et al. 1998; Scott et al. 1999; Laurance et al. 2002; Leroux et al. 2007; Woodley 2010; IUCN & WCPA 2017). They have suffered minimal direct industrial anthropogenic disturbance. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 86 How is ecological integrity measured? Ecological integrity is a multidimensional concept that is difficult to measure directly. For the purposes of identifying sites qualifying under Criterion C, ecological integrity should be observed or, more likely, inferred from evidence based on both: (1) direct measures of species composition and abundance/biomass/density across taxonomic groups (particularly for species indicative of long-term structural stability and functionality or those known to be highly sensitive to human impact); AND (2) absence (or very low levels) of direct industrial human impact, as quantified by appropriate indices at the scale of interest and verified on the ground or in the water. Measures of species composition and abundance/biomass/density across taxonomic groups may be based on indicator species (see Section 5.2.3). Absence, or very low levels, of direct industrial human impact does not necessarily imply absence, or even low densities, of human inhabitants. For example, some sites with outstanding ecological integrity have been inhabited by indigenous peoples for millennia. Conversely, some sites with very low human population densities have nonetheless undergone extensive loss of ecological integrity due to remote human impacts. Rather, for a site to qualify as a KBA under Criterion C, human impacts must not have eroded ecological integrity (see Section 5.2.1). How can the regionally appropriate historical benchmark be determined? The choice of historical benchmark must be consistent with identifying only those sites that are truly outstanding examples of ecological integrity at the global scale, and must be accompanied by an explanation of why it is appropriate to the region (see Stephenson et al. (2019) for discussion).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "207e2e23-502a-4810-a638-8f39e455f71c": {"__data__": {"id_": "207e2e23-502a-4810-a638-8f39e455f71c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "78cacbc1cfd38e6036b5b0f994f1b2ee03327bb71cc3518ca0a90d8dbd9a2023"}, "2": {"node_id": "6d044368-11c1-4038-9e7f-150d33e2dffc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0e0cba257d30f120ca8a081367e821c8a752a459e3c9dbdaeecc69908abdea34"}}, "hash": "78859c553a0086577fd01c3ab6f1a71bd76173cdbcd64320ea09372d015cd861", "text": "(2019) for discussion). 5.2 Applying Criterion C to identify KBAs with outstanding ecological integrity A site qualifies as a KBA under Criterion C because it is \u201cone of \u22642 per ecoregion characterised by wholly intact ecological communities, comprising the composition and abundance of native species and their interactions\u201d (IUCN 2016, p. 21).

Other ecoregions will have potential sites that have been severely affected by pervasive global-scale threats; careful consideration needs to be given to whether these sites meet the requirements to qualify as KBAs under Criterion C. 5.2.1 Conduct a scoping analysis to identify ecoregions with potential for sites that could trigger Criterion C. In many cases, it will be useful to identify Criterion C KBAs through a step-based process, beginning with regional scoping and following with site evaluation and selection within ecoregions (Fig. 5.2). Identification of potential areas of outstanding ecological integrity will usually start with a preliminary scoping analysis to identify ecoregions, or areas within ecoregions, with low levels of industrial human impact using readily available global and/or regional-level \u201chuman footprint\u201d type datasets (e.g., roads and infrastructure; Sanderson et al. 2002; Venter et al. 2016). This analysis can then be refined using additional data at the ecoregion level, where available. Preliminary scoping of areas that retain their full complement of native species may be informed by regional maps showing areas where species have been extirpated (see Plumptre et al. 2019 for an example at the global scale). Note that species richness is not a surrogate for ecological integrity. More thorough assessments of species composition and abundance/biomass/densities will be needed at the site-scale (see Section 5.2.3). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 88 Figure 5.2 Overview of possible workflow for applying Criterion C How is absence (or very low levels) of human impact measured? KBA Proposers may develop quantitative indices based on global/regional/ecoregional datasets and analyse the cumulative impacts of these pressures to identify sites with very low levels of direct industrial human impact. For Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 89 a site to qualify as a KBA under Criterion C, human impact must not have eroded ecological integrity. Pervasive global-scale threats that affect all marine and/or terrestrial areas (e.g., climate change, ocean acidification, past overharvest of cetaceans) should not be included as binary factors in this analysis (i.e. as simple yes/no layers), as no sites would be identifiable under Criterion C in this case. However, they may be useful as relative factors, highlighting areas where the impact on ecological integrity is relatively high/moderate/low, for example. Understanding the key drivers of change within an ecoregion or across similar ecoregions can help to identify the most appropriate datasets and indicators for identifying areas with low levels of direct anthropogenic disturbance. KBA Proposers are encouraged to refer to summaries of the main threats currently affecting or likely to affect any ecosystem types that have been assessed for the Red List of Ecosystems (see IUCN 2017). Some types of infrastructure have different levels of impact in different regions. For example, roads may have limited impacts on ecological integrity in some regions, but lead to broad-scale logging, mining and hunting in others. In regions where indicators of human impact are similar across adjacent ecoregions, the same indices may serve for multiple ecoregions. Elsewhere, ecoregion-specific indices of human impact may be appropriate, especially where more detailed or up-to-date information is available at the ecoregional level than at broader scales. 5.2.2 If there are no suitable delineated sites in areas of potential importance, derive initial KBA boundaries using ecological data. Some large existing KBAs and other sites of importance for biodiversity (see Section 7.1) may qualify under Criterion C. Scoping analysis may also reveal areas of potential importance where there are no existing KBAs, other recognised sites of importance for biodiversity, or protected or conserved areas. In this case, initial boundaries for potential KBAs may be based on ecological considerations (see Section 7.2). These boundaries may need to be refined later to yield practical KBA boundaries (see Section 7.3). Are there any special considerations for delineating sites under Criterion C?

The requirement that all KBAs should be manageable as a unit may, in some cases, constrain the upper size limit of Criterion C KBAs. In some ecoregions, initial KBA boundaries will be clear because areas with ecological integrity are bounded by areas that clearly do not qualify; whereas, in others, large portions of the ecoregion may exhibit high levels of ecological integrity. (See Section 7.3.3 for guidance in this context.) Where potential sites are located on both sides of an ecoregion boundary, a single site may be delineated, while recognising that the site on each side of the ecoregion boundary would need to meet the Criterion C threshold in its own right to qualify as a KBA under Criterion C. 5.2.3 Assess species composition and abundance/biomass/densities at existing/potential sites to identify those with intact ecological communities. A site qualifies as a KBA under Criterion C because it is \u201cone of \u22642 per ecoregion characterised by wholly intact ecological communities, comprising the composition and abundance of native species and their interactions\u201d (IUCN 2016, p. 21). How can areas with intact ecological communities be identified? An ecological community is a complex of native plants, animals and other organisms that interact together within an ecosystem (Smith 1992). Ecological communities are Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 91 complex and constantly changing due to both natural processes and anthropogenic changes, compounded by climate change. Intactness must be evaluated in this context. Assessments of species composition and abundance/biomass/densities are essential for the identification of KBAs that qualify under Criterion C. Nevertheless, it is recognised that comprehensive assessments will be impractical in many areas with high ecological integrity, especially in remote ecoregions with few human settlements and limited road access. Ecological assessments may therefore be focused on a set of species indicative of intact ecological communities and ecological processes in their natural state. KBA NCGs and other KBA Proposers are encouraged to refer to descriptions of the characteristic native biota and key ecological processes and interactions of any ecosystem types that have assessed for the Red List of Ecosystems. Where ecoregions straddle national boundaries, KBA NCGs and KBA Proposers from neighbouring countries are encouraged to discuss and collaborate on identifying a consistent set of indicator species. Conceptual models of key ecosystem dynamics developed as part of Red List of Ecosystems assessments can also provide a useful reference (see IUCN 2017). The set of indicator species should include species indicative of long-term structural stability and functionality (e.g., old structure-forming plants, top predators, other keystone species, ecosystem engineers and foundation species; Paine 1969; Dayton 1972; Jones et al. 1994), species sensitive to broad-scale ecological processes (e.g., fire, flood, grazing and predation; Carignan & Villard 2002), area-demanding species (e.g., low density and highly mobile species; Boyd et al. 2008; Didier et al. 2009), species that are sensitive to human impact (e.g., all large hunted and harvested species; Redford 1992; Thiollay 1992), and species that indicate ecological condition (e.g., invertebrates and lichens that indicate water and air quality; Karr 1981).

If a species that is not considered an indicator species for ecological integrity has been extirpated from a site (or has significantly reduced abundance), the KBA Proposer should explain why that species\u2019 loss is not detrimental to a Criterion C status. In addition, assessments of ecological integrity should investigate the occurrence of disease, invasive alien species and other species associated with anthropogenic disturbance, as these may indicate a loss of ecological integrity. As above, the significance of disease and invasive species should be considered in the context of the their role in threatening ecological integrity and key ecological processes. Given that natural ecosystems are dynamic, assessments of ecological integrity should take into account the expected range of variability in ecosystem composition, structure, and function under natural environmental conditions and phases of natural disturbance (e.g., a site in a fire-adapted ecosystem should not be excluded because it has relatively few fire-intolerant seedlings immediately following a natural fire). In some sites, a species might be extirpated or reduced in abundance through natural processes, independent of human impacts. Can other indicators of ecological integrity be considered? Information on additional indicators of ecological integrity (e.g., patch size and fragmentation for forests, coral cover for coral reefs, and water quality for rivers and lakes) can provide valuable supporting evidence, but are not a substitute for direct measures of species composition. Use of such indicators should be accompanied by explanations of why they are relevant as indicators of ecological integrity in the ecoregion in question. 5.2.4 In ecoregions with more than two sites that could trigger Criterion C, use comparative analysis of ecological integrity to support site selection. Sites qualifying under Criterion C represent truly outstanding examples of ecological integrity at the global scale. The maximum number of sites that can qualify under Criterion C is two per ecoregion. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 93 How are sites selected when there are more than two potential sites that could trigger Criterion C is an ecoregion? In ecoregions with more than two potential sites that could trigger Criterion C, site selection will likely be an iterative process, involving a comparative analysis of factors contributing to ecological integrity (e.g., intactness, size and shape) and manageability based on a combination of desk-based analysis of remotely sensed data, published field surveys and museum records, and site evaluation involving biodiversity knowledge-holders (see Section 5.2.5). (i) Intactness: Criterion C is based on absolute rather than relative integrity; nevertheless, there may be greater confidence in the intactness of ecological communities at some potential sites than others. (ii) Size and shape: Large unfragmented areas are generally better able to support highly mobile species, better able to persist through most natural disturbance events, and are more resilient to edge effects. Other factors relating to ecological condition may also be taken into consideration. As with all KBAs, sites qualifying under Criterion C should be manageable as a unit (see Section 7.3 on delineation). 5.2.5 Conduct site evaluation of existing/potential sites to confirm ecological integrity. Site evaluation should be conducted prior to proposing any site as a KBA to confirm the presence of intact ecological communities by reviewing recent data or conducting new field surveys if necessary. KBA Proposers should verify information gained from remotely sensed datasets, as well as information that cannot be inferred from remotely sensed data, such as overexploitation, presence of invasive alien species, and water quality. Evidence may come from workshops or interviews with biodiversity knowledge- holders, including taxonomic experts, biologists, and holders of Indigenous and Local Knowledge (ILK, see below and Section 8.1), recently collected data or new field surveys. Site evaluation should include interviews with local knowledge-holders and/or new field surveys if assessments of species composition and abundance/ biomass/ densities are based on field surveys that are out-of-date. If the KBA Proposer wants to use data older than 12 years, they should provide a brief explanation of why these data are still considered valid (e.g., no major ecological or human management changes have occurred in the area in the intervening period).

Identifying Key Biodiversity Areas based on quantitative analysis of irreplaceability (Criterion E) Note. Testing on various aspects of Criterion E is ongoing, as indicated in the text below. KBA NCGs and KBA Proposers interested in identifying KBAs under Criterion E are requested to contact the KBA Secretariat for updates before embarking on data compilation or analysis. 6.1 Overview Criterion E aims to identify globally irreplaceable sites, specifically sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity because they are very likely needed as part of a global network of complementary sites in which all species are represented at a minimum level (based on predefined representation targets) somewhere in the network. Criterion E is species-based, like criteria A1, B1-3, and D1- 3. The KBA Standard defines irreplaceability as follows: \u201cEither (a) the likelihood that an area will be required as part of a system that achieves a set of targets (Ferrier et al. 2000) or (b) the extent to which the options for achieving a set of targets are reduced if the area is unavailable for conservation (Pressey et al. 1994). Irreplaceability is heavily influenced by geographically restricted biodiversity, but it is a property of an area within a network rather than of an element of biodiversity and is related to the concept of complementarity.\u201d The KBA Standard defines complementarity as follows: \u201cA measure of the extent to which an area contains elements of biodiversity not represented, or that are underrepresented, in an existing set of areas; alternatively, the number of unrepresented or underrepresented biodiversity elements that a new area adds to a network (Margules & Pressey 2000).\u201d Irreplaceability is a function of the established representation targets. Typically, there are many possible combinations of complementary sites that can achieve species\u2019 representation targets (i.e. the desired amount of a species global population size or distribution), with different spatial configurations. Some of these combinations are more efficient than others, achieving representation targets in a relatively small total area, for example. Sites have high irreplaceability if there are no other sites (or very Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 96 few other sites) that can replace them without compromising species\u2019 representation. Conversely, sites that can easily be replaced by other sites without compromising species\u2019 representation are said to have low irreplaceability. Irreplaceable sites are thus important for the goal of representing all species, especially species that are geographically concentrated or have population sizes not much greater than the representation target, such that there is limited spatial flexibility to meet the representation target. Sites identified as KBAs under Criterion E should have very high irreplaceability (i.e. at least 0.9 on a scale of 0 to 1). In any analysis of irreplaceability, considerable effort will generally be required to compile comprehensive species distribution datasets across the entire study region. It is recommended that KBA NCGs and KBA Proposers invest in compiling the best possible datasets given available data to reduce the need to re-do analyses to account for additional species. These datasets can also inform identification of sites under other species-based KBA criteria.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cc65a13a-71c6-4488-875d-eb5f54d04b62": {"__data__": {"id_": "cc65a13a-71c6-4488-875d-eb5f54d04b62", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5b9cafb05306497f32b0cdc0669c9e533734109a33e723aef9759e7581e02938"}, "2": {"node_id": "cb191619-4ecd-4617-a28d-15736c094dbe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bd181bc4b6933f2acef05829dece8e2f27cd02c06bba4bd22544989aa5720e8d"}}, "hash": "1eb20e18f160ddfee35f2a7dcff3dd8c8f2976c41fcf637b3ab845af8fddda0a", "text": "These datasets can also inform identification of sites under other species-based KBA criteria.

Figure 6.1 presents a possible workflow for applying Criterion E. Analysis will generally be conducted in two distinct stages: the first stage is an initial scoping analysis, usually based on equal-area spatial units or other polygons; whereas the second stage is designed to assess the irreplaceability of existing and proposed sites following delineation (see IUCN 2016, p. 25). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 97 Figure 6.1 Overview of possible workflow for applying Criterion E What is the appropriate geographic scope for applying Criterion E? The KBA Standard states that irreplaceability analysis needs to take into account the entire range of species, and so must either (a) be conducted at a global scale, or (b) focus only on species endemic to the region analysed, or (c) set the representation targets to reflect the fraction of the global population size of each species that is included in the study area (IUCN 2016, p. 25). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 98 In all three cases (a \u2013 c), the analysis needs to take into account the global population size (or distribution) of the species, rather than just the population size (or distribution) within the subglobal region analysed. This is straight-forward for analyses (a) at the global scale or (b) for species endemic to the study region in subglobal analyses. The KBA Standard allows for the inclusion of non-endemic species (c), with representation targets adjusted to reflect the fraction of the global population size in the study region (see Section 6.2.2). Here, we recommend that only species with \u226550% of their population or range within the study region are included in subglobal analysis for Criterion E, pending further testing.12 (Please contact the KBA Secretariat for updates.) Otherwise, species with a relatively small proportion of their global population size within the study region might lead to sites being identified as highly irreplaceable because of limited spatial flexibility within the study region, despite considerable spatial flexibility outside the study region. As with all KBAs, assessments of sites as potential KBAs under Criterion E should be locally driven, ideally coordinated by a KBA NCG. Collaboration between KBA NCGs and KBA Proposers in neighbouring countries within the same biogeographic region is encouraged, especially if there would otherwise be many non-endemic and edge- of-range species. KBA RFPs should coordinate with KBA NCGs and other KBA Proposers to ensure that sites are not proposed as KBAs based on analyses that overlap both spatially and taxonomically. Global analyses may serve as valuable scoping and evaluation exercises and international organisations may play a valuable supporting role, but are not an alternative to site identification processes led by local or national constituencies. 6.2 Scoping analysis for KBAs based on irreplaceability through quantitative analysis 6.2.1 Decide the taxonomic scope and identify the species to be included in quantitative irreplaceability analysis in the region of interest. What is the appropriate taxonomic scope for applying Criterion E? Criterion E analysis will generally be conducted separately for terrestrial, freshwater, and marine systems. 12 An alternative approach, to be assessed through testing, may be to use the global population size or distribution for all species, with no adjustment to the target, and then exclude all sites identified as falling outside the region of interest. KBA Proposers interested in testing this option should contact the KBA Secretariat. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 99 For each system, the provisional recommendation for applying Criterion E is to conduct the most comprehensive analysis possible given the available data (i.e. including all species with suitable data). Once a Criterion E analysis is complete and KBAs have been confirmed, re-analysis will not be required when new data become available until the end of the 8-12 year reassessment period. However, if additional data do become available, KBA NCGs or KBA Proposers may choose to revisit Criterion E analysis, combining the old and new datasets, at any time.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a3c11b78-f946-4d1f-b594-03eea47334c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "a3c11b78-f946-4d1f-b594-03eea47334c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5b1a22925531d652122b0a5d38893d07a7cc5c57c622d22ffdea9f2e81801dea"}, "2": {"node_id": "9d01e5a3-ede8-4e7d-ab1e-1ab751869523", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "91959d2076ee67862dc18f6f8a4ce4e2da1be324bd12f390306b4300c2419514"}}, "hash": "b55df186fb56f238b12bc344bd6b918584d0fbbe92830e1bcbda5bfd11bd621c", "text": "If a site previously identified as a KBA under Criterion E no longer meets the 0.9 irreplaceability threshold and does not meet any other KBA criteria, it will no longer be considered a KBA.

Can migratory species be included in quantitative irreplaceability analysis under Criterion E? Migratory species may be included; see Section 6.2.2 for guidelines on setting representation targets for migratory species. 6.2.2 Check the representation target for each species. Under Criterion E, representation targets are set for each species individually, based on the thresholds defined in the KBA Standard (IUCN 2016, pp. 24-25). There are two subcriteria, applicable to species with different types of available data: \u2022 Subcriterion Ea applies to species for which it is possible to know, estimate or infer the number of mature individuals per spatial unit. Representation targets are then set in terms of number of mature individuals. \u2022 Subcriterion Eb applies to species for which only distribution data are available (e.g., range or AOO). Representation targets are then set in terms of area, with the implicit assumption that population density is constant across the species\u2019 distribution. The two subcriteria mirror each other \u2014 for any given species, they describe a consistent level of representation, i.e. a minimum of 1,000 mature individuals AND a Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 100 minimum area of 1,000 km2 within the species\u2019 range or 20 km2 within the species\u2019 AOO. KBA Proposers are encouraged to set targets in terms of the number of mature individuals where possible, rather than range or AOO, as the number of mature individuals is more directly related to the probability of persistence. The representation targets should be reduced to comprise the entire population if the global population size is fewer than 1,000 mature individuals, the species\u2019 range is less than 1,000 km2 or the AOO less than 20 km2. Conversely, the representation targets should be increased if quantitative viability analysis indicates that this is necessary to ensure \u226590% probability of global persistence in 100 years. The representation targets are reproduced here, with minor edits for clarification. (a) The site network should encompass at least X mature individuals of each species, where X is the largest value possible among: i. the total number of individuals currently existing in the wild, if either: the global population size is fewer than 1,000 mature individuals; or the species\u2019 range is smaller than 1,000 km2; or the area of occupancy is smaller than 20 km2; ii. the population size necessary to ensure the global persistence of the species with a probability of \u226590% in 100 years, as measured by quantitative viability analysis; iii. 1,000 mature individuals; iv. the number of mature individuals expected to occupy, at average densities, 1,000 km2 within the species\u2019 range or 20 km2 within the species\u2019 area of occupancy (as appropriate); (b) The site network should encompass at least an area of Y km2 for each species, where Y is the largest value possible among: i. the total area where the species occurs, if either: the global population size is fewer than 1,000 mature individuals; or the species\u2019 range is smaller than 1,000 km2; or the area of occupancy is smaller than 20 km2; ii. the area necessary to ensure the global persistence of the species with a probability of \u226590% in 100 years, as measured by quantitative viability analysis, up to a minimum of 10% of the total species distribution (i.e. range or area of occupancy, as appropriate); iii. 1,000 km2 within the range or 20 km2 within the area of occupancy (as appropriate); iv. the area corresponding to the range or the area of occupancy (as appropriate) necessary to include 1,000 mature individuals.

Are there guidelines for quantitative viability analysis in subcriteria Eaii and Ebii? For subcriteria Eaii and Ebii, quantitative viability analysis should be consistent with the general IUCN Red List Guidelines on applying Red List Criterion E (IUCN SPC 2019, Section 9). For both subcriteria, quantitative viability analysis for endemic species (or any species in a global analysis) should be representative of the species\u2019 population dynamics at the global level, constructed from information sampled from at least 10% of the species\u2019 overall distribution. (This is the intention of the phrase \u201cup to a minimum of 10% of the total species distribution\u2026\u201d in the KBA Standard, IUCN 2016, pp. 24-25). How are representation targets set for non-endemic species? For any species that is not endemic to the region analysed, the representation target must be adjusted to reflect the fraction of the global population size of the species in the study area (IUCN 2016). For example, say the global representation target for a species is 1,000 mature individuals and approximately 75% of the species\u2019 global population size occurs in the study region, then the representation target for the study region would be 750 mature individuals and analysis would be based on the species\u2019 distribution within the study region only. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 102 Figure 6.2 Selecting species representation targets for Criterion E Targets for non-endemic species under Eaii or Ebii should be set to ensure the persistence of the species in the study region with a probability of \u226590% in 100 years, Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 103 and the quantitative viability analysis should be representative of the species\u2019 population dynamics within the study region, constructed from information sampled from at least 10% of the species\u2019 distribution within the study region. How are representation targets set for coastal, riverine and other species with linear distributions? In many cases, Criterion E analyses of freshwater systems will be based on subcatchments, as range maps for freshwater species are typically based on subcatchments (see IUCN Red List Mapping Standards). However, in the special case of Criterion E analysis of riverine or coastal systems in which all species have linear distributions that do not exceed 200 km in width within the study region (e.g., an analysis of intertidal marine invertebrates), species representation targets may be rescaled to 50 km linear geographic span for range or 1 km for AOO.13 How are representation targets set for migratory species? For migratory species with well-defined spatially segregated life-cycle processes, such as breeding and non-breeding, representation targets should be set separately for each spatially segregated life-cycle process (e.g., 1,000 mature individuals or 1,000 km2 in the breeding range and 1,000 mature individuals or 1,000 km2 in the non-breeding range). 6.2.3 Determine the spatial units for analysis. For the purposes of scoping analysis (Fig. 6.1), the study region should be subdivided into grid cells and/or irregular polygons representing subcatchments or existing sites (e.g., existing KBAs, other sites of importance for biodiversity, protected or conserved areas; see Table 7.1 for GIS data on existing sites). The size of spatial units, whether grid cells or irregular polygons, should generally be consistent with the average or likely size of KBAs in the country or region analysed. Spatial units should not be so large that they are unlikely to be manageable as a unit because large spatial units will need to be partitioned into smaller manageable sites later. The KBA Standard recommends that spatial units should be approximately 100\u2013 1,000 km2 (IUCN 2016, p. 25).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4052fa95-c4d9-44dc-a0bb-40e89b8b238a": {"__data__": {"id_": "4052fa95-c4d9-44dc-a0bb-40e89b8b238a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9370f56779682574c562b1ad5655cac0a8706516bf3c99ef8b40811f4f02b819"}, "2": {"node_id": "6e5ce0e1-6419-401c-abdb-cda82ab4780a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "94dd61e3f307f582b2fbbe6368c6704b6e5d61945aabd11b4f8d0ca25a393a81"}}, "hash": "cfde0b0f34528ab6d9f5974dce0afc486d97f28482a91c9a6269fe5a89b0e7fb", "text": "25).

The choice of spatial units affects commission errors; whereas the choice of species\u2019 distribution data affects both commission and omission errors (see Section 6.2.4). When choosing the size of spatial units, the rate of commission errors can generally be reduced by avoiding spatial units that are so small that there is considerable uncertainty regarding whether the species is present in any given unit. In particular, if species distribution data are based on grid cells (e.g., atlas data), the size of spatial units used in irreplaceability analysis should be similar or greater than the resolution of the input data (e.g., if the input data are for cells of 20 x 20 km2 = 400 km2, then spatial units should be 400 km2 or larger). While minimizing commission errors points towards relatively large spatial units, spatial units should not be so large that they cannot be managed as a unit. Confirmation of species\u2019 presence during the second stage of irreplaceability analysis will serve to minimize commission errors at that stage, but over-estimating species occurrence or using spatial units that are too large to be manageable as a unit during the initial scoping stage will be inefficient and frustrating. Grid cells should be equal-area. If polygons representing existing sites or subcatchments are not approximately equal-area, then they should be weighted by area (e.g., by including area as a cost layer). 6.2.4 Compile distribution data for each species. Which types of data on the distribution of mature individuals can be used in quantitative irreplaceability analysis under Criterion Ea? Where available, data on the distribution of mature individuals provide the most direct measure of the contribution of a site to species persistence. Data on the number of mature individuals in each spatial unit may be actual counts or abundance estimates based on sample data or a spatial density model (see Appendix III), as long as it is possible to estimate numbers in absolute rather than relative terms (e.g., as number of mature individuals per km2 rather than catch-per-unit-effort). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 105 Which types of data on the area where a species occurs can be used in quantitative irreplaceability analysis under Criterion Eb? In the context of quantitative analysis of irreplaceability, the choice of area-based assessment parameter from available options will affect the balance of risks between commission and omission errors. In particular, using range runs the risk of overestimating the true distribution, leading to commission errors; whereas using AOO may risk underestimating the true distribution, leading to omission errors. Testing is ongoing to compare results using range, ESH and AOO. The aim is to find an appropriate balance between risks of commission and omission error. Please contact the KBA Secretariat for updates on testing. The recent presence of trigger species must ultimately be confirmed in all sites proposed as KBAs. This suggests there may be efficiency advantages from using atlas data (i.e. gridded presence/absence maps) where available. Atlas data may be used and treated similarly to range or AOO depending on the size of grid cells (see below). The KBA Standard does not provide representation targets for locality data. Locality data must therefore be converted to AOO prior to quantitative irreplaceability analysis under Criterion Eb. Range-type datasets: Range maps for many globally threatened species can be downloaded from the IUCN Red List (see Appendix III.1 for detailed guidelines). If no range map exists for the species, KBA Proposers seeking to use range in Criterion E analysis should follow the guidance in the IUCN Red List Mapping Standards on developing distribution maps for estimating range (see Section 3.5). KBA Proposers are encouraged to use ESH (also known as AOH, see Section 3.6) as a proxy for range. This will generally reduce the risks of commission error and be more efficient, especially if the range includes large unsuitable areas. Validated ESH maps will be provided through the IUCN Red List when available. If ESH maps have not yet been developed, KBA Proposers seeking to use ESH should follow the guidance on estimating ESH in Appendix III.2.

If AOO maps have not yet been developed, KBA Proposers seeking to use AOO should follow the guidance in the IUCN Red List Mapping Standards on estimating AOO (see also Appendix III.3). KBA Proposers may also use atlas data, if available. Atlas data based on small grid cells (e.g., 2 x 2 km) that effectively distinguish between occupied and non-occupied parts of the range should be treated as AOO for the purposes of setting representation targets. If atlas data use smaller grid cells (i.e. <2 x 2 km), they should be scaled up to 2 x 2 km for consistency with the definition of AOO. 6.2.5 Select a decision support tool for complementarity-based quantitative analysis of irreplaceability. The recommended decision support tools for conducting complementarity-based quantitative analysis of irreplaceability under Criterion E are Marxan (Ball et al. 2009), Conservation Land-Use Zoning software (CLUZ; Smith 2019) or prioritizr using the replacement-cost function (Hanson et al. 2017). (See Appendix VI for further discussion of suitable decision support tools.) Tools and metrics suitable for conducting complementarity-based quantitative analysis of irreplaceability under Criterion E are continually evolving. The set of recommended tools is expected to change over time. KBA Proposers initiating a new Criterion E analysis should follow current recommendations. The availability of new tools does not invalidate previous analyses, but KBA Proposers are encouraged to use currently recommended tools when updating previous analyses or when the 8-12 year reassessment period is reached. Given the various ways that irreplaceability can be estimated, KBA Proposers should clearly document the method used to enable proper review. 6.2.6 Conduct complementarity-based quantitative analysis of irreplaceability to identify spatial units that meet the irreplaceability threshold for Criterion E. KBA assessment to identify sites under Criterion E should be implemented through complementarity-based irreplaceability analyses. A site qualifies as a KBA under Criterion E because it has a level of irreplaceability of \u22650.90 (on a 0\u20131 scale), measured by quantitative spatial analysis, and is characterised by the regular presence of species Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 107 with \u226510 reproductive units known to occur (or \u22655 reproductive units for EN or CR species). What types of cost layer can be included in quantitative irreplaceability analysis under Criterion E? The purpose of KBA identification is to identify sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity, not to prioritise sites for conservation action. The only \u201ccost\u201d information included in quantitative irreplaceability analysis to identify KBAs under Criterion E is the area of each spatial unit. Additional cost considerations may be included, along with other factors, in subsequent conservation priority-setting (IUCN 2016, p. 8; see also Smith et al. 2019, Table 1). What consideration should be given to land-/seascape-level considerations when measuring irreplaceability? Some decision support tools used in systematic conservation planning include optional features for integrating land-/seascape-level considerations (e.g., forcing selected sites to be as adjacent or connected as possible). Given that the purpose of KBA identification is to identify sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity, and not to design conservation land- or seascapes, these optional features should not be used. When using Marxan or prioritzr, for example, the boundary length modifier or penalty argument should be set to 0. Such land-/ seascape-level considerations may be included, along with other factors, in subsequent conservation priority-setting exercises (see IUCN 2016, p. 8). How is uncertainty handled in quantitative irreplaceability analysis under Criterion E? KBA Proposers are encouraged to investigate the sensitivity of irreplaceability to potentially significant choices, such as the shape and size of spatial units and the type of data used in setting representation targets (e.g., range or AOO).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "810fce1f-373e-4081-a0cd-34217ad3ef09": {"__data__": {"id_": "810fce1f-373e-4081-a0cd-34217ad3ef09", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3b4b36f9e2539de60ee9bca4f8783bcd8998fe73eee4672a06ff068062903f66"}, "2": {"node_id": "12fb4516-ccc8-4b92-91e8-501251d4af95", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "07603bb96d16d89532f418c70f0ecdd1ba0688932516d7073130b9ebf0eafc8d"}}, "hash": "b92575f4c895711e425dce3e38a6aa74ceef1973fc4d5d7baa725e9f057652f8", "text": "(See Section 9.3 for more general guidelines on dealing with uncertainty in KBA identification and delineation.) 6.2.7 Identify likely trigger species.

An extension to conduct this analysis in prioritizr has been developed, and an extension to conduct this analysis in CLUZ will be released shortly. (Please check with the KBA Secretariat for updates.) 6.2.8 Identify the existing/potential sites that overlap highly irreplaceable spatial units. Boundaries of existing sites (e.g., existing KBAs, other sites of importance for biodiversity, protected or conserved areas) may be used as spatial units in the initial scoping analysis (Section 6.2.3). If not, boundaries of existing sites should be overlaid on highly irreplaceable spatial units to generate a list of existing sites that might qualify as KBAs under Criterion E. Where this process involves partitioning spatial units into smaller sites, care should be taken to ensure that these sites capture the area(s) within the spatial unit that are driving high levels of irreplaceability. Spatial units should not be partitioned into several distinct sites if the entire spatial unit is required to meet specific representation targets and is manageable as a unit. In some cases, spatial units that exceed the irreplaceability threshold may fall outside existing sites. In these areas, initial boundaries for potential KBAs may be based on highly irreplaceable spatial units combined with ecological data on the distribution and habitats of likely trigger species (see Section 7.2). Where this process involves partitioning spatial units into smaller sites, care should be taken to ensure that these sites capture the area(s) within the spatial unit that are driving high levels of irreplaceability. Spatial units should not be partitioned into several distinct sites if the entire spatial unit is required to meet specific representation targets and is manageable as a unit. 6.3 Applying Criterion E to identify KBAs based on irreplaceability through quantitative analysis 6.3.1 For each proposed site, confirm the presence of potential trigger species in numbers that meet relevant reproductive-units thresholds. Once initial KBA boundaries have been derived, the next step is to confirm the presence of each potential trigger species at each site in numbers that meet or exceed the relevant reproductive-units threshold by reviewing recent field data or conducting Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 109 new field surveys (see Section 9.2.3). The reproductive-units threshold for Criterion E is 5 reproductive units for CR and EN species, and 10 reproductive units for all other species. 6.3.2 Repeat the quantitative irreplaceability analysis using delineated sites. At this point, complementarity-based quantitative analysis should be repeated using delineated sites plus the background grid or polygons used in the scoping analysis, and updated species distribution data, to determine the irreplaceability score of potential KBAs (IUCN 2016, p. 25). Sites that previously met the 0.9 irreplaceability threshold and have been confirmed to contain the required reproductive units for all likely trigger species may be locked in at this stage, as long as the size has not been reduced. Conversely, the contributions of sites to a particular species\u2019 representation target should be set to 0 if it is not possible to confirm the presence of that species or that the reproductive-units threshold is met. Each spatial unit should be weighted by area at this stage (e.g., by including area as cost layer), as spatial units may vary considerably in size. Large sites may be subdivided into smaller spatial units, which could form the basis for zoning in any future management plan. If new areas are identified as having very high irreplaceability (i.e. exceeding the 0.9 irreplaceability threshold), return to Step 8 (Section 6.2.8). 6.3.3 Refine ecological boundaries, if necessary, to yield practical KBA boundaries. KBA delineation is not complete until ecological boundaries have been evaluated and refined, if necessary, to yield a manageable site or sites (see Section 7.3 for further guidelines). Involvement of customary rights-holders and stakeholder consultation is important at this stage (see Section 8 for further guidelines). Care should be taken to avoid removing areas that are important for trigger species. 6.3.4 Compile required and recommended documentation under Criterion E.

Delineation is an iterative process that typically involves assembling spatial datasets (Section 7.1), mapping the distribution of trigger biodiversity elements and deriving initial boundaries based on ecological data (Section 7.2), refining ecological boundaries to yield practical KBA boundaries (Section 7.3), and documenting delineation (see the KBA Proposal Process guidance). In most cases, it will not be possible to complete this process in a single KBA identification and delineation workshop with a limited number of participants. Stakeholder consultation and involvement is an essential element of the delineation process (see Section 8 for detailed guidelines). In particular, consultation with a range of knowledge-holders is recommended when assembling spatial datasets, mapping the distributions of biodiversity elements, delineating ecological boundaries, and refining ecological boundaries to yield practical KBA boundaries (Section 8.1). Consensus-building with proposers of existing KBAs (including AZE sites, IBAs and KBAs identified under previous initiatives) is required before existing KBA boundaries are modified and to avoid overlapping KBAs (Section 8.2). Involvement of customary and legal rights-holders is recommended during the delineation process (Section 8.3). Once KBA identification and delineation are complete, additional consultation and involvement will generally be required before advancing any form of conservation or management action that might affect indigenous peoples or other natural resource dependent communities (Section 8.4). Is there a minimum or maximum size requirement for a KBA? There is no absolute minimum or maximum size requirement for a KBA. The size of a KBA will depend on the ecological requirements of the biodiversity elements triggering the criteria, and consideration of site manageability (see Section 7.3). The Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 111 size distribution of existing protected or conserved areas may provide some guidance on the practical scale of management in each region. Sites identified under Criterion C are likely to be larger on average than sites identified under other KBA criteria, as are those in the open ocean compared with ones on land (see Section 5.2.2). Why do KBAs need to be manageable as a unit and what does this mean? The KBA Standard defines \u201csite\u201d as: \u201cA geographical area on land and/or in water with defined ecological, physical, administrative or management boundaries that is actually or potentially manageable as a single unit (e.g., a protected area or other managed conservation unit)\u2026\u201d (IUCN 2016, p. 7). The KBA Standard defines \u201cmanageability\u201d as: \u201cThe possibility of some type of effective management across the site. Being a manageable site implies that it is possible to implement actions locally to ensure the persistence of the biodiversity elements for which a KBA has been identified. This requires that KBA delineation consider relevant aspects of the socio-economic context of the site (e.g., land tenure, political boundaries) in addition to the ecological and physical aspects of the site (e.g., habitat, size, connectivity) \u2026\u201d (IUCN 2016, p. 13). Another aspect of manageability is site accessibility. In some cases, the scale of manageability will be determined by how large an area can be monitored in practice, given the configuration of roads or waterways or the range of typical survey vessels. Taking site manageability into account during delineation will enhance the prospects for biodiversity persistence because conservation actions are more likely to be undertaken. However, the process of KBA identification and delineation does not include steps to advance management activity and does not imply that any specific form of conservation action, such as protected area designation, is required (IUCN 2016, p. 8). A KBA should be a manageable unit, but does not need to be a single management unit. Rather, there needs to be scope for effective management across the site. For example, a site that comprises several different ownership or management units (e.g., a protected area and adjacent private reserve) may be proposed as a single KBA if management can be coordinated across the site. Where a proposed KBA comprises multiple management units, KBA Proposers should make the case that there is scope for some type of effective management across the site to support the persistence of Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "052ced37-2f28-44b1-9a66-a7bcadb2f167": {"__data__": {"id_": "052ced37-2f28-44b1-9a66-a7bcadb2f167", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4be7779f91767cc5114705bf6151c993962b746c27590391e617410da1902ad8"}, "2": {"node_id": "d63615ed-f6b7-4003-a0bc-5b5dff281772", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4db461a3aea77a2d2fc7883f05044d8bfe1e72c5f17f90a79a83cb1c9d12ae85"}}, "hash": "85256dba9667d444426d0f3bb67c968792e010986ca538b511c137239b8cbae5", "text": "1.1 112 trigger biodiversity elements.

KBA Proposers should work to harmonise proposed KBA boundaries with existing ones through consensus-building and agreement with the proposers of existing KBAs (see Section 8.2). (See Resolving complex boundary overlaps for further guidance.) Can KBAs have dynamic boundaries? KBAs should have fixed boundaries because sites displayed in the WDKBA must be stable, although it is anticipated that boundaries may change periodically as additional biodiversity elements are added or distribution patterns shift. Where dynamic features are important, as for many marine species and freshwater/terrestrial species that depend on dynamic or ephemeral habitats, KBAs should be large enough to encompass those features, as long as there is scope for effective management at that scale. KBAs that support trigger biodiversity elements seasonally (e.g., KBAs that support seasonal aggregations under Criterion D1) are also displayed with fixed boundaries in the WDKBA. 7.1 Assembling spatial datasets What types of spatial datasets are useful for KBA delineation? A range of different types of data may be useful for KBA delineation (see Table 7.1 for examples). Data layers should be of an appropriate resolution to form the basis for delineating manageable KBAs.

Ecosystem data: \u2022 topographic data (e.g., elevation, bathymetry, slope, subcatchments, ridges, rivers, seamounts, outer reef passages); \u2022 boundaries of land cover and benthic habitat classes; \u2022 ecosystem type boundaries; \u2022 ecoregion and bioregion boundaries. Existing sites of biodiversity importance: \u2022 boundaries of any existing KBAs (e.g., AZE sites, IBAs and KBAs identified under previous criteria); \u2022 boundaries of other sites of biodiversity importance (e.g., IPAs, Important Marine Mammal Areas (IMMAs)) and designated biodiversity conservation sites (e.g., natural World Heritage sites, Ramsar sites, EBSAs).

However, distribution maps of biodiversity elements are a useful starting point for delineation where there are no existing sites in the area of interest, or biodiversity elements overlap with existing sites but do not align with their boundaries. For well sampled KBA trigger biodiversity elements, it may be possible to derive distribution maps that represent the known local geographic distribution from observed locality data. In contrast, for elements with relatively few sampling localities, it may be necessary to infer the approximate geographic distribution using knowledge of habitat requirements combined with maps of remaining habitat or by using habitat models.

In addition to habitat, it is advisable to consider the spatial aspects of ecological boundaries, including size, edge:area ratio and connectivity with other natural areas. In particular, delineating boundaries that align with natural topographic or habitat features may enhance prospects for the persistence of trigger biodiversity elements. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 115 If distribution maps of KBA trigger biodiversity elements are clipped during this process, it is important to check that the initial KBA boundaries still contain enough of each potential trigger biodiversity element to meet relevant KBA criteria and thresholds. Does the area contained within a KBA need to support a minimum viable population of each trigger species? No. Populations of trigger species within KBAs may form part of a larger meta- population and so do not need to be self-sustaining. The area contained within ecological boundaries needs to meet the relevant KBA thresholds, including the threshold number of reproductive units (if applicable). It should be sufficient to sustain the threshold population size and number of reproductive units during the relevant seasons of the annual life-cycle (e.g., year-round for resident species and seasonally for migratory species), although it is recognised that this information will be unavailable for many species. How can ecological boundaries be defined in wilderness areas? KBA delineation may be challenging in areas of continuous habitat, such as wilderness areas (Upgren et al. 2009). Data on species distributions are often lacking and data on remaining habitat may be of limited use because much of the habitat still remains. The best approach may be to generate predictive maps of species distributions through habitat modelling, validated by additional surveys (see Appendix III). However, where this is not possible, topographic and environmental data such as elevation, bathymetry, ridgelines, seamounts, geological features and other identifiable elements of the land/seascape may be used to delineate provisional ecological boundaries that can be refined using additional data to yield practical KBA boundaries (see Section 7.3.3). 7.3 Refining ecological boundaries to yield practical KBA boundaries KBA delineation is not complete until ecological boundaries are evaluated for their manageability and refined, if necessary, to yield a manageable site or sites. Initial ecological boundaries based on the trigger biodiversity element should be retained for future reference, even if they do not become the final KBA delineated boundary. Refining ecological boundaries to yield practical KBA boundaries will generally involve additional information (e.g., on land/resource tenure considerations) as well as stakeholder input. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 116 Once practical KBA boundaries have been delineated, KBA Proposers should check that these contain enough of each KBA trigger biodiversity element to meet relevant KBA thresholds. 7.3.1 Refining boundaries with respect to existing KBAs KBA delineation must take into account the boundaries of existing global or regional KBAs (including AZE sites, IBAs and KBAs identified under previous criteria). Many of these sites have national recognition, active conservation and monitoring initiatives and/or are linked to legislative and policy processes. This provides an opportunity for reassessment of existing KBAs for the original trigger biodiversity elements (especially if these have not yet been assessed based on the KBA Standard) and a review of manageability. Any reassessment should involve consensus-building with proposers of the existing KBA(s) to the extent possible. The boundaries of an existing global or regional KBA may not be modified in such a way that the site no longer qualifies as a KBA for its original trigger biodiversity element(s) unless there is an agreement with the original proposer that it makes sense to do this (see Fig. 7.3.1 for an overview). Delineation with respect to other sites of biodiversity importance and to protected or conserved areas is treated separately (see Section 7.3.2).

Where KBA trigger biodiversity elements extend beyond the boundaries of an existing KBA, the options are as follows: \u2022 The additional area may be disregarded if it is not important for the persistence of the KBA trigger biodiversity element(s) at the site and the KBA trigger biodiversity element(s) will still meet relevant KBA thresholds if the existing boundary is adopted (Fig. 7.3.1.2a).

The data on the new trigger biodiversity element(s) should be added to the existing KBA\u2019s qualifying data. If the change in boundary affects existing KBA trigger biodiversity elements (for example, it increases the population of a potential trigger species or extent of an ecosystem type contained within the KBA), this information should be updated. \u2022 If the proposers of the existing KBA are unwilling to modify its boundary (for example, because the site is linked to legislative or policy processes, or would no longer be a manageable unit) and the additional area is important for the persistence of the new KBA trigger biodiversity element(s), a new adjacent KBA may be delineated as long as it qualifies independently as a KBA (Fig. 7.3.1.2c). If proposers of the existing KBA are unwilling to modify its boundary and the additional area does not qualify independently, KBA Proposers should seek advice from the KBA NCG or RFP (in that order). The choice between these options will depend on the ecological significance of the areas outside the existing KBA for relevant biodiversity elements, the scale of manageability, and consensus-building with proposers of the existing KBA (see Section 8 on stakeholder consultation and involvement, and Resolving complex boundary overlaps for further guidance). The case for modifying the existing site will generally be stronger if trigger species periodically move between the existing KBA and the additional area, such that coordinated management will likely increase the probability of persistence.

Where the boundaries of other existing sites of biodiversity importance or protected or conserved areas are suitable for the biodiversity elements triggering the KBA criteria and are manageable units, conservation efforts can be strengthened by using the same boundaries for KBA delineation. However, if their boundaries are not suitable for KBA trigger biodiversity elements, a KBA may be proposed that overlaps with other sites of biodiversity importance, or protected or conserved areas (see Fig. 7.3.2 for an overview). Consultation with the managers of other sites of biodiversity importance or protected or conserved areas that overlap with proposed KBAs is recommended as they may have additional relevant information on the spatial extent of biodiversity elements and land/resource tenure and management in the area (see Section 8.1).

Ecological boundaries may encompass multiple management units or jurisdictions (e.g., landholdings, land management agencies, administrative areas). In this context, there are generally three options: \u2022 If the area that lies within management units would qualify independently as a KBA, then identifying a separate KBA in each qualifying management unit will most likely align with the scale of practical management responsibilities and implementation (Fig. 7.3.3.1b).

In some cases, management units may be too large to be useful (e.g., state/ provincial boundaries or EEZs) or may not exist (e.g., in wilderness areas or on the high seas, Fig. 7.3.3.1e). In such cases, the best approach is to base KBA delineation on the ecological data used to derive initial KBA boundaries (see Section 7.2).

The case for a single site will be stronger if non-contiguous areas fall within a single protected or conserved area (Fig. 7.3.4.1), or where a single site is more likely to lead to the effective conservation of the KBA trigger biodiversity element(s).

(Note. Regular shapes are used in these cartoon examples for clarity and are not intended to suggest that protected areas are rectangles or KBAs are hexagons.) Are there any special considerations for delineating sites under Criterion C? See Section 5.2.2. Are there any special considerations for delineating freshwater KBAs? When delineating practical KBA boundaries for sites triggered by freshwater biodiversity, it may be appropriate to take subcatchments (e.g., HydroBASINS level 12) into account, if the amount of non-habitat area within the catchment is limited. The use of broader-scale catchment levels should be avoided. As with all KBAs, there should be scope for effective management across the site. How can freshwater KBAs be aligned with existing terrestrial KBAs? In many cases, freshwater biodiversity elements fall within or align with the boundaries of existing KBAs identified for terrestrial biodiversity. In some cases, however, the boundaries of existing terrestrial KBAs are inappropriate for delineating KBAs for freshwater biodiversity. For example, boundaries that follow rivers may exclude some or all of the area important for freshwater trigger biodiversity elements. Where freshwater biodiversity elements overlap with an existing KBA, KBA Proposers should follow the guidelines in Section 7.3.1. Where freshwater biodiversity elements overlap with other sites of biodiversity importance, or protected or conserved areas, KBA Proposers should follow the guidelines in Section 7.3.2. What if ecological boundaries for single biodiversity elements extend to the landscape or seascape scale? For some biodiversity elements, especially area-demanding species that occur at low densities across large areas of contiguous habitat, it may not be possible to delineate manageable sites that encompass a sufficient quantity to meet a KBA threshold. These biodiversity elements may depend primarily on conservation actions at the land-, water- or seascape scale rather than the site scale of KBAs (Boyd et al. 2008; IUCN 2016, p. 4). What if overlapping biodiversity elements extend to the landscape or seascape scale? In some cases, distribution maps for different biodiversity elements yield multiple polygons that overlap in such a way that ecological boundaries surrounding them extend to the land- or seascape scale (i.e. beyond the scale that is manageable as a unit, Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 126 Fig. 7.3.4.2). In this case, delineation may involve parsing the different biodiversity elements into sites that are manageable in scale. The decision on whether to combine or separate management units into one or more KBAs will depend on whether ecological boundaries for some biodiversity elements align with management boundaries, whether management units qualify independently as KBAs, and the scope for effective management across management units. Figure 7.3.4.2 Ecological boundaries overlap and extend to the landscape or seascape scale. Management units are shown as irregular shapes with a dashed boundary; ecological boundaries are shown as ovals; proposed KBAs are shown as hatched areas.

What about transboundary areas? Transboundary areas are an extreme example of sites where ecological boundaries extend over multiple management units (Fig. 7.3.3.1), and the principles are the same: \u2022 If the area within each country would qualify independently as a KBA, then identifying separate KBAs in each country will most likely align with the practical division of management responsibilities and implementation. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 127 \u2022 If the area within either country is ecologically significant (i.e. essential for the persistence of trigger biodiversity elements) but would not qualify independently as a KBA, and there is scope for effective management across the transboundary site, then a KBA may be delineated across the international boundary. \u2022 If the area within either country is ecologically significant (i.e. essential for the persistence of trigger biodiversity elements) but would not qualify independently as a KBA, and realistically there is no scope for effective management across the transboundary site, the area may meet thresholds for regional significance, once these thresholds have been developed. What if ecological boundaries encompass multiple overlapping jurisdictions? In some cases, different resources or activities are managed by different agencies with spatially overlapping jurisdictions (Fig. 7.3.4.3). For example, fisheries may be managed by the fisheries management agency, shipping by the coastguard, or oil and gas development by an energy management agency. In this context, a KBA may be delineated based on the ecological data used to derive initial KBA boundaries (see Section 7.2). These initial KBA boundaries may be refined using topographic data (e.g., bathymetry, seamounts, and other bathymetric features) as appropriate, as long as there is scope for effective management at this scale. Figure 7.3.4.3. Ecological boundaries encompass multiple overlapping jurisdictions. Management jurisdictions are shown as rectangles; ecological boundaries are shown as an oval; the proposed KBA is shown as the hatched area.

Stakeholder consultation and involvement The purpose of this section is to set out the stakeholder consultation and involvement that is required or recommended during the KBA identification and delineation process prior to publishing details of a confirmed KBA through the WDKBA, consistent with the KBA Standard. The process of KBA identification and delineation by itself does not include steps to advance management activity. According to the KBA Standard, \u201cKBAs are sites of importance for the global persistence of biodiversity. However, this does not imply that any specific conservation action, such as protected area designation, is required. Such management decisions should be based on [subsequent] conservation priority- setting exercises, which combine data on biodiversity importance with the available information on site vulnerability and the management actions needed to safeguard the biodiversity for which the site is important\u201d (IUCN 2016, p. 8). The KBA Guidelines on stakeholder consultation and involvement relate solely to the KBA identification and delineation process, and do not cover steps to advance management activity (but see Section 8.4 for some relevant policies). For the purposes of KBA identification and delineation, we define key terms as follows: \u2022 Rights-holder: has legal or customary tenure or use rights over land/water/resources within a proposed or confirmed KBA; \u2022 Stakeholder: may affect or may be affected by the outcome of the KBA identification and delineation process; all rights-holders are stakeholders, but not all stakeholders are rights-holders; \u2022 Consultation: sharing information and seeking input; \u2022 Involvement: working with rights-holders or other stakeholders to ensure their concerns and aspirations are understood, considered, and reflected in the alternatives developed; \u2022 Collaboration and consensus-building: extends beyond consultation and involvement to building consensus and seeking agreement, where possible. Stakeholder consultation and involvement are important at various stages of the KBA identification and delineation process, as summarised in Table 8.1. Three types of stakeholder consultation or involvement are considered here. These will generally need to be conducted separately, unless the same individuals or organisations are involved: Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d4748b01-b075-4bb9-9dd0-12605c6bcf28": {"__data__": {"id_": "d4748b01-b075-4bb9-9dd0-12605c6bcf28", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "244434f97fb0be36da5138457d6d1087e99450e2fa36131e561098f54d4da678"}, "2": {"node_id": "b41c028d-dec6-4e02-8154-ae50c782eba3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a825ec72634ccc2e67444359f663b9250c1211c758f4dc1e992a9d3f9d845d8f"}}, "hash": "fa26e38f0fa6d8d811f69435f628afad8ab3d84ab29767c78acf650323f1c2c7", "text": "1.1 129 \u2022 consultation with knowledge-holders (Section 8.1); \u2022 consensus-building with proposers of existing KBAs (Section 8.2); \u2022 involvement of customary rights-holders (Section 8.3).

ILK can also play an important role in KBA delineation by ensuring that this is informed by the best available information on customary tenure and resource management systems. Accessing ILK can be complex and will require different approaches in different communities. It is generally advisable to approach the leadership of the community first before going directly to particular knowledge-holders. This should be done with an understanding of the community's cultural practices, language(s) and traditions, in order to ensure any approach to an ILK knowledge-holder is done in a respectful, culturally appropriate manner, recognising they are equal partners in the information- sharing process. It is generally important to build trust with knowledge-holders, be open and transparent about how the information will be used, and consider issues relating to ownership of the information and permission to use the information (see below). The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) Proposed approach to working with Indigenous and local knowledge provides further guidelines on working with ILK. Is Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) required to display KBAs in the WDKBA? The KBA Proposer is responsible for ensuring that FPIC is granted and documented before displaying information based on previously unpublished ILK in the WDKBA. Any KBA proposal that uses data derived from unpublished ILK must be flagged for expert review when the KBA proposal is submitted to the WDKBA; FPIC should be documented (see the KBA Proposal Process guidance). In rare cases, publication of information on KBAs could compromise the value of sacred natural sites (i.e. areas of land or water have special spiritual significance to Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 132 peoples and communities, Verschuuren et al. 2010) if it encourages increased visitation. The KBA Proposer is therefore responsible for ensuring that FPIC is granted and documented before the publication or display of previously unpublished information regarding sacred natural sites, regardless of the information source. The location of sacred natural sites may not be widely known \u2014 it is therefore strongly recommended that KBA Proposers involve relevant ILK-holders, especially when working in regions where sacred natural sites may occur, to avoid revealing information on sacred natural sites inadvertently. Is Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) required before using an indigenous name for a KBA? In regions that are important for indigenous communities, using an indigenous name may capture a site\u2019s local importance and have benefits in strengthening local support for the KBA. KBA Proposers are strongly recommended to involve indigenous peoples and ensure that FPIC is granted before using an indigenous name for a proposed KBA, especially if this is not the name of an existing KBA or the official name of a relevant geographic feature (e.g., the name of a mountain, lake or river used in maps produced by the national cartographic agency). (See the KBA Proposal Process guidance for further guidance on naming sites as KBAs.) How is consultation with knowledge-holders documented? Any consultation with knowledge-holders during the KBA identification and delineation process should be documented. This is especially important if FPIC is required. 8.2 Consensus-building with proposers of existing KBAs Consensus-building with proposers of existing KBAs (including AZE sites, IBAs and KBAs identified under previous initiatives) is required before any existing KBA boundaries are modified to account for additional biodiversity elements or additional criteria (see Section 7.3.1). Mechanisms for contacting proposers of existing KBAs will be provided through the WDKBA. As outlined in the KBA Standard (IUCN 2016, p. 28), the aim is to avoid KBA boundaries that overlap with each other. KBA Proposers are also encouraged to consult with proposers and managers of existing KBAs in the area of interest, even if there is no proposed modification to the boundaries, as proposers and managers of existing KBAs may well have relevant information on the occurrence and distribution Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 133 of biodiversity elements, and managers should be informed of any new KBA trigger biodiversity elements identified for the site.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0e31c538-e7ab-458f-9899-5fd3913cffd2": {"__data__": {"id_": "0e31c538-e7ab-458f-9899-5fd3913cffd2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "822cf8e05c340de990ff91bf902527acdc5cae38435a80cdfe78c6aa50d4bce7"}, "2": {"node_id": "f33a0ee9-c054-4edc-ad4d-693e0e4cb13e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ebbca9f1def3541ae4abbe747605867ee6c649c932b750dae64fe7ea23881212"}}, "hash": "21aabef8b5c4d548d5454ab40dd3293a8ef2dae88296bedc0e378fa5ee3c9e1a", "text": "What happens if proposers of existing KBAs in the area of interest cannot be contacted or do not respond?

How is consensus-building with proposers of existing KBAs documented? KBA Proposers should provide text briefly summarising the process and outcomes of consensus-building with proposers of any existing KBAs that may overlap with a newly proposed KBA when submitting a KBA proposal (see the KBA Proposal Process guidance). This text should provide enough information for the KBA NCG, RFP and the KBA Secretariat to understand and assess the decision and rationale. 8.3 Involvement of customary rights-holders The process of KBA identification and delineation does not directly affect the customary or legal ownership/management/use rights of any rights-holders because KBA identification and delineation does not include any steps to advance management activity. Nevertheless, involvement of customary rights-holders is strongly recommended during the KBA identification and delineation process because KBAs can provide the basis for future conservation and management actions. Customary rights-holders need to be in a position to shape and anticipate this momentum early on, so they can be involved as they wish in decision-making about future management activities. This is especially important in situations where customary rights do not have legal backing and/or indigenous or other natural resource-dependent communities are typically Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 134 marginalised in decision-making processes. FPIC will generally be required before any steps are made to advance management activities that might affect the rights of indigenous and other natural resource-dependent communities (see Section 8.4). Involvement of legal rights-holders (including land/water/resource owners, managers and users) is also encouraged because it engages them in the process and can help identify practical KBA boundaries. Customary and legal rights-holders may also serve as biodiversity knowledge-holders or tenure knowledge-holders (see Section 8.1). How can involvement of customary rights-holders be achieved? In many countries, customary rights-holders are represented at the national level by various national bodies, such as organisations or networks for indigenous or forest- dependent peoples, livestock-holders, fishers, etc. Where this is the case, involvement of customary rights-holders may be facilitated by seeking advice from representative organisations or networks, including advice on how best to reach out to customary rights-holders for particular sites. In most cases, however, involvement of customary rights-holders will take place at the local level. How is involvement of customary or legal rights-holders documented? Any involvement of customary or legal rights-holders during the KBA identification and delineation process should be documented for future reference. In each case, KBA Proposers should provide text briefly summarising involvement efforts and outcomes. This text should provide enough information for the KBA NCG and RFP to understand and assess what was done. 8.4 Beyond KBA identification and delineation Guidance on stakeholder consultation and involvement relating to active management falls beyond the remit of the KBA Guidelines. Here, we note that the IUCN Policy on Conservation and Human Rights for Sustainable Development includes the guiding principle that FPIC is required when IUCN projects, activities, and/or initiatives take place on indigenous peoples\u2019 lands and territories and/or impact natural and cultural resources, sites, assets, etc. More specifically, the IUCN Standard on Indigenous Peoples includes the following principle: \u201cIndigenous peoples are consulted and are active and effective participants in decision-making processes relevant to them and related to conservation activities supported by IUCN.

Do data used in KBA identification and delineation need to be published? In the case of global estimates of assessment parameters that are not derived from IUCN Red List or Red List of Ecosystems assessments and have not been published previously, KBA Proposers should document how these parameters were estimated so that the method can be reviewed and updated in the future. KBA Proposers are responsible for ensuring that data used to estimate site-level values of assessment parameters, or to observe or infer the ecological integrity of a site, are referenced to a publication, are publicly available (e.g., through a free data-archiving service such as the Dryad Digital Repository), or are made available on request. In the latter case, a brief description of the data and data source and contact details for the data-holder should be included in the KBA proposal; this information can then be cited as in litt. (See the KBA Proposal Process guidance for more detailed guidance on required and recommendation documentation to support KBA identification and delineation.) 9.1.1 Sensitive data How are sensitive data treated? In some cases, publication of KBAs or information on species distribution patterns in the WDKBA could put the biodiversity values of those sites at risk. For example, Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 137 publication of information on the localities of remaining populations of a rare species may jeopardise its conservation. A sensitive data flag may apply to any species with an IUCN Red List account published since 2004 that does not include a range map or locality data and to any species with a range polygon coded \u201cGeneralised = 1\u201d (see Appendix III.1 for additional information). KBA Proposers should check with their RFP, who will liaise with the IUCN Red List Unit, before submitting a KBA proposal for these species. KBA Proposers should also follow these principles adapted from the Sensitive Data Access Restrictions Policy for the IUCN Red List. A sensitive data flag should be applied to species that: (a) are listed as CR or EN on the IUCN Red List under Criteria C and D, or have not been assessed for the IUCN Red List but would likely qualify as CR or EN under Criteria C and D; (b) have high economic value; (c) are [listed or would likely be listed as] threatened by trade; and (d) have important sites that are not generally known (i.e. an internet search engine such as Google cannot find these sites). Given that the WDKBA publishes more detailed information on species distributions than the IUCN Red List, a more precautionary approach is appropriate in the WDKBA. Therefore, trigger species may also be flagged as sensitive if: \u2022 the species has a small global population size in the wild and is known to be exploited, collected, traded or utilized, resulting in the death or permanent removal of individuals from the wild (or belongs to a group of species that is exploited in this way); or \u2022 the species is threatened by widespread, unregulated exploitation of wild populations, resulting in the death or permanent removal of individuals from the wild; and: \u2022 the species has a life history that cannot sustain or recover easily from over- exploitation; and: \u2022 the proposed site is not generally known to hold a significant population of the species.

For D1-3, the proportion of the global population size at a site may be observed based on the number of mature individuals. How can the proportion of the global population size at the site be \u201cobserved\u201d? The population size at a site may be observed from well documented recent direct observations of mature individuals (e.g., the number of sea lion females observed nursing sea lion pups at a site). Population size may be based on counts of all mature individuals at a site or on counts of mature individuals in sampling areas (e.g., points, transects, quadrats) together with statistical assumptions about sampling (e.g., point sampling, distance sampling). Animal tracking data collected using devices with high location accuracy (e.g., global positioning system, GPS) and camera traps are considered equivalent to direct observations. Any statistical assumptions regarding the representativeness of sampling or detectability should be justified in the documentation. Note that the definition of \u201cobserved\u201d here is similar to the definition of \u201cestimated\u201d in the IUCN Red List Guidelines (IUCN SPC 2019, Section 3.1); \u201cestimated\u201d is not used in the KBA Standard, except in the definition of mature individuals. How can the proportion of the global population size at the site be \u201cinferred\u201d? The proportion of the global population size at a site may be inferred based on indirect evidence, such as indices of the relative abundance of mature individuals (e.g., the number of sea lion pups at a site may serve as an index of the abundance of mature individuals), or using the area-based assessment parameters (e.g., AOO, ESH, range, or number of localities), as indicated for each criterion in the KBA Standard. Inference is generally based on biological assumptions about the relationship between observed Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 139 variables (e.g., sea lion pups) or modelled output (e.g., ESH) and the variable of interest (i.e. number of mature individuals). Animal tracks may be inferred from analysis of data from low-accuracy geolocators (e.g., light-level loggers). Any biological or statistical assumptions should be justified in the documentation. How recent do data need to be when used to observe or infer the proportion of the global population size or global extent of an ecosystem type at a site, or ecological integrity? Estimates of abundance and distribution are likely to become less accurate over time. Data that were collected more than 8-12 years before the assessment should be used cautiously and only if there is no information suggesting that there has been significant relevant change in global or site-level population size or distribution patterns (i.e. a change likely to affect KBA qualification or delineation). Thus, for example, older data may be acceptable in a remote wilderness area that has seen little change in the last 50 years, but not in one that has seen recent extensive habitat transformation, or where trigger species may have suffered significant decline due to factors such as disease, invasive species, or over-exploitation. See Section 9.2.3 below for confirmation of presence. 9.2.2 Known, inferred and projected occurrences Range is defined as the current known limits of distribution of a species, accounting for all known, inferred or projected sites of occurrence (IUCN 2012a).

Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 140 Note that inferred occurrences may be used to estimate the proportion of the global population size found at a site, but a KBA must include at least one known locality (i.e. confirmed presence, see Section 9.2.3). What are \u201cprojected sites of occurrence\u201d? \u201cProjected\u201d refers to spatially predicted occurrences based on habitat maps or models (IUCN SPC 2019, Section 4.10.7). Any projected occurrences beyond the spatial extent of known localities (as defined by a minimum convex polygon based on known localities) should have a very high likelihood of presence, based on known localities and the species\u2019 dispersal capability. When used to estimate AOO, projected occurrences are subject to the three conditions outlined in Appendix III. Note that projected occurrences may be used to estimate the proportion of the global population size found at a site, but a KBA must include at least one known locality (i.e. confirmed presence, see Section 9.2.3). 9.2.3 Confirmation of presence and reproductive units For all sites proposed as KBAs, the presence of the KBA trigger biodiversity elements at the site must be confirmed and documented (see the KBA Proposal Process guidance). This is especially important where KBA identification relies on area-based parameters (i.e. AOO, ESH, or range). What types of data can be used to confirm species presence? Confirmation of species presence should, ideally, be based on direct observations of mature individuals. Animal tracking data collected using devices with high location accuracy (e.g., GPS) and camera traps are considered equivalent to direct observations. For highly cryptic species, indirect observations (e.g., scat, tracks, burrows, or environmental DNA that can be identified unambiguously to species) may be used to infer presence. Clear justification should be given in the documentation for using indirect evidence. With the exception of CR(PE) or CR(PEW) species, presence cannot be inferred simply from the presence of habitat, or habitat maps or models. What types of data can be used to confirm that the reproductive-units threshold is met? Confirmation that the reproductive-units threshold is met should, ideally, be based on direct observations of the required number of reproductive units or mature Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 141 individuals. Animal tracking data collected using devices with high location accuracy (e.g., GPS) are considered equivalent to direct observations. For highly cryptic species, indirect observations indicating presence of the required number of mature individuals (e.g., active burrows indicating the threshold number of breeding pairs) may be used to infer that the reproductive-units threshold is met. Reproductive units cannot be inferred from the presence of habitat, habitat maps or models, or from a sample that does not meet the threshold. For example, if the reproductive-units threshold is 10 breeding pairs, it is not sufficient to sample 10% of the habitat and find 1 breeding pair; direct observations or indirect evidence of at least 10 breeding pairs would be required, so the sampling area may need to be expanded. What types of data can be used to confirm presence of an ecosystem type? See Section 4.3.4 and 4.4.4. How recent do data need to be when used to confirm species presence or reproductive units at a site? The data used to confirm presence and the number of reproductive units (where required) should, ideally, have been collected within less than 12 years before KBA identification. Older data should be used conservatively and should not be used for species listed as globally threatened on the IUCN Red List under Criterion A2, A3 or A4, for other species known to have suffered recent population declines, or if the site has suffered significant habitat loss or other types of degradation in the intervening period. Clear justification should be given in the documentation for using older data, up to a maximum of 50 years (except for CR(PE) or CR(PEW) species). Data used to confirm presence and reproductive units (where required) in KBA reassessments should not be older than 8-12 years unless the justification for older data is strong and it is very unlikely that the species has been extirpated.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "02ecfaf9-613a-4281-b882-0f6b42346299": {"__data__": {"id_": "02ecfaf9-613a-4281-b882-0f6b42346299", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b9c5e3d7df1dee18ff5fa2614dfcad12091f0961d6ec2e61072da64169778bac"}, "2": {"node_id": "92ea7604-f59c-44c2-a513-4d2c95eeaf2f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1a1f6f2d48180af7d45be30143bda6186797c39f7aa547c766a15963277adc3c"}}, "hash": "80820510f79ba01fce88edd92e4ff95740bba6d6e3c68575eaaf0d1eb96785fc", "text": "How can presence be confirmed for species that are listed as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) or Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct in the Wild)?

How are presence and reproductive units documented? Confirmation of presence and that the number of reproductive units at a site meets the relevant threshold (where required) should, ideally, be referenced to a publication or other publicly available data source (e.g., IUCN Red List account, a peer-reviewed journal article or publicly available site monitoring report). Where this is not possible, the knowledge of one or more named biodiversity knowledge-holders may be used instead. This knowledge should be based on direct or indirect observations as described above and not on inference based on the extent of habitat. Biodiversity knowledge-holders should be able to provide reliable confirmation of species identification. Species that are challenging to identify in the field may be confirmed later through expert verification of specimens, photographs, video or other evidence collected at the site. For each proposed trigger species, KBA Proposers should provide a statement that: a) confirms that the species has recently been observed at the site; b) by a named biodiversity knowledge-holder who can provide reliable confirmation of species identification; c) in numbers that meet or exceed the reproductive-units threshold (where required); d) with a brief description of how reproductive units (where required) are defined for the species; e) the year of observation; f) a reference (e.g., publication, locality database, named biodiversity knowledge- holder with contact details). 9.3 Uncertainty 9.3.1 Types of uncertainty There are two main types of uncertainty that may affect KBA identification: \u2022 Measurement uncertainty, such as uncertainty about the true number of mature individuals at any point in time, can often be reduced by collecting more data (for example, by increasing the sample size or number of sampling occasions) using appropriate sampling, measurement and estimation methods. \u2022 Ecological variation (often called \u201cprocess variation\u201d), such as interannual variation in the true number of mature individuals at a site, can be a source of uncertainty Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 143 as to whether a site qualifies as a KBA, even if the number of mature individuals is counted precisely each year. 9.3.2 Dealing with uncertainty In many cases, the population size at a site will be either well above or well below the threshold for qualification as a KBA. Uncertainty is only significant for KBA identification when the estimated site-level population size lies close to the relevant threshold, such that there is uncertainty about whether or not the site qualifies. For example, if the minimum site-level population-size estimate exceeds the relevant threshold based on the maximum global population-size estimate, then the site would qualify as a KBA regardless of uncertainty. In the process of identifying sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity, it is important to balance the risks of omission and commission errors, i.e. the risks of failing to identify a site that actually qualifies (omission error) and the risks of identifying a site that does not actually qualify (commission error). High rates of omission error may lead to biodiversity loss, but high rates of commission error could deflate the value of identifying KBAs and may dilute conservation resources. Note that the low thresholds for Criteria A1 and A2 relative to the other criteria provide a built-in precautionary approach to identifying sites of importance for globally threatened species and ecosystem types. How to deal with measurement uncertainty? The general principle for handling measurement uncertainty is to balance the risks of omission and commission error. In the context of measurement uncertainty, a site should be proposed if it is more likely than not that it meets the relevant threshold. For example, if the global population size is 10,000 mature individuals, and the site- level population size is most likely greater than 1,000 individuals, then the site population most likely exceeds a 10% threshold. In other words, the site would qualify if there was a greater than 50% chance that it exceeds 1,000 mature individuals. Consider the data summarised in Table 9.3.2.1 \u2014 in this case, the site would qualify because the median estimate exceeds the threshold (i.e. there is a greater than 50% chance that the site population exceeds the threshold).

If no global estimate of the chosen assessment parameter is provided in the WDKBA, KBA Proposers will be asked to provide the best estimate of the assessment parameter at both global and site levels. The same type of estimate should be used at both global and site levels for comparison. Where there is a choice, the order of preference is as follows: maximum likelihood estimate, \u201cbest\u201d, median, mean, midpoint of the maximum and minimum. 14 If the only data available are presence/absence data, then KBA Proposers will need to infer the proportion of the global population size at the site based on one of the area- based assessment parameters, which include number of localities. How to deal with ecological variation? Ecological variation likely occurs to some extent for all species at all sites, as well as for dynamic ecosystem types (e.g., kelp forests). Ecological variation (e.g., fluctuations in a species\u2019 population size or the extent of ecosystem type attributable to random environmental variation) is distinct from long-term trend (see Section 3.1 for guidance on handling trends). Ecological variation is often substantial for sites important for biological processes, such as demographic aggregations (D1), ecological refugia (D2), and recruitment (D3). The general principles for handling ecological variation are based on the application of Ramsar Criteria 5 and 6 (Ramsar 2018). A site predictably holds the threshold population size if the following conditions are met: (i) Interannual variation: the number of mature individuals at the site is known to have met or exceeded the threshold population size in at least two thirds of the 14 If necessary, the maximum likelihood, \u201cbest\u201d and median can be compared to each other. The mean should only be compared to the maximum likelihood, \u201cbest\u201d or median if measurement error is limited. The mid-point of the maximum and minimum should not be compared to the other metrics. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 145 years for which adequate data are available for the relevant season (e.g., the breeding season in the case of a breeding aggregation); the total number of years considered should not be fewer than three; or (ii) Intra-annual variation: the median of the maximum number of mature individuals at the site during the relevant season meets or exceeds the threshold population size; the mean should be taken over at least five years.15 For example, adult female marine turtles return to specific nesting beaches to lay their eggs, but, in most cases, individual females do not return every year, so that the number of nesting females that use a site over a breeding season can vary substantially from one year to the next. Suppose the site threshold under Criterion D1a is 1,000 mature females. Under (i) above, the site would be considered to predictably hold 1,000 mature females during the nesting season if it holds 1,000 mature females in at least two thirds of nesting seasons. Consider the data set out in Table 9.3.2.2. The site would qualify under D1a because the site exceeds threshold numbers in two out of three years. Table 9.3.2.2 Ecological variation.

Reassessment The term \u201creassessment\u201d is used synonymously with the term \u201cre-evaluation\u201d throughout the KBA Guidelines. Confirmed KBAs should be reassessed against the KBA criteria and thresholds at least once every 8-12 years, although more frequent monitoring of KBAs is recommended wherever possible. If the original KBA Proposer is no longer available, the KBA NCG or RFP (in that order) may identify a group to work on reassessment. Reassessment of sites identified as KBAs is especially important in the context of climate change, as climate change may affect biodiversity to such an extent that a site increases in importance and qualifies under additional criteria or loses importance and ceases to qualify. 10.1 Reasons for a change in KBA status Why might the status of a confirmed KBA change? The focus here is on changes in the status of confirmed KBAs and delisting of KBAs.

A site will be retained in the WDKBA after 12 years, but flagged as \u201cneeds updating\u201d. A confirmed KBA will not lose its KBA status solely on the basis of old data or the need for reassessment.16 Earlier reassessment is encouraged, especially in the following circumstances: \u2022 Earlier updates to documentation, and reassessment if appropriate, is encouraged in the case of a taxonomic change to a trigger species; or a change in threat category of a trigger species or ecosystem type for a site confirmed as a KBA under Criterion A1 or A2. \u2022 Earlier reassessment is also encouraged if new information becomes available, or a site suffers a catastrophic event (i.e. a genuine change) leading to the irreversible loss of trigger species or ecosystem type, or to loss of a site\u2019s ecological integrity). Ideally, all trigger biodiversity elements will be reassessed at the same time on 8-12 year cycles, even if some have been added more recently. Interim reassessments of particular species (e.g., following a taxonomic change, change in threat category, or new information affecting a particular species) can be conducted individually without reassessing all other trigger biodiversity elements.

During the reassessment process, KBA NCGs or KBA Proposers should use the following checklist: \u2022 For sites that were confirmed as a KBA under any of the species-based criteria (i.e. A1, B1-3, D1-3), check whether there have been any taxonomic changes to trigger species (see Section 2.2.1). \u2022 For sites that were confirmed as a KBA under Criteria A1 or A2, check whether there has been any change in the threat category of the trigger species or ecosystem type, such that the site no longer qualifies as a KBA under Criteria A1 or A2. \u2022 For each KBA trigger biodiversity element for each confirmed KBA, check whether there has been a change in the global or site-level values of assessment parameters (e.g., based on new or more reliable information), such that the biodiversity element no longer meets relevant thresholds. \u2022 For each KBA trigger biodiversity element for each confirmed KBA, reconfirm the KBA trigger biodiversity element\u2019s presence at the site, in numbers that meet or exceed the reproductive-units threshold, where applicable. It is recommended that data used to confirm presence in KBA reassessments under any of the criteria should not be older than 8-12 years. \u2022 For each confirmed KBA, check whether there have been any changes (including changes in manageability) indicating that KBA delineation should be re-visited. This is especially important for sites considered potentially rather than actually manageable as a unit during the original KBA delineation. Any outstanding overlaps with other KBAs should also be addressed during reassessment.

Sites holding biodiversity elements that are globally restricted, or at risk of disappearing, make high contributions to the persistence of those elements. The global persistence of a biodiversity element occurring at any given KBA, unless it is entirely confined to the site, depends not only on the fate of the site itself but also on that of other sites and of the land-/seascapes where it occurs. Global Global implies that the contributions of a site to the persistence of a given biodiversity element are measured in relation to its worldwide population size or extent. Persistence Persistence of a biodiversity element means that its loss (e.g., species extinction, ecosystem collapse) or decline (e.g., of numbers of mature individuals of a species, ecosystem extent and condition) is avoided, both now and into the foreseeable future. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 164 Significantly/Significant Significant means that an outstanding proportion of a biodiversity element (e.g., species population size or ecosystem extent) occurs at the site, as defined by a quantitative threshold. Site A geographical area on land and/or in water with defined ecological, physical, administrative or management boundaries that is actually or potentially manageable as a single unit (e.g., a protected area or other managed conservation unit). For this reason, large-scale biogeographic regions such as ecoregions, Endemic Bird Areas and Biodiversity Hotspots, and land-/seascapes containing multiple management units, are not considered to be sites. In the context of KBAs, \u201csite\u201d and \u201carea\u201d are used interchangeably. I.2 Terms used in the KBA criteria and delineation procedures Aggregation (Criterion D) A geographically restricted clustering of individuals that typically occurs during a specific life history stage or process such as breeding, feeding or migration. This clustering is indicated by highly localised relative abundance, two or more orders of magnitude larger than the species\u2019 average recorded numbers or densities at other stages during its life-cycle. The KBA Standard refers to a difference in relative abundance of two or more orders of magnitude, but this is advisory rather than required. Other metrics may also be used to support KBA proposals under Criterion D1 (e.g., nearest-neighbour distances). Area of occupancy (Criteria A, B, E) The area within the range of a species that is actually occupied (IUCN 2012a). Assemblage (Criterion B) A set of species within a taxonomic group having: a) their ranges \u226595% predictably confined to a single ecoregion for at least one life-history stage; b) their ranges \u226595% predictably confined to a single biome for at least one life-history stage (for taxonomic groups with a global median range size >25,000 km2); or c) their most important habitats in common with multiple other species. In the definition of \u201cassemblage\u201d, the term \u201cbiome\u201d should be replaced by the term \u201cbioregion\u201d. This will be corrected in the next version of the KBA Standard. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 165 The term \u201cassemblage\u201d is also used in the definition of \u201cecological integrity\u201d, but in a more generic sense. Biodiversity element Genes, species or ecosystems, as used by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) definition of biodiversity (Jenkins 1988). Biological process (Criterion D) The demographic and life-cycle processes that maintain species such as reproduction and migration. Bioregion (Criterion B) Major regional terrestrial and aquatic habitat types distinguished by their climate, flora and fauna, such as the combination of terrestrial biomes and biogeographic realms (Olson et al. 2001) or marine provinces (Spalding et al. 2007, Spalding et al. 2012).

Ecoregion (Criteria B, C) A \u201crelatively large unit of land (or water) containing a distinct assemblage of natural communities and species with boundaries that approximate the original extent of Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 166 natural communities prior to major land-use change\u201d (Olson et al. 2001). Ecoregions have been mapped for terrestrial (Olson et al. 2001), freshwater (Abell et al. 2008) and near-shore marine (Spalding et al. 2007) environments and are nested within bioregions or provinces. Please see Appendix V for ecoregion templates for terrestrial, freshwater and marine systems. Ecosystem type (Criteria A, B) A defined ecosystem unit for standard and repeatable assessment, at an intermediate level in a globally consistent ecosystem classification hierarchy such as macrogroup or equivalent (Faber-Langendoen et al. 2014). It is defined by a particular set of variables related to its characteristic native biota, an abiotic environment or complex, the interactions within and between them, and a physical space in which these operate (Keith et al. 2013, Rodr\u00edguez et al. 2015). Other terms such as \u201cecological communities\u201d and \u201cbiotopes\u201d are often considered operational synonyms of ecosystem type. A detailed description of the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology (Ver. 1.01) was published in 2020. In this hierarchy, biogeographic ecotypes (Level 4) and global ecosystem types (Level 5) are relevant levels for KBA identification (see the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology Ver. 1.01, Table 2 for further details). The KBA Standard also allows for KBAs triggered by equivalent ecosystem types, defined using other globally consistent ecosystem classification hierarchies (e.g., EcoVeg, Faber-Langendoen et al. 2014). For consistency with the definition of ecosystem type in the KBA Standard (see above) and the ecosystem concept used in the Red List of Ecosystems, equivalent ecosystem types should be defined by a particular set of variables related to the characteristic native biota, abiotic environment or complex, the interactions within and between them, and a physical space in which these operate (Keith et al. 2013, Rodr\u00edguez et al. 2015). Endemic (Criteria A, E) A species having a global range wholly restricted to a defined geographic area such as a region, country or site. Environmental stress (Criterion D) Natural events like floods, droughts, storms, wildfires, earthquakes as well as high or low temperature caused by global change; it can also describe the lack of food due to the bottom-up effect of environmental stress or massive die off of prey in ecosystem due to infectious disease. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 167 Environmental stress refers to extreme environmental conditions, whether natural or anthropogenic. Extent of suitable habitat (Criteria A, B) The area of potentially suitable ecological conditions, such as vegetation or substrate types within the altitudinal or depth, and temperature and moisture preferences, for a given species (Beresford et al. 2011). ESH refers to the area of habitat available to a species within its range. ESH cannot extend beyond the range, but may include unoccupied habitat within the species\u2019 range, unlike AOO. ESH is equivalent to \u201carea of habitat\u201d(AOH; Brooks et al. 2019).

Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 168 Localities refer to known points of occurrence, and do not include inferred or projected occurrences or sampling points where the species was not found to occur. For the purposes of KBA identification, old records from areas where the species no longer occurs and vagrancies (i.e. records from areas where the species has only been recorded sporadically and is not known to be native) are excluded from known localities. Each locality should represent a discrete population, to the extent this can be inferred, given the degree of habitat fragmentation and what is known about the dispersal capabilities of the species. Manageability (Delineation) The possibility of some type of effective management across the site. Being a manageable site implies that it is possible to implement actions locally to ensure the persistence of the biodiversity elements for which a KBA has been identified. This requires that KBA delineation consider relevant aspects of the socio-economic context of the site (e.g., land tenure, political boundaries) in addition to the ecological and physical aspects of the site (e.g., habitat, size, connectivity). An additional aspect of manageability is site accessibility. In some cases, the scale of manageability will be determined by how large an area can be monitored in practice, given the configuration of roads or waterways or the range of typical survey vessels. Mature individuals (Criteria A, B, E) The number of individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction as defined in IUCN (2012a). Population size (Criteria A, B, D) The total, global, number of mature individuals of the species (IUCN 2012a). Population size is used throughout the KBA Standard rather than simply \u201cpopulation\u201d, which IUCN (2012a) use to mean the total number of individuals of a species. In the KBA Guidelines, the term \u201cpopulation size\u201d is used to refer to the total number of individuals in a species, as in \u201cglobal population size\u201d; and to the number of individuals in a geographically or otherwise distinct group, as in the \u201csite population size\u201d. This differs from the IUCN Red List, in which the term \u201csubpopulation\u201d is used to refer to a geographically or otherwise distinct group in the population (IUCN 2012a). Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 169 Predictably (Criterion D) An expectation of species occurrence at a site during particular seasons or at one or more stages of its life cycle, based on previous or known occurrence, such as in response to specific climate conditions. Predictable occurrence includes both regular (seasonal) occurrence and irregular (episodic) occurrence, as long as the occurrence is a predictable response to environmental conditions. For Criterion D1, which is based on regular (seasonal) occurrence, a site \u201cpredictably\u201d holds a species if the species is known to have occurred at the site in at least two thirds of the years for which adequate data are available for the relevant season (e.g., the breeding season in the case of a breeding aggregation); the total number of years considered should not be fewer than three. This is consistent with the definition of \u201cregularly\u201d in the application of Ramsar Criteria 5 and 6 (Ramsar 2018). (See Section 9.3.2 for detailed guidelines.) In contrast, Criterion D2 is based on irregular (episodic) occurrence. The term \u201cpredictably\u201d is not used in Criterion D2, but consistent with D1 and D3, a site may be considered to hold a species during periods of environmental stress if the species is known to have occurred at the site in at least two thirds of the periods of environmental stress for which adequate data are available.

A site \u201cregularly\u201d holds a species if the species is either continually present or occurs there on a predictable cyclical basis, typically (but not necessarily) following a seasonal pattern.

Additional examples of five reproductive units include: \u2022 birds: 5 active nests; 5 pairs; or 5 mature females and at least 1 mature male in lekking species; \u2022 amphibians: 5 mature females and at least 1 mature male for most species; 5 pairs for species that provide biparental care; \u2022 turtles: 5 mature females for marine turtles on nesting beaches; \u2022 fish: 5 mature females and at least 1 mature male for most species; 5 pairs for species that form bonded pairs (e.g., some seahorse species); \u2022 insects: 5 females and at least 1 male for non-social insects; 5 colonies with a single reproducing queen each for social insects; 5 reproductive females for parthenogenetic insects; \u2022 cooperative breeders: 5 cooperative units (e.g., 5 packs of African Wild Dog, Lycaon pictus); \u2022 fungi: 5 mature individuals; Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 171 \u2022 plants: 5 mature individuals for self-fertilising monoecious or hermaphroditic species; \u2022 clonal species: 5 distinct clones. Restricted range (Criterion B) Species having a global range size less than or equal to the 25th percentile of range- size distribution in a taxonomic group within which all species have been mapped globally, up to a maximum of 50,000 km2. If all species in a taxonomic group have not been mapped globally, or if the 25th percentile of range-size distribution for a taxonomic group falls below 10,000 km2, restricted range should be defined as having a global range size less than or equal to 10,000 km2. For coastal, riverine and other species with linear distributions that do not exceed 200 km width at any point, restricted range is defined as having a global range less than or equal to 500 km linear geographic span (i.e. the distance between occupied locations [i.e. localities] farthest apart). Species known only from their type locality should not automatically be assumed to have a restricted range, since this may be indicative of under-sampling. Note that range, not ESH, must be used for identifying restricted-range species. The minimum threshold for restricted range is set at 10,000 km2 as a precautionary measure. A list of all species that have been assessed for the IUCN Red List that qualify as restricted-range (using the 10,000 km2 threshold for any taxonomic group that has not yet been comprehensively assessed) is provided on the KBA website.

The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems Categories and Criteria (Version 2.0) were established as a standard by IUCN (2014), based on Keith et al. (2013), not by \u201cIUCN (2015)\u201d as erroneously cited in the KBA Standard. The formatting (but not the content) of these has been updated in the two versions of the RLE Guidelines produced to date (IUCN 2016b, 2017). Threshold (Criteria A-E) Numeric or percentage minima which determine whether the presence of a biodiversity element at a site is significant enough for the site to be considered a KBA under a given criterion or subcriterion. Trigger (Criteria A-E) A biodiversity element (e.g., species or ecosystem) by which at least one KBA criterion and associated threshold is met. I.3 Additional terms The following terms defined here were not defined in the KBA Standard. Biogeographic ecotype (Criteria A, B) Biogeographic ecotypes (Level 4) are defined as: \u201cAn ecoregional expression of an ecosystem functional group derived from the top down by subdivision of Ecosystem functional groups (Level 3). They are proxies for compositionally distinctive geographic variants that occupy different areas within the distribution of a functional group.\u201d (See the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology Ver. 1.01, Table 2 for further details.) Ecological refugium (Criterion D) In the KBA Standard (IUCN 2016a), ecological refugia are sites that maintain necessary resources (such as food and water) during periods of environmental stress (such as severe droughts) when conditions elsewhere become inhospitable, sometimes over multiple years or decades. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 173 Note that the KBA Standard states that ecological refugia are used in times of environmental stress. Sites where individuals concentrate in times of environmental plenty (e.g., when prey is available at unusually high densities) do not meet this definition. Extent of an ecosystem type (Criteria A, B) Extent of an ecosystem type refers to the current geographic distribution of an ecosystem type, representing all spatial occurrences of the ecosystem type (IUCN 2017, p. ix). Equivalent system (Criterion A) Equivalent systems refers to regional- or national-based assessment processes that produce global status assessments that: i) are based on similar criteria to the IUCN Red List and can be reliably cross-walked to the IUCN Red List; ii) set similar standards for minimum supporting documentation and involve an appropriate process of independent review; and iii) are implemented by recognised assessment bodies in the region/country in question, based on science and input from scientists/ experts throughout the entirety of each species\u2019 range. (See Appendix VII for further details.) Global ecosystem type (Criterion B) Global ecosystem types are defined as: \u201cA complex of organisms and their associated physical environment within an area occupied by an ecosystem functional group. Global ecosystem types grouped into the same ecosystem functional group share similar ecological processes, but exhibit substantial difference in biotic composition.

Estimating ESH If there is no validated ESH map or the ESH map needs updating, the first step for KBA Proposers seeking to use ESH as an assessment parameter is to download the existing range map or develop a new range map (see Appendix III.1). Typically, ESH takes into account a species altitudinal/bathymetric limits, other physiological limits (e.g., temperature, salinity), and major habitat types (e.g., land cover, or benthic habitat), as appropriate. (See Appendix III.4 for a more in-depth review of methods.) ESH maps have been developed for birds (Beresford et al. 2011), mammals (Rondinini et al. 2011), and amphibians (Ficetola et al. 2015).

A similar approach may be applied in marine systems, using bathymetry and other physiological limits (e.g., sea-surface temperature and salinity) together with benthic habitat classes. An ESH map is typically a raster (i.e. set of grid cells), but may be a polygon. Once a range map is available, ESH can be delimited as follows: i. in a GIS, rasterise the range map into grid cells (optional); ii. remove cells or areas that fall outside the altitudinal/bathymetric or climate/temperature/salinity/soil type limits of the species distribution; iii. remove cells or areas that are otherwise unlikely to be suitable for the species, based on land cover or benthic habitat. If ESH is based on grid cells, the proportion of a species\u2019 ESH that is found within a site will depend in part on the spatial resolution of analysis. Analysis at a finer spatial resolution (for example, using 1-km2 or 4-km2 grid cells rather than 100-km2 grid cells) will generally lead to a lower global ESH and make it more likely that a site that falls entirely within the ESH exceeds the thresholds specified in the criteria. The standard resolution for AOO is 2 x 2 km grid cells; a link to a standardised 2 x 2 km grid is Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 182 provided on the KBA website. KBA Proposers are encouraged to use this grid for ESH where appropriate, but may use other resolutions if the 2 x 2 km grid is not suitable given the species\u2019 distribution patterns or the resolution of available data. The final ESH raster or polygon(s) should include all known, inferred or projected occurrences (including conservation translocations but excluding vagrancies), and all habitat (with unsuitable areas removed). ESH maps should be validated with independent occurrence data. In the documentation, KBA Proposers are requested to include sufficient information on datasets and mapping procedures to enable reproduction of the final ESH layer, and describe the process whereby the ESH map was created and validated (including the degree of expert engagement). III.3 Estimating area of occupancy (AOO) Existing data on AOO For some species that have been assessed for the IUCN Red List, AOO may have been defined and mapped already. AOO maps must be validated before they can be used in KBA identification. Validated AOO maps will be provided through the IUCN Red List, if available. Estimating AOO If there is no validated AOO map or the AOO map needs updating, KBA Proposers seeking to use AOO as an assessment parameter should see the IUCN Red List Mapping Standards for detailed guidelines on mapping AOO. Habitat maps and models cannot be used to estimate a species\u2019 AOO directly because they map areas of habitat that may presently be unoccupied (i.e. outputs are closer to ESH than AOO). Low habitat-occupancy may result because factors other than habitat are limiting, such as exploitation, availability of prey, impacts of predators, competitors or disturbance, dispersal limitations. Habitat maps and models may therefore need to be filtered to produce a valid depiction of AOO for use in KBA identification. In some cases, filtering out areas that are unlikely to be occupied may be fairly straight-forward. For example, projected occurrences in habitat patches that are small and distant from habitat patches with known localities may be filtered out using knowledge of the species\u2019 dispersal limitations; projected occurrences in areas close to roads or human population centres may be filtered out if hunting is a threat; areas that lack recent known occurrences and are known to have been affected by pathogens may be filtered out. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 183 The IUCN Red List Guidelines (IUCN SPC 2019, Section 4.10.7) provide the following three conditions for using habitat maps or models to estimate AOO: i) Habitat maps and models must be justified in the documentation as accurate representations of the habitat requirements of the species and validated by a means that is independent of the data used to construct them.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf800fb0-9792-4a8d-b5e6-78809f4861f6": {"__data__": {"id_": "bf800fb0-9792-4a8d-b5e6-78809f4861f6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a7d3a969a6f3c84ae7741ad318deecb780425cd4d28bfa023823cc105285ba6a"}, "2": {"node_id": "c3badb79-7001-4b86-a7d6-3c0a6df1c553", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6684880ca7f53c8ed841aa2c39a4166b02f9206405618153a5830514357252b4"}}, "hash": "295836bea2caede7a3c0f8753987f3a64389397db0f25cf6add1a860af35e138", "text": "ii) The area of potential habitat must be filtered to produce an estimate of the area of occupied habitat. iii) The estimated area of occupied habitat derived from the map must be scaled to the reference scale of 2 x 2 km.

III.4 Note on habitat maps and models Habitat maps show the distribution of habitat for a species and are used as the basis for estimating ESH. Habitat maps may be based primarily on expert knowledge (deductive models) or statistical analysis (inductive models). Statistical habitat models may also be referred to as species distribution models, ecological niche models, bioclimatic models, density distribution models, etc. For some species, including many pelagic marine species, statistical models may represent the best available method for estimating the distribution of mature individuals. Mapping habitat based on published data and expert knowledge (deductive models) This type of approach is well suited to developing consistent binary habitat maps (e.g., ESH maps) for entire taxonomic groups, including data-limited species. It is well suited to sedentary species and species with fixed breeding and/or non-breeding habitats. It is less well suited to species with spatially dynamic habitats, including many pelagic marine species. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 184 Mapping habitat and distribution based on statistical analysis (inductive models) Habitat models may also be developed by applying statistical methods (e.g., generalized linear or additive models, classification or regression trees) to known localities and topographical and environmental covariates (Elith & Leathwick 2009; Franklin 2010; Zurrell et al. 2020). Statistical habitat models are generally used to estimate (a) the probability of occurrence of the species, and/or (b) the expected relative densities (in terms of numbers of individuals or biomass) based on correlation between known localities and topographical/environmental covariates. A threshold may be used to generate a binary map of habitat (e.g., an ESH map) by selecting areas with high versus low probability of occurrence or high versus low expected densities. Alternatively the results may be used to estimate the absolute or relative distribution of mature individuals directly. This type of approach requires a large number of sampling localities (presence only, presence/absence, or abundance) and is usually applied to a single species or small group of species because of the data, technical, and computational demands. Statistical analysis can account for variation in sampling effort and detectability. This type of approach is generally better suited than deductive approaches to species with spatially dynamic habitats, including many pelagic marine species. Validation and review of habitat maps and models used in KBA assessments Habitat maps and models can vary widely in quality and accuracy. A map or model may not provide an accurate representation of habitat if key variables are omitted. For example, a map would overestimate the habitat of a forest-dependent montane species if it identified all forest areas as potential habitat, irrespective of altitude. Any habitat maps or models used in KBA assessments should therefore be subject to a critical evaluation based on biological and statistical considerations, where applicable. The selection of environmental covariates should be based on knowledge of the biology of the species and not simply fitted statistically from a pool of candidate variables that are conveniently available. Appropriate methods for statistical model evaluation should be employed, including validation using independent datasets. Habitat maps and models that have not been published in the peer-reviewed literature should be sufficiently rigorous to pass peer review.

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.04960 Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 186 Appendix IV: Mapping ecosystem extent Spatial data showing the extent of biogeographic ecotypes (Level 4) will be made available through the Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) website once mapping is complete. For global ecosystem types (Level 5), KBA Proposers should use the following guidelines on estimating the extent of an ecosystem type (i.e. geographic distribution), extracted from the RLE Guidelines (IUCN 2017, p. 46 ff). Remote sensing is a common approach for mapping the geographic distributions of many terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Global data sets, such as those available for forests (Hansen et al. 2013), mangroves (Giri et al. 2011), water cover (Pekel et al. 2016), and coral reefs (Andr\u00e9fou\u00ebt et al. 2006), may provide a useful basis for superimposing appropriate classifications of ecosystem types. Spatial proxies for ecosystem distributions, such as climate, substrate, topography, bathymetry, ocean currents, flood regimes, water cover, aquifers or some synthesis of these that can be justified in the documentation as valid representations of the distribution of ecosystem biota or its niche space may be used in some cases. Physical factors such as sea floor characteristics, ocean currents, water temperatures and water chemistry may be appropriate predictors of ecosystem distribution for marine ecosystems. Spatial distribution models offer an additional opportunity to formally select and combine the most suitable set of spatial proxies to predict ecosystem distributions. Clark et al. (2015), for example, used bathymetric spatial data and remote sensing data on sea ice concentration to model the distribution of suitable light conditions for under-ice marine benthic invertebrate communities in Antarctic waters. When using spatial proxies or developing spatial distribution models, a mechanistic understanding of the relationship between occurrence of the ecosystem and limiting environmental factors is essential for developing a valid representation of the geographic distribution of an ecosystem type. Spatial distribution models should follow best practice recommendations for each model type and should be validated (see IUCN SPC 2019, p. 76). Once the geographic distribution of an ecosystem type has been assessed using the methods described above, areas that have been lost to settlement, agriculture or other forms of habitat conversion should be removed before calculating the global and site- level extent of the ecosystem type. The spatial resolution (e.g., pixel size) of an ecosystem map should be as fine as practical, consistent with the input data and the scale of the ecosystem (e.g., Fig.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "36677ec4-4923-4a35-8425-c42fa72b037f": {"__data__": {"id_": "36677ec4-4923-4a35-8425-c42fa72b037f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d3d39c6b07c12607b16303397ebf96be3d56fbc4f13179bd8c440acddda63271"}, "2": {"node_id": "0a096560-e1e0-4c2f-bb21-ae1d55ee01cb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8b499f990f525e76098710b575056d1d649ebc10cc18ba01bb3048259dffbe6c"}}, "hash": "4801ce33ddf24f118f9ac50ff7fe526cfb83aaa7f44ace085b9328712c8d1621", "text": "Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 187 AIV.1).

Irreplaceability can be measured using various metrics. Pressey et al. (1994) proposed a method that was computed as the number of representative combinations including the focal spatial unit divided by the total number of representative combinations, but this is computationally costly and cannot be calculated for large numbers of spatial units. Ferrier et al. (2000) proposed two methods, including summed irreplaceability, but this can exceed a value of 1 and is not easily rescaled, which makes it difficult to use in Criterion E assessments. The software Marxan (Ball et al. 2009) approximates irreplaceability by running an algorithm with the objective function of minimising the total network area or cost, subject to the constraint of achieving the representation targets. The algorithm is run a large number of times and the irreplaceability of each spatial unit is approximated by its selection frequency. This is the most widely used approach for estimating irreplaceability. However, it is based on a large number of suboptimal solutions \u2014 it can approximate irreplaceability if Marxan can find near-optimal solutions, but selection frequencies across spatial units will then tend to 0 or 1. CLUZ (Smith 2019) is a user-friendly GIS plug-in that links to Marxan. With integer linear programming methods now available in tools such as prioritizr (Hanson et al. 2017), it is possible to calculate the optimal solution for a given conservation planning problem. Given a single optimal solution, the selection frequency for each spatial unit will be 0 or 1. prioritizr provides two alternative methods for estimating irreplaceability \u2014 the replacement cost method (Cabeza & Moilanen 2006) is recommended for Criterion E analysis. A practical limitation of Marxan is that the maximum number of planning units that can reasonably be included is 50,000 (Ardron et al. 2010). Above that number, results tend to become unreliable. This limitation is not present in prioritizr and analysis is Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 194 possible with >1 million planning units (Schuster et al. 2019a). Another limitation of Marxan is that analyses take a long time to run. A recent study found that prioritizr generated high quality solutions 1,000 times faster than Marxan for realistic conservation scenarios (Schuster et al. 2019b). Given the various ways that irreplaceability can be estimated, KBA Proposers should clearly document the method used to enable proper review. References Ardron, J.A., Possingham, H.P. and Klein, C.J.

Species that can trigger KBA Criterion A1 are: \u2022 species assessed as globally threatened (i.e. CR, EN or VU) on the IUCN Red List; and \u2022 species that (a) have not been assessed globally and (b) are endemic to the region/country in question and (c) have been assessed as regionally/nationally threatened following the Guidelines for Application of IUCN Red List Criteria at Regional and National Levels (IUCN 2012b) or equivalent systems. What are equivalent systems? Equivalent systems refers to regional- or national-based assessment processes that produce global status assessments that: i) are based on similar criteria to the IUCN Red List and can be reliably cross-walked to the IUCN Red List; ii) set similar standards for minimum supporting documentation and involve an appropriate process of independent review; and iii) are implemented by recognised assessment bodies in the region/country in question (e.g., NatureServe in the USA/Canada, the Threatened Species Scientific Committee in Australia), based on science and input from scientists/ experts throughout the entirety of each species\u2019 range. By definition, equivalent systems have demonstrated consistency with IUCN Red List assessments and so can serve as reliable proxies. There are taxonomic groups with large numbers of species that have not yet been assessed for the IUCN Red List that have been assessed as globally threatened under equivalent systems. Allowing such species to trigger KBAs under Criterion A1 expands the scope of Criterion A1 to include taxonomic groups that have not yet been assessed for the IUCN Red List in a way that is consistent with the IUCN Red List and hence with the intent of the KBA Standard. What if there is a mismatch in taxonomy? Each species in the WDKBA must have a unique identification number, unique scientific name, and a single status assessment, as per the database that underpins the Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 197 IUCN Red List (i.e. the Species Information Service, SIS). This is essential for the functionality of the WDKBA. In the case of a mismatch in taxonomy, the species concept used for KBA identification must be consistent with the species concept used in the SIS. In the case of a simple difference in nomenclature for the same species concept (e.g., Morus capensis in SIS; Sula capensis in the equivalent system), the difference in nomenclature should not impede KBA assessment. On the other hand, where there is a difference in treatment of a species or species complex (e.g., Canis lupus lycaon is recognised as a subspecies of C. lupus on the IUCN Red List, but as a distinct species in some other systems), a KBA may only be triggered by a full species recognised by the IUCN SSC Red List Authority or IUCN Red List Unit (see Section 2.2.1). (See Section 2.2.1 for detailed guidelines on the process for updating taxonomy in the case of new information.) What if there is already a global IUCN Red List assessment? Equivalent systems may only be used for species that do not have a global IUCN Red List assessment.22 If the global IUCN Red List assessment is flagged as \u201cneeds updating\u201d, it is strongly recommended that all efforts are made to update the IUCN Red List assessment prior to KBA identification. The KBA Proposer should request that the national/regional assessment body prepare an updated IUCN Red List account and submit it to the relevant IUCN SSC Red List Authority. In addition, the KBA Proposer may ask the their RFP to request that the IUCN SSC Red List Authority update the assessment for the species.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "73a04a19-c76c-4775-ac8d-a76b33f735e6": {"__data__": {"id_": "73a04a19-c76c-4775-ac8d-a76b33f735e6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines for using A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas : version 1.1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "070c000090786ac59cbf645e925e00515471145eaa89066f96823de5649a0659"}, "2": {"node_id": "614709bb-73f7-43d4-a3ab-99902bfb535d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guidelines-using-global-standard-identification-key-biodiversity-areas-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5287e43358a3287b319461fc6f8af01e1a6d5c07de12719418f61d6bbe0de779"}}, "hash": "1ec1c7154279d19eb700e2c26fcfe0a969e291da67c75a86afeb2c7a271388b8", "text": "If the national/regional assessment body provides the required information, but the IUCN SSC Red List Authority does not submit an updated assessment for publication on the IUCN Red List within a reasonable timeframe, the KBA Proposer may request the KBA Secretariat (through their RFP) to allow that the equivalent system assessment be used in the interim for species that are endemic to the region or country where the equivalent system is recognised.

This does not qualify as having an IUCN Red List assessment for the purposes of this appendix. A species listed as \"Data Deficient (DD)\" does not have adequate data to assess its extinction risk using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria. This qualifies as having an IUCN Red List assessment for the purposes of this appendix. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 198 (in particular, the delay should not reflect a significant disagreement about the species\u2019 status). Decisions will be made on a species-by-species basis. (Please note that this option may no longer be available once the WDKBA is fully linked to the SIS. This Appendix will then be updated accordingly.) What about non-endemic species? Regional- or national-based equivalent systems cannot be used for species that are not endemic to the region or country where the equivalent system is the recognised (e.g., USA/Canada for NatureServe\u2019s G-ranks, Australia for species listed under Australia\u2019s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act). Given that each species can only have a single global status in the WDKBA, this stipulation minimises the potential for conflict over status assessments (for example, because the assessor is not recognised as the relevant assessment body in some part of a species\u2019 range and/or different assessments are made for the same species by different regional/national authorities). For non-endemic species that have been identified as globally threatened by equivalent systems, the best solution is for the KBA Proposer to request that the national/regional assessment body prepare an IUCN Red List account and submit it to the relevant IUCN SSC Red List Authority. In addition, the KBA Proposer may ask their RFP to request that the IUCN SSC Red List Authority prioritise assessment of the species. Where does the responsibility lie for determining whether a system meets the criteria for use as an equivalent system? The KBA Standards and Appeals Committee has the responsibility for verifying that criteria (i) and (ii) above are met, namely that the criteria are similar and there is a reliable cross-walk and that documentation standards and review are appropriate. NCGs are responsible for determining whether (iii) is met, namely that the assessment agency is the recognised authority in the region/country, and whether assessments are based on science and input from scientists/ experts throughout the species\u2019 range. Are NatureServe\u2019s G-ranks considered an equivalent system? Yes, NatureServe\u2019s G-ranks are considered an equivalent system, as defined above, as the system complies with the three criteria established above. Specifically, species that (a) have not been assessed globally for the IUCN Red List and (b) are endemic to North America and (c) have been assessed as possibly extinct (GH), possibly extinct in the wild (GHC), critically imperiled (G1) or imperiled (G2) can trigger KBA Criterion A1. Guidelines for using A Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs, Ver. 1.1 199 For the purposes of KBA identification, species listed as GH, GHC or G1 are considered equivalent in status to species listed as CR or EN on the IUCN Red List; whereas species listed as G2 are considered approximately equivalent in status to species listed as VU on the IUCN Red List (Master et al. 2012). Rounded NatureServe G-ranks should be used when a species has been assigned a range rank (e.g., G1G3 is rounded to G2). Species assessed over 8-12 years ago should be reassessed prior to being used to identify KBAs.

no landscape or seascape, not even the poles or remote islands, has escaped To effectively address the accelerated growth in plastic waste and leakage into the environment, a systems approach to addressing the problem is needed The footprint model, and its application in the Mediterranean in this report, is an example of using a systems approach to identify actions that address the growing problem of plastic impacts on ecosystems This report focuses on the Mediterranean basin for several reasons The region represents a perfect model to advance our understanding of plastic: it is a semi-enclosed sea, making the definition of plastic mass balance and the comparison between modelling approaches and field sampling approaches easier It has also been the subject of many oceanographic field studies and thus many plastic measurements are available to help the design of local and achievable solutions Additionally, the Mediterranean Sea is surrounded by countries with contrasting socio- economic realities and is therefore a good model to investigate and then shape a wide variety of actions related to both plastic waste and primary microplastics These characteristics of the Mediterranean basin make this region a perfect choice to reconcile the results of modelling with sampling approaches and provide an answer to the question, \u201cHow much plastic is in the sea?\u201d This report is part of a series of publications under IUCN\u2019s Close the Plastic Tap programme The main goal of this report is to fill knowledge gaps and contribute to the triggering of preventative and remedial actions in the countries bordering the Mediterranean basin A first step towards action is to identify and quantify the most critical types of plastics and plastic products discharged into the Mediterranean Sea The report refines the estimates of the quantity of plastic currently floating into the Mediterranean, based on a compilation of data from field studies and using the footprint methodology to estimate the yearly input of plastic into the Mediterranean Sea The report also assesses the efficiency of a series of actions currently undertaken around the Mediterranean basin and, coupled with the modelling of hotspots for priority action, recommends targeted priorities for the countries bordering the sea The analysis can serve as a tool to monitor the progress of current initiatives The report also highlights some of the challenges of modelling with existing data, where disparities can result across different modelling and sampling studies To improve both confidence in estimates of plastic waste and the application of systems- based thinking requires paying more attention to the mechanisms to collect, store and share the data required for such assessments The development and application of a common framework to harmonise procedures for plastics pollution monitoring is an important foundation if science-based decision-making on plastic pollution is to be mainstreamed globally Minna Epps Director, IUCN Global Marine and Polar Programme The Mediterranean: Mare plasticum exeCutive summary vii Executive summary Widely regarded as one of the most threatened environments in the world, the Mediterranean Sea is subject to a now ubiquitous, man-made disaster: plastic pollution As a result of high population densities, lack of consistent waste-management schemes, and large influxes of tourists and strategic merchant navigation, this environment is under significant pressure This study is the first of its kind to combine: \u2022 An estimate of the plastic stock, i e the quantity of plastic accumulated in the sea (Part 1); \u2022 An estimate of the plastic leakage, i e the yearly flux of plastic flowing into the sea (Part 2); \u2022 An assessment of key actions that could contribute to closing the \u201cplastic tap\u201d in the Mediterranean Sea (Part 3) The total plastic accumulated in the Mediterranean Sea is estimated in the order of magnitude of 1,178,000 tonnes, with a possible range from 53,500 to 3,546,700 tonnes There is high uncertainty in this estimate as most research undertaken so far has focused mainly on the plastic accumulated at the sea surface, which constitutes less than 0 1% of the total stock This study estimates a central annual plastic leakage of 229,000 tonnes (low and high leakage estimates equate to 150,000 and 610,000 tonnes year -1 respectively), made up of 94% EGYPT FRANCE SWITZERLAND SLOVENIA CROATIA BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA SERBIA KOSOVO ALBANIA N.

The Mediterranean basin The Mediterranean Sea, originally the \u201cMare Medi Terra\u201d, literally meaning the sea surrounded by land, is is exposed to many human activities, counting approximately half a billion inhabitants when including hydrological basins (449,074,896 inhabitants considered in the present report) It is one of the busiest and most strategic navigational corridors in the world, as well as a very attractive destination with more than 342 million tourists in 2015 (UNWTO, 2015) For the purpose of this study, we have considered 33 countries (Figure 2 1), either coastal or part of a hydrological basin flowing into the Mediterranean Sea Due to high population densities on the coast and around the rivers draining into the sea, the Mediterranean area is considered to be the most affected environment in the world in terms of plastic pollution (C\u00f3zar et al , 2015) A semi-enclosed sea with limited exchanges with the Atlantic Ocean (Tanhua et al , 2013), it is prone to plastic accumulation (Ramirez- Llodra et al , 2013) It is composed of two basins of approximately equal size (the western basin bordered by Spain, France, Italy, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco, and including the Adriatic Sea, and the eastern basin bordered by Greece, Turkey, the Levant, Egypt and Libya) Watershed LEGEND 0 500 1000 1500 2000 km EGYPT SUDAN SOUTH SUDAN UGANDA RWANDA BURUNDI ETHIOPIA KENYA FRANCE SWITZERLAND SLOVENIA CROATIA BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA SERBIA KOSOVO ALBANIA N.

Aim of our work The focus of this report is to answer three fundamental questions: \u2022 How much plastic is currently accumulated in the Mediterranean Sea? \u2022 How much plastic is leaking into it every year? \u2022 What are the most efficient strategies to alleviate plastic leakage in the Mediterranean region within the next 20 years? This report is therefore divided into three distinct parts and has three overarching objectives Part 1: Current situation Using the best available data, we will extrapolate published plastic concentrations in Mediterranean sub-basins to the entire Mediterranean Sea The report aims to advance the data and knowledge available on plastic accumulation for different sea compartments: sea surface, seafloor, water column, stranded plastics on the shoreline, and ingested in specific marine organisms Table 2.1: Estimated inputs of plastic litter and concentrations provided in the literature How much plastic is currently floating in the Mediterranean Sea?

Limitations of our approach and need for additional research are further discussed in section 3.4. Plastic debris accumulating on the shoreline (or within the sand).

Marine mammals are also under threat from bigger debris (e.g. bags, nets). All plastic debris that is present at the surface layer of the sea.

The box model The proposed box model consists of 5 compartments as presented in Figure 3 1 There is a clear imbalance regarding the amount of data available for each compartment, with the water column being much less documented than other compartments (absence of any published article specific to the Mediterranean region, at the time of the analysis) The goal of the present study is to estimate the likely mass of plastic accumulated in the Mediterranean Sea However, analysis of the literature revealed that results are often stated in terms of abundance (particle counts) and thus could not be extrapolated Such data is therefore not used This was found to be the case for articles related to both plastics on the seafloor and ingested in organisms Preliminary findings from the literature review are synthesised in Figure 3 2 above, which sets out the status of and main gaps in the knowledge 2.2. Extrapolation methodology The challenge of our approach is to extrapolate plastic quantities for each compartment of the box model based on punctual concentrations reported in the scientific literature and official reports (NGO, international organisations, etc ) This is made harder by the significant differences between the sampling and analysis methodologies used by the different authors Due to this lack of a standardised approach in sampling plastics at sea, and an insufficient number of replicates, only a few sets of data were tested using statistical analysis (non-parametric tests) For each of the five compartments of the box model, the extrapolation methodology follows a series of four steps, as presented in Figure 3 3 The full database with all articles and the individual concentration data used to calculate mean concentrations per compartment (steps 1 and 2 in Figure 3 3) can be found in the appendix (page 55 onwards) Disparate assessment campaigns. North-western basin concentrates the wide majority of the research. Beaches are the main study area. Plastics are usually found at high tide / storm-level lines. Plastics of all sizes are reported. The shore acts as an emission and retention area. Monitoring protocols used: Clean Coast Index, OSPAR Commission Guidelines for Monitoring Marine Litter on the Beaches, UNEP Operational Guidelines for Comprehensive Beach Litter Assessment. Plastic is usually the main component of marine debris. Degradation rates, understanding of the accumulation patterns of plastic on shoreline. General lack of data. For the Mediterranean Sea, plastic is likely to accumulate sporadically in creeks, bays or islets. - What we know - What we know - Knowledge gaps - Knowledge gaps - What we know - Knowledge gaps - What we know - Knowledge gaps - What we know - Knowledge gaps Presence of ingested debris in several \ufb01sh species and marine mammals (red mullet, blue shark, sperm whale).

Water column concentrations: 325 tonnes (range 0\u2013705) Key findings from the literature The question of whether plastic is accumulated in the water column is still being debated There is currently no available data for this compartment in the Mediterranean region; however some recent studies have investigated the distribution of plastic of a different sizes range (from 10 \u00b5m to 5 mm) within the water column (between the surface and 1000 m depth) in the Atlantic and Pacific regions (Reisser et al , 2015; Enders et al , 2015; Choy et al , 2019) We propose to use the findings of these studies to evaluate whether the water column could be a significant accumulation compartment for plastic in the Mediterranean The main findings of the above-mentioned studies are summarised below: \u2022 Macroplastics and mesoplastics that are positively buoyant concentrate on the surface \u2022 Microplastics with size > 300\u00b5m follow the same dynamic, as their concentration decreases exponentially with depth, with no detectable plastic below 5 m (Reisser et al , 2015) \u2022 Small microplastics (<300\u00b5m) behaviour in the water column is more complex It is assumed that microplastics of 100 \u00b5m and 10 \u00b5m are widely dispersed in the water column (up to 250 m according to Enders et al , 2015, and up to 1000 m according to Choy et al , 2019), with maximum abundance potentially driven by the position of the pycnocline (the layer of water in which there is a steep gradient in density with depth \u2013 International Seabed Association) These studies discuss the potential role of the water column in concentrating the \u201cmissing plastic\u201d i e the quantity of plastic estimated by models but not yet discovered in the marine environment The number of (smaller) particles dispersed in the water column seems to largely overcome the (larger) particles present at the surface, and estimating a mass remains a very challenging endeavor Extrapolation and sensitivity analysis Based on the findings from Enders et al (2015), for both microplastic particles (in the size range 10\u2013300 \u00b5m) and microplastic fibres (in the size range 10\u20132,500 \u00b5m), assuming that 40% of all microplastics identified are attributed to fibres, we derive that approximatively 30% of all particles/fibres have a size > 300 \u00b5m and

(assumed to be a 1 metre layer) and reaching up to 12 particles m -3 at a depth of around 200 m with a slow decrease up to 1,000 m, we can deduce that there may be 2,000 times more particles below the

morphology, feeding behaviour and spatial distribution of each individual will greatly influence the plastic ingestion, thus these results are an indication rather than a tangible fact 2.3.6. Shoreline: 1,020 tonnes (range 32\u20132,551) The extrapolation for shoreline plastics was based on the Ocean Conservancy \u201cBuilding a Clean Swell\u201d report For the Mediterranean region, 12 countries were cleaned through beach clean-up campaigns, each clean up varying in size and effort For each of these countries, the following information was provided: The Mediterranean: Mare plasticum 20 Current situation \u2022 Mass of plastic removed (kg); \u2022 Length of coast cleaned (km); \u2022 Total items collected Through GIS analysis, the coast length of each of these countries was calculated The average plastic mass per kilometre of coast was extrapolated to the entire coastline Because litter does not accumulate evenly, we bring forward three hypotheses: 1%, 32% and 80% of the coast likely to retain plastic debris The 32% scenario was kept as a central value based on the proportion of sandy beaches on coastlines worldwide (Earthobservatory, 2016) The average value for plastic accumulated per kilometre of coastline from countries with data was applied to the countries without data 2.4. Key takeaway points from the plastic accumulation assessment and knowledge gaps As main takeaways, the following points are to be considered: \u2022 Most of the current research is focusing on the sub-300 \u00b5m and < 200 mm size fraction at the surface while most of the plastic seems to accumulate in other compartments of the sea \u2022 Some compartments \u2013 such as the water column, marine organisms and the seafloor \u2013 would require further research as they could possibly be holding the \u201cmissing fraction\u201d of marine debris The data regarding these compartments is still very scarce and we lack an understanding of the vertical distribution and size distribution of microplastics and nanoplastics throughout the water column, as well as mechanisms for entering the food web \u2022 It is obvious that the north-western section of the Mediterranean Sea concentrates most of the research effort The eastern section urgently needs new investigations Many studies using numerical models to predict plastic loading on the sea surface also predict higher amounts in the eastern sector This can be attributed to very long residence time of surface waters due to lack of exchange with the North Atlantic (Van Sebille et al , 2015) \u2022 There is a need to develop models to better understand the contribution of point sources (cities, rivers) This limitation is preventing researchers from establishing possible correlations between point emissions and concentrations recovered at sea As a matter of fact, the inclusion of hydrological parameters (e g gyres or water stratification) and understanding the settling pathways governing the transport of debris towards the seafloor are the essential next steps towards better understanding the plastic pollution in the Mediterranean Sea We are conscious of the limitations of our approach; however, the objective is to provide orders of magnitude It also constitutes a framework for other researchers to replicate the approach once new and more standardised data are available The Mediterranean: Mare plasticum Current situation 21 Overarching question Level of certainty green: very likely orange: likely red: uncertain Assertion How much plastic is accumulated in the Mediterranean Sea?", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e4834465-0ff6-4574-98ab-bb75235c3bd1": {"__data__": {"id_": "e4834465-0ff6-4574-98ab-bb75235c3bd1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/mediterranean-mare-plasticum", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Mediterranean : Mare Plasticum", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/mediterranean-mare-plasticum", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0a2dcc2269da7e083debcd8f8f6a61c164757d8f91f58101d6e76db6627f28a4"}, "2": {"node_id": "a6a394f4-4cd6-4daa-94d8-300d00a77d6b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/mediterranean-mare-plasticum", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d14198b1b78e453aaf432bd4ef8e98e58f9141d429791c1e79f197f4f73cdeba"}}, "hash": "8297239c2322b57270272a975d4df399374276a533d772ea56528d66f8c8557a", "text": "Several tens of thousands of tonnes of plastic are currently accumulated in the Mediterranean Sea The total plastic accumulated in the Mediterranean is estimated in the order of magnitude of 1,178,000 tonnes, with a possible range from 53,500 to 3,546,700 tonnes Where is the plastic accumulated?

Plastic footprint How much plastic is leaking into the Mediterranean sea every year? The Mediterranean: Mare plasticum PlastiC FootPrint 23 This section intends to answer the following question: How much plastic is leaking into the Mediterranean Sea every year? The majority of marine plastics originate from land, reaching oceans and seas through several pathways, such as rivers and sewage systems This leakage concerns all plastic sizes, from nanoplastic particles to macroplastic debris Data extracted from the literature indicates that the Mediterranean Sea is widely affected by this pollution (cf Chapter 3), with a significant stock of plastic accumulated in different compartments Chapter 4 will focus on assessing the flows of both macroplastics and microplastics from land to sea (i e the leakage), using a \u201ctop-down\u201d modelling approach based on socio-economic activity data from the countries This report tackles both leakage in the form of macroplastics from mismanaged waste, as well as leakage from four plastic commodities known to release primary microplastics in the environment: \u2022 tyre dust generated during driving; \u2022 fibre shedded during the washing of synthetic clothes; \u2022 microbead release in cosmetics; \u2022 industrial spills of plastic production pellets Primary microplastics refer to plastic entering the marine environment already in a micro format, due to the alteration of its chemical composition (marine paint, tyre abrasion) or intentionally manufactured in a sub-millimeter format (microbeads, pellets) (Boucher, Billard et al , 2019) Beyond providing a better understanding of the plastic leakage hotspots in the Mediterranean region (essential to drive solutions), this modelling approach is complementary to the approach based on field studies presented in Chapter 3 Indeed, this complementarity of the two approaches will reinforce the argument that plastic leakage is real This has already been demonstrated on a smaller scale in Lake Geneva, Switzerland (Boucher, Faure, et al , 2019) 3.1.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fa525e14-4c3b-4a4a-b66b-8142d0618a53": {"__data__": {"id_": "fa525e14-4c3b-4a4a-b66b-8142d0618a53", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/mediterranean-mare-plasticum", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Mediterranean : Mare Plasticum", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/mediterranean-mare-plasticum", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "116d830725e81a44567b8bc194f49bd447eceed457034fc45d77460dd01828c2"}, "2": {"node_id": "09542273-b958-409e-954f-25eb9bfc3f56", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/mediterranean-mare-plasticum", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f5dcec869e6ceac847a5b21e51a9644a42c706e9a105cd8051a489e2834cb9e6"}}, "hash": "c20dc696c7ee63369bdcc2c0ebfb021d96b40ca8d8d5f8078431536eb850e10d", "text": "The marine plastic footprint model applied to the Mediterranean basin This assessment is based on the newly developed methodology by the same authors previously applied to the Baltic basin, in the Marine plastic footprint report (Boucher, Billard, et al , 2019), for macro-sized, mismanaged plastic waste and microplastics We thus provide here only a summary of the approach;

Key takeaway points from the plastic footprint assessment and knowledge gaps Uncertainties underlying these conclusions stem from two main causes: the structural uncertainties and the parametric uncertainties The structural uncertainties in the model primarily result from three aspects: 1 Our fragmented understanding of the leakage pathways Indeed the release rate matrix used in the model (Boucher, Billard, et al , 2019), allowing the calculation of more region-specific release rates based on distance to shore and catchment run-off, has not been calibrated and relies mainly on expert judgement Overarching question Level of certainty green: very probable orange: probable red: uncertain Assertion How much plastic is leaking into the Mediterranean Sea every year? The quantity of plastic flowing every year into the Mediterranean Sea is in the order of magnitude of 229,000 tonnes year-1, with a low and high estimate of 150,000 and 610,000 respectively Leakage into the Mediterranean Sea is dominated by macroplastics from mismanaged waste (94%) as the average mismanaged waste fraction in the basin is very high (67%) Where are the key plastic leakage hotspots? Based on current waste management information, the three hotspot countries for macroplastic leakage are Egypt, Italy and Turkey, together contributing over 50% of the total leakage The ten most contributing countries are responsible for over 80% of the total leakage in the Mediterranean basin For primary microplastics (13,196 tonnes year -1), tyre dust is the largest source of leakage (53%), followed by textiles (33%), microbeads in cosmetics (12%), and production pellets (2%) The three most contributing countries are Italy (3,000 tonnes year -1), Egypt (1,200 tonnes year -1) and Uganda (990 tonnes year -1) The Nile watershed represents a significant input of total leakage into the Mediterranean Sea (25% of total inputs) The top 100 localities generate 23% of the total microplastic leakage, a key finding that could serve to prioritise action The coastal areas are responsible for 30% and 35% of microplastic and macroplastic leakage respectively Per capita leakage is more significant in countries with a high proportion of mismanaged waste and with a high proportion of their population living in coastal areas (e g Montenegro) Mean per capita leakage of macroplastics is 1 kg year -1, ranging from 0 02 kg year -1 for Ethiopia to 8 7 kg year -1 for Montenegro Mean per capita leakage of microplastics is 40 grams year -1; ranging from 10 grams (Serbia) to 200 grams year -1 (Malta) The Mediterranean: Mare plasticum PlastiC FootPrint 33 2 Littering rates are considered as being constant for all countries (2%) It is known that this parameter may vary widely from one country to another (due to culture and differing street cleaning and sweeping operations), as illustrated in Figure 4 10 3 The model does not account for maritime sources because of a lack of data It is therefore not possible to estimate the relative importance of this source, which may influence the overall conclusions of the study The parametric uncertainties in the model result from the following data-related challenges: 1 The results are mainly driven by the mismanaged waste index (MWI) In general, this index is very high in the Mediterranean basin (67%), with a few countries displaying a comparatively lower index in the north- western sector This study used waste management data provided by the World Bank (Silpa et al , 2018) extrapolated to plastic The data rely on the information provided by each country based on its own waste generation patterns To fine-tune this data, a case-by-case waste characterization should be conducted to see if the data reflect the reality for plastic 2 Microplastic estimates are still uncertain Such uncertainty applies to, for example, the loss rate of plastic pellets as the plastic industry cannot currently provide better estimates 3 The parameters for tyre dust rely on a study that is not necessarily representative of the whole study area (Boucher, Billard, et al , 2019; Unice et al , 2018a; 2018b) As previously stated, this report has relied on the best available data and some future research is required To compare the predictions of the model and the concentrations reported in the literature, a measure of ground-truthing is required As previously stated, microplastic data, as well as the parameters required to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "46885e8b-e9b5-4cd4-aada-35f496d00aae": {"__data__": {"id_": "46885e8b-e9b5-4cd4-aada-35f496d00aae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/mediterranean-mare-plasticum", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Mediterranean : Mare Plasticum", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/mediterranean-mare-plasticum", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d6858529b1c58aa61f34c581cf5d71be509a2d90675c95674ff1784ffe83aedb"}, "3": {"node_id": "6ea59a1e-01f6-4331-baaf-634e087f40cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/mediterranean-mare-plasticum", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "34c89bf02270f035fb41f9aeaf46bbc4eb19de3601b01d2650b04378f4ac14c3"}}, "hash": "710c95cc8aa0b54d27ce83d57681db1dcdfcbd811b4800eae9f331e2299ae43a", "text": "calculate the leakage (e g road coverage), would benefit from a higher level of precision This study has considered only areas with direct contact to the sea We refer to this methodology as the watershed approach Waste generation data, population numbers and environmental parameters are all factors that are input into the model to calculate plastic leakages As it has focused on a smaller scale, this report presents lower orders of magnitude that some Littering in Italy Overflowing bin in Switzerland Refugees in Greece Figure 4.10: Multiple examples of plastic leakage pathways: not everything can be modelled in a plastic leakage assessment (photos from the author \u2013 \u00a9 Julien Boucher).

The Mediterranean: Mare plasticum 36 drawdown sCenarios 4.1. Inventory and assessment of key high-level actions to mitigate plastic leakage in the Mediterranean Sea Various solutions have been put into practice in the Mediterranean region, including bans and taxes on certain plastic goods, improvements to recycling and collection facilities, and clean-ups targeting plastic waste on beaches and in the sea (for a review see Appendix 1 10) This section intends to model a set of these interventions that could be applied to the Mediterranean basin in order to mitigate plastic leakage Figure 5 1 below summarises the key actions that have been studied: five actions concern bans, two actions concern lifestyles and behaviours, three actions concern waste and wastewater management, and finally one action is related to clean-up activities (post-leakage intervention) They represent high-level potential actions for the purpose of identifying orders of magnitude of potential leakage savings, and thus prioritising further research and actions The description of these actions and the quantitative hypotheses used are provided in Figure 5 1, together with the result in terms of leakage reduction per year; detailed data sources are provided in Appendix 1 9 and Appendix 1 10 We conclude that the most efficient actions are related to the improvement of waste management, a global ban on plastic bags, and the collection of floating debris in the Nile river (taking advantage of the presence of multiple dams on the river) Furthermore, action 9 shows that addressing the waste management in the 100 most contributing cities around the Mediterranean basin would eliminate a quarter of the total leakage The list of these target cities is provided in Appendix 1 8 The results also show that current planned interventions consisting of bans of some specific items are far from sufficient for solving the plastic crisis and restoring a healthy Mediterranean Sea 4.2.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template":

challenge and would not produce results overnight: marine plastic pollution has high inertia, and only by acting now will we have the ability to reduce this inertia to its minimum before environmental

Ce programme a pour objectif de fournir des informations de base sur la faune menac\u00e9e du Maroc afin de mener des actions de gestion visant \u00e0 la conservation de ces esp\u00e8ces et de la biodi- versit\u00e9 en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Dans une premi\u00e8re phase lanc\u00e9e en 2019, les d\u00e9nombrements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ax\u00e9s sur les grands rapaces rupicoles diurnes au Maroc et les menaces qui p\u00e8sent sur eux.

Introduction Le Maroc est un territoire cl\u00e9 pour les oiseaux de proie car, non seulement il h\u00e9berge un nombre important de ces esp\u00e8ces, mais il fait \u00e9galement partie de la voie migratoire et du domaine vital de nombreux rapaces. Ce territoire est aussi un lieu d\u2019interaction entre les populations du nord de l\u2019Afrique et du sud de l\u2019Europe. L\u2019interaction entre les diff\u00e9rentes sous-populations est sans aucun doute un grand avantage pour leur conservation. Plus de 40 esp\u00e8ces de rapaces, nicheuses ou migratrices, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9es sur le territoire marocain, dont plusieurs m\u00e9riteraient que des mesures de conservation soient mises en \u0153uvre de fa\u00e7on planifi\u00e9e avec tous les acteurs concern\u00e9s. En effet, ces oiseaux subissent les effets n\u00e9fastes de divers types de menaces telles que la fragmentation et la destruction de leurs habitats, la pers\u00e9cution directe, l\u2019impact des infrastructures \u00e9lectriques et l\u2019utilisation incontr\u00f4l\u00e9e de poi- sons, pesticides ou d\u2019autres polluants. Au Maroc, des travaux pr\u00e9liminaires sur l\u2019incidence des facteurs de menace pour les oiseaux de proie ont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 l\u2019existence d\u2019importantes sources de mortalit\u00e9 dues aux \u00e9lectrocutions dans les lignes \u00e9lectriques dangereuses1,2. Dans ce cadre, le Centre de Coop\u00e9ration pour la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e de l\u2019UICN (UICN-Med) et le D\u00e9partement des Eaux et For\u00eats (DEF) du minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Agriculture, de la P\u00eache Maritime, du D\u00e9veloppement Rural et des Eaux et For\u00eats du Maroc ont entam\u00e9 en 2015 une fructueuse collaboration en mati\u00e8re de conservation des rapaces menac\u00e9s, avec le soutien technique du Gouvernement r\u00e9gional de l\u2019Andalousie (Junta de Andaluc\u00eda). Ainsi, diverses activit\u00e9s de transfert de connaissances entre techniciens et gestionnaires des deux rives de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e en relation avec cette th\u00e9matique ont \u00e9t\u00e9 organis\u00e9es, y compris un s\u00e9minaire international, des ateliers de formation et la publication de rapports techniques. Pour contribuer au renforcement de la connaissance des populations de rapaces et de vautours au Maroc, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9largir les donn\u00e9es disponibles, une formation sur les m\u00e9thodes de d\u00e9nombrement et de suivi de ces esp\u00e8ces a \u00e9t\u00e9 organis\u00e9e \u00e0 Tanger en octobre 2018. En suivant la feuille de route convenue dans ladite formation et les actions identifi\u00e9es comme n\u00e9cessaires pour avancer dans l\u2019\u00e9laboration de la strat\u00e9gie nationale de conservation des rapaces, le D\u00e9partement des Eaux et For\u00eats et l\u2019UICN-Med ont lanc\u00e9 en 2019 le Programme de d\u00e9nombrement de la faune au Maroc (appel\u00e9 \u00ab Programme Atlas \u00bb).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8fd85b59-6a93-41b9-82f6-7697952c21cc": {"__data__": {"id_": "8fd85b59-6a93-41b9-82f6-7697952c21cc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/premier-denombrement-national-des-rapaces-rupicoles-diurnes-du-maroc", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Premier d\u00e9nombrement national des rapaces rupicoles diurnes du Maroc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/premier-denombrement-national-des-rapaces-rupicoles-diurnes-du-maroc", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8a930200f9d04745acb08af482a5a46f30f3c7eea5236afaa09b5506234cde22"}, "2": {"node_id": "f8783a8b-7648-456a-b284-a49da763ad20", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/premier-denombrement-national-des-rapaces-rupicoles-diurnes-du-maroc", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2b32feed16aba2165988ff8bc1b7c6db30da9d2445e4dcf12c82d8219f2cf50e"}}, "hash": "523f0537e358006e6c04053925f8eed93daae5d2e1d7ce0a79af81d5c260b7ec", "text": "L\u2019objectif g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Programme Atlas est d\u2019initier un programme plus vaste de suivi \u00e0 long terme de la faune ma- rocaine, en particulier la plus menac\u00e9e, en fournissant des informations de base, rigoureuses et aussi compl\u00e8tes que possible, afin de mener des actions de gestion visant", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a2c2e687-3bd7-48c6-a3b9-fd51399c68e3": {"__data__": {"id_": "a2c2e687-3bd7-48c6-a3b9-fd51399c68e3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/premier-denombrement-national-des-rapaces-rupicoles-diurnes-du-maroc", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Premier d\u00e9nombrement national des rapaces rupicoles diurnes du Maroc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/premier-denombrement-national-des-rapaces-rupicoles-diurnes-du-maroc", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2442962fa6a058c99705ab2a12f710c4784beac1736ecf23221cb3dce229b0f0"}, "3": {"node_id": "c5101aa0-a924-4518-a905-e2a023ad190e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/premier-denombrement-national-des-rapaces-rupicoles-diurnes-du-maroc", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b2baf014a165b62d52bd6bf28e73cd8bd42343697d099f6f25f3bab64cbe63c"}}, "hash": "34670200e1c8e6e7c892046a6ae4a0b9bb983c5d10c353ebcc8378aaa0dfab11", "text": "\u00e0 la conservation de ces esp\u00e8ces, en particulier, et de la biodiversit\u00e9 r\u00e9gionale en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.

Parmi celles-ci, les rapaces rupicoles diurnes ma- rocains pr\u00e9sentent une s\u00e9rie de caract\u00e9ristiques qui les rendent particuli\u00e8rement int\u00e9ressants en termes de suivi : \u2022 Ils vivent dans un habitat aux caract\u00e9ristiques tr\u00e8s sp\u00e9cifiques, plus ou moins simple \u00e0 caract\u00e9riser. \u2022 Ils sont relativement faciles \u00e0 recenser et il est donc facile d\u2019obtenir un chiffre fiable pour leurs populations, de sorte que les programmes de suivi offrent des informations assez fiables en termes de tendances.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c5101aa0-a924-4518-a905-e2a023ad190e": {"__data__": {"id_": "c5101aa0-a924-4518-a905-e2a023ad190e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/premier-denombrement-national-des-rapaces-rupicoles-diurnes-du-maroc", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Premier d\u00e9nombrement national des rapaces rupicoles diurnes du Maroc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/premier-denombrement-national-des-rapaces-rupicoles-diurnes-du-maroc", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2442962fa6a058c99705ab2a12f710c4784beac1736ecf23221cb3dce229b0f0"}, "2": {"node_id": "a2c2e687-3bd7-48c6-a3b9-fd51399c68e3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/premier-denombrement-national-des-rapaces-rupicoles-diurnes-du-maroc", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "34670200e1c8e6e7c892046a6ae4a0b9bb983c5d10c353ebcc8378aaa0dfab11"}}, "hash": "0b2baf014a165b62d52bd6bf28e73cd8bd42343697d099f6f25f3bab64cbe63c", "text": "\u2022 Le groupe comprend des esp\u00e8ces rares, certaines en mauvais \u00e9tat de conservation et \u00e0 tendance n\u00e9gative sur l\u2019ensemble du continent africain, tel le Gypa\u00e8te barbu, le Vautour percnopt\u00e8re, le Vautour fauve et le Vautour de R\u00fcppell. \u2022 Plusieurs de ces esp\u00e8ces sont en commun avec la rive nord de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, avec des flux d\u2019individus entre les deux continents, de sorte que l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat pour la conservation de leurs populations est partag\u00e9 par d\u2019autres pays en plus du Maroc.

Le cadre g\u00e9ographique initial du Programme portait sur tout le territoire marocain, d\u2019une superficie approximative de 685 194 km2. La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape du protocole a \u00e9t\u00e9 de d\u00e9finir les unit\u00e9s de re- censement et de faire la s\u00e9lection des territoires/habitats \u00e0 couvrir en priorit\u00e9 par les \u00e9quipes de terrain. Pour la d\u00e9finition des unit\u00e9s de recensement, le plan d\u2019\u00e9chantillonnage s\u2019est bas\u00e9 sur des grilles de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence cou- vrant tout le territoire, de tailles diff\u00e9rentes en fonction de l\u2019\u00e9chelle du travail et imbriquant les plus petites dans de plus grandes.
