against Women (CEDAW). The Committee named marriage and family life and the safety and security of women and children as priorities for law reform. In order to work towards consistency with CEDAW in these areas, the Committee recommended the development of a comprehensive civil Family Law Bill to replace and modernize the disparate pieces of legislation that currently govern family law in the Cook Islands. It presents the results of a desk review commissioned by the UNDP Pacific Centre to identify good practice law reform options in six areas pertaining to family law in the Cook Islands. The publication does not recommend any particular approaches for the Cook Islands rather it identifies the range of different good practice approaches that could be adopted to achieve legislative consistency with CEDAW. It was developed to help inform a consultation held in Rarotonga in February 2010 in which local participants discussed and recommended the approaches best suited to the culture and context of the Cook Islands, and to inform the draft Family Law Bill that was subsequently developed for the Government of the Cook Islands. Family law in the Cook Islands is currently governed by a complex range of legislation that is now largely outdated including; the Marriage Act 1973, the Marriage Amendment Act 2007, the Cook Islands Act 1915, the Cook Islands Amendment Act 1994, the Infants Act 1908, the Prevention of Juvenile Crime 1968 and the Matrimonial Property Act 1976 (NZ). The Constitution of the Cook Islands 1965 guarantees men and women the equal protection of the law, but it does not guarantee them equal benefits or outcomes. The Constitution guarantees a range of fundamental rights and freedoms \u2018without discrimination on the grounds of sex\u2019 but it does not define discrimination to include direct and indirect discrimination. Further, the Constitution does not expressly bind actions of either private actors or public authorities and institutions, leaving the scope of the anti-discrimination provisions unclear. The drafting of a single, clearly articulated and contemporary Family Law Bill provides the Cook Islands with the opportunity to develop a legal framework that is reflective of the values and context of contemporary Cook Islander society, including national commitments to gender equality and the implementation of CEDAW. It will also provide the opportunity to replace and modernize the old laws, which reflect the norms and values of the former colonizing countries at the time they were adopted. Whilst there are a number of components that are universally required in a civil family law to reflect good modern practice and to be CEDAW compliant, the specific culture and context of the Cook Islands will provide the framework for considering which good practice approaches, including non- discriminatory customary practices, in each of the key areas are the most appropriate for the Cook 1. 2. 3. 4.

A modern CEDAW compliant Family Law Bill has the potential to improve the accessibility of family law to a wide range of parties and to provide an important contribution from the Cook Islands to good practices for other Pacific Island countries, and globally. The six areas reviewed in this paper are; i) marriage, ii) the end of marriage, iii) the care of children, iv) spousal and child support, v) domestic violence and vi) property division after marriage or relationship breakdown. For each of the six areas this policy paper identifies; the current relevant law in the Cook Islands (or where there are gaps in the current laws) and the range of components that are essential to a comprehensive, good practice and CEDAW compliant civil Family Law Bill. For each component, the policy paper identifies a range of good practice approaches (based on international conventions to which the Cook Islands is a party including CEDAW, the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), international declarations and commentary, relevant academic literature and government and non-government reports). Finally, the paper provides a range of good practice examples that illustrate how different countries have approached each particular component or issue in their respective law(s).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7f9679c2-ce8f-4281-a869-039c99844cf7": {"__data__": {"id_": "7f9679c2-ce8f-4281-a869-039c99844cf7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing the Implementation of CEDAW in the Cook Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "037f9b41061d492a9d4bc157d82bb8fc214fba21875c5cf22a70a55fa085c0b0"}}, "hash": "037f9b41061d492a9d4bc157d82bb8fc214fba21875c5cf22a70a55fa085c0b0", "text": "Where possible examples from Oceania have been chosen (Pacific Island countries and territories, New Zealand and Australia) but this publication also provides international comparison by drawing on examples from around the world that represent aspects of good practice in various laws. The law of inheritance is an important aspect of family law in which serious discrimination against women occurs when law and practice do not treat females equally with men. Many legislative frameworks worldwide, including in the Cook Islands, continue to provide that male family members receive larger portions of an inheritance. This is often justified in part, by stereotypes about the roles that women and men should play within the family and the community, and stereotyped assumptions that women will marry and leave the family of origin. The complexity of the issues involved in inheritance in the Cook Islands context, and the national stakeholders\u2019 decision that there needs to be comprehensive consultations on these issues before proposals for inheritance law reform are pursued, has led to the exclusion of inheritance from this publication, and the drafting of the civil Family Law Bill that it accompanies. However, because of its importance, inheritance is an area which should be among the priorities for future law reform initiatives in the Cook Islands. Marriage Marriage is governed in the Cook Islands by the Marriage Act 1973 . Reform in this area would be best achieved through amendments to the Marriage Act. Marriage is limited by the Marriage Amendment Act 2007 to persons of opposite gender. A recognition that the principle of non-discrimination requires that marriage rights be available equally to all members of the community has led to the extension of marriage to same-sex couples or the establishment of domestic registered partnerships and civil unions in many countries throughout the world. In the Pacific region in 2009 the French collectivities of Wallis and Futuna and New 5. 6. 7. 8.

There are two situations in which a marriage is automatically void under the Marriage Act 1973. A void marriage is one where the marriage is not recognized as having ever existed in law. This is different from ending a legally recognized marriage through divorce. The first situation in which a marriage is automatically void is if the two people being married are within specified prohibited degrees of relationship (i.e. siblings and parents and children are not allowed to marry each other because of their close genetic relationship etc). The second reason for voiding a marriage is if one of the parties is still married to someone else. There is however, no active requirement for consent in the Act, nor a process for voiding a marriage if full and free consent was not obtained as is required by Article 16(1)(b) of CEDAW. Both of these necessary components should be incorporated into the Marriage Act 1973 in order for there to be compliance with CEDAW (as reflected in CEDAW legislative compliance indicator 16.2). The minimum age for marriage in the Cook Islands is currently 16. However, minors (which in the Cook Islands has been applied to include all persons between 16 and 21) cannot marry in the Cook Islands without the consent of both parents. The CEDAW and the CRC recommended minimum age of marriage is 18 for both women and men. The CEDAW Committee in its Concluding Comments to the Cook Islands in 2007 urged the Cook Islands \u2018to raise the minimum age of marriage for women to 18 years, in line with article 16(2) of the Convention, the Committee\u2019s General Recommendation 21 and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\u2019 The CEDAW Committee has explained that a low legal age of marriage may prevent girls from continuing their education, lead them to drop out of school early and may result in difficulties in their achievement of economic independence and empowerment. Raising the age of marriage to 18 would satisfy CEDAW legislative compliance indicator 16.3. The End of Marriage Separation is governed in the Cook Islands by the Cook Islands Amendment Act 1994 and divorce is governed by the Cook Islands Act 1915 and the Family Proceedings Act 1963 (NZ).

In the Cook Islands, divorce procedures are still based on fault, which means proving a matrimonial offence (typically desertion, adultery or cruelty). Although divorce is often a difficult process for all involved, placing blame on one or both parties, by using fault as the legal basis for granting a divorce, is no longer appropriate. A fault-based approach is criticized for interfering with the autonomy and independence of both men and women and each person\u2019s right to choose when to enter and leave relationships. In addition, fault based divorce often exacerbates hostility and bitterness between the parties and this is often not in the best interests of any children. It can also make it difficult for women to leave violent relationships since the requirement to provide evidence of a specific matrimonial crime may force them to provide evidence of situations 9. 10. 11. 12. GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 12 that are humiliating, embarrassing or frightening. International obligations and contemporary good practice standards now specifically require that fault not be used as a requirement or prerequisite for obtaining a divorce. In response, modern separation and divorce laws have shifted and progressed from a reliance on finding one of the spouses at fault, towards neutral and non- adversarial systems of divorce. The introduction of a no-fault divorce procedure into Cook Islands law would satisfy CEDAW legislative compliance indicator 16.13. Two good practice no-fault approaches have been adopted in modern divorce law. The first and most popular approach is a requirement that the relationship has broken down in such a way it is \u2018irretrievable\u2019, without any need to show that a spouse is at fault. Whilst some countries require evidence or proof that the marriage has broken down this has proven difficult and often adds to the time and effort required to qualify for a divorce. Another means of establishing the marriage is irretrievable is to specifically set out in the law, a period of separation (usually one year) after which the marriage is automatically deemed irretrievable. Whilst this approach is morally neutral, simple and easily understood, it has been criticized because legally requiring a delay of a year in every case before a divorce can be granted, can cause significant personal and financial hardship for the parties (including in relation to those who may need to find alternate housing. Neither best practice approach precludes reconciliation between the parties but they do not require that the parties must attempt reconciliation. A second approach which is more consistent with international standards that require the recognition of the autonomy of both spouses as individuals, is to enable an immediate and unilateral termination of a marriage by either party at will. The rationale behind this approach is that marriage is the voluntary union of two persons and therefore a unilateral wish by one of the spouses to end the marriage should be enough to do so. Separation procedures in the Cook Islands are not currently fault-based. Instead, the parties can obtain a separation order if \u2018there is a state of disharmony between the parties to the marriage\u2019. However, the primary legal effect of the separation order is that the parties no longer have to live together. This does not resolve or determine the new relations between the parties. Both divorce and separation procedures must be linked to essential legal remedies such as; i) their duties and obligations relating to property that they own, ii) the responsibilities of either or both of them to provide spousal and child support, iii) determining who lives in the marital home, and iv) settling residence and contact arrangements for any children. Access to such legal remedies are central to good practice for both separation and divorce procedures in modern divorce law. The Care of Children The Cook Islands Act 1915 governs the law relating to children in the Cook Islands. The Act, almost 100 years old, contains very limited coverage of the issues discussed in this publication. Law reform in this area would be best achieved through the repeal of any applicable provisions in the Cook Islands Act 1915 and incorporation of the area into the new Family Law Bill.

Best Interests of the Child as Paramount Article (1)(d) of CEDAW states that \u2018in all cases the interests of the children shall be paramount.\u2019 Article 3(1) of the CRC states that in all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration. In response to these international obligations modern family law typically includes a clear statement in the legislation to the effect that the principle of the child\u2019s best interests in all matters relating to children is paramount. In the Cook Islands, there is a statement of the best interests of the child in relation to custody hearings. However, it is important that the principle extends to all proceedings relating to children. The inclusion of such a statement would satisfy CEDAW legislative compliance indicator 16.18. Additionally and importantly, to assist the court in determining the best interests of the child, good practice requires a list of factors of what may be considered the best interests of the child to be included in the legislation. Parental Responsibility Article 18(1) of the CRC obligates State parties to ensure that both parents have common responsibilities for the upbringing and development of the child. Accordingly, a good practice approach in the modern family law context is to include a legislative statement that parental responsibility is equal and shared and continues until the child is 18 regardless of other circumstances, such as a parent subsequently remarrying or entering into a de facto or other relationship. Parenting Orders The Cook Islands Act 1915 authorizes the court to make custody orders on the basis of what \u2018it thinks fit\u2019 in relation to the children of the marriage. The Infants Act 1908 provides that custody shall be determined on the basis of the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration. Access, according to the Infants Act shall be determined on the basis of the welfare of the infant and the conduct of the parents. Good practice requires a consolidation of the legislation and an explicit statement that the best interests of the child are paramount in all proceedings involving children. Additionally, modern family law legislation has moved away from the terminology of custody and access orders, which foster notions of ownership in children and focusing on the respective \u2018rights\u2019 of the parents. Instead, the new approach is an emphasis on parental agreement as the primary means of settling parenting arrangements including when parents do not live together, through the issuing of parenting orders. Parenting orders in modern family law legislation typically consist of a range of orders termed \u2018residence\u2019, \u2018contact\u2019 \u2018specific issues\u2019 and \u2018prohibited steps\u2019 orders. Each of these is discussed below. A residence order determines where a child is to live and who has the day to day care of the child. A contact order determines whether and in what circumstances a parent or other person shall have contact with a child. The reason for a contact order is to recognize and maintain the beneficial relationships already established between the child and other children in the family or other adults, to the maximum extent possible, in the light of changed family circumstances. Contact orders typically permit reasonable contact but may specify the times, frequency and location of visits and may include a variety of forms of contact such as emails, letters or 18. 19. 20. 21.

A contact order may also provide for specific protections, such as in a situation of abuse, where a condition might be imposed that an abusive partner can have contact with a child only if supervised. A specific issues order complements residence and contact orders. A specific issues order will detail who will make a particular decision or how a particular decision will be made. Examples of topics that might be included in a specific issues order include; who is to have responsibility for the day-to-day care, welfare and development of the child, and who is responsible for decisions about the child\u2019s medical treatment, holidays or religious education.

A prohibited steps order prevents a particular decision from being made without returning to the court for permission or, alternately, without permission from the other parent. A prohibited steps order can prohibit a parent from making specific major decisions in relation to the child, such as changing the surname of the child, removing the child from the country, changing the nationality or domicile of the child, or consent to the adoption process. The availability of a prohibited steps order provides a means of protecting the rights of the child in accordance with the CRC. Mandatory separate legal representation for the child is good practice in proceedings where there are extenuating circumstances such as abuse or neglect. Sometimes, there are differences of opinion between the parents and others, and/or a confict between the best interests of the child and the interest of (each) parent (or other adults). The role of the separate representative is to make submissions to the court on what is in the best interests of the child, including from the child\u2019s perspective, where appropriate, and is independent from the submission by the parent(s) on what they (each) argue is in the best interests of the child. In order to carry out this role, the separate representative may be authorized to seek information from relevant parties including; the child (particularly when the child is old enough to give information on what has happened in the past, as well as her/his wishes), the child\u2019s school, and other relevant agencies and to obtain an expert\u2019s report from appropriate persons such as a child psychologist. Such provisions, however, are dependant upon government funding and its inclusion in the legislative provisions must be accompanied by the necessary administration and financial commitments from the state. Parenting orders may not be necessary to settle arrangements about where and with whom the child(ren) will live (a residence order), and how each parent (or other relevant adults) are allowed to interact with the child (a contact order). A good practice approach is to explicitly provide that a court must not make a parenting order unless it considers that doing so would be better for the child than making no order at all. In this way, the court only intervenes in the child\u2019s life if there is a real problem in need of resolution and not simply as a matter of routine or because the court has the power to do so. A parenting plan is an agreement between the parents of the child that deals with issues such as residence, contact, child support or any other 22. 23. 24. 25. 26.

To encourage divorcing or separating parents or parents who are not living together to take mutual responsibility for their children, some countries have included parenting plans in their family law legislation. A parenting plan can be registered with the court, if it accords with the welfare and best interests of the child, and enforced in the same manner as a court order. Parental responsibility provisions may enable a parent to be obstructive in the exercise of parenting orders. It is important therefore that the legislation clearly states that parental responsibility, especially to the extent that it involves any kind of \u2018authority\u2019 in relation to decision-making, is superseded by a parenting order. It is critically important that parenting orders can be enforced. The range of good practice approaches to enforcement include the following: i) expressly stating what the consequences of orders and contraventions are, ii) varying or discharging (ending) the parenting order (for example, by reducing or eliminating altogether the time in which the child is in the care of, or has contact with, the parent or other relevant person who is in contravention of the order), iii) punishing the parent or other relevant person who is in breach of the order with penalties such as fines, imprisonment or community service orders iv) requiring a deposit of a bond after the breach of a parenting order as an assurance that the order will not be breached again.

The Cook Islands is not yet a party to the Hague Convention although the removal of children from the Cook Islands may be a growing problem as freedom of movement between countries increases. Accession to the Convention would require the Cook Islands to set up a Central Authority to receive applications, collect relevant information and take the necessary steps to ensure that abducted or unlawfully retained children are returned to their resident country. In relation to children removed from the Cook Islands, a procedure must be established that provides evidence to the country to which the child has been removed that the child is \u2018habitually resident\u2019 in the Cook Islands and that the removal or keeping the child outside of the Cook Islands is wrongful. Wrongfulness is defined as a breach of the custody rights of another person or institution and although an order is not required this is the easiest process for its establishment. Care and Supervision Orders Article 20 of the CRC obligates States parties to provide to special protection and assistance including alternative care to a child that temporarily or permanently is unable to be in her or his family environment, or in whose own best interests cannot be allowed to remain in that environment. The first and best option if a child\u2019s safety is at risk in her or his home due to abuse or gross neglect is to remove the abuser (not the child) from the home.

GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 16 intervene to safeguard the welfare of the child. In the Cook Islands the Prevention of Juvenile Crime 1968 provides that a child can be taken into state care if it appears to the court the child is living in a place of \u2018ill-repute\u2019 or is likely to be ill-treated or neglected. However, no duty is placed upon the state to provide an appropriate level of care. The Act also provides for a supervision order but only if the child has committed an offence and the aim of the order is primarily punitive rather than to provide assistance for the welfare of the child. The approach adopted in modern family law legislation is to enable the state to take action through two forms of public orders; a care order and a supervision order. A care order allows the state to remove the child from the home and obligates the state to provide appropriate alternate services for the child such as placing the child in foster-care, with another relative or family friend or into institutionalized care, and in all cases ensure that an appropriate standard of care for the child is provided. A supervision order, which keeps the child in the home, allows the state to supervise, for example by undertaking regular scheduled visits or ensuring that the child attends school. The reason for having a supervision order is that it provides some state control over a family situation where a child might be at risk, but a care order (which means removing the child from their home) is not considered necessary or in the child\u2019s best interests. The statutory factors (which means a list of factors that are specifically contained in the law itself) for care and supervision orders are crucial since the result is either the compulsory removal of a child from their family or mandatory intervention in the family (through a supervision order). Using the best interests of the child as the only criteria for care and supervision orders is not always suitable because it could enable the removal of children from their homes on grounds where the child\u2019s safety is not at immediate risk through abuse or neglect. An alternate good practice approach is to have a two step process to ensure that removing the child is absolutely necessary for the child\u2019s safety.

A family group conference (FGC) is a meeting of specified family members and other relevant persons to try to develop the best possible plan for a child who is the victim of neglect, abuse or is a juvenile offender, before turning to the court to grant care and/or supervision orders. Family group conferencing originated in New Zealand in the late 1980\u2019s in situations of neglect and abuse as a response to the removal of Maori children by the state and their placement with \u2018cultural strangers\u2019 or in state institutions and in light of evidence that it is better for children to remain in their families, including their extended families, rather than being taken into state care. Family group conferences represent a collaborative, rather than an adversarial approach to assist families to address the neglect and/or abuse of a child. A core principle of family group conferencing is the involvement of extended families, a principle very relevant to the Cook Islands where extended families are often involved 32. 33. 34. 35. 36. GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 17 in all aspects of the parenting process. Whilst family group conferencing can represent an important alternative approach to resolving arrangements in relation to children in need of care and protection, it is important to introduce safeguards. First, appropriate chairpersons to convene and facilitate family group conferences must be selected, and trained in managing family dynamics, gender equality and the issues relating to children in need of care and protection. Chairpersons could be selected and trained from church groups, NGOs and other relevant community groups. Second, the legislation must prohibit family group conferences in situations of domestic violence, to ensure that no victim of domestic violence, child or adult, is forced to face or reach agreement with an offender or family members that are supportive of the offender. Finally, because different factors may come into play in some family dynamics, which may affect the decisions or plans agreed to during family conferencing, it is important to ensure that the court retains the authority to make final determinations on the basis of the welfare and best interests of the child. Adoption of Children Adoption ends the legal status of a birth family and gives a new, permanent home for a child. It replaces, in law, one family with another. The adoptive parent or parents become legally responsible for all aspects of parenthood, and the child is legally treated as a member of the adoptive family. In the Cook Islands adoption is governed by the Cook Islands Act 1915 which provides separately and differently for \u2018Native adoption\u2019 and \u2018European adoption\u2019. Cook Islanders are prohibited from adopting non-indigenous children whilst \u2018Europeans\u2019 can adopt any child including Cook Islander children. These provisions were enacted in the context of early twentieth century colonization and require modernizing to meet international standards and obligations under CEDAW and the CRC. The primary purpose of an adoption process is to place a child in a stable, secure and loving environment. This can be provided in a range of family forms including by grandparents, aunts and uncles, married and de facto couples, both opposite sex and same-sex, and by individuals. Good practice requires therefore that the emphasis in adoption law should be on what is in the child\u2019s best interests in light of the abilities and capabilities of the prospective adoptive parent or parents. The law should not limit who can apply to adopt and instead, should consider their suitability as adoptive parent[s] on the basis of criteria used to determine whether they are capable of providing a stable and secure environment for the child and what in the circumstances is in the best interests of the child. The criteria should be the same for all potential adoptive parents (whether single or a couple). The Cook Islands Act 1915 requires that biological parents give their consent to all adoptions unless \u2018the child has been deserted by that parent, or that parent unfit to have the care and custody of the child, or if the Court for any other reason whatsoever considers that the consent of that parent should be dispensed with\u2019.

Other good practice factors that should be included in the law as reasons for not requiring the consent of both biological parents for adoption are; if the child is the result of the rape of the mother, if the parent has failed to discharge her or his parental duties, or if it is in the best interests of the child to do so. A requirement for the consent of the child has been incorporated into some modern adoption law however this requirement has been criticized by some on the basis that it amounts to asking the child to reject her or his birth parents. Young people and people with impaired intellectual ability may be vulnerable to pressure to agree to adoption and may provide consent that is not full and free. The CRPD specifically requires that \u2018States Parties shall render appropriate assistance to persons with disabilities in the performance of their child- rearing responsibilities.\u2019 A good practice approach requires safeguards in the legislation to ensure that their rights are protected. Such safeguards could include a requirement for a report that confirms that the person is capable of understanding the consent to adoption, a requirement that the person has received legal advice, the inclusion of a revocation period so that the birth parent can change their mind during a designated period of time and finally a requirement that all the options for care and services are explored fully. Article 21 of the CRC obligates states parties to ensure that the principle of the best interests of the child is the most important consideration in adoption determinations. In the Cook Islands the grounds for both European and Cook Islander adoption are that \u2018the applicant is a fit and proper person to have the care and custody of the child and of sufficient ability to maintain the child, and the adoption will not be contrary to the welfare and interests of the child.\u2019 Uniformly, the approach of modern adoption law is to incorporate the best interests of the child as the (or a) primary consideration and also that the person who is applying for the adoption is fit and proper and of sufficient ability to provide the day-to-day care for the child. The adoption process has historically been kept closed and secret. A more open and inclusive system of adoption may be appropriate in the modern context, particularly in communities (such as the Cook Islands) where kinship networks are important, broad and enduring, and advances the right of the child (reflected in the CRC) to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis, except if it is contrary to the child\u2019s best interests. An \u201copen\u201d adoption process is where the child, in some circumstances, maintains ongoing contact with her or his birth parents and/or other extended family members. Contact may range from regular meetings between the birth parents and the adoptive family, and / or to intermittent ongoing contact. The aims of this contact are to ensure that the child feels as psychologically secure as possible and to mitigate any sense of loss she or he might experience. Whilst open adoption is recommended by many experts it has not yet been incorporated into many adoption law regimes. Spousal and Child Support Child and spousal support is currently governed in the Cook Islands by the Cook Islands Act 1915 and requires modernization to meet good standard 42. 43. 44. 45.

Reform in this area would be best achieved through the repeal of any applicable provisions in that Act and incorporation of the area into the new Family Law Bill.

Although the recognition of same-sex relationships has not yet been explicitly addressed by the CEDAW Committee, many consider there is sufficient support in CEDAW and the CRC (and in the growing international jurisprudence and in its acceptance within many societies) that terms such as family, and discrimination on the grounds of sex or marital status should be interpreted to obligate States parties to provide equal rights and protections for those in same-sex relationships. Such recognition would also satisfy CEDAW legislative compliance indicator 16.20. The recognition of de facto relationships for the purpose of spousal support requires a definition in the law of a de facto relationship. Two different approaches are used in contemporary family law to establish the existence of a de facto relationship. The first is to designate a time period that the parties must have lived together continuously, which is usually 2 years. The second approach is to provide a range of factors, which can include (but is not limited to) factors such as whether they have children, the level of financial interdependence and public recognition of their relationship. In this approach, the duration of a relationship may also be among the determining factors but the period of time required is not specified in the law. The Cook Islands Act 1915 provides for spousal support on the basis of reasonableness. However, in contemporary family law, a right to spousal support and the amount to be awarded (if there is such a right) is now uniformly decided on the basis of what is \u2018just\u2019 or \u2018fair\u2019 coupled with a mandatory consideration of a range of factors. The inclusion of a specific list of factors in the law, which can include both the duration of the marriage or relationship and the effects on earning capacity of the division of functions within the marriage or relationship while parties lived together, ensure that courts take into account the discriminatory effects that marriage and relationships can have upon the earning capacity of one partner (usually the female partner) especially if there are children and one party has given up education and/or paid employment or employment advancements to be able to provide domestic and child care for the family. Article 16(1)(d) of CEDAW makes both parents equally responsible for a child whether or not they are legally married. The costs of medical attention and other costs associated with pregnancy and childbirth should therefore be shared equally by both biological parents and the legislation should expressly provide for the payment of such expenses. The provision in the legislation of child-bearing expenses to be paid by the biological father to the birth mother would satisfy CEDAW legislative indicator 16.23. 46. 47. 48. 49. GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 20 Child Support The CEDAW Committee states in General Recommendation 21(19) that after separation and divorce many fathers fail to share the responsibility of care, protection and maintenance of their children and has urged States parties to \u2018put in place adequate legislative measures, including the review and amendment of existing laws, to guarantee that women obtain child support.\u2019 The payment of child support after relationship breakdown and divorce ensures that fathers take responsibility for the costs of child rearing and at the same time recognizes the reduced earning power of many mothers and the costs that women bear in the raising of children. It is important however that the provisions are gender neutral to ensure that in cases where fathers do have the day-to-day care of their child, they can also obtain child support. The inclusion of access to child support on the basis of the needs of the child would satisfy CEDAW legislative indicators 16.10 & 16.24. There are two main approaches in contemporary family law to child support. The first, adopted in many common law countries including New Zealand, England and Australia, is the establishment of state-run child support schemes which assess and collect monies (from the parent who has been ordered to make financial contributions) through automatic payment systems. This approach, which has proven effective, requires state commitment to its administration and the related costs.

The Cook Islands Act 1915 provides for the court to issue a child support order for a child born either within a marriage or outside. Contemporary family law simply requires that the child is under 18 years old and not financially independent. The Cook Islands Act 1915 does not explicitly state who may apply for a child support order but the language implies that it is limited to a mother or a father. In contemporary society where there is a range of family forms and situations where care for children is provided, good practice now requires that anyone who is providing the day-to-day care of a child should also be able to apply for child support. Traditionally, the biological parents of a child, or an adoptive parent have been the only people that have had child support orders issued against them. The Cook Islands Act 1915 provides for the issuance of a child support order against the mother or the father of a child. While the question of whether and to what extent step-parents should also be liable is controversial, most contemporary family law provides, that where a parental relationship of some sort as formed, even if the adult is not the biological or adoptive parent, then a support order can also be made against this person. The reason for this is that the step-parent has voluntarily assumed that role and it is not in the best interests of children that they be permitted to abandon it simply because the adult relationship has ended. The Cook Islands Act 1915 provides for the provision of child support on the basis of what the court thinks reasonable. Good practice in contemporary family law is to provide in the law a list of factors that courts must take into account when determining the appropriate contribution by the liable parent. This child centered approach ensures that courts take into account the variety of needs that a child may have, and shifts the primary focus away from the liable person or the applicant. 50. 51. 52. 53. 54. GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 21 Variation, Form of Payment and Enforcement Usually modern family law specifically allows for the variation of child support orders if the circumstances of the liable party, the recipient, or the child changes. Additionally, although a child support order might ordinarily end when a child reaches 18 years, a modern and good practice approach requires that financial support be continued if children are over 18 years of age but are still in full-time education, or are mentally or physically handicapped and therefore required long-term support. The Cook Island Act 1915 provides only for periodical payments of money for both spousal and child maintenance orders. Contemporary family laws have moved towards more flexible approaches to payment of support orders including lump sum payments, the provision of goods (in the Cook Islands this could include fish, meat, taro and livestock such as pigs, goats and chicken etc.) the provision of services, and the transfer or usage of property or assets. A system of enforcement is crucial to ensuring that spousal and child support payments are made. Mechanisms that have been used in other countries include deductions through the tax system, ordering the employer (if the liable parent is working) to deduct a certain amount from her or his salary to meet the support payments, garnisheeing bank accounts, forcing the sale of assets or property, fines and imprisonment in accordance with the law. Determination of Parentage The determination of who is a parent, (usually the father) of a child, is important because of the parental obligations to provide child support and child-bearing expenses. The Cook Islands Act 1915 limits applications for paternity to \u2018an unmarried woman who is the mother of an illegitimate child or who is with child.\u2019 Modern family law typically allows a child or either parent, and any other party if they have \u2018a proper interest in the result\u2019 to apply. Other parties might include grandparents or other relatives, social workers, government agencies, trustees and executors. The inclusion of appropriate procedures for determining parentage would satisfy CEDAW legislative compliance indicator 16.22. The Cook Islands Act 1915 gives the court authority to determine the paternity of a child but it does not include a specific formula or set of criteria that is to be used to do so.

If the child is 6 years or older, no application can be made unless the prospective father has either contributed to child support during that six years, or has cohabited with the mother in a de facto relationship, in which case any application must be made within two years of either the financial contribution or the cohabitation. Such limitations are arbitrary and do not accord with modern good practice. In modern family law presumptions of paternity are typically made in certain circumstances. These include if the father is the husband or de facto partner of the mother at the time of the birth, or at the time of conception, or if the father\u2019s name is registered on the birth certificate. In the Cook Islands other presumptions that could be included might include; whether the father bought items for the baby, visited the mother in hospital or any other kind of traditional acknowledgement of the child. Where there is no presumption, paternity is typically based on evidentiary submissions. 55. 56. 57. 58. 59. 60. GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 22 Discriminatory assumptions about women\u2019s dishonesty in reproductive matters were historically relied on in many jurisdictions to develop a discriminatory requirement that a woman\u2019s testimony in relation to paternity must be corroborated. A requirement for corroboration (independent evidence that supports the claim of paternity) is discriminatory because it is not required in other matters. In addition, it implies that a woman\u2019s word is inherently worth less than that of the prospective or presumed father even though there is no evidence that mothers should be viewed as a particularly unreliable class of witness. The Cook Islands Act 1915 provides that whilst the evidence of the mother is not necessary for the making of a paternity order, no order can be made upon the evidence of a pregnant woman unless it is corroborated. Good practice requires a specific statement in the law that corroboration is not required in any circumstances. DNA testing now enables paternity (or maternity) to be established conclusively. This is most commonly done by taking a buccal or blood sample from father and child, although it can be done on any number of other body parts such as hair follicles. Generally however genetic testing without the consent of the person being tested is controversial since taking any sample is an intrusion on bodily integrity, dignity and privacy. Two approaches to DNA testing have been taken in modern family law. The first is that the court can recommend parentage testing and if this is refused then the court can use the prospective father\u2019s refusal to be tested as evidence of paternity. In the same way if the mother refuses to give consent to the testing of the child (if requested by the father or the court) this can be used as evidence that the man in question is not the father. The second approach is to empower the court to order mandatory testing. The reason behind this approach is that it is in the best interests of the child, her or his parents and the general public that parentage determinations are made on the basis of accurate DNA parentage testing. Domestic Violence Domestic violence has been increasingly recognized in the Cook Islands as a growing and substantial problem, which impacts on the physical and mental health of victims and also upon families and communities. The importance of a strong, effective and comprehensive legal response to domestic violence has been recognized worldwide as public recognition of domestic violence as a social problem has increased. This publication focuses on reforming the civil law aspects of domestic violence. A comprehsive approach to domestic violence includes both civil and criminal law protections, which serve different but complementary purposes. There are two good practice approaches to domestic violence legislation to achieve this. The first is to enact one comprehensive criminal and civil domestic violence law that incorporates both criminal offences to enable the prosecution of offenders, and civil law protection orders that prohibit the abuser from any further act of domestic and/or enables victims to remain in the family home to the exclusion of the abuser. The second approach, which has been adopted by the Cook Islands, is to keep these aspects separate but to make the relevant reforms to both the criminal law, and the civil law (rather than to enact one law covering both", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6923a176-325f-408d-8ca5-e1abec8d2d16": {"__data__": {"id_": "6923a176-325f-408d-8ca5-e1abec8d2d16", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing the Implementation of CEDAW in the Cook Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5b84519a4130a86dabc2455f77a1388d1b5e45173cabbb71fd85fe3f853b3193"}}, "hash": "5b84519a4130a86dabc2455f77a1388d1b5e45173cabbb71fd85fe3f853b3193", "text": "criminal and civil aspects). 61. 62. 63.

The aims of domestic violence civil law provisions are, broadly, to prevent domestic violence, to ensure the safety of all persons who experience domestic violence, to provide victims with effective and accessible remedies, and to promote nonviolence as a fundamental social value. The Cook Islands Amendment Act 1994 provides access to occupation orders and non-molestation orders for victims of domestic violence. However, these orders provide protection only to a limited range of persons, and only for protection from a limited range of behaviours, in a limited range of circumstances. Therefore, in this area, in many regards, the Act does not meet international good practice standards. Law reform in this area would be best achieved through the repeal of any applicable provisions in the Cook Islands Amendment Act 1994 and either the incorporation of the area into the new Family Law Bill or the development of a separate Domestic Violence Bill. It is critical to have a good practice definition of domestic violence in the civil law (and in the criminal law) that reflects its breadth and complexity. Domestic violence occurs in many forms, including physical violence, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, intimidation, harassment, stalking, economic deprivation, property damage, causing a child to witness domestic violence, animal abuse or threats of any of the above. It is particularly important that both physical and non- physical forms of abuse are explicitly recognized and identified in the legislation. Non-physical forms of domestic violence should specifically be included as they are often not perceived by the community as \u2018real\u2019 violence, despite research consistently showing they may be the cause of severe and ongoing harm. Domestic violence occurs in many contexts and between persons in a range of personal relationships where there are power imbalances. Good practice requires that the full range of people who experience or are at risk of experiencing domestic violence should be able to access protection orders. However, pursuant to the Cook Islands Amendment Act 1994 occupation orders are only available to married persons. Whilst the legislation extends access to non- molestation (protection) orders to de facto (opposite sex) couples and gives the court the discretion to issue a protection order for the protection of any \u2018other person\u2019 it does not explicitly extend protection to all persons at risk. The approach adopted by contemporary good practice domestic violence law is to explicitly extend the range of protected persons beyond \u2018traditional concepts of family\u2019 to include spouses, persons in a \u2018marriage-like\u2019 relationship (either opposite or same-sex), persons in close personal relationships, relatives, those in a care relationship, any child who resides with the abuser and in some countries, a person who is or has been a member of the other person\u2019s household. Protection Orders Protection orders are a civil remedy typically issued by a court, the police or other authorized person to prevent a person from making contact with, harming or harassing another person. The CEDAW Committee has stated that the availability of protection orders is an \u2018essential component of a comprehensive legal framework designed to protect women in situations 64. 65. 66. 67. 68.

In contemporary domestic violence legislation, the range of people who can apply for a protection order typically includes an adult protected person (as defined in the legislation), a child protected person who is a mature minor (who understands the nature and the consequences of the proceedings) a parent of a child protected person on behalf of the child, and any person with a residence order in relation to a protected child. In some circumstances it may be difficult for a protected person to apply for an order and therefore a good practice approach is to enable applications to be made by \u2018any other person on behalf of the aggrieved person.

Protection orders should be available for all persons at risk, and not just after an act of domestic violence has occurred. The Cook Islands Amendment Act 1994 recognizes this in part, by not requiring an act of violence to have occurred and instead enabling the court to issue a non-molestation order if the court is satisfied it is \u2018necessary for the protection\u2019 of the applicant. A good practice approach goes further and simply requires that the victim has a reasonable apprehension of an act of domestic violence. An alternate approach requires that the victim has an actual fear of an act of domestic violence (whether \u2018reasonable\u2019 or not). This ensures that a person living in fear (and who may be very aware of the signs of impending danger of domestic violence), does not have to meet any standard of \u2018reasonableness\u2019 before being given protection. Emergency Protection Order An emergency (or interim) protection order is a protection order that is immediately and easily available. It is essential that domestic violence victims be provided with access to protection orders when they do not have immediate access to a court. This is particularly crucial given that domestic violence often occurs after 5pm, during the week and on weekends, or in areas (such as outer islands or rural areas) where there is no formal court. If a domestic violence victim seeks protection from the legal system during a crisis outside of standard court hours, or where a court is not readily accessible, the system must be able to respond and offer an appropriate level of protection. In order to provide immediate protection an emergency protection order must be accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, be available without the testimony of the abuser, and there must be persons authorized and available to issue an order at all times. Occupation Order An occupation order enables the protected person to remain in any home that she or he shares with the abuser regardless of the abuser\u2019s legal or equitable rights in the property. Requiring the violent party (rather than the one at risk of violence) to leave the home reinforces the message that domestic violence is unacceptable and that abusers will be held accountable in a range of ways. Inclusion of a provision enabling victims of domestic violence to occupy the shared residence would satisfy CEDAW legislative compliance indicator 16.11. Good practice in contemporary family law is to provide a list of factors in the law that courts must take into account when determining whether to make an occupation order. Such factors include; 69. 70. 71. 72. 73. GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 25 i) the impact on the safety and protection of the protected person and any children who live at the residence if an occupation order is not made, ii) the desirability of minimizing disruption to the protected person and any child living with the protected person and iii) the importance of maintaining social networks and support and ensuring continuity in childcare, education, training and employment for protected persons and children who live with them. Access to personal property may be a significant issue for all parties when there is an occupation order in place. The party that is excluded from the home will need access to their personal effects in order to take up residence elsewhere. In practice, orders allowing a respondent to return to the premises from which they are excluded to collect their belongings may need to be tightly controlled in order to ensure that protected person(s) are not intimidated, influenced or put at risk of any kind of violence. Equally, if an occupation order enables a protected person and/or any children to remain in the home, it may be important to prevent the excluded party from removing necessary items from the premises (i.e. all the food or furniture). The former UN Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women has recommended that States parties should provide for the removal of the abuser from the shared home and allow the victim- survivor to retain her present housing, at least until formal and final separation is achieved. Good practice requires that the courts are directed to start from the position that the interests of the protected person and their children would be best served by them remaining in their home.

Some jurisdictions have made it mandatory that the police must apply for a protection order when domestic violence has or is likely to occur, regardless of whether the protected person consents. In other jurisdictions a lesser obligation is placed upon police officers. For example, if an application is not made, the police must record the reasons they did not make the application. Such provisions provide clear direction to police officers of their responsibilities in relation to domestic violence. It also sends a message to the community and the perpetrator; that domestic violence is unacceptable, that the police will act, it increases the likelihood of an order being made, it lessens the burden on the victim, can deflect blame from the victim where the application is seen as a police matter and out of the victim\u2019s hands, and increases the likelihood that a woman will pursue an application when she knows she will be supported by the police. Enforcement of Orders A strong system of enforcement is crucial to ensuring the protection order scheme is effective in protecting domestic violence victims. If police or the courts do not respond adequately to breaches of orders, they will be viewed as ineffectual by victims and perpetrators alike. It will also give victims a false sense of safety and security, heightening their danger if a perpetrator behaves violently. To be effective, a breach of a protection order must be a criminal offence. 74. 75. 76. 77. GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 26 Contemporary domestic violence legislation typically has fines and/or imprisonment as the penalty for breaches of protection orders. Some jurisdictions have harsher penalties for second offences. Another approach to enforcement is to require the abuser to attend a rehabilitation program. Such a measure, is however reliant on the existence of a well-resourced programs for the court to refer the offender to. Good practice requires that the police are empowered to immediately arrest and detain an offender as soon as there is any breach of a protection order. In the Cook Islands the Criminal Procedure Act 1965 provides that a police officer may arrest or take into custody without a warrant a person \u2018he finds committing, or whom he has good cause to suspect of having committed, any offence punishable by death or imprisonment for life or for three months or more.\u2019 This law will be sufficient in the Cook Islands to enable the arrest of any person who breaches a protection order if the penalty for a breach is a term of 3 months imprisonment. In General Recommendation 19(24)(i), the CEDAW Committee states that compensation should be provided for victims of gender-based violence. Compensation provides \u2018therapeutic\u2019 benefits in assisting the recovery of victims from the medical, psychological, cultural, vocational and relational consequences of domestic violence. Although victims of domestic violence can sue for damages in the civil law in common law jurisdictions including the Cook Islands, this is usually an expensive and ineffective avenue. Good practice approaches to compensation now include state- funded criminal injuries compensation schemes, compensation provisions in either criminal or civil law legislation which enable the court to award damages to the victim which are payable by the perpetrator and the establishment of a support fund for domestic violence victims administered by the state. It is important that the legislation specifically states that any compensation paid under custom may be taken into consideration in determining the amount of compensation to be paid to the victim (i.e. amounts paid to the victim following a customary compensation arrangement could be deducted from the total amount of compensation payable to the victim under the FLA), but does not of itself extinquish a right to compensation under the Act. Property Division after Relationship Breakdown Property division when a marriage ends is governed in the Cook Islands by the Matrimonial Property Act 1976 (NZ). The Act is CEDAW compliant in many respects and law reform could be achieved through amendments to the Act. However, a better approach would be the repeal of the Act and incorporation of the area into the new Family Law Bill. This would enable the process of property division to be linked to spousal and child support and for the development of a clearer and more straightforward framework.

GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 27 Comments in 2007 called upon the Cook Islands \u2018to establish a system of equitable division of marital property upon dissolution of de facto marriages.\u2019 The Matrimonial Property Act 1976 (NZ) divides property into \u2018matrimonial\u2019 property and \u2018separate\u2019 property. Matrimonial property includes the family home and chattels (regardless of whether it was acquired before or after the marriage) and all other property including businesses, investment, benefits and superannuation acquired during or directly before the marriage. Separate property is all property that is not matrimonial property and generally consists of property held by the parties at the commencement of the marriage. This approach to the categorization of marital property is consistent with good practice. The Matrimonial Property Act (NZ) provides that the matrimonial home and family chattels shall be divided equally. The rationale for equal sharing, which is a good practice approach, is that marriage is a joint cooperative venture in which equal sharing of the couple\u2019s assets is fair and appropriate. There are three exceptions to equal sharing; i) if the marriage is of short duration, which the Act defines as less than 3 years, and if the contribution of one spouse has clearly been \u2018disproportionately greater\u2019 then a contributions approach will be applied, ii) if there are extraordinary circumstances that render equal sharing \u2018repugnant to justice\u2019, then the matrimonial home and family chattels shall be determined on the basis of contributions, iii) matrimonial property other than the family home and chattels such as a business, second homes and other property, shares, insurance and superannuation are to be divided equally unless one spouse\u2019s contribution to the partnership is \u2018clearly been greater\u2019 than the other. The major criticisms of the exceptions are i) the arbitrariness of the 3 years rule and, ii) that the major portion of matrimonial property is determined on the basis of contributions rather than on the principle of equal sharing. Such an approach typically disadvantages women and good practice therefore requires the principle of equality to apply to all matrimonial property, a measure introduced by New Zealand in 2001. Such an amendment to current Cook Islands law would represent full compliance with CEDAW legislative indicator 16.15. If one of the three exceptions apply then the individual contributions are measured (rather than a presumption of equality) to determine how property should be divided. A good practice approach to the determination of contributions is to include a mandatory list of factors in the law for the court to consider. In addition, it is also important that the legislation explicitly states that non-financial contributions should be given equal weight with financial contributions. In General Recommendation 21(32) the CEDAW Committee states that in relation to the division of marital property \u2018financial and non-financial contributions should be accorded the same weight\u2019. The Committee explains that non- financial contributions during a marriage such as raising children, caring for elderly relatives, and discharging household duties enable a husband to earn an income and increase the assets of the marital relationship. 83. 84. 85. 86.

The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)2 came into force on 2 September 1990 and as at 15 March 2010, 194 countries are states parties to the Convention. The Convention sets out the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of children with the four core guiding principles of non-discrimination, devotion to the best interests of the child, the right to life, survival and development, and respect for the views of the child. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)3 came into force on 3 May 2008 and as at 15 March 2010, 82 countries are parties to the Convention. The Convention provides a comprehensive framework of the rights of persons with disabilities and the obligations of State parties to promote, protect, and ensure those rights. A good practice approach to a Family Law Bill is to incorporate in the \u2018purposes\u2019 section a commitment to enact provisions and interpret the legislation in accordance with the most relevant human rights conventions and the Act can include a specific reference to those conventions (i.e. CEDAW, CRC and CRPD). The purposes section of legislation is included by drafters as a guide to the interpretation of the Act and to provide an overall guiding framework for the legislation. Additionally, in some Pacific Island countries where custom is given constitutional status, it is important that the legislation specifically states that it takes precedence over any traditional or customary practices. For example, the Family Law Act would take precedence if there is a customary rule that fathers should be given greater rights than mothers in determining who should have the day-to-day care of a child. 1 1979 G.A.

However, the Cook Islands acceded to CEDAW in its own right in 2006 and to the Optional Protocol to CEDAW on 27 November 2007 and also furnished its initial report to the CEDAW Committee in that same year. The Cook Islands became a party to the CRC in 1997 and acceded to the CRPD on May 8, 2009. Accession obligates the Cook Islands to work towards the modification of its constitution and legislation to accord with the articles of CEDAW, the CRC and the CRPD. Additionally, through its relationship of free association with New Zealand the Cook Islands, although internally and externally fully self-governing, is obliged to uphold a \u2018standard of values generally acceptable to New Zealanders in its law-making and policies\u2019. Whilst compliance with CEDAW is the primary focus of this paper, the relevant norms and standards contained in the CRC, the recently adopted CRPD and those of other core international human rights treaties are also referred to, as together, they form the comprehensive framework of international human rights norms and standards to guide the Cook Islands in the development of the proposed comprehensive civil family law Bill. CEDAW Implementation in the Cook Islands The Cook Islands government has taken a number of positive steps towards the implementation of CEDAW in recent years. In 2005 it commissioned a report which recommended a range of law reform steps to be taken by the Cook Islands legislature to achieve legislative compliance with CEDAW.4 The report was later endorsed by Cabinet. In 2006 the Cook Islands government submitted its initial report to the CEDAW Committee and a group of Cook Islands NGOs prepared and submitted a shadow report. In 2007, the Cook Islands delegation engaged in constructive dialogue in New York with the CEDAW Committee. The Concluding Comments to the Cook Islands issued by the CEDAW Committee were subsequently tabled in Parliament. In response to the Concluding Comments the Cook Islands government established the CEDAW Law Reform Committee, an inter-departmental working group, to work towards legislative consistency with CEDAW.

The Cook Islands CEDAW Law Reform Committee subsequently named marriage and family life and the safety and security of women and children as important priorities for law reform.

In order to begin the process of development of a Family Law Bill, the UNDP Pacific Centre, in response to a request from the Cook Islands Government, prepared this publication to explain in plain language the key elements of a CEDAW, CRC and CPRD compliant civil Family Law Bill. The publication includes an examination of the current relevant law in the Cook Islands alongside simple explanations of the key components required to meet international good practice standards, as well as a range of examples of provisions drawn from legislation in other countries that reflect a range of global and Pacific good practices and approaches in various laws. In February 2010 a consultation was held in Rarotonga, Cook Islands, to provide the foundations for the approach of the Family Law Bill that would be developed. The findings of the draft of this policy publication were presented and the consultation group, which included representatives from various government departments, including Crown Law, Internal Affairs, and Probation, local lawyers practicing in family law, educators, a Pastor, a representative from the House of Ariki as well as non-government representatives, considered which of the good practice approaches to each of the core issues were best suited to the context and culture of the Cook Islands. The recommendations of the consultation group are included at the end of each Chapter of this publication. Benefits of a CEDAW Compliant Family Law Bill Family law in the Cook Islands is currently governed by a number of pieces of legislation including the Marriage Act 1973, the Marriage Amendment Act 2000, the Marriage Amendment Act 2007, the Cook Islands Act 1915, the Cook Islands Amendment Act 1994, the Infants Act 1908, the Prevention of Juvenile Crime 1968 and the Matrimonial Property Act 1976 (NZ). In large part this legislation was adopted from New Zealand during colonization and reflects neither local values nor contemporary international norms but rather the mid-twentieth century values of England and New Zealand. The drafting of a Family Law Bill provides the opportunity to develop a legal framework that is reflective of the values and context of contemporary Cook Islander society, including the national commitments to gender equality and the implementation of CEDAW, to replace the old laws which reflect the norms and values of the colonizing countries when they were developed.

The development of a civil Family Law Bill is intended to consolidate the multiple pieces of family law legislation into a single, clearly articulated and contemporary Bill. The Bill will improve the accessibility of the law in this area, particularly to the general public. Family law is a complex area however the development of a single piece of civil legislation in simple language will facilitate access to the law to a wide range of parties. It will also provide the opportunity to ensure that all family law legislation is in compliance with the international instruments to which the Cook Islands is a party. In addition, the development of a CEDAW, CRC and CRPD compliant Family Law Bill will also provide an important contribution by the Cook Islands to good practices that can be relied on both by other Pacific Island countries, and globally. Whilst the civil Family Law Bill will not incorporate targeted domestic violence criminal law offences this is an important area for future law reform. Methodology This paper considers law reform options in six areas pertaining to family law in the Cook Islands. The six areas are; i) marriage, ii) the end of marriage, iii) the care of children, iv) spousal and child support, v) domestic violence and vi) property division after marriage or relationship breakdown, For each of the six areas this policy paper identifies the range of components that are essential to good practice and CEDAW, CRC and CRPD compliant legislation. For each of these components this paper provides a simple definition and an explanation of the rational that underlies its inclusion. It also provides an overview of the law in the Cook Islands, where relevant, in relation to each component. After an overview of the relevant law, the policy paper provides a statement on what constitutes good practice (based on international conventions to which the Cook Islands is a party, international declarations and commentary, relevant academic literature and government and non-government reports). The paper also includes a range of good practice examples that illustrate how different jurisdictions have approached each particular component. Where possible, examples from Oceania have been chosen (the Pacific Islands and Territories, New Zealand and Australia) but this paper also provides international comparison by drawing on examples from around the world that represent good practice. The policy paper does not cover the area of inheritance although this is an important aspect of family law in which serious discrimination against women occurs when law and practice do not treat females equally with males. The CEDAW Committee in General Recommendation 21(34) directs States parties to implement the Economic and Social Council Resolution (884) which requires States parties to ensure that \u2018men and women in the same degree of relationship to a deceased are entitled to equal shares in the estate and to equal rank in the order of succession.\u20196 Further, the Beijing Platform recommends that governments \u2018enact and strictly enforce legislation that guarantees equal rights to 1.13 1.14 1.15 6 General Recommendation 21, Equality in Marriage and Family Relations, 1994, 13th Session (UN Doc A/49/38) at para [34].

Currently, marriage is governed in the Cook Islands by the Marriage Act 1973 and reform in this area would be best achieved through amendments to that legislation. Many of the existing provisions of the Marriage Act 1973 are already CEDAW compliant. Therefore this chapter identifies and discusses only three areas that are currently non-compliant with CEDAW for consideration. These include, first, considering whether to raise the minimum marriageable age, which is currently 16, to the CEDAW and the CRC recommended age of 18. It also requires considering whether to remove the requirement placed on \u2018minors\u2019 (which in the Cook Islands has been applied to include those persons between the ages of 16 and 21) to obtain consent from both parents before marriage can take place. Such a provision denies the autonomy of those over the age of 18 to choose if and when to marry (which legally does not depend on whether or not the person still resides with her/ his parents). Second, marriage in the Cook Islands is limited to persons of opposite sex. Same-sex marriage is still controversial for many in the Pacific and this is reflected in the decision of the participants at the Cook Islands consultation on the Family Law Bill not to include same-sex marriage in the new reforms. There is however a growing worldwide recognition that the principle of non-discrimination implies that marriage rights should be available equally to all members of the community. This has led to the extension of marriage to same-sex couples or the establishment of domestic registered partnerships and civil unions throughout the world. Although there is not yet a direct enforceable obligation under international law to extend marriage to same- sex couples, increasingly countries are amending their laws to do so. In the Pacific region, in 2009, the French collectivities of Wallis and Futuna and New Caledonia, introduced civil unions for same- sex couples providing a basis for similar reform in other Pacific Island countries. Finally, a marriage is automatically void under the Marriage Act 1973 if the parties are within specified prohibited degrees of relationship (which means the two people are either too closely related or are related in a way that makes marriage unacceptable and inappropriate such as two siblings) or if one of the parties is already married. The Act does not however require the consent of the parties before a marriage can proceed and there is no process for voiding a marriage if full and free consent was not obtained as required by Article 16(1)(b) of CEDAW. Marriageable Age The Cook Islands Marriage Act 1973, s 17(1) designates 16 as the minimum age of marriage for both males and females. In General Recommendation 21(36) the CEDAW Committee states that international standards require that the minimum age of marriage for both men and women be set at 18 years since marriage carries with it important responsibilities which require maturity 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 34 and capacity to act.8 The CEDAW Committee in its Concluding Comments to the Cook Islands in 2007 urged the Cook Islands \u2018to raise the minimum age of marriage for women to 18 years, in line with article 16(2) of the Convention, the Committee\u2019s general recommendation 21 and the Convention on the Rights of the Child\u2019.9 Raising the marriageable age to 18 would also satisfy CEDAW legislative compliance indicator 16.3.10 The Committee has explained that \u2018a low legal age of marriage may prevent girls from continuing their education, lead them to drop out of school early and may result in difficulties in their achievement of economic autonomy and empowerment.\u201911 An early marriage can have negative effects on their \u2018enjoyment of their human rights, especially their rights to health and education\u201912 in part because of the increased likelihood of early motherhood and the associated health risks including an increased risk", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3a6f8a16-b89e-410c-8555-188bd6b8c130": {"__data__": {"id_": "3a6f8a16-b89e-410c-8555-188bd6b8c130", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing the Implementation of CEDAW in the Cook Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3b22b3e60241ea712f40adb1a2c5aec6ca20e007a5eaabf5c3bfd0739315bd83"}, "3": {"node_id": "5232e4a0-e86e-401b-bf19-c595da987f3a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9b10e61ed6b4153bfd1b3f16e26b452efe795a3de10528d44bc852137af95f31"}}, "hash": "21a5f3cc07275f4f62f6be6977a16c973723f0d4cd46da1d3538ff4169fcc342", "text": "of HIV/AIDs.13 Minors (which in the Cook Islands has been applied to include those persons between the ages of 16 and 21) those children and persons between the ages of 16 and 21), must obtain consent from both parents before they can marry. This is not in line with international standards as it denies the autonomy of those over the age of 18 to choose if and when to marry. Who Can Marry? In the Cook Islands the Marriage Amendment Act 2000 amended the Marriage Act 1973 with the insertion \u2018A man may not marry another man and a woman may not marry another\u2019. In 2007 that Act was repealed by the Marriage Amendment Act 2007, which prohibits marriage between persons of same gender. The two Acts provide a clear statement on the position of the Cook Islands in relation to legalizing same-sex unions, which contradicts the growing worldwide trend to legalize either same- sex marriage or to introduce either same-sex civil unions or registered domestic partnerships (in addition to repealing other related laws such as colonial era anti-sodomy laws).14 An increasing number of countries agree with human rights experts that there is sufficient support in CEDAW In General Recommendation 21 the CEDAW Committee notes that in the CRC a \u2018child\u2019 means any human being below the age of 18 unless majority is attained earlier under national law.

(b) both parties shall, as regards age, mental capacity and otherwise, be capable of contracting a valid marriage. EXAMPLE Voiding of Marriage The Marriage Act 1973 provides for the voiding of marriage in two situations. The first situation in which a marriage is automatically void is if the two people being married are within specified prohibited degrees of relationship (i.e. siblings are not allowed to marry each other because of their close genetic relationship). The second reason for voiding a marriage is if one of the parties is still legally married to someone else. However, the Act does not yet provide for the voiding of marriage if consent has been obtained through duress, fraud, misrepresentation or mistaken identity, intoxication or if one of the parties is incapable of understanding the nature of the consent (as illustrated in the example of Australia below). The inclusion of a provision that explicitly voids marriages not obtained with full and free consent would also satisfy CEDAW legislative compliance indicator 16.2. 20 Duress can occur when a party is incapable of refusing a marriage due to coercion or threats (usually against the woman or her loved ones). Fraud can occur if someone is deceived as to the reason for the marriage, for example if someone is induced to marry ostensibly for love but in fact the real aim of one party is to gain residence.21 Misrepresentation can occur if the person does not understand the nature of the ceremony, for example, an English speaking woman in India thought she was facilitating marriage for a friend but in fact was signing the marriage register on her own behalf.22 Mental incapacity and intoxication are relevant when they result in the party not understanding the nature and effect of the marriage ceremony. 2.9 2.10 20 See Translating CEDAW into Law note 4 at 37.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a633197-60cc-493c-9356-faf5eb8cc976": {"__data__": {"id_": "7a633197-60cc-493c-9356-faf5eb8cc976", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing the Implementation of CEDAW in the Cook Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "49f339f1cdf4f3dd256e9ca44e35df322c6e57a3247956547f4158c63adc8da5"}, "2": {"node_id": "4f255a75-0754-4809-8535-58f9e7571ec3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ea3d58c16ae3176902cfdebf64b1f68ae814ed104021e19344242bcc96686099"}}, "hash": "5a5ddaa34abbb4723987d2016baf49ad8b7272cf44a11bd0bd5a997d66599c56", "text": "21 A Dickey, Family Law (Sydney: Lawbook Company 4th ed, 2002) at 167. 22 Mehta (orse.Kohn) v Mehta [1945] 2 All ER 690.

EXAMPLE Recommendations of the Cook Islands Consultation - Marriage 1. To raise the marriageable age to 18. 2. To remove from the Marriage Act 1973 the requirement for minors (those between the age of 16 and 21) to obtain consent of both parents before they can marry. 3. To insert a requirement for \u2018full and free consent\u2019 into the Marriage Act 1973. 4. To insert a provision into the Marriage Act 1973 that voids a marriage not obtained with full and free consent. 5. The consultation believed that the Cook Islands was not yet ready to legalise same-sex marriage or civil unions and therefore decided not to incorporate same-sex marriage into the family law reforms. The group acknowledged that this was discriminatory and not in accord with international obligations and that it would require further discussion over time. GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 38 Chapter 3 THE END OF MARRIAGE Introduction This chapter considers law reform issues relating to separation and divorce. Currently, separation is governed in the Cook Islands by the Cook Islands Amendment Act 1994 and divorce is governed by the Cook Islands Act 1915 and the Family Proceedings Act 1963 (NZ). Law reform in this area would be best achieved through the repeal of the applicable provisions and incorporation of these areas into the new Family Law Bill. The significance of both separation and divorce law is primarily in the legal determination of the new relations between the parties, including their duties and obligations relating to property that they own, the responsibilities of either or both of them to provide spousal and child support, determining occupation of the marital home, and settling residence and contact arrangements for any children. These topics are individually considered in the chapters that follow. Therefore, this chapter focuses instead on the grounds on which separation orders and divorce are granted, and their respective immediate legal effects. This chapter identifies and discusses two key aspects of the law in the Cook Islands relating to the end of marriage that are currently non-compliant with CEDAW and contemporary good practices in family law. First, the current divorce procedures in the Cook Islands are still based on fault. This is contrary to international obligations, which expressly require the abolition of fault-based divorce.23 Modern separation and divorce laws have progressed and shifted from a reliance on the establishment of fault, which requires proof of a matrimonial offence (typically desertion, adultery or cruelty) towards a non-fault based, neutral and non-adversarial system of divorce. Fault-based separation and divorce provisions were originally introduced into many legal systems based on a religious belief that divorce is a sin, and that accordingly the rules of divorce should punish the matrimonial crime24 freeing an \u2018innocent spouse from the contractual obligation of a lifelong marriage to a guilty spouse.\u201925 However, this approach is no longer considered consistent with the demographics of changing family forms whereby marriages breakdown has dramatically increased and can no longer be regarded as a lifetime union. Fault-based systems have been further criticized for several reasons, including; because they interfere with the autonomy of both men and women and each persons\u2019 right to choose when to enter and leave relationships,26 and for exacerbating hostility and bitterness between the parties and therefore operating in opposition to the interests of any children. Fault based systems can also make it more difficult for women to leave violent relationships because the requirement to provide evidence of a matrimonial crime may force them to provide evidence of situations that are humiliating, embarrassing, frightening27 and finally the futile and often difficult nature of allocating blame. 3.1 3.2 3.3 23 Concluding Comments of the CEDAW Committee: Luxembourg (2008) 40th Session at para [34] (UN Doc CEDAW/C/LUX/CO/5). 24 M Antoloskaia, \u201cThe Search for a Common Core of Divorce Law: State Intervention Versus Spouses Autonomy\u201d in M Martin-Casals (ed) The Role of Self-Determination in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8d123004-3db5-4403-a012-d8a51fa5f35d": {"__data__": {"id_": "8d123004-3db5-4403-a012-d8a51fa5f35d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing the Implementation of CEDAW in the Cook Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5b4319237a19ed5eaa48d879ed2698c4b80f947769a04399ff556b3ef95cfbd7"}, "3": {"node_id": "a04ee006-66d9-4140-b951-6ef413ada72f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "00df262dadbb483e73b45eae69fb0cc79662e52a41ae97815063a2b34ff41143"}}, "hash": "8a591de03a2c634cb322123e6542d49acb26b33a3b48588db2b91b9e505fb994", "text": "the Modernisation of Family Law in Europe (Girona: Documenta Universitaria, 2006) at 36. 25 H Kay, \u201cNo-Fault Divorce and Child Custody: Chilling out the Gender Wars\u201d (2002-2003) 16 Family Law Quarterly 27 at 30. 26 J Herring, Family Law: Issues, Debates, Policy (Devon: Willan Publishing, 2001) at 34. 27 S Thistle, From Marriage to the Market: The Transformation of Women\u2019s Lives and Work (Los Angeles: University of California Press, 2006) at 49.

The order does not resolve and determine the new legal relationship between the parties. Application for Divorce Current Cook Islands Law A divorce order ends the legal status of marriage between the parties and the legal rights and duties associated with marriage. Divorce is primarily governed in the Cook Islands by the Family Proceedings Act 1963 (NZ) and requires the application of fault-based criteria by the High Court. Most of the grounds included are now widely regarded as outdated and inappropriate. These grounds include: adultery; artificial insemination of the respondent wife without the husband\u2019s consent; desertion for three years; habitual drunkenness for three years, with failure to support or neglect of domestic duties (as the case may be), or cruelty; conviction for murder or certain attempted murders; insanity and confinement for this reason for certain periods without likelihood of recovery; non-compliance for three years with a decree for restitution of conjugal rights; separation by Court order or agreement for three years; living apart for seven years without likelihood of reconciliation; conviction for certain offences of violence or sexual offences; rape, sodomy, or bestiality (wife\u2019s petition). Although these grounds also still remain in the laws of other Pacific Island countries such an approach is out of step with modern divorce laws which have minimized or removed the involvement of courts, removed the requirement that fault be found and instead relying on the wishes of one or both of the spouses to divorce. Introducing a no-fault system of divorce would also satisfy CEDAW legislative compliance indicator 16.13.28 Approaches to Divorce Two identifiable approaches to no-fault frameworks of divorce, which facilitate the dissolution of marriage through simple procedures, have been adopted in contemporary family laws. The most popular approach is a requirement that the relationship has broken down that in such a way that it is \u2018irreconcilable\u2019, \u2018irremediable\u2019 or \u2018irretrievable\u2019, without reference to spousal conduct and typically upon the request of one spouse.29 Some jurisdictions require evidence or proof that the marriage has broken down \u2018irretrievably\u2019 but this has proven to be a considerable burden, takes longer, and is not considered good practice. An alternate approach, as illustrated in the example of Australia below, is that once a specified period of separation has elapsed, typically one year, the marriage is automatically designated as irretrievable. Whilst this approach is morally neutral, simple and easily understood, it has been criticized because it creates a delay of a year before divorce can be granted.30 The delay can pose significant financial hardship for the parties who, for example, may need to find alternate housing for one party until financial settlement upon divorce. Australia has approached this difficulty by not requiring the parties to live apart during the one year separation. However, if the relationship between the parties is acrimonious this may not be possible or desirable. If this approach is adopted it is important to have clear separation procedures (discussed below) 3.4 3.5 3.6 28 V Jivan & C Forster, Translating CEDAW into Law: CEDAW Legislative Compliance in the Cook Islands (Suva: UNDP Pacific Centre, 2008) at 39. 29 C Starnes, \u201cOne More Time: Alimony, Intuition and the Remarriage -Termination Rule\u201d (2006) 81 Indiana Law Journal 971 at 987. 30 The CEDAW Committee in its constructive dialogue with Fiji in July 2010 criticized the one year period of separation provided by the Fiji Family Law Act 2003.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a04ee006-66d9-4140-b951-6ef413ada72f": {"__data__": {"id_": "a04ee006-66d9-4140-b951-6ef413ada72f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing the Implementation of CEDAW in the Cook Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5b4319237a19ed5eaa48d879ed2698c4b80f947769a04399ff556b3ef95cfbd7"}, "2": {"node_id": "8d123004-3db5-4403-a012-d8a51fa5f35d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8a591de03a2c634cb322123e6542d49acb26b33a3b48588db2b91b9e505fb994"}}, "hash": "00df262dadbb483e73b45eae69fb0cc79662e52a41ae97815063a2b34ff41143", "text": "See also S Cretney & J Mason, Principles of Family Law (London: Sweet & Maxwell, 1997) at 322.

The rationale behind this approach is that marriage is the voluntary union of two persons and therefore a unilateral wish of one party to end the union should be seen as sufficient to terminate the marriage. Proponents argue that whilst marriage provides a statement of intent that the relationship will be long-lasting, it is however a legal bond which either spouse should be able to enter or leave with relative (or absolute) freedom. The state cannot require people to live together or continue a relationship and it does not have a legitimate role in attempting to delay or prevent divorce. Instead, it should provide the means to resolve the important legal questions relating to financial settlement, the division of property and the care of children. Sweden has adopted this approach however it has imposed some limitations as illustrated below. If both spouses agree that their marriage should be dissolved they have a right to an immediate divorce (except where there is a child under sixteen years of that provides for either spouse to apply for support, property division or adjustment, occupation of the marital home and residence orders in relation to any children. There must be processes available to immediately resolve these issues so they are not delayed until the divorce is granted. This approach can be coupled with a procedure that converts a separation order into a divorce order automatically without any requirement to proceed to a hearing or to file further documents. Neither best practice approach precludes reconciliation between the parties but they do not require that the parties must attempt reconciliation. 3.7 3.8 Grounds for Divorce: \u201cIrretrievable Breakdown\u201d Family Law Act 1975, s 48, s 49 (Australia) S 48(1) An application under this Act for a divorce order in relation to a marriage shall be based on the ground that the marriage has broken down irretrievably. S 48(2) In a proceeding instituted by such an application, the ground shall be held to have been established, and the divorce order shall be made, if, and only if, the court is satisfied that the parties separated and thereafter lived separately and apart for a continuous period of not less than 12 months immediately preceding the date of the filing of the application for the divorce order. S 49(1) The parties to a marriage may be held to have separated notwithstanding that the cohabitation was brought to an end by the action or conduct of one only of the parties. S 49(2) The parties to a marriage may be held to have separated and to have lived separately and apart notwithstanding that they have continued to reside in the same residence or that either party has rendered some household services to the other. EXAMPLE GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 41 Separation Procedures Legal Effects of Separation The main legal significance of a separation procedure is, like divorce, to enable the court to; award spousal and child support to either of the parties, to determine a property adjustment in lieu of a final property settlement, to settle the occupation of the marital home and to resolve issues in relation to any children. It is crucial that the legislation explicitly provides the authority for the determination of these matters during any period of separation, regardless of which divorce process is adopted. If there is a mandatory separation period or even if an immediate unilateral divorce process is applied (since the parties may choose not to proceed immediately to divorce) access to the relevant legal remedies must be facilitated by the separation process. Grounds for Divorce: Unilateral The Marriage Code (\u00c4ktenskapsbalken) 1987, Chapter 5 (Sweden) Section 1 If the spouses are agreed that their marriage should be dissolved, they shall be entitled to divorce.

If the other spouse does not consent to divorce, a reconsideration period (of six months) must precede the divorce. If the spouses have lived apart for at least 6 months, either of them is entitled to divorce without any reconsideration period.

This however is no longer considered sufficient or appropriate in modern divorce laws. It is not enforceable, and is irrelevant to and has no role in determining the important legal issues that must be resolved when a relationship breaks down. A separation order issued under the Act therefore has little legal impact because currently the important legal issues that typically arise after separation that need to be determined, are governed by other legislation which can be accessed with or without a separation order. For example, the Cook Islands Act 1915 provides for spousal support if there is \u2018reasonable cause\u2019 for a wife or a child to live apart from their father or husband. Provision is made for interim property division or adjustment in the Matrimonial Property Act 1976 (NZ) upon separation and for an occupation order to determine who has the right to occupy the matrimonial home on the basis of what the court thinks \u2018fit\u2019. Issues relating to children, such as who will provide day- to-day care, are determined by the Cook Islands Act 1915 and the Infants Act 1908 on the basis of the best interests of the child. Approaches to Separation Two approachs have been taken to separation procedures in modern divorce law. The first and most straightforward, as illustrated in the example of Sweden below, is to expressly allow either party to apply for spousal and child support from the other and for occupation of the marital home upon separation. This approach does not require either party to establish that the marriage is \u2018irretrievable\u2019 merely that separation has occurred at the request of either party. Additionally, it does not require a separation order and is therefore administratively efficient. The second approach is to establish a procedure for obtaining a separation order. The legal effect of the separation order is to enable either party to: apply for spousal and child support, to determine who will occupy the marital home, and to also enable either party to apply for residence and contact orders if necessary. This approach is administratively much less efficient than the first, and should be adopted only if the parties are required to provide a reason for separation rather than merely enabling access to the relevant legal remedies once separation has, in fact, occurred.

No procedure for obtaining a separation order shall be included in the Bill as this serves no purpose in the divorce procedure adopted. 3. Separation shall begin when either of the parties applies for a divorce, when the parties cease to cohabit, or when either party determines that separation has begun even if the parties are still cohabiting. 4. Upon separation either party can apply for spousal and child support, occupation of the joint residence, property division and residence and contact orders in relation to any children. EXAMPLE GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 44 Chapter 4 THE CARE OF CHILDREN Introduction This chapter considers law reform issues relating to children. In particular this chapter considers; i) the responsibilities of parents in relation to the care of their children until they reach 18, ii) the various kinds of arrangements required for children when parents do not live together, including the resolution of disputes in relation to those arrangements and the basis on which those disputes are to be resolved, iii) the circumstances in which state care and/or supervision can and should be invoked and, lastly, iv) adoption. In the Cook Islands the Cook Islands Act 1915, the Infants Act 1908, and the Juvenile Crimes Act 1968 govern the law relating to children. However, the three Acts contains very limited coverage of the issues discussed in this chapter. Law reform in this area would best be achieved through the repeal of any applicable provisions in the three Acts and incorporation of the area into the new Family Law Bill. In relation to the legal issues relevant to the care of children, a paradigm shift in thinking has occurred in recent years, away from a focus on parental rights and authority, towards a focus instead on the combination of parental responsibilities and the rights of the child. This shift reflects the tenor of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) to which the Cook Islands became a party in 1997. It also reflects many changes in the demographic structure and make-up of family forms in recent years in many countries including the Cook Islands. The Explanatory Note to the New Zealand Care of Children Act 2004 which came into effect in 2005, with the aim of modernizing the law in relation to the care of children articulated this as follows: \u201cFamily and ethnic demographics in New Zealand have changed considerably since the 1968 Act was enacted. The 1968 Act is premised upon a traditional nuclear family model that does not reflect the diversity of family arrangements that now exist in New Zealand. More modern legislation must provide a framework that recognises and supports all types of family units that care for children, for example, single-parent households, extended families, reconstituted families, and de facto relationships (including those of the same sex).\u201d32 In the majority of cases in the Cook Islands, after the breakdown of a relationship or when the parents do not live together, the parties reach agreement on what arrangements should be made for children without court intervention. This can often be in the children\u2019s best interests. Agreement in such situations is achieved either through personal mutual compromise or solicitor-negotiated settlement. The standards represented in the law can provide a strong basis for the decisions and agreement reached. Protections must be in place, however for those circumstances where agreement cannot be reached or agreement is not in the best interests of the child. 4.1 4.2 4.3 32 Care of Children Bill 2003 (NZ) No 54-1, Explanatory Note, General Policy Statement, at 1.

The Principle of the Best Interests of the Child Legislative Definition Article(1)(d) of CEDAW states that \u2018in all cases the interests of the children shall be paramount.\u2019 Article 3(1) of the CRC states that in all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration. In response to these international obligations, modern family law typically includes a clear statement in the legislation that the principle of the child\u2019s best interests in relation to all matters pertaining to children is paramount, as illustrated below in the example of England. The inclusion of a list of statutory factors to be used to determine what is the best interests of the child is discussed below in paragraph [4.6]. A legislative statement confirming the paramountcy of the best interests of the child in all proceedings concerning children would also represent compliance with CEDAW legislative indicator 16.18.33 Currently, in the Cook Islands the Infants Act 1908 provides that in any proceedings relating to \u2018the custody or upbringing of an infant\u2019 (defined as a person uner 18)34 the court \u2018shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration\u2019. The Cook Islands Act 1915 states that the the High Court may \u2018in and by any decree for the dissolution of marriage, or at any time and from time to time thereafter, make such order as it thinks fit as to the custody of the children of the marriage.\u201935 There are some difficulties in determining how these two Acts were originally meant to interact, as well as with the current interpretations and practices however, the case law suggests that judges do apply the principle of the best interests of the child. It is important however that there is a clear statement in the legislation that explicitly states that the principle of the best interest of the child is to be applied in all proceedings relating to the care of children to ensure the principle is consistently applied in every case. 33 See V Jivan & C Forster, Translating CEDAW into Law: CEDAW Legislative Compliance in the Cook Islands (Suva: UNDP Pacific Centre, 2008) at 41. 34 Infants Amendment Act 2009, s 3. 35 Cook Islands Act 1915, s 538. 4.4 4.5 GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 46 Best Interests of the Child Paramount Care of Children Act 2004, s 4 (1) (New Zealand) The welfare and best interests of the child must be the first and paramount consideration\u2014 (a) in the administration and application of this Act, for example, in proceedings under this Act; and (b) in any other proceedings involving the guardianship of, or the role of providing day to day care for, or contact with, a child. Statutory Checklist of Factors The trend in modern family law is to provide a statutory checklist (which means a specific checklist of factors is included in the law itself) to guide the court in determining what is in the child\u2019s best interests in family law proceedings. The arguments in favor of including such a checklist in the law, are that; it provides clarity and therefore enables a more consistent and systematic approach to decision-making by all judges, it enables judges to clearly identify the reasons for their decisions, simplifies the judicial process, it gives parents and children a greater understanding of the basis of the judge\u2019s decision, and it assists professionals when they prepare reports for the court to ensure that all aspects of the best interests of the child are covered. Finally, including a checklist also provides guidance for settling issues in relation to children outside of the court setting. Conversely, some argue against the use of a statutory checklist on the basis that; it may lengthen proceedings, judges may come to take a mechanical approach to decision-making relying solely on the checklist and that the best interests of the child principle is all-encompassing", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e2968f9c-af14-4ad6-a482-d4639fb3ff73": {"__data__": {"id_": "e2968f9c-af14-4ad6-a482-d4639fb3ff73", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing the Implementation of CEDAW in the Cook Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "047b4e88905203c8fe0d1f5f0c5c42682807087aeaf4212ecfb209b8a52ef594"}}, "hash": "047b4e88905203c8fe0d1f5f0c5c42682807087aeaf4212ecfb209b8a52ef594", "text": "and does not require explicit guidance.36 Most modern family law legislation does however contain a checklist including, in the Oceanic region, Australia, Fiji, and New Zealand.

This factor requires the court to consider the relationship of the child with her or his parents, siblings or any other person with whom the child normally resides (including for example grandparents) recognising the potential impact on the child, of any change in such arrangements. This factor recognises the importance of maintaining existing relationships, emotional bonds and physical environment and in particular that siblings should, wherever possible, be brought up together in the same household so that they can be of emotional support to each other.

GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 49 Parental Responsibility The Progression from Parental Authority to Parental Responsibility The role of parents in relation to their children has been, in many common law countries, historically conceptualized in terms of their rights and authority over a child, rather than in terms of their responsibility for the child\u2019s welfare and best interests. In contrast to this approach, Article 18(1) of the CRC obligates state parties to use their best efforts to ensure recognition of the primary role of parents in protecting the interests of children and states that both parents have common responsibilities for the upbringing and development of the child. Accordingly, a number of countries (including Fiji) have in recent years shifted from the parent-focused \u2018parental rights and authority\u2019 approach towards the more child-focused concept of \u2018parental responsibility\u2019. The inclusion of a provision defining parental responsibility accords with the CRC and good practice in the modern family law context. Legislative Definition of Parental Responsibility Two approaches have been taken in modern family laws to defining parental responsibility. The first approach is to include a detailed description of the particular responsibilities expected of both parents (as seen in the example of Scotland below). The second approach is to include a short generic provision that does not detail the responsibilities but instead leaves it to the discretion of the judges (as seen in the example of Fiji below). The inclusion of a detailed list of responsibilities could be seen by some as too restrictive and directive. On the other hand, the generic approach, such as the one taken by Fiji, could be viewed as failing to give appropriate guidance to parents and the judges in determining parental responsibility. This may result in differing and uneven interpretations and applications of the law. The more detailed approach adopted by Scotland accords more closely with the obligations under the CRC. Article 6 states that the \u2018responsibilities, rights and duties\u2019 of parents to provide, appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise by the child of the rights recognized in the present Convention. Article 9 states that a child who is separated from one or both parents has the right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis, except if it is contrary to the child\u2019s best interests. Who has Parental Responsibility? Article 16(1)(d) of CEDAW obligates States parties to ensure \u2018on a basis of equality of men and women the same rights and responsibilities as parents, irrespective of their marital status, in matters relating to their children.\u2019 Historically, in many common law countries biological fathers had sole parental rights in relation to their children born within marriage whilst mothers were primarily left with responsibilities for children born outside of marriage. The obligation to place the child\u2019s interests as paramount and the contemporary view that \u2018the burdens and pleasures of child rearing\u2019 should be shared by both parents, has resulted in a shift in modern family law towards equal parental responsibility. As well as a clear statement of equal and shared parental responsibility, some countries have included in the legislation a provision stating that parental responsibility continues until the child is 18 regardless of other circumstances such as a parent re-partnering. This approach is reflected in the good practice examples of Fiji and England below. 4.8 4.9 4.10 GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c1d8b0ed-36df-4efb-ac42-ba0d8d39b072": {"__data__": {"id_": "c1d8b0ed-36df-4efb-ac42-ba0d8d39b072", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing the Implementation of CEDAW in the Cook Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "859ea6f01341f3a521d3678bc85f25f13cad85ab512812665eb0e5749268e2e2"}}, "hash": "859ea6f01341f3a521d3678bc85f25f13cad85ab512812665eb0e5749268e2e2", "text": "0 1 0 50 Definition of Parental Responsibility Children (Scotland) Act 1995, s 1 (Scotland) A parent has in relation to [her or] his child the responsibility: (a) to safeguard and promote the child\u2019s health, development and best interests; and (b) to provide, in a manner appropriate to the stage of development of the child: (i) direction and (ii) guidance to the child; and (c) if the child is not living with the parent, to maintain personal relations and direct contact with the child on a regular basis; and (d) to act as the child\u2019s legal representative Family Law Act 2003, s 45.

EXAMPLES EXAMPLES GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 51 The Age At Which Parental Responsibility Legally Ends The age at which legal parental responsibility ceases differs in modern family law with some countries opting for when the child turn 18 years old, some opting for 16 years old and some 16 and 18 depending on the particular responsibilities in question. In Scotland all parental responsibilities, except the responsibility to provide guidance which lasts until the child is 18, cease when the child reaches 16 years of age.37 In Fiji all aspects of parental responsibility continue until the child is 1838 and this approach most closely aligns to Article 1 of the CRC which defines a child as a \u2018human being below the age of 18 years unless, under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier.\u2019 Parenting Orders Definition of Parenting Orders The Cook Islands Act 1915 authorizes the High Court to make custody orders on the basis of what \u2018it thinks fit\u2019 in relation to the children of the marriage.39 The Infants Act 1908 however provides for custody to be determined on the basis of the \u2018welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration\u2019. Whilst the Cook Islands Act 1915 only applies to children whose parents are married to each other, it is unclear whether the Infants Act 1908 applies to unmarried parents. The Infants Act 1908 also provides for access orders, to be determined on the basis of the welfare of the infant and the conduct of the parents. Good practice requires a consolidation of the legislation, an explicit statement that the best interests of the child are paramount in all proceedings involving children, and the removal of any reference to parental conduct or to any relationship that either parent may have with another person. Modern family law legislation has moved away from the terminology of custody and access orders, which foster notions of ownership in children by focusing on the respective \u2018rights\u2019 of the parents, and on which parent has been granted \u2018possession\u2019 of the child to the exclusion of the other. Instead, the new approach emphasizes parental agreement as the primary means of settling parenting arrangements when parents do not live together, and the issuing of parenting orders. When parents are not living together, parenting orders are made to settle arrangements in respect of; the child\u2019s residence, to enable continuing contact with both parents, or with other important adults in the child\u2019s life, provided this is in the best interests of the child, and to determine the process for making important decisions in relation to the child. Parenting orders in modern family law typically consist of a range of orders termed \u2018residence\u2019, \u2018contact\u2019 \u2018specific issues\u2019 and \u2018prohibited steps\u2019 orders. Types of Parenting Orders Residence Order Residence orders determine where a child is to live and who has the day-to-day care of the child. In modern family law a residence orders replace custody orders.

In modern family law contact orders replace access orders. Access orders were historically adult-centered, permitting another person to visit the child for the benefit of the adult. In contrast, a contact order is child-centered, requiring the person with whom the child lives to allow contact with the other parent or other person named in the order, if it is in the best interests of the child. It signals a move away from approaching contact with the child as a parental right, to viewing it instead as the child\u2019s right and part of the range of responsibilities that parents have for their children. The rationale underscoring a contact order is therefore to recognize and maintain the beneficial relationships already established between the child and other children in the family or other adults to the maximum extent possible in the light of changed family circumstances. Contact orders typically permit \u2018custody\u201940 however in the Cook Islands the law specifically states that neither the father nor the mother has a \u2018superior\u2019 claim to the other.41 In the Cook Islands, currently the law gives the custodial parent virtually all rights concerning the upbringing of the child.42 A residence order is conceptually different from a custody order because it gives one parent the day-to-day care and responsibility for the child but does not remove the responsibility of the other parent to participate in parenting as much as is practicable. 4.15 40 For example in Tuvalu paternal presumption applies to a child over 2 years of age.

A prohibited steps order is typically issued to prohibit major decisions in relation to the child such as changing the surname of the child, removing the child from the country, changing the nationality or domicile of the child, or consent to the adoption process. The availability of a prohibited steps order provides a means of protecting the rights of the child in accordance with the CRC. 4.17 EXAMPLES Specific Issues Order Children Act 1989, s 8 (England) A specific issue order means an order giving directions for the purpose of determining a specific question which has arisen, or which may arise, in connection with any aspect of parental responsibility for a child. EXAMPLES Prohibited Steps Order Children Act 1989, s 8(1) (England) A prohibited steps order is an order that no step which could be taken by a parent in meeting her or his parental responsibilities or her or his parental rights for a child, and which is of a kind specified in the order, shall be taken by any person without the consent of the court. Application for Parenting Orders Persons Who Can Apply The trend in modern family law is to enable a wide range of potentially interested parties to apply for a parenting order. In Australia (and Fiji which has replicated the Australian provisions), an application for a parenting order may be made by a representative of the child, by either or both parents, or any other person concerned with the care, welfare or development of the child.43 This is a good practice approach. 4.18 43 Family Law Act, 1975, s 65C (Australia); Family Law Act 2003, s 65 (Fiji).

However, orders are not always necessary to settle arrangements in relation to residence and contact. A good practice approach is to explicitly provide in the legislation that a court must not make an order unless it considers that doing so would be better for the child than making no order at all. This measure ensures that the court only intervenes in the child\u2019s life where there is a real problem in need of resolution and not simply as a matter of routine (because it can). The rationale underscoring this approach is that if parents are prepared to co-operate between themselves or through a mediation process to ensure suitable continuing arrangements for their children, not making an order would be in the best interests of the children, and this would enhance and support the parents\u2019 future relationship. Primacy of Court Orders Over Parental Responsibility The inclusion of parental responsibility provisions in the law may enable a parent to be obstructive in the exercise of parenting orders. In the Australian context, a review of the provisions on parental responsibility (introduced into the Family Law Act 1975) revealed that \u2018the meaning of joint parental responsibility, and how joint parental responsibility should be exercised after the making of court orders, was not clearly stated in the legislation and was not well enough understood by the legal profession and the public\u2019.44 It is important therefore that the legislation clearly states that parental responsibility, especially to the extent that it involves any kind of \u2018authority\u2019 in relation to decision-making, are superseded by any court order as illustrated in the example of England below. 4.20 4.21 EXAMPLES Primacy of Parenting Orders Children Act 1989, s 2(8) (England) The fact that a person has parental responsibility for a child shall not entitle her or him to act in any way which would be incompatible with any order made with respect to the child under this Act. 44 H Rhoades, R Graycar and M Harrison, The Family Law Reform Act 1995: The First Three Years (Dec 2000, University of Sydney and Family Court of Australia).

A parenting plan is an agreement made between the parents of the child that deals with issues such as residence, contact, child support or any other aspect of parental responsibility. The parenting plan can then be registered with the court and subject to enforcement in the same way as any court order. The rationale underscoring parenting plans is that they encourage parents and those caring for children to make their own arrangements and to honor them by providing the parties with a legal means of enforcing those arrangements. It is important that safeguards are included to ensure that no parenting plan can be registered unless it is accords with the welfare and best interests of the child and to ensure that no pressure was exerted on either party to agree to the plan.

The approaches that various countries have adopted to ensure that orders are enforced and that those who contravene them are sanctioned include the following: \u2022 expressly spelling out the consequences of orders and contraventions; \u2022 varying or discharging the parenting order (for example, by reducing the time in which the child is in the care of, or has contact with the party that contravenes the order); \u2022 requiring the deposit of a bond to the court as an assurance that the parenting order will not be contravened again; \u2022 punishing the party in breach of the order with penalties such as fines, imprisonment or community service orders. The Abduction of Children Overseas The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction 198045 (The Hague Convention) aims at securing the prompt and safe return of children who have been wrongfully removed from one Convention country to another, and to ensure that rights of residence and contact under the law of one country are effectively respected in other countries that are party to the Convention.46 A specific issues order (discussed previously) can prohibit the removal of children without the permission of the court and/or the other parent and linked to passport control. However, if a child is removed either in the absence of such an order, contrary to the order, or is removed legitimately for a holiday or some other purpose and not returned, then the Hague Convention can be used to facilitate the child\u2019s return if the child is resident in a country that is also party to the Convention. The Cook Islands is not yet a party to the Hague Convention, although the removal of children from the Cook Islands may be a growing problem 4.22 4.23 45 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, 25 October 1980, Hague XXVIII, available at: http://www. unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3ae6b3951c.html hereinafter the \u2018Hague Convention\u2019. 46 Hong Kong Law Reform Commission, International Parental Child Abduction (Apr 2002), at para [1.5]. 4.24 4.25 GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 58 as freedom of movement increases between countries. A party to the Hague Convention has dual obligations. On the one hand, if it becomes a state party, the Cook Islands would be required to set up a Central Authority to receive applications, collect relevant information and institute the necessary action for the return of abducted or unlawfully retained children from the Cook Islands to that of their resident country. This role includes discovering the whereabouts of the child, preventing any or further harm, securing voluntary return, initiating proceedings and making administrative arrangements for the child\u2019s return.47 On the other hand, in relation to children removed from the Cook Islands, a procedure must be established that provides evidence to the country to which the child has been removed that the child is \u2018habitually resident\u2019 in the Cook Islands and that the removal or retention of the child outside of the Cook Islands is wrongful. Wrongfulness is defined as a breach of the \u201ccustody rights\u201d of another person or institution and although an order is not required this is the easiest process for its establishment. The approach taken in the Family Law Act 2003 in Fiji, as illustrated in the example below, which is also not a party to the Hague Convention, provides a good practice example for the Cook Islands. The legislation authorizes the future enactment of relevant provisions to facilitate the return of abducted children should Fiji become a party to the Hague Convention at a later date. The worldwide situation for the return of children can only be improved by further ratifications to the Convention, which is recommended by numerous commentators. 48 4.26 EXAMPLES Hague Convention of International Child Abduction Family Law Act 2003, s 200(1) (Fiji) The regulations may make such provision as is necessary to enable the performance of the obligations of the State, or to obtain for the State any advantage or benefit, under the Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction signed at The Hague on 25 October 1980 (the Convention) but any such regulations must not come into operation until the day on which that Convention enters into force for the Fiji Islands. 47 See S Cretney & J Masson, Principles of Family Law (London: Sweet & Maxwell, 1997) at 757. 48 H Slota, \u201cPreventing and Responding to International Child Abduction\u201d (2009) 23(2) American", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cfcd3f91-1939-4c8e-b4cb-5c48349507ba": {"__data__": {"id_": "cfcd3f91-1939-4c8e-b4cb-5c48349507ba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing the Implementation of CEDAW in the Cook Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "32469a2c1b934a310d2399bdcf95e63b5bb74fe48b5a97810b9db02610cfdc91"}}, "hash": "32469a2c1b934a310d2399bdcf95e63b5bb74fe48b5a97810b9db02610cfdc91", "text": "Journal of Family Law 73; J Caldwell, \u201cChild Abduction Cases: Evaluating Risks to the Child and the Convention.\u201d (2008) 23(2) New Zealand Universities Law Review 161.

Article 20 obligates the state to provide to special protection and assistance, including alternative care, to a child temporarily or permanently deprived of his or her family environment, or in whose own best interests cannot be allowed to remain in that environment. Article 23 of the CRC also specifically requires recognition of the rights of children with disabilities and the CRPD prohibits discrimination against children with disabilities. The CRPD further states that under no circumstances is the disability of a child and either or both parents to be used as the reason to remove a child from the family.49 Additionally, if the immediate family cannot care for a child with a disability, \u201cStates Parties shall\u2026 undertake every effort to provide alternative care within the wider family, and failing that, within the community in a family setting.\u201d50 The international obligations of a State party are therefore to ensure that children are protected from abuse and/or neglect. Definition of Care and Supervision Orders The first and most desirable option if a child\u2019s safety is at risk in her or his home due to abuse or gross neglect is the removal of the abuser (rather than the child). In some circumstances this may not be possible, for example, if both parents are involved in the abuse or if the abuser is the sole parent or caregiver. In such circumstances, although regarded \u2018as an option of last resort\u2019, the state may need to intervene to safeguard the welfare of the child by removing her or him. In such circumstances the state must ensure the highest standard of care possible in accord with Article 20 of the CRC. In the Cook Islands the Prevention of Juvenile Crime 1968 provides for the removal of children from their \u2018surroundings\u2019 if the child \u2018is living in a place of ill- repute, or is likely to be ill-treated or neglected or for any other reason\u2019. 51 There is no duty however placed upon the state to provide appropriate care to the child and the provisions are primarily aimed at punitive measures against the parents rather than ensuring the welfare of the child. The Act also provides for supervision orders but these are available only if a child commits an offence and are punitive in their intent rather than aimed at the care and protection of the child.52 The approach adopted in modern family law legislation is to enable state intervention through two forms of public orders. The first, a care order, authorizes the state to remove the child from the home and obligates them to provide appropriate alternate services for the child such as placing the child in foster-care, with another relative or family friend or into institutionalized care. The second is a supervision order whereby the child remains in the home but the state plays a supervisory role, for example, by undertaking regular scheduled visits 4.30 4.31 4.27 4.28 4.29 49 CRPD, Article 23(4). 50 CRPD, Article 23(5). 51 Prevention of Juvenile Crime 1968, s 22. 52 Prevention of Juvenile Crime 1968, s 27.

Grounds for Application The statutory grounds for care and supervision orders are crucial since the order will result in either the compulsory removal of a child from the family in the case of a care order, or mandatory intervention in the family through a supervision order. The application of the principle of the best interests of the child as the sole criteria is unsuitable for care and supervision orders because it could enable the removal of children from their homes when the child\u2019s safety is not at immediate risk through abuse or neglect. An alternative approach, adopted by England as illustrated below, is to use a two step process. A threshold requirement establishes whether the child is at risk of significant harm due to either inadequate care provided by the parent or lack of parental control. If this is satisfied than the principle of the best interests of the child, which applies to all proceedings under the Act, is then applied to establish whether an order is the best option in the circumstances of the case. 4.32 4.33 Grounds for Care and Supervision Order Children Act 1989, s 31(2) (England) A court may only make a care order or supervision order if it is satisfied\u2014 (a) that the child concerned is suffering, or is likely to suffer, significant harm; and (b) that the harm, or likelihood of harm, is attributable to\u2014 the care given to the child, or likely to be given to him if the order were not made, not being what it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give to him; or the child being beyond parental control (i) (ii) GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 61 Legal Effects of Care Orders The legal effect of a care order is typically as follows. A care order obligates the state to receive the child into its care, provide an appropriate standard of care and gives parental responsibility to the state (and specifically the person or agency designated to represent the state, i.e. social welfare services). Typically it does not mean that the parents no longer have parental responsibility but prevents them from exercising it in a way that is incompatible with the care order. The state authority must share parental responsibility with the parent and facilitate contact, if it is in the child\u2019s best interests. The legislation might also impose restrictions on making major decisions such as changing the child\u2019s surname or agreeing to adoption. Legal Effects of Supervision Orders Supervision orders differ fundamentally from care orders because (unlike care orders) they do not give parental responsibility to the state and the parents remain responsible for the child\u2019s safety and welfare. The purpose of a supervision order is to enable the state to oversee a child at risk without removing the child from the home. It thus provides a lesser form of state intervention than a care order. The approach taken in many countries is to appoint a supervisor who is then given responsibilities and duties. This may include monitoring the care given to the child, introducing participation activities to improve the socialization of the child, or ensuring that the child is attending school. 4.34 4.35 EXAMPLES Legal Effect of a Care Order Children Act 1989, s 33(1) (England) (1) Where a care order is made with respect to a child it shall be the duty of the local authority designated by the order to receive the child into their care and to keep [her or] him in their care while the order remains in force. (3) While a care order is in force with respect to a child, the local authority designated by the order shall\u2014 (a) have parental responsibility for the child; and (b) have the power (subject to the following provisions of this section) to determine the extent to which a parent or guardian of the child may meet his parental responsibility for [her or] him.

Family group conferencing originated New Zealand in the late 1980\u2019s in situations of neglect and abuse where the state was poised to remove a child from a family. FGC was a response to; i) the removal of Maori children by the state and their placement with \u2018cultural strangers\u2019 or in state institutions, ii) evidence that children have been, and continue to be, abused in the child welfare \u2018substitute\u2019 care system, and iii) evidence that it is better for children to remain in their families, including their extended families, rather than being taken into state care. FGC has subsequently been applied in New Zealand to youth justice (delinquency) cases. Since the development of FGC in New Zealand,53 it has been implemented in 17 countries including Canada,54 throughout Scandinavia,55 the United Kingdom,56 Ireland57 the USA58 and Australia.59 Procedure of Family Group Conferences A FGC is typically called prior to any care and protection court hearing by the social welfare services, the court or other person authorized by the legislation to request a conference. Although the New Zealand model does not offer such protection in no circumstances should a family group conference be convened if there is domestic violence, a suspicion of domestic violence or any likelihood of domestic violence occurring in the future. Once a conference is requested a chairperson is appointed by the registrar of the court (or other authorized person). Although this is not a feature of family group conferencing in New Zealand it is important that the chairperson receive specialized training to ensure they are skilled at facilitating family dynamics and to ensure they have an understanding of cultural or social traditions that may allow for men to dominate and are equipped with skills to prevent this and to ensure an equal and participatory forum. Family group conferences in New Zealand and in other countries where they have been adopted typically occur in four stages as follows. The first stage of the conference is the introduction, where the chairperson welcomes all participants and describes the course of action and the purpose of the conference. This is done in a manner that is consistent with the family\u2019s cultural and social tradition including a choice of language and the choice to include prayer and/or food.

The aim of this stage of the FGC is to arrive at agreement. The aim of the agreement is to determine i) whether the child is in need of care and protection, and if so ii) to formulate a plan that will address the care and protection of the child. Whilst in the New Zealand model the family is free to set their own procedures and conduct this part of the FGC as formally or informally as they wish, good practice requires that safeguards are introduced to ensure that discussion and negotiations proceed in a way that furthers the welfare and the best interests of the child and to ensure that participants have an equal ability to contribute. For a conference agreement to proceed to the court for consideration it is necessary that all participants agree. To ensure that agreement is full and free safeguards may be required to ensure that no pressure is exerted on any of the participants.60 For the fourth and final stage of the FGC, the professionals rejoin the family and the final plan is determined. The professionals help the family fine tune the plan in order to reach one that is acceptable to all participants. A number of participants, namely the parents, social workers, care and protection coordinator, and the child\u2019s lawyer are given veto power, which helps ensure that the participants involved in the FGC agree with the decision reached. Whilst in the New Zealand model a decision reached by the FGC is given legal effect this approach has not been adopted in Australia, where either the courts or the relevant government department must endorse any plans or recommendations before they can take effect.61 This approach represents a more desirable model of FGC and good practice requires that any agreement reached can only be given legal effect if the court considers the plan furthers the welfare and the best interests of the child. The court should be given authority to modify or remove any part of the plan which does not accord with the welfare and best interests of the child. Family Group Conferencing in the Cook Islands Context Collaborative rather than adversarial Family group conferences represent a collaborative, rather than an adversarial, approach to resolving a problem. The focus is on agreement rather than placing the parties in opposition to each other through the court system and to enable a solution to be reached without the stress of a long, expensive court proceeding.

However, as noted above it is important that the conference provides a forum in which all participants are able to participate equally and that protections are introduced to ensure that no participant dominates the proceedings and that the process and outcome is always centered around the best interests of the child, and not the interests of any of the participating family members as these may not always be the same. 62 Including extended family members A core principle of family group conferencing is that the \u2018family\u2019 consists of more than just the nuclear family. This principle is very relevant to the Cook Islands where extended families are often involved in all aspects of the parenting process. Additionally, FGC views child welfare as a responsibility shared by many entities including government agencies, communities and families. After nearly two decades in New Zealand, FGC is considered to be one of the \u201cplausible, realistic methods for merging the needs and interests of children and families and the protection concerns of public child welfare agencies, the courts, and the community.

FGC also takes the view that children are best cared for within their extended kin network and in situations of neglect or abuse extended families can create the sort of therapeutic conditions necessary for the rebuilding of damaged lives. It views families, no matter how imperfect, as important to a child\u2019s upbringing. By enabling the extended family to devise a plan for the care of the abused or neglected child, with the approval and oversight of the court, the family is placed at the centre of the welfare proceeding thereby building and repairing the family\u2019s ability to care for and protect the child. Welfare and best interests of child must be paramount The inclusion of family group conferences into the family law framework must ensure that the benefits of encouraging parents, other involved adults and the child to reach agreement do not compromise the best interests of the child. In the New Zealand model the actual decision-makers are the extended families. Conferences have the power to decide, if there is unanimous agreement, whether or not a child is in need of care and protection, as well as how this need can best be addressed. The intention of this process is to transfer the power and authority of decision-making for children into the hands of the people who have a life-long connection with them and who have to live with the outcome of the decisions made. However, if the plan formulated by the conference is not in accord with the principle of the best interests of the child then an important good practice protection is to compel the court to 4.42 4.43 4.44 S Holland & M Rivett, \u201cEveryone Started Shouting\u2019: Making Connections Between the Process of Family Group Conferences and Family Therapy Practice\u201d (2008) 38(1) British Journal of Social Work 21. 62 GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 65 modify or reject the plan and recommendations of the FGC so that it accords with the CRC principle of the paramount role of the welfare and the best interests of the child. Domestic Violence Although the New Zealand model does not prevent the convening of a family group conference in a situation of domestic violence, suspected domestic violence or potential domestic violence good practice requires that FGCs are prohibited in such circumstances. No victim of domestic violence, or person that is in fear of domestic violence either an adult or a child should be placed in a family group conference situation with an offender or a member of the offender\u2019s family. 63 Adoption of Children Purpose of adoption Adoption ends the legal status of a birth family or a parent and provides a new permanent home for a child replacing, in law, one family or parent with another. The adoptive parent or parents take on the legal attributes of parenthood and the child is treated by law as a member of the adoptive family or a child of the adoptive parent.64 Historically, adoption focused on adult needs. When first introduced in England it served the dual purpose of offering a discreet exit from stigma and economic hardship for unmarried mothers and, at the same time, met the needs of childless parents. Modern adoption law is, by contrast, in accord with Article 21 of the CRC a child focused process centred on a means of finding a family for a child rather than a child for a family, and recognizing the legal role and responsibilities of a new parent.65 Adoption typically falls within three scenarios. The first is when a person or couple adopts a child that is orphaned or given up for adoption by the birth mother (or parents). The second is when a step- parent adopts a child that she or he is parenting, and the third is when the state has care of a child and seeks a permanent parent or parents for the child. In the Cook Islands adoption is currently regulated by the Cook Islands Act 1915 providing separately and differently for \u2018Native adoption\u2019 and \u2018European adoption\u2019. These provisions were enacted in the context of early twentieth century colonisation and, in many aspects, require modernizing to meet international standards and obligations imposed by CEDAW and the CRC.

It can also be made by an individual unmarried person provided they are at least 30 years older than the child.67 This adoption regime requires modernization to meet the good practice standards in contemporary adoption law. The primary purpose of an adoption process is to place a child in a stable, secure and loving environment. Research suggests that this can be provided in a range of family forms including extended family forms such as grandparents, aunts and uncles, married and de facto couples, both opposite sex and same-sex, and by individuals.68 Good practice requires, therefore, that the emphasis in adoption law should be on what is in the child\u2019s best interests in light of the abilities and capabilities of the prospective adoptive parent or parents in accord with Article 21 of the CRC. Accordingly, the law should not limit who can apply to adopt but rather determine their suitability as adoptive parent[s] on the basis of criteria which focuses on their capacity to provide a stable and secure environment for the child and the best interests of the child, rather than other, often discriminatory criteria that has no bearing on the applicant\u2019s ability to parent a specific child. England introduced such a regime in 2002 enabling anyone over 21 to adopt, including same-sex and opposite sex couples who are \u2018living as partners in an enduring family relationship.\u201969 Such an approach prevents unfounded prejudices and discrimination against particular groups in the community (such as de facto couples and persons not in relationships) and is compliant with the anti-discrimination provisions in both CEDAW and the CRC. At the same time, the legislation prevents adoption by any person that has been convicted for specified offences such as child abuse. Who can be Adopted? The Cook Islands provides differently for indigenous Cook Islander adoption and European adoption. The Cook Islands Act 1915 states \u2018No person other than a Native or the descendent of a Native (whether legitimate or illegitimate) shall be capable of being adopted by a Native.\u201970 In relation to European adoption the Act states \u2018any child, whether Native or European, and whether legitimate or illegitimate, and whether domiciled in the Cook Islands or not, shall be capable of being adopted\u2019.71 Whilst the purpose of prohibiting indigenous Cook Islanders from adopting non-indigenous children was (and is) to prevent non indigenous Cook Islanders from obtaining succession rights to native land, these provisions are discriminatory. Modern adoption law usually enables any child under 18 to be adopted by all eligible persons in accord with good practice.

GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 69 Grounds for Determining Adoption Article 21 of the CRC obligates States parties to ensure that the principle of the best interests of the child is the paramount consideration in adoption determinations. In the Cook Islands the grounds for both European and Cook Islander adoption are that \u2018the applicant is a fit and proper person to have the care and custody of the child and of sufficient ability to maintain the child, and the adoption will not be contrary to the welfare and interests of the child.\u201976 Uniformly, the approach of modern adoption law is to incorporate the best interests of the child as the (or a) primary consideration and also that the person who is applying for the adoption is fit and proper and of sufficient ability to provide the day-to-day care for the child. However, a range of other criteria has also been included such as; the prospective parent[s] willingness to comply with religious beliefs of the parents (as in the example of New Zealand below), respecting the racial origin and cultural background of the child, the wishes of the child (as in the example of New Zealand below), the likely effect on the child of ceasing to be a member of the original family and becoming an adopted person, the likelihood of relationships with the original (including extended) family continuing and the value to the child of the continuation of such relationships. EXAMPLES (1) Consent to a child\u2019s adoption is not effective unless it is: (a) informed consent, and (b) given in accordance with this Act. (2) Consent given by a person (other than a child under 18 years of age) is not effective if it appears to the Court that: (a) it was not given in accordance with this Act, or (b) it was obtained by fraud, duress or other improper means, or (c) the instrument of consent has been altered in a material particular without authority, or (d) the person giving or purporting to give the consent was not, at the time the instrument of consent was signed, in a fit condition to give the consent. (3) Consent is not effective if it is revoked during the time allowed by section 73. (4) Consent given by a birth parent who is less than 18 years of age is not effective if it appears to the Court that the birth parent did not have the benefit of independent legal advice concerning the adoption before the instrument of consent was signed by the birth parent.

This can become an important consideration in relation to the temporary and permanent removal of indigenous children from their families and/or communities, and in the case of adoption. The best option is to place indigenous children in a culturally similar home, but where this is not possible, alternative caregivers should encourage children to continue to practice their own culture and to be educated in their own culture and language. However, this should not amount to a specific prohibition on the adoption of indigenous children by non-indigenous individuals. C169 Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989.

Grounds for Determining Adoption Adoption Act 1955, s 35(1) (New Zealand) 4.54 The Legal Effects of Adoption Adoption fundamentally affects the legal status of the child. The adoptive parent[s] gain parental responsibility for the child including the obligation to provide day-to-day care for the child and to make decisions regarding the education, medical care and upbringing of the child. In the situation where a step-parent adopts the child the adoptive parent gains the responsibility of sharing the day-to- day care and decision making in relation to the child. The child\u2019s natural parent(s) gives up her or his (or their) parental rights and responsibilities in respect of the child (unless there is an agreement between the birth parents and the adoptive parents as part of an open adoption process as described below in 4.57). 4.55 GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 71 NZ Law Reform Commission, Adoption and its Alternatives: A Different Approach and a New Framework, 2000 at 67. See Adoption and its Alternatives note 40 at 33. C Smith & J Logan, After Adoption: Direct Contact and Relationships (New York: Routledge, 2004) at 33. 79 80 81 All legal agreements such as child support orders or residence and contact orders are terminated. Additionally, legal relationships with the child\u2019s previous wider family are severed and the child no longer has rights in relation to inheritance or citizenship in respect of her or his former family. This does not mean that emotional relationships with the child\u2019s former family need also be ended. In an open adoption regime as described below in 4.41 the parties can agree that such relationships can continue. The adoption process has been historically kept closed and secret. Research has indicated however that the secrecy of closed regimes of adoption have caused both serious psychological trauma including feelings of rejection, confusion, or of being unwanted to some adopted children, and in some instances, lifetime bereavement to the birth family.79 Experts have recommended therefore a more open and inclusive system of adoption as appropriate in the modern context, particularly in communities (such as the Cook Islands) where kinship networks are broad and enduring.80 It is also consistent with the CRC which provides the child with the right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis, except if it is contrary to the child\u2019s best interests. An \u2018open\u2019 adoption process enables the child, in some circumstances, to maintain ongoing contact with her or his birth parents. The goal of an open adoption process is to ensure that the child feels as psychologically secure as possible and lessen any sense of loss she or he might experience. Research suggests that whether contact is direct or indirect by way of an annual report or photograph it is potentially important for the child\u2019s sense of identity and knowledge of family background.81 Additionally, it provides a means for a child\u2019s cultural heritage and ethnicity to be furthered. Further, there is no secrecy about where the child comes from or who their birth family is. Open adoptions are not shared parenting arrangements as both birth and adoptive parent/s have their own separate and distinctive roles. Whilst open adoption is favored it has not yet been incorporated into many adoption law regimes. New South Wales (Australia) however, as illustrated in the example below, has adopted an \u2018open adoption\u2019 procedure whereby birth parents and adopting parents can formulate a plan that details post adoption contact. Contact may range from regular meetings between the birth parents and adoptive family, to intermittent ongoing contact. 4.56 GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 72 EXAMPLES (1) An \u201cadoption plan\u201d is a plan agreed to by", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "936522be-8565-445d-b8e2-81ddddb8a7e1": {"__data__": {"id_": "936522be-8565-445d-b8e2-81ddddb8a7e1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing the Implementation of CEDAW in the Cook Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2723d5badda69ab08398912b04e52f97ee7b5d3c2c4fe68d7e8a67930e7f9694"}}, "hash": "2723d5badda69ab08398912b04e52f97ee7b5d3c2c4fe68d7e8a67930e7f9694", "text": "two or more of the parties to the adoption of a child that includes provisions relating to: the making of arrangements for the exchange of information between the parties in relation to any one or more of the following: (i) the child\u2019s medical background or condition, (ii) the child\u2019s development and important events in the child\u2019s life, (iii) the means and nature of contact between the parties and the child, and any other matter relating to the adoption of the child.

GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 74 Chapter 5 CHILD AND SPOUSAL SUPPORT Introduction This chapter considers law reform issues relating to child and spousal support. In this chapter support refers to the requirement of one person to provide financial support for a spouse or a child in the form of a lump sum, periodic monetary payment, the transfer of valuable goods (such as crops, livestock and other food resources) or the provision of services. Child and spousal support is governed in the Cook Islands by the Cook Islands Act 1915 and requires modernization to meet good standard practices and to comply with CEDAW and the CRC. Reform in this area would best be achieved through the repeal of any applicable provisions in that Act and incorporation of the area into the new Family Law Bill. This chapter identifies and discusses a range of issues relating to spousal and child support in the Cook Islands which are currently non-compliant with CEDAW. First, access to spousal support is currently limited by the Cook Islands Act 1915 to married persons. However, the CEDAW Committee has stated that those in de facto unions should have the same protections as if they were married. International obligations suggest that same-sex unions should also be provided with the same protections as marriage. Reform in this area should reflect changes in the form of family units, which include cohabitation between couples in intimate relationships whether opposite-sex or same-sex. Second, a right to spousal support and the determination of the appropriate amount of support is currently determined in the Cook Islands on the basis of what the court thinks \u2018fit\u2019 and \u2018reasonable\u2019. However, contemporary good practice in family law is to provide a checklist of statutory factors that ensure the discriminatory effects that marriage and relationships can have on the financial situation and earning capacity of one partner are taken into account in the determination of the support award. Third, the Cook Islands currently does not require a biological father to contribute to child-bearing costs however this is contrary to Article 16(1)(d) of CEDAW which states that both parents are equally responsible for a child. Fourth, in relation to child support, the Cook Islands limits child support applications to biological parents. Article 27(4) of the CRC and good practice in contemporary law enables anyone caring for a child to apply for child support from either or both biological parents and social parents in certain circumstances. A child support order is awarded in the Cook Islands on the basis of reasonableness. However, instead of relying on \u201creasonableness\u201d, a good practice approach includes a statutory checklist of factors to ensure that the needs of the child are paramount. Finally, parentage testing is important for the determination of liability for child support and child-bearing expenses.

Spousal Support Definition of Spousal Support Spousal support is the provision of living expenses by one party to a marriage or relationship to the other party after separation and/or divorce.

However, this formal equality approach to spousal support often resulted in discrimination against women because it did not take into account systemic discrimination against women which results in women being unequally positioned financially after a marriage or a relationship breakdown. Many families organize their lives during marriage and de facto relationships on the basis of continuing reciprocity. In other words, one spouse, typically the woman, forgoes employment opportunities or advancements to focus on and further the welfare of the family, whilst the other spouse, typically the man, works, for financial gain. The result is that one party to the relationship, typically the woman, is at a huge financial disadvantage after separation and often for many years thereafter (in terms of future employment opportunities and related earning potential).82 Provision for spousal support taking into account systemic discrimination is therefore an important component of modern family law and, additionally, satisfies CEDAW legislative compliance indicators 16.10 and 16.17.83 The Definition of a Spouse The Cook Islands Act 1915 limits the definition of spouse, and therefore who is entitled to spousal support, to married couples only. It provides that a maintenance order can be made against a husband in favor of his wife upon separation and upon the dissolution of marriage as long as she remains unmarried. Upon separation, but not divorce, the court can make an order against a married woman in favor of her husband. The Cook Islands legislation reflects a historical view that was and is still also found in many common law countries that, first, a marriage is the only relationship that should give rise to an obligation to pay spousal support and, second, that only a wife was entitled to receive support from a husband upon divorce. This position has been reversed in recent times by many countries, both in response to the demographic reality that many people are choosing to live in de facto relationships, including same-sex relationship,84 and in addition, because international obligations have increasingly M Gray & B Chapman, \u201cRelationship Breakdown and the Economic Welfare of Australian Mothers and Their Children\u201d (2007) 10(4) Australian Journal of Labour Economics 253; T Oldham, \u201cChanges in the Economic Consequences of Divorces, 1958-2008 ](2008) 42(3) Family Law Quarterly 419.

In General Recommendation 21(13), the CEDAW Committee supports the recognition of de facto unions stating that the form and concept of the family can vary and in whatever form it takes, the treatment of women in the family both in law and in private, must accord with the principles of equality and justice for all, as required by Article 2 of CEDAW. Indeed, the CEDAW Committee has recently expressed concerns about the implications of the \u2018lack of a legal framework for de facto unions and the resulting precarious situation in which women in such unions may find themselves when relationships break down\u2019.85 Although the recognition of same-sex relationships has not yet been explicitly addressed by the CEDAW Committee, many consider there is sufficient support in CEDAW and the CRC through a broader interpretation of terms such as family, and discrimination on the grounds of sex or marital status to obligate States parties to provide equal rights and protections for those in same-sex relationships.86 The extension of eligibility for spousal support to those in de facto and same-sex relationships can be implemented without enacting domestic partnership/civil union legislation or extending marriage to same-sex couples. Indeed, even in countries where there are civil unions or same-sex marriage it is essential to extend legal protection to all de facto couples as it operates as a safety-net or default system to those", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "65eaddd9-0df1-4aec-889b-9b328cd5f1bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "65eaddd9-0df1-4aec-889b-9b328cd5f1bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing the Implementation of CEDAW in the Cook Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "00bc8941fd3960edb58047edd01d9e0a10e3426fa3577f7d968f93188280dc33"}, "3": {"node_id": "78bb2871-2d91-4ee1-8997-582beaecda8f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "72d3a1b70dc25751ad3f744d288bbfe05e1dbc1db981c0c5daff8718e14794ed"}}, "hash": "567234f9b60f59a72e4017875df37e44126c3d3bdce5fa6ad24b2c4f0abf7596", "text": "couples who have decided not to marry or enter into a civil union. The recognition of de facto relationships for the purpose of spousal support requires a definition in the law of what constitutes a de facto relationship. Two different approaches have been taken in contemporary family law to establishing the existence of a de facto relationship. The first is to identify a time period (which is usually 2 years) during which the parties must have lived together continuously. The second approach, as illustrated in the example of Scotland below, is to provide a range of factors, which typically include duration (but do not specify how long the relationship has to have lasted), for the court to use in determining whether a de facto relationship existed. Other factors usually included are the nature of the relationship during that period and the nature and extent of joint financial arrangements during that period.

However, the Cook Islands Act 1915 provides for spousal support to be awarded upon separation only if the court is satisfied that the husband has \u2018failed or intends to fail to provide his wife with adequate maintenance\u2019. However, if the husband does not have \u2018sufficient ability to contribute\u2019 no order can be made unless the wife is destitute. Upon divorce the court can award spousal support \u2018if it thinks fit\u2019. In both instances the amount is determined on the basis of reasonableness. The inclusion of a list of factors in the law to be used in determining when spousal support must be paid, and in what amounts, ensures that courts take into account the discriminatory effects that marriage and relationships can have upon the earning capacity of one partner (usually the female partner). This is especially important if there are children and one party has forgone or reduced education and/or paid employment to provide domestic and child care for the family. Additionally, after divorce one party (usually the woman) will retain the custody and day-to-day care of children, further disadvantaging them in relation to their current and future ability to earn.87 The failure to award any or adequate spousal support after separation and divorce is discriminatory because, as the CEDAW Committee states in General Recommendation 21(21), \u2018the responsibilities that women have in bearing and raising children affect M McKeever and N Wolfinger, \u201cReexamining the Costs of Marital Disruption\u201d (2001) 82 Social Science Quarterly 2002 at 215; P Erera, Family Diversity: Continuity and Change in the Contemporary Family (Oxford: Sage, 2002) at 104 5.10 5.11 87 EXAMPLES \u201cCohabitant\u201d means either member of a couple consisting of a man and a woman who are (or were) living together as if they were husband and wife; or two persons of the same sex who are (or were) living together as if they were civil partners.

The inclusion of child support provisions based on the needs of the child represents compliance with CEDAW legislative indicator 16.16 & 16.24.91 There are two main approaches in contemporary family law to child support. The first, adopted in many developed common law countries including New Zealand, England and Australia, is the establishment state-run child support schemes which assess and collect moneys through automatic payment systems. This approach, which has proven effective, requires state commitment to its administration and the related costs. The second is to adopt the same procedures utilized to determine spousal support with an application procedure for a child support order. State-Run Child Support Schemes In many jurisdictions including New Zealand, Australia and England a poor record in payment of child support (usually by fathers) has resulted in the establishment of registration schemes and the collection of monies through state-run automatic payment systems. Such schemes rely on a state funded administration unit that receives applications from parents or carers. A statutory formula is applied to assess the amount required to be paid. The formula is typically based on a percentage of the liable person\u2019s income after a deduction has been made for their own basic living expenses. The designated amount is then automatically deducted from the wage of the liable parent, or added as a tax to the income of the liable parent and paid to the beneficiary parent. In order to work, such schemes depend on sufficient state resources (human and financial) that are required to manage the administration and costs of this kind of scheme.

The Cook Islands Act 1915 provides for the issuance of a child maintenance order against the mother or the father of a child. The question of whether and to what extent step-parents should also be liable is controversial for some. However, most contemporary family law provides that if a parental relationship has been formed, then support obligations should follow. The rationale that underscores this position is that the step-parent has voluntarily assumed that role and it is not in the best interests of children that he or she be permitted to abandon it because the marriage or relationship has ended. 93 whether born within a marriage or outside. Good practice family law simply requires the child to be under 19 and not financially independent. Eligible Applicants The Cook Islands Act 1915 does not explicitly state who may apply for a child support order but the language implies that it is limited to a mother or a father. In contemporary society the wider range of family forms and situations where care for children is provided is now reflected in good practice which requires that anyone with the responsibility of caring for a child should be legally able to apply for child support. The Fiji Family Law Act 2003 in a good practice example provides that a parent, anyone with a residence order or any other person concerned with the care, welfare or development of the child can apply for a support order.92 Additionally, although a child support order might ordinarily end when a child reaches 18 years of age, good practice requires, as illustrated in the example of Fiji below, provision for orders for the financial provision and maintenance of children who are over 18 but are still in full-time education, or are mentally or physically handicapped and therefore require longer-term support. 5.17 5.18 C Rogerson, \u201cThe Child Support Obligations of Step-Parents\u201d (2001) 18 Canadian Journal of Family Law 9. 93 EXAMPLES A court must not make a child maintenance order in relation to a child who is aged 18 or over unless the court is satisfied that the provision of the maintenance is necessary (a) to enable the child to complete his or her education; or (b) because of a mental or physical disability of the child.

Form of Support The Cook Island Act 1915 provides only for periodic payments of money for both spousal and child support orders.94 Contemporary family law legislation has moved towards more flexible approaches to the payment of support orders including lump sum payments, the provision of goods such as crops and livestock (which could be appropriate in the goods based \u2013 rather than cash based - economy of parts of the Cook Islands), the provision of services, and the transfer or usage of property or assets. Generally, periodic payments are preferred over a lump sum since this allows for a more accurate calculation of the needs of the recipient. Enforcement of Support Orders A system of enforcement is crucial to ensure that spousal and child support payments are made. Enforcement mechanisms that can be employed include utilizing the tax system (New Zealand), ordering the employer (if the liable partner is working) to deduct a certain amount from her or his salary to meet the support payments, garnisheeing accounts, forcing the sale of assets or property, fines and imprisonment. An absconding debtor order could also be introduced which can prevent a person who has support obligations from leaving the country. Determination of Parentage Reasons for Parentage Determination The law must specify who can apply to determine the biological parent(s) of a child and for what reasons, testing can be ordered. The determination of parentage, typically paternity, is important Checklist Factors for Child Support Orders The need to provide suitable accommodation for the child. The age and health of the child including any special needs of the child. The educational or training needs of the child The financial circumstances of the child. The availability and cost of suitable child-care facilities or services. The needs and resources of the parties The commitments of the parties to support any other child or person. 5.20 5.21 5.22 Cook Islands Act 1915, s 564(1). 94 GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 86 for the determination of child support and child- bearing expenses. Other reasons for seeking parentage tests include allocation of parental responsibilities, amendment of birth certificates, inheritance, immigration applications, identification of human remains, civil proceeding for adoption, medical reasons, to ensure ties and inclusion within extended families and communities, and personal interest. Uncertainty about who the father is might arise if a biological mother does not know who the biological father is, or does not want to reveal who the father is (which may occur for many reasons, including if the pregnancy is a result of a rape, or if the identity of the father will result in problems for the mother or the child within the family or community), or if a prospective biological father either does not acknowledge paternity or wishes to establish paternity.

The Cook Islands Act 1915 limits applications for paternity to \u2018an unmarried woman who is the mother of an illegitimate child or who is with child.\u2019 96 The purpose of the application is solely for child support. In the contemporary context the three parties most likely to request a parentage order are mothers, prospective or presumed biological fathers, and children. Modern family law typically provides for application by those three parties and any other party if they have \u201ca proper interest in the result\u201d. Other parties might include grandparents or other relatives, social workers, government agencies, trustees and executors. However, there must be protections in place to ensure that parentage tests cannot be applied for in any circumstances. Such protections are to ensure that identifying a parent (particularly the father) is not used for discriminatory or improper purposes (i.e. to try to force a marriage of the mother and father). Determining Parentage The Cook Islands Act 1915 provides the High Court with the authority to make a determination of paternity however no formula for that determination is provided. Further, no application can be made if the child is 12 or over. If the child is 6 or older, no application can be made unless the prospective father has contributed to child support during that six years, or cohabited with the mother in a de facto relationship, in which case any application must be within two years of either the financial contribution or the cohabitation. Such limitations are inappropriate and do not accord with good practice. In modern family law presumptions of paternity are typically made in certain circumstances. These include if the father is the husband or de facto partner of the mother at the time of the birth, or at the time of conception, or if the father\u2019s name is registered on the birth certificate. In the absence of a presumption, paternity is typically based on evidentiary submissions. In the Cook Islands other presumptions that could be included are whether the father bought items for the baby, visited the mother in hospital or any other kind of traditional acknowledgement of the child. 5.23 5.24 5.25 See Translating CEDAW into Law note 44 at 42.

In addition, it implies that a woman\u2019s word is inherently worth less than that of the prospective or presumed father, even though there is no evidence that mothers should be viewed as a particularly unreliable class of witness. The Cook Islands Act 1915 provides that whilst the evidence of the mother is not necessary for the making of a paternity order, no order can be made upon the evidence of a pregnant woman unless it is corroborated.98 Good practice requires a legislative statement that corroboration is not required, as demonstrated in the example of New Zealand below. 5.26 A Didick & F Kaganas, Family Law, Gender and the State: Text, Cases and Materials (London: Hart Publishing, 2006) at 155.

Corroboration is Not Required Family Proceedings Act 1980, s 52 (New Zealand) DNA Parentage Testing Orders DNA testing now enables paternity (or maternity) to be established conclusively. This is most commonly done by taking a buccal or blood sample from the father and child, although it can be done on any number of other body parts such as hair follicles.

Such an approach has been adopted in Fiji as illustrated in the example below (adopted from the Family Law Act, 1975 Australia). The New Zealand Law Reform Commission has recommended that mandatory orders should be incorporated but with the threshold requirement that the court must consider whether there is a \u2018reasonable possibility that a person recognized as a parent is not the genetic parent or that a person not recognized as a parent is the genetic parent\u2019. If this threshold is satisfied, the next consideration focuses on \u2018why it would not be in the interests of justice, including the best interests of the child\u2019 to issue an order for DNA testing.99 The rationale that underscores this approach is that it is in the best interests of the child, her and his parents and the general public that parentage determinations are made on the basis of accurate DNA parentage testing. A DNA parentage testing procedure, either mandatory or recommended, requires the availability of or access to registered testing facilities.

There are two good practice approaches to law reform in the area of domestic violence. The first is to amend and repeal existing civil and criminal law to incorporate domestic violence and the second is the enactment of a separate Domestic Violence Bill. Either approach can be used to advance legislative compliance with CEDAW. Whilst the enactment of a separate Domestic Violence Bill has the potential to incorporate both civil and criminal provisions the Cook Islands has elected to incorporate civil domestic violence provisions into the Family Law Bill and, in a parallel process, to separately pursue law reform in the criminal law. This chapter does not therefore consider domestic violence offences in the criminal law. In particular, this chapter focuses on the establishment of a good practice legal framework for protection orders. The importance of a strong, effective and comprehensive legal response to domestic violence has been recognized worldwide as public recognition of domestic violence as a social problem has increased.100 Further, a burgeoning body of research about the broad nature, dynamics, effects and costs of domestic violence has emerged.101 Domestic violence can be differentiated from generic violence (where there is no pre-existing relationship between the parties) by the existence of a relationship characterized by intimacy, familial ties or a shared household. It is this bond that renders domestic violence particularly serious because it exacerbates the impact of the violence and complicates the legal measures required, since victims need protection in the (often hidden) privacy of their homes and from someone with whom they share(d) an intimate or familial relationship.102 In Pacific Island countries, including the Cook Islands, domestic violence has been increasingly recognized as a growing and substantial problem, which impacts on the physical and mental health of victims and also upon families and communities.103 Violence against women, children, elderly and persons with intellectual and physical disabilities within domestic relationships is a fundamental violation of human rights.

Lack of economic independence forces many women to stay in violent relationships. \u2026 The effect of such violence on the physical and mental integrity of women is to deprive them [of] the equal enjoyment, exercise and knowledge of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\u201d104 A number of international human rights instruments, to which the Cook Islands is a party, require states parties to take effective measures to prevent and eradicate such violence.105 The former UN Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women has stated that in order to meet such obligations states parties should introduce targeted domestic violence legislation \u2018rather than making marginal amendments to existing penal and civil laws\u2019.106 A recent global trend towards the introduction of targeted domestic violence legislation, both civil and criminal, marks how seriously the world community views domestic violence. This publication does not consider good practice in domestic violence criminal law provisions as it is beyond the scope of the proposed civil Family Law Bill in the Cook Islands. A civil Family Law Bill does not however remove the need for a strong framework of criminal law domestic violence offences as it is important to incorporate both civil and criminal laws dealing with domestic violence as they serve different but complementary purposes.107 The criminal law focuses primarily on determining the innocence or guilt of those accused of domestic violence, and the administering of appropriate punishment of offenders within the criminal law system, and in the modern context, the rehabilitation of the offender where possible. Criminal offences send a message to all members of society that domestic violence is a crime and unacceptable.108 The complementary aims of civil law domestic violence provisions are, broadly, to prevent domestic violence, to ensure the safety of all persons who experience domestic violence, to provide victims with effective and accessible remedies, and to promote non-violence as a fundamental social value. Specifically, civil law initiatives focus on the protection of persons \u2018exposed or potentially exposed to violence in a domestic setting\u2019109 with the establishment of various orders that prohibit the offender from any further acts of domestic violence and/or to enable victims to remain in the family home from which the offender is excluded. In the Oceanic region New Zealand and all Australian states have targeted civil laws providing a range of protection orders for victims of domestic violence.

The Cook Islands in 1994 introduced both occupation orders and non-molestation (protection) orders.111 However, these orders provide protection to a limited range of persons, from a limited range of behaviours, in a limited range of circumstances and do not meet international good practice standards. Therefore, this chapter identifies and considers a range of good practice approaches to the following key components of a fully CEDAW compliant civil law response to domestic violence. First, an appropriate and comprehensive definition of domestic violence must be developed, one that draws on a range of good practice examples which encompass physical violence, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, intimidation, harassment, stalking, economic deprivation, property damage, animal abuse or threats of any of the above. Second, a good practice domestic violence civil law should provide protection to any person who experiences or is at risk of experiencing domestic violence. Third, a system of protection orders, emergency protection orders and occupation orders, with an extensive range of potential conditions should be established. Fourth and fifth, there must be an obligation on the police and other state actors to apply for and enforce orders and a comprehensive mechanism for the enforcement of orders. Finally, domestic violence law should enable the provision of compensation to victims of domestic violence. This can be incorporated into the civil or the criminal law or both. The Definition of an Act of Domestic Violence Domestic violence occurs in many forms, including physical violence, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, intimidation, harassment, stalking, economic deprivation, property damage, animal abuse (particularly of domestic pets as this is intended to scare or hurt the person(s) who care for them), or threats of any of the above and it is important that domestic violence legislation contains a definition that reflects its breadth and complexity. The Cook Islands Amendment Act 1994, which enables the court to issue occupation orders and non- molestation (protection) orders, does not contain a definition of domestic violence. A comprehensive definition of domestic violence which clearly articulates the range of behaviors which can give rise to an act of domestic violence is, however, an essential component of good practice domestic violence law. The former Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women has urged the adoption of the \u2018broadest possible definitions of acts of violence\u2019 in domestic violence legislation.112 The same comprehensive definition of domestic violence should be reflected in both civil and criminal domestic violence laws. 6.6 6.7 GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 93 It is important that both physical and non-physical forms of abuse are explicitly recognized and identified in the legislation. Non-physical forms of domestic violence are often not perceived by the community as \u2018real\u2019 violence, despite research consistently showing they may be the cause of severe and ongoing harm.113 Contemporary good practice domestic violence legislation uniformly contains comprehensive definitions of domestic violence and the differences between the models largely lie in the range of factors which they include within their definition of domestic violence, and the fullness of the definitions of the different factors. A fuller definition has the advantage of clearly articulating the range of behaviors which the legislation contemplates as falling within the scope of domestic violence. Good Practice Definition (New Zealand) The example of New Zealand below provides a good practice \u2018starting point\u2019 for the region although, as discussed in the subsections below, other jurisdictions have included additional factors within the definition of domestic violence, which should also be considered for inclusion. The New Zealand example is notable for its inclusion of non- physical abuse and additionally, the unique and important inclusion of a person causing a child to witness domestic violence. This is an important recognition that, even if a child has not been the specific target of violence, indirect exposure to domestic violence is so harmful that it may constitute a form of child", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "04f72f61-8023-4dda-8d0c-e1f6e984aebc": {"__data__": {"id_": "04f72f61-8023-4dda-8d0c-e1f6e984aebc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing the Implementation of CEDAW in the Cook Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2bb1179a90d2a972a554b00d1cd25dffb784b7f052b6065357cf64c1461f9a60"}, "3": {"node_id": "f868a9d4-8e1e-4c20-978b-83cd4169e86c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8e2f2b2c14502d0f915f3997fa34a60bd7736a09edbaa486bedf74b0c7dadb54"}}, "hash": "07c896e979b86ecabc559b506317b9a727c1680745344abeff2259b187b1197f", "text": "abuse in its own right.114 Factors not included in the New Zealand definition and discussed below, that should be considered for inclusion are economic abuse, animal abuse, and the inclusion of a discretionary category to encompass any other behavior that results in the apprehension of fear in the protected person.

It may involve one person having complete control of money and income, preventing family members from accessing their own money or bank accounts, paying bills or buying necessities, having unrealistic expectations of spending patterns and budgeting, controlling how other family members spend their income forcefully taking money from family members or threatening family members for money. 6.10 EXAMPLES (2) In this section, domestic violence means (a) Physical abuse: (b) Sexual abuse: (c) Psychological abuse, including, but not limited to - (i) Intimidation: (ii) Harassment: (iii) Damage to property: (iv) Threats of physical abuse, sexual abuse, or psychological abuse: (v) In relation to a child, abuse of the kind set out in subsection (3) of this section.

Discretionary open-ended factor The definition of domestic violence should be non- exhaustive to ensure that behaviors not included in the specific list which cause \u2018apprehension\u2019 or \u2018fear\u2019 can be included on a case by case basis at the discretion of the court. Thus for example in the Australian state of South Australia, domestic violence includes any \u2018other conduct, so as to reasonably arouse in a family member apprehension or fear of personal injury or damage to property or any significant apprehension or fear\u2019.116 The Inclusion of Comprehensive Definitions of Factors Physical and Sexual Abuse A comprehensive definition of what constitutes physical and sexual abuse provides clear direction to the court in their determination of whether an act of domestic violence has occurred. In particular, the inclusion of \u2018forcibly detaining the protected person or withholding the necessities of life\u2019 as in the example of Namibia below may encompass situations where money to buy food or medical treatment is withheld or where the victim is prevented from having friends or to talking to or being with others. 6.12 6.13 EXAMPLE An act of domestic violence is causing or threatening to cause the death of, or injury to, an animal, even if the animal is not the protected person\u2019s property Animal Abuse Model Domestic Violence Laws 1999, s 3(1)(c). 116 Domestic Violence Act 1994, s 4(vi).

Physical and Sexual Abuse Combating of Domestic Violence Act 2003 s 2 (Namibia) Stalking or Harassment A comprehensive definition of what constitutes stalking or harassment provides clear direction to the court to determine whether an act of domestic violence has occurred.

It includes any act or omission that reduces an individual\u2019s dignity, sense of self-worth and damages their psychological and emotional integrity.

Domestic violence can occur in many contexts and between persons in an array of personal relationships where there are power imbalances and it is important that the range of persons protected by the legislation includes anyone who experiences or is at risk of experiencing domestic violence. The Cook Islands currently limits access to occupation orders to married persons which does not meet international standards which require that protection be afforded to all persons at risk. The legislation does however extend non-molestation (protection) orders to de facto (opposite sex) couples and gives the court the discretion to issue an order for the protection of any \u2018other person\u2019.

The term relative can be defined prescriptively with a list of those who come within the category or alternately it can be more broadly defined to encompass extended or \u2018non-traditional\u2019 family groupings. Whether prescriptive or broadly defined contemporary family law legislation has typically left some discretion for the judge to encompass extended family relationships.

Possible Protected Persons Commentary and Good Practice Examples Definition of Protection Orders Protection orders (including emergency orders and occupation orders) are a civil remedy typically issued by a court, the police or other authorized person to prevent a person from making contact, harming or harassing another person or alternately to enable a victim of domestic violence to remain in the family home. The CEDAW Committee states in General Recommendation 19(24)(r) that civil remedies in cases of domestic violence are required to overcome family violence and in particular has called upon States parties to ensure that victims of domestic violence have immediate means of protection by way of protection orders issued by courts and/or the police.119 It has additionally stated that the availability of protection orders is an \u2018essential component of a comprehensive legal framework designed to protect women in situations of domestic or sexual violence\u2019 and that a failure to provide for protection orders \u2018amounted to discrimination under Article 1 of the Convention.\u2019120 Types of Protection Orders 1. Protection Order Who can Apply for an Order? Protection orders should be easily accessible to anyone at risk of domestic violence. The range of persons who can apply for a protection order in contemporary domestic violence legislation typically includes an adult protected person (as defined in the legislation), a child protected person who is a mature minor over 14 (who understands the nature and the consequences of the proceedings) a parent of a child that is a protected person, any person with a residence order in relation to a protected child, or any person if a child is in immediate danger. In some circumstances it may be difficult for a protected person to apply for an order and therefore a good practice approach is 6.18 6.19 GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 105 to enable applications to be made by \u2018any other person on behalf of the aggrieved person\u2019.121 Some jurisdictions have authorized applications to be made without the consent of the protected person including police officers or a person appointed by the court. The rationale for this is similar to that of \u2018no drop\u2019 criminal law procedures that require, for many reasons, including power imbalances, that if there is evidence of domestic violence, the police must proceed with criminal charges even if the victim (usually a woman) does not request that charges be laid or even if the victim requests that charges be dropped.

The Cook Islands Amendment Act 1994 recognizes this in part by not requiring an act of violence to have occurred and instead enables the court to issue a non-molestation order if the court is satisfied it is \u2018necessary for the protection\u2019 of the applicant. A good practice approach is to simply require that the victim (or an authorized other) has a reasonable apprehension of an act of domestic violence. An alternate approach is require that the victim has an actual fear of an act of domestic violence (whether \u2018reasonable\u2019 or not) so as a person living in fear, and who may be very aware of the signs of impending danger of domestic violence, should not have to meet any standard of reasonableness before being afforded protection.123 Another, but somewhat weaker approach, as in the examples of India and Tasmania, Australia and Vanuatu below is to require that an act of domestic violence is \u2018likely\u2019 to occur. 6.21 123 Partnerships against Domestic Violence, Model Domestic Violence Laws, Canberra, 1999 at 63.

There are two approaches in contemporary family laws that determine the conditions of an order. The first approach is to leave it to the discretion of the court to make the order entirely based on the circumstances of the case. However, typically the law includes a list of \u2018directions, restrictions and prohibitions\u2019 that can be imposed as illustrated in the example of South Africa below. The second approach is to impose mandatory conditions for every protection order with discretion for the judge to attach extra conditions based on the circumstances of each individual case. If there are mandatory conditions these should correspond to the definition of an act of domestic violence that is included in the legislation. The advantage of a mandatory approach is that important protections, such as illustrated in the example of New Zealand, below, are not left to the judge\u2019s discretion. 6.22 EXAMPLE (1) The court may prohibit the respondent from committing (a) any act of domestic violence; (b) enlisting the help of another person to commit any such act; (c) entering a residence shared by the complainant and the respondent: (d) entering a specified part of such a shared residence; (e) entering the complainant\u2019s residence; (f) entering the complainant\u2019s place of employment; (g) preventing the complainant who ordinarily lives or lived in a shared residence as contemplated in subparagraph (c) from entering or remaining in the shared residence or a specified part of the shared residence; or (h) committing any other act as specified in the protection order. (2) The court may impose any additional conditions which it deems reasonably necessary to protect and provide for the safety, health or wellbeing of the complainant.

Emergency Protection Order An emergency (or interim) protection order is a protection order that is immediately and easily available. It is essential that domestic violence victims be provided with access to protection orders when they do not have immediate access to a court. This is particularly crucial given that domestic violence often occurs after 5pm during the week and on weekends. Additionally in specific areas (i.e. remote outer islands) where there are no courts it is important that there are trained magistrates or Justices of the Peace, or other persons who can be nominated as authorized to issue emergency orders. If a domestic violence victim seeks protection from the legal system during a crisis outside of standard court hours, the system must be able to respond and EXAMPLES (1) It is a condition of every protection order that the respondent must not\u2014 (a) Physically or sexually abuse the protected person; or (b) Threaten to physically or sexually abuse the protected person; or (c) Damage, or threaten to damage, property of the protected person; or (d) Engage, or threaten to engage, in other behaviour, including intimidation or harassment, which amounts to psychological abuse of the protected person; or (e) Encourage any person to engage in behaviour against a protected person, where the behaviour, if engaged in by the respondent, would be prohibited by the order. (2) It is a condition of every protection order that at any time other than when the protected person and the respondent are, with the express consent of the protected person, living in the same dwelling house, the respondent must not,\u2014 (a) Watch, loiter near, or prevent or hinder access to or from, the protected person\u2019s place of residence, business, employment, educational institution, or any other place that the protected person visits often; or (b) Follow the protected person about or stop or accost the protected person in any place; or (c) Without the protected person\u2019s express consent, enter or remain on any land or building occupied by the protected person; or (d) Where the protected person is present on any land or building, enter or remain on that land or building circumstances that constitute a trespass; or (e) Make any other contact with the protected person (whether by telephone, correspondence, or otherwise).

In order to provide immediate protection an emergency protection order must: Be accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Ideally the order should be accessible over the phone (where there is telephone service), or by shortwave radio. Be available ex parte (which means without the testimony of the abuser or need to inform the abuser of the application). Provide for categories of persons authorized and available to issue an order at all times. Some countries have provided such authority to police,124 others to Justices of the Peace, others to designated persons in the community. Vanuatu provides for nominated authorized persons to make temporary protection orders as illustrated below. This is a good practice example for the Pacific region. EXAMPLES 2) The Minister is to recommend to the Judicial Services Commission persons for appointment under subsection (1). A person is to be recommended only if: (a) the person has undertaken training approved by the Minister for the purposes of this section; and (b) the person has a good knowledge of this Act and understands how it works; and (c) the person understands the social and cultural environment within which domestic violence takes place; and (d) the person: (i) is the principal chief of a village; or (ii) is an assistant chief of a village, a church leader, a community leader, a teacher, or a village health worker nominated by the principal chief of the relevant village; or (iii) is a member of the Vanuatu Police Force of or above the rank of inspector; or (iv) has applied in writing to the Minister to be recommended for appointment. Authorized Persons Family Protection Act 2008, s7 (Vanuatu) Typically an emergency protection order is issued for a short period of time pending a court hearing for a protection order. The length of time stipulated should depend on the expected waiting time for the court hearing and should not expire before the hearing. The conditions of an emergency protection order should be the same as that for a protection order as described above. 1. 2. 3. 124 Family Violence Act 2004, s 14 (Tasmania) GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 111 3. Occupation Order Definition of Occupation Order An occupation order enables the protected person to remain in any shared home that she or he might have with the abuser regardless of the abuser\u2019s legal or equitable rights in the property. Where violence or abuse has occurred or is threatened between persons who live together, it may be necessary or appropriate for the perpetrator of the violence or threatened violence to be excluded from the home. Requiring the violent party to leave the home (including before the violence has taken place) reinforces the message that violence is wrong and that perpetrators of domestic violence will be held accountable in a range of ways. The inclusion of an occupation order represents compliance with CEDAW legislative compliance indicator 16.11.125 There are two approaches to the provision of occupation orders in contemporary family law legislation. The first approach is to make this a possible condition of an emergency protection order or a protection order, as illustrated in the example of Nova Scotia below. In some jurisdictions when a court is making a protection order or an emergency protection order it is mandatory to consider whether the respondent should be excluded from the home. If a court decides that it is appropriate to so exclude an (adult) respondent, and the protected person does not oppose this then the court must do so.126 The second approach is to have a separate and distinct order as illustrated in the example of India below. The advantage of a separate order is that it enables a protected person to apply for an occupation order and not a protection order which might be all that is required in certain circumstances. EXAMPLES An emergency protection order may do any or all of the following : (a) grant the victim or other family members exclusive occupation of the victim\u2019s residence for a defined period regardless of any legal rights of possession or ownership; (b) direct a peace officer to remove the respondent from the victim\u2019s residence immediately or within a specified time; (c) direct a peace officer to accompany a specified person, within a specified time, to the victim\u2019s residence to supervise the removal of personal belongings.

The advantage of a statutory list of factors is that it focuses the attention of the court on what an occupation order will achieve in terms of the safety and best interests of the parties. 6.25 GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 113 Ancillary Orders that Facilitate Access to Personal Property Access to personal property may be a significant issue for all parties when an occupation order is in force. The party that is excluded from the home will need access to their personal effects in order to take up residence elsewhere. In practice, orders allowing a respondent to return to the premises from which they are excluded to collect their belongings may need to be tightly controlled in order to ensure that protected person(s) are not put at risk of further intimidation or any other forms of violence. Equally, if an occupation order enables a protected person and/or any children to remain in the home, it may be necessary to prevent the excluded party from removing necessary items from the premises (i.e. taking all the food or furniture etc., from the home). In some cases, prescriptive and detailed terms may be required in the order setting out what items are to be left at the premises for the use of the protected person and her or his children. For example, in New Zealand if a person applies for an occupation order, a court may also make an ancillary furniture order granting to the applicant the use of all or any of the furniture, household appliances, and household effects in the dwelling house specified in the occupation order. 6.26 The impact on the safety and protection of the protected person and any children who live at the residence (even if the children are not protected persons) if an exclusion order is not made. The desirability of minimizing disruption to the protected person and any child living with the protected person and the importance of maintaining social networks and support. Ensuring continuity of care for children who live with a protected person. Ensuring continuity in childcare, education, training and employment for protected persons and children who live with them.

Research suggests that it is safer and in the best interests for any children of the relationship to remain in their own home and area, without the need to change schools.127 Additionally, studies have found that women and children are severely economically, educationally and socially disadvantaged if they are forced to leave their homes due to family violence, and that there is a high risk they will become homeless or, with no other options, will return to the abusive environment.128 Accordingly, the former UN Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women has recommended that all States should \u2018provide for the removal of the abuser from the shared home and allow the victim-survivor to retain her present housing, at least until formal and final separation is achieved\u2019.129 6.27 EXAMPLE (1) This section applies if: (a) the defendant and protected person normally live in the same home with a child (whether or not the child is also a protected person); and (b) in deciding the conditions of a DVO [Domestic Violence Order], the issuing authority imposes a restraint on the defendant having contact with the protected person or child.

Historically, the police response to domestic violence has been inadequate, with violence in the home seen as a private matter, not serious or worthy of police attention.130 In many countries in response to such historical discrimination, a range of obligations have been placed upon police officers. Some countries have placed a mandatory obligation on police to apply for a protection order when domestic violence has or is likely to occur regardless of whether the protected person consents. In New South Wales (Australia) for example, police must apply for an order where they suspect or believe that a family violence, stalking, intimidation, or child abuse has recently been committed, is imminent or is likely to be committed against a family member.131 Such an approach provides clear direction to police officers of their responsibilities in relation to domestic violence. It also sends a message to the community and the abuser that domestic violence is unacceptable and obligates the police to act, it increases the likelihood of an order being made, lessens the burden on the victim and can deflect blame from the victim where the application is seen as a police matter and out of the victim\u2019s hands. Finally, it increases the likelihood that a woman will pursue an application when she is supported by the police.132 In other countries a lesser obligation is placed upon police officers such as in the examples below. In the example of the Model Laws if an application is not made by the police, the reasons for not making the application must be recorded. In the example of India an obligation is placed on a range of persons including the police to inform victims of their right to apply for an order. 6.28 6.29 130 See Victorian Law Reform Commission, Review of Family Violence Laws, 2005, Melbourne at 116. 131 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) s 562C(3). 132 Victorian Law Reform Commission, Review of Family Violence Laws, Melbourne, 2000 at 146.

Police Obligations to Apply for Protection Orders Model Domestic Violence Laws 1999, s 8 Domestic Violence Act 2005, s 8(5) (India) Duration of Order A range of approaches have been taken to how long the protection order should be in place. The first approach is to have designated periods (typically ranging from 6 months to two years) if no time period is stipulated in the order. A second approach is for the order to be in effect for an indefinite period and discharged only upon application by the protected person or the perpetrator as in the example of New Zealand below. A third approach is to leave the protection period to the discretion of the court on the basis of what is \u2018necessary to protect a person\u2019133 or what is \u2018necessary to ensure the safety and interests of the person for whose benefit the order is made.\u2019134 The Precedence of Protection Orders over Parenting Orders Research in Australia and internationally has demonstrated that the period immediately following separation from a violent relationship is the time of greatest risk of an escalation of violence. A recent NSW study found that a significant proportion of the post-separation abuse was linked to child contact, 6.30 6.31 133 Family Protection Act 2008, s 37(3) (Vanuatu). 134 Family Violence Act 2004, s 19(a) (Tasmania, Australia). GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 117 particularly where the contact or negotiations for contact gave the ex-partner some level of access to the mother.135 Research from England and Denmark has similarly demonstrated that most post-separation violence committed against mothers is linked in some way to child contact. Substantial commentary has also been written in recent years on how the child\u2019s presumed right to maintain contact with both parents has resulted in courts favoring contact between the absent parent and the child, regardless, at times, of the concerns of the mother or the past history of violence by one parent towards to other (or between the partners).137 This is contrary to Article 9 of the CRC which supports contact with both parents \u2018except if is contrary to the child\u2019s best interests.\u2019 Such findings have resulted in legislative statements in many countries that protection orders override contact orders. Enforcement of Orders A strong system of enforcement is crucial to ensuring the protection order system is effective in protecting domestic violence victims. If the police or the courts do not respond adequately to breaches of orders, they will be perceived as ineffectual by victims and abusers alike. It will also give victims a false sense of safety and security, heightening their danger if an abuser behaves violently. To be effective a breach of a protection order must be a criminal offence.138 Penalties Contemporary domestic violence legislation typically has fines and/or imprisonment as the penalty for breaches of protection orders. Some jurisdictions have harsher penalties for second offences with some imposing only imprisonment for a second offence. In the Oceanic region the penalties for a breach of an order are as follows. All impose terms of imprisonment or fines. In Vanuatu the penalty is up to 2 years imprisonment, a fine of 50,000 vatu or both, in New Zealand the penalty is up to 6 months imprisonment or a fine not exceeding $5,000, in Australia the penalties range from in the state of Victoria for a first offence a fine of up to $24,000 or 1 years imprisonment and for a subsequent offence up to 2 years imprisonment. In New South Wales and South Australia the penalty is up to 2 years imprisonment and/or a fine. In Queensland the penalty is up to one year imprisonment or a fine.

Mandatory Attendance at Rehabilitation and Educational Programmes Another approach to enforcement is to require the abuser to attend a rehabilitation programme. In New Zealand a magistrate making a civil protection order must direct the abuser to attend such a programme. Such a measure, aimed at rehabilitation of the abuser and supported by research which indicates that such programmes can have positive outcomes, is however reliant on the existence of a well-resourced programmes for the court to refer the offender to. Unfortunately, in many Pacific Island countries, such programmes do not exist, and are unlikely to be available in the rural areas or outer islands. Police Powers to Arrest The police should be empowered to arrest and detain a perpetrator immediately upon any breach. In the Cook Islands the Criminal Procedure Act 1965 provides that a police officer may arrest or take into custody without a warrant a person \u2018he finds committing, or whom he has good cause to suspect of having committed, any offence punishable by death or imprisonment for life or for three months or more.\u2019 This may be sufficient in the Cook Islands if a penalty of over 3 months imprisonment is imposed for breaches of protection orders. In countries where no arrest can occur without a warrant two approaches have been typically adopted. The first, as illustrated in the example of South Africa below, is to issue an arrest warrant at the time of issuing the protection order to enable the immediate arrest of perpetrator should any breach occur. As well as providing an expedient means of immediate response to any breach such a procedure signifies the importance and seriousness placed on the protection order. Alternatively the second approach, as illustrated in the example of the Model Domestic Violence Law below, the authority for arrest without a warrant can be explicitly provided in the legislation. 6.34 6.35 EXAMPLES (1)Whenever a court issues a protection order, the court must make an order- (a) authorising the issue of a warrant for the arrest of the respondent, in the prescribed form; and suspending the execution of such warrant subject to compliance with any prohibition, condition, obligation or order imposed in terms of section 7. (b) The warrant referred to in subsection (l)(a) remains in force unless the protection order is set aside, or it is cancelled after execution.

Some countries require that before any revocation or variation of order can be considered, there must have been a substantial change in the relevant circumstances since the order was made or last varied.140 Typically, the court is required to consider specific grounds in deciding whether or not to vary or revoke an order. These include the applicant\u2019s reasons for the variation or revocation, the safety of the protected person, the wishes of the protected person and whether or not the applicant is legally represented.

GOOD FAMILY APPROACHES TO A CIVIL FAMILY LAW BILL C E D AW I N T H E C O O K I S L A N D S | 2 0 1 0 123 Chapter 7 DIVISION OF PROPERTY AFTER MARRIAGE OR RELATIONSHIP BREAKDOWN Introduction This chapter considers the law reform issues relating to property division after separation, divorce or the breakdown of a relationship. The CEDAW Committee has called upon States parties to ensure that women receive \u2018equal rights to property accumulated during marriage after dissolution.\u2019147 Property division after the end of marriage is governed in the Cook Islands by the Matrimonial Property Act 1976 (NZ). The Act, which was adopted from New Zealand,148 is CEDAW compliant in many respects and for the most part provides a good practice framework. The property regime it creates is generally referred to as a deferred community property regime. This means that all property acquired during the course of the marriage by either party, with certain exceptions, is deemed on the breakdown of the marriage, to be the property of both parties regardless of legal title. The Act provides for equal sharing of the matrimonial home and chattels. The rest of the matrimonial property is to be shared equally unless one party\u2019s contribution is \u2018clearly greater than the other\u2019. In such circumstances, when the decision about how to divide property is based on a consideration of the contributions of each rather than being based on a presumption of equality, the Act recognizes equally both financial and non-financial contributions in accord with good practice. In this way, marriage is acknowledged as a partnership with both parties contributing equally but differently to the relationship and the family. The major aspect of the legal framework governing property division in the Cook Islands that is currently non-compliant with CEDAW is the failure to extend protection to de facto couples. The CEDAW Committee in its Concluding Comments in 2007 called upon the Cook Islands \u2018to establish a system of equitable division of marital property upon dissolution of de facto marriages.\u2019 A second area that is non-compliant with CEDAW for consideration is that whilst the principle of equality is applied to the matrimonial home and chattels, the rest of the matrimonial property (which can include businesses, investments and any other property, and can be a substantial component of the matrimonial property) will not be determined on the basis of equality if one party\u2019s contribution to the partnership has \u2018clearly been greater\u2019 than the other. Such an approach has been shown to disadvantage the party whose contribution is non-financial and good practice requires that the principle of equality applies to all matrimonial property. Although the Matrimonial Property Act 1976 is largely CEDAW compliant and could be amended to achieve compliance, law reform in this area would be best achieved through the repeal of the Act and incorporation of the area into the new Family Law Bill. This would enable property division to be linked to spousal and child support and for the development of a clearer and more straightforward framework. 7.1 7.2 147 Concluding Comments of the CEDAW Committee: Malawi (2010) 45th Session at para [43] (UN Doc CEDAW/C/MWI/CO/6); Lebanon (2008) 40th Session at para [45] (UN Doc CEDAW/C/LBN/CO/3). 148 Adopted as Cook Islands law by the Matrimonial Property Act 1991-1992, s 3.

The provision of a statutory regime based on the equal sharing of property for de facto couples is of particular significance, since it is common for property and other assets to be in one partner\u2019s name (typically the male). The recognition of de facto relationships for the purpose of property division requires a legislative definition of a de facto relationship. An example of a good practice legislative definition of de facto relationship was provided previously at para [5.6]. What Property is Part of the Settlement? The Matrimonial Property Act 1976 divides property into \u2018matrimonial\u2019 property and \u2018separate\u2019 property. Only property defined as matrimonial property is deemed part of the settlement process. As illustrated in the example of New Zealand below (where property is divided on the same basis as the Matrimonial Property Act 1976, but is named \u2018relationship\u2019 property and \u2018separate\u2019 property instead), this provides a good practice approach. Relationship property includes the family home and chattels regardless of whether it was acquired before or after the marriage or union, and all other property including benefits and superannuation acquired during or directly before the marriage or union. Separate property is all property that is not relationship property and generally consists of property held by the parties at the commencement of the cohabitation/marriage. 7.3 7.4 149 Property (Relationships) Act 1976 (New Zealand).

These include any asset owned wholly or substantially by one spouse at the date of the marriage, or any asset that has been inherited or received by one partner as a gift. These assets will be divided on the basis of contributions discussed below at para [7.9]. Additionally, if the contribution of one spouse has clearly been \u2018disproportionately greater\u2019 than the other then the division is also determined on the basis of the contributions of the parties. The major criticism of allowing an exemption based on the short duration of the relationship is the arbitrariness of the 3 years rule (which is especially apparent in light of the reality that many children are conceived or born during the first 3 years of a relationship or marriage). The second exception relates to where there are extraordinary circumstances that would make equal sharing \u2018repugnant to justice\u2019. In such circumstances the matrimonial home and family chattels is determined on the basis of contributions. A good practice approach would be to discard the 3 year rule and retain the exception of the \u2018repugnant to justice\u2019 which could exclude a marriage or a relationship of short duration if equal sharing appeared unjust in the circumstances. The third exception is that that the balance of matrimonial property (ie other than the matrimonial home and chattels) which might include a business, a second home and other property, shares, insurance and superannuation is to be divided equally unless one spouse\u2019s contribution to the partnership has been \u2018clearly greater\u2019 than the other. A major criticism of this approach is that the exception is easily established and that the major portion of the matrimonial property is typically therefore determined on the basis of contributions (to the disadvantage of the non-earning partner) rather than on the principle of equal sharing. The CEDAW Committee has specifically criticized this approach.152 In 2001 New Zealand reformed the original Act that the Cook Islands Act is based on, and as is illustrated below, in a good practice measure has now designated all relationship property to be shared equally. 7.5 7.6 7.7 7.8 150 L Tee, \u201cDivision of Property Upon Relationship Breakdown\u201d in Family Law: Issues, Debates Policy (ed) J Herring (Devon: Willan Publishing, 2001) 45 at 71. 151 UK Law Reform Commission, Cohabitation: The Financial Consequences of Relationship Breakdown.

Equal Division of Property Property (Relationships) Act 1976, s 11(1) (New Zealand) Determining Contributions In the Cook Islands, as in many modern property division frameworks, there are circumstances when property division is determined on the basis of contributions rather than equality of division. In the Cook islands, as discussed above, a contributions approach is adopted if equal division would be \u2018repugnant to justice\u2019, if the marriage is less than 3 years duration, and in relation to all matrimonial (or \u2018relationship\u2019) property other than the matrimonial home and chattels. A contributions approach requires the assessment of the contributions of the two parties to the marriage or partnership. A good practice approach to deciding how the contributions of each partner should affect how property is to be divided is to include a mandatory statutory list of factors for the court to consider, as detailed below. It is additionally important that the legislation explicitly states that non-financial contributions should be given equal weight with financial contributions.153 In General Recommendation 21(32) the CEDAW Committee states that in relation to the division of marital property \u2018financial and non-financial contributions should be accorded the same weight\u2019.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c687bcf-b99e-43da-ad23-46f006cb7be9": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c687bcf-b99e-43da-ad23-46f006cb7be9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing the Implementation of CEDAW in the Cook Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bf5dd266ab77bd71f9530098c6ce840851a495088486608434a2bf235696e586"}, "2": {"node_id": "15566508-62f7-438c-91d6-2eeefa2a9032", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-implementation-cedaw-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ba5f95f01a9e6ffd2d0342d6d5b5359e7e308249bc5762d92829c0a4cbc81873"}}, "hash": "15392f4dd60a0820e4dd2e653f4da7eedf0d6529d0b49cb9ff65cfa14a5da1e6", "text": "The Committee explains that non-financial contributions during a marriage such as raising children, caring for elderly relatives, and discharging household duties \u2018enable a husband to earn an income and increase the assets of the marital relationship\u2019. 7.9 153 UK Law Reform Commission, Cohabitation: The Financial Consequences of Relationship Breakdown.

Yet questions linger about how these indices should be interpreted and how valid they are. Relying on a framework that synthesizes key guidelines concerning the methodology of measurement, this paper offers an assessment of indices currently used to study gender disparities on a global scale and sheds light on these unresolved questions. That is, we answer the question, what do these indices with gender-differentiated data actually measure? and, how valid are these indices? In addition, we spell out the stakes of research on measures disaggregated by gender, and an agenda for work geared to producing good cross-national gender-differentiated indices. Key words: Gender disparity, gender-differentiated data, indices, methodology The views expressed in this publication are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily represent those of the United Nations, including UNDP, or the UN Member States. This paper was commissioned by the Human Development Report Unit as a technical background paper to inform the Asia-Pacific Human Development Report, \u201cPower, Voice and Rights\u201d.

Driven largely by the desire to provide follow-up to, and monitor compliance with, regional and world agreements that focus on gender equality and other gender-related issues, and by the Beijing Platform for Action of 1995 in particular, a multitude of researchers and organizations have carried out serious work to develop measures disaggregated by gender. Several projects have considered a broad range of indicators and raised the question\u2014 sometimes implicitly, sometimes explicitly\u2014of what set of indicators are needed to cover the main aspects of social life (UNECLAC 1999; UNECE 2001; UNIFEM 2002; UNESCAP 2003; UNRISD 2005; UNDP 2006). Other works have focused on how to develop measures focused on specific issues, such as health, including reproductive health (Abdullah 2000; Yinger et al. 2002), and violence against women (Walby 2007; Kelly et al. 2008). Moreover, much effort has gone into collecting and disseminating gender-differentiated data, that is, data on some issues that includes separate measures for both sexes.1 As a result of this collective endeavor, the amount of data and the quality of data that incorporates a gender perspective has increased considerably.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "18f57ccf-6d06-45b9-9dd5-77b36dfe60d8": {"__data__": {"id_": "18f57ccf-6d06-45b9-9dd5-77b36dfe60d8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/01", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1f5cb0c4c18e4a321fd305c9b98a9f8921e451a5045b0e959af93501eebc6c7d"}, "2": {"node_id": "32ecc1ab-4910-4d8f-9023-ee7d5f71ad8c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dc4f331598a26c0b96c58f38e43c5a66aca0c61c53ad447797fcadf3c92abb96"}}, "hash": "d2359f92b68158c8eaac704c885301336417957ec3966c26d42d2e6371a6e993", "text": "A distinctive facet of this broad challenge of measurement has been the development of indices, that is, compound measures that aggregate multiple indicators.

But much effort by other organizations and by independent researchers has also gone into the development of new indices. Thus, today, various indices with gender-differentiated data are broadly available and used for academic and public policy purposes.2 1 For an overview of resources on gender-differentiated data, including the production of data, the actors involved in the dissemination of data, and statistical databases, see UNECLAC (2002). 2 The number of proposed gender indices is by now quite long. Tin addition to the two UNDP indices, the list of proposed indices includes the Gender Equality Index (White 1997), the Gender Inequality Index (Forsythe, Korzeniewick and Durrant 1998), the Relative Status of Women index (Dijkstra and Hanmer 2000), the 4 Indices are likely to play a growing role in discussions of gender. All indices serve to summarize a complex picture by aggregating the information of multiple indicators. And this role is all the more important in the study of gender because the solution to the lack of information on gender\u2014the growing availability of gender indicators\u2014has created a new problem\u2014the sheer clutter produced by the growing availability of gender indicators. Indeed, a comprehensive list of data sources reveals a total of 303 indicators (UNECLAC 2002: Annex 6), making it difficult to study a particular country, let alone to compare several countries, by considering all the available information. However, by itself an index is not a solution to the problem brought about by the plethora of indicators. For an index to serve as a synthetic measure, it is indispensable that the index be a good measure of the issue one is interested in addressing. This paper seeks to contribute to the collective effort to develop cross-national indices that aggregate gender-differentiated data, as well as to offer guidance to users of these indices, by offering an assessment of the most visible indices that provide up-to-date data on most countries of the world.3 We focus on five indices: the UNDP\u2019s Gender-related Development Index (GDI), the UNDP\u2019s Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM), Social Watch\u2019s Gender Equity Index (GEI), the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI), and the OECD\u2019s Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI).4 As is standard in evaluations of measures, we seek to answer the question, how valid are these indices? And, as is conventional in evaluations of validity, we address the methodology used to generate the index, seeking to ascertain whether the measure captures variations in the phenomena being studied rather than being an artifact of the methodology used. Standardized Index of Gender Equality (Dijkstra 2002), the European Union Gender Equality Index (Plantenga, Figueiredo, Remery and Smith 2003). the African Gender and Development Index (UNECA 2004), the Gender Equity Index (Social Watch 2004), the Social Institutions and Gender Index (J\u00fctting, Morrisson, Dayton- Johnson, and Drechsler 2006), the Gender Equality in Education Index (Unterhalter 2006), the Global Gender Gap Index (Hausmann, Tyson, and Zahidi. 2007b), and the Multidimensional Gender Equality Index (Permanyer 2008). 3 For other assessments of indices, see Bardhan and Klasen (1999), Dijkstra (2002, 2006), Charmes and Wieringa (2003), Chant (2006), Klasen (2006a, 2006b, 2006c), Shuller (2006), Permanyer (2007), and J\u00fctting, et al. (2008). 4 Though many other indices have been proposed, as pointed out, not all are equally relevant to the current assessment. Some of these indices are presented as purely theoretical exercises. Others constitute merely a recalculation of the data used in computing the UNDP\u2019s two pioneering indices, the Gender-related Development Index and Gender Empowerment Measure. And yet others present data that have become dated or cover only a small number of countries. All these exercises are interesting and useful, and they form part of the broad debate about gender measures. But a core challenge in the development of suitable gender indices concerns the practical challenge of developing data about sometimes hard to measure concepts across a large number of countries in a sustainable manner. 5 But we also address a more basic, logically prior, question.

The problem of interpretability of these indices is not altogether surprising. After all, gender-differentiation can be linked to all sorts of matters of interest, such as the functioning of the brain, roles of men and women within the family or the military, attitudes toward violence, job advancement, participation in politics, and so forth. Gender is, to use a familiar phrase, a cross-cutting issue. And since a concern about gender is hence linked with many other concepts, interpreting a measure that is presented as a \u201cgender index\u201d is not necessarily easy. But the problem of interpretability of gender indices is compounded by methodological issues. The generation of indices involves complex methodological choices, and these choices, even if technical in nature, determine the meaning of the resulting measure. Thus, whether the goal is to evaluate the validity of an index, or to understand how to interpret an index, one must consider the methodology used to generate the index. To study the methodology used in constructing the five indices under review, so as to answer our two questions\u2014what do these indices measure? and, how valid are they?\u2014we rely on a simple framework. Measures are produced using a measuring instrument. And, at its core, the construction of a measuring instrument involves three tasks: the identification of dimensions of the concept that is being measured or what might be called the overarching concept; the selection of indicators to measure each conceptual dimension; and the design of scales for each indicator. Finally, inasmuch as the measures under consideration are indices, that is, compound measures that aggregate the values of multiple indicators, a fourth task that must be considered concerns the rule used to aggregate the indicators (see Table 1). 6 Each task involves distinct considerations and thus can be addressed one at a time. Indeed, there are many advantages to breaking down the overall task of generating an index into the core tasks connected to each element of a measuring instrument. But, as suggested by the very criteria for assessing how each task is tackled (see column 3 in Table 1), these tasks are interrelated. For example, the selection of indicators must be made both in light of the conceptual dimensions that have been identified and the choice of aggregation rule must refer back to the theory that drives the identification of conceptual dimensions. Moreover, though each task involves distinct considerations and can be assessed according to distinct criteria, the interpretation of an index is influenced by decisions made regarding all four elements of a measuring instrument, and the validity of an index is jointly determined by the extent to which the criteria regarding all tasks is adequately met.5 5 Another way to state this point is that any discussion of measurement must focus broadly on measurement error, as highlighted in standard discussions of measurement methodology, but in a broader manner than is customary in this literature. That is, our comprehensive framework seeks to show that there are many sources of error, that go beyond the standard ones discussed in the literature. 7 This methodological framework, which draws on and integrates different bodies of literature on measurement methodology,6 serves as the organizing principle for the paper. Section 1 focuses on how the five indices under review tackle the initial three tasks in the construction of a measuring instrument: i) the identification of conceptual dimensions, ii) the selection of indicators, and iii) the design of indicator scales. Section 2 addresses the particularly complicated aggregation of indicators, introducing\u2014as a way to make these indices more comprehensible\u2014a distinction between two steps in the aggregation of gender- differentiated data: first, the aggregation of the male and female values for each indicator and, second, the aggregation of the values of all indicators. In both these sections, we elaborate as necessary the barebones guidelines presented in Table 1, describe and compare the choices made by the index creators, and evaluate compliance with methodological criteria. We consider, in particular, whether each choice contributes to the generation of a measure that is clear and consistent in meaning, whether an appropriate justification is offered for each choice, and whether any empirical tests were used to validate the choices.7 Section 3 provides an overall assessment of the five indices under review.

Finally, in the conclusion, we articulate the stakes of research that aims at the development of measures that differentiate by gender and spell out some implications of our assessment for this research agenda. As we emphasize, the stakes of generating better measures, especially of a global scope, are considerable. Thus, it is critical to recognize the progress that has been made in generating measures, but also to acknowledge that many existing measures are still affected by serious shortcomings, not to get wedded to existing measures out of inertia, and to see the production of measures that incorporate a gender perspective as an evolving research agenda that calls for considerable efforts and innovation. 6 On measurement methodology, see Blalock (1982), Campbell (2001), and Kempf-Leonard (2005). 7 In this assessment, we rely on texts about the methodology followed to produce each index as well as the data on each index and the data on the indicators used in each index On the methodology used to constructing each index, we consulted Anand and Sen (2003a, 2003b), Hausmann, Tyson and Zahidi (2007b), J\u00fctting et al (2006, 2008), Porter and Schwab (2008), Social Watch (2005, 2008a: 68-79, 2008b), and UNDP (1995, 2007: 225-27, 358-60). The data on each index are generally available in reports and/or the websites of each organization. 8 1. From Overarching Concept to Data on Indicators This section focuses on how the five indices under review tackle the initial three tasks in the construction of a measuring instrument: i) the identification of conceptual dimensions, ii) the selection of indicators, and iii) the design of indicator scales. 1.1. Conceptual Dimensions The first task in developing a measuring instrument\u2014the identification of the dimensions of the overarching concept to be measured\u2014is the most purely theoretical and logical one. The identification of conceptual dimensions hinges on a decision that should be justified in light of a theory about the overarching concept, for it is in terms of such a theory that measures are interpreted. Moreover, this decision should follow a basic rule of logic\u2014 that good definitions consist of a mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive set of elements that do not smuggle in any extraneous element. However, even at this stage a practical matter, the feasibility of collecting data that measures the full meaning of the overarching concept cannot be fully forgotten. This first task is tackled formally in a fairly similar way by the constructors of the five indices under review. In each case, the index\u2019s overarching concept is disaggregated into three or four conceptual dimensions (see column 2 in Table 2). Moreover, in each case, this process of disaggregation relies on broad distinctions between spheres of social life that are well rooted in social science analysis and that identify mutually exclusive conceptual dimensions. In this way, a firm basis for measuring is established. That is, in all five indices, the disaggregation of the index\u2019s overarching concept into component parts breaks down and makes more concrete an otherwise extremely broad and abstract concept and hence helps to orient the subsequent task of indicator selection. 11 These similarities notwithstanding, as Table 2 shows, there are some notable differences in terms of the extent to which the index\u2019s overarching concept is theorized and the content of the conceptual dimensions of each index. The UNDP\u2019s GDI has a key virtue, that it focuses on a well theorized overarching concept, development and, moreover, that it is conceptualized and measured in exactly the same terms as the UNDP\u2019s Human Development Index (HDI), except for the way it differentiates between genders and uses gender inequalities to adjust the HDI scores downwards (UNDP 2007). The clarity of purpose evident in the design of the GDI makes it relatively easy to interpret. But this choice also makes the GDI vulnerable to the main conceptual critique that was voiced against the HDI: the failure to include several key conceptual dimensions of human development (Fukuda Parr 2003).8 After all, the concept of human development is very broad, including factors essential to the \u201cformation of human capabilities\u201d, that were explicitly included in the HDI and the GDI, but also a series of \u201cpolitical, economic and social freedoms\u201d (UNDP 1990; Sen 1999), that were not included in the HDI and the GDI due to, among other reasons, the lack of data on the relevant indicators at the time the HDI was constructed (Fukuda Parr 2003).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0791a8d0-680d-448d-84dc-9e683568cdd4": {"__data__": {"id_": "0791a8d0-680d-448d-84dc-9e683568cdd4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/01", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "339896eafb6c7c4580641b7505993fd01867945cfa884c3d05c73fd8557d00e2"}, "2": {"node_id": "ad330010-033f-474d-a13f-82759f572ce5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d5b93d413c5b8f231fc53a2e4e5e860b5305f62438c9659a86815dad0d7a4cb7"}}, "hash": "7a7a2ad644e7d1ab104776ec4c111432c1cdf92536853e8f905a30baf8b90fbc", "text": "In a nutshell, the GDI\u2019s conceptual strengths but also its limitations are quite obvious.

But, interestingly, they all appear to take the GDI as a point of reference and partly explicitly, partly implicitly, they seek to overcome the narrowness of the GDI. The first index to tap into conceptual dimensions excluded from the GDI is the UNDP\u2019s own Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM), launched in 1995 along with the GDI. This index goes beyond the GDI\u2019s focus on socio-economic aspects and explicitly addresses issues of rights and of access to power. But the concept of empowerment used in this index is not developed and, as a result, the relationship between the GDI and the GEM is hard to pin down. Subsequently, the Social Watch\u2019s Gender Equity Index (GEI), first released in 2004, and the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI), introduced in 2006, offered, as their key conceptual innovation, the inclusion of conceptual dimensions presented separately in the two UNDP indices.9 However, the creators of both these indices do not explicitly state what overarching concept these indices measure, and hence do not offer a theoretical rationale for choosing the conceptual dimensions they include. Indeed, besides the GDI, only the OECD\u2019s Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI), made public in 2008, is based on an explicit 8 The one problem of the HDI the GDI gets around, in a partial way, through its focus on gender, is the critique that the HDI does not address distributional issues. 12 framework built around the overarching concept of social institutions (Morrisson and J\u00fctting 2005). This concept serves as the point of reference in the identification of the SIGI\u2019s conceptual dimensions. Moreover, it helps to highlight the purpose and novelty of this index. The SIGI does not seek to subsume previous efforts, and thus drops all the conceptual dimensions introduced by the UNDP indices, the GEI and the GGGI. Rather, its contribution lies in offering a supplementary measure that encompasses a range of issues pertaining to social institutions and norms other indices ignore. In sum, the history of indices with gender-differentiated data can be summarized, in large part,10 as a series of successive efforts to address ever-expanding spheres of social life in which gender differences could be a factor that had not been included in the GDI. These other indices do not always rest on as clear an overarching concept as the GDI, and thus it is hard to state with certainty whether the entire meaning of each index\u2019s overarching concept has been grasped. In this regard, it is probably safe to state that, in addition to identifying conceptual dimensions that are mutually exclusive, all five indices avoid the introduction of extraneous elements, which are not part of the concept\u2019s meaning. But it is also tempting to posit that all five indices could be understood as measures of the concept of development, as conceived by the UNDP and that, even though none of these indices offer a jointly exhaustive measure, a combination of the World Economic Forum\u2019s GGGI, which subsumes the two UNDP indices and the Social Watch\u2019s GEI, and the OECD\u2019s SIGI would be an important step in that direction. 1.2. Indicators The second task in developing a measuring instrument concerns the selection of indicators to measure each of the conceptual dimensions identified during the prior step (see Table 1). This task is an extension of the prior more purely conceptual task, in that indicators are but concrete, empirically grounded concepts. Thus, a fundamental concern in the selection of indicators is whether they appropriately build a bridge between the abstract concepts that are part and parcel of theorizing and the observables that are essential to measurement. Moreover, much as with the identification of conceptual dimensions, indicators should be selected so as to capture the full meaning of the conceptual dimensions they purportedly measure, using mutually exclusive indicators, that is, that do not duplicate each 9 The main conceptual difference between these two indices being that the Social Watch index dropped the dimension focused on health while the World Economic Forum index retained it. 10 The other main conceptual differences concern how these indices conceive of gender equality and whether they focus on absolute and/or relative levels of attainment of goals, points addressed in Section 2.2. 13 other, and avoid extraneous indicators, that is, indicators of a different conceptual dimension or a different concept.11 In other words, the selection of indicators should be made, and justified, in light of the link between conceptual dimensions and indicators, a link that directly affects the validity of eventual measures. In addition, practical considerations, particularly as they relate to the process whereby values are assigned to each indicator,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3a03acb-433b-49a2-b9f1-2c1c0e31c384": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3a03acb-433b-49a2-b9f1-2c1c0e31c384", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/01", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "99bf277f0944c924df606978876a4a4281b2e42aab9b92c840fbfb38bffd8957"}}, "hash": "99bf277f0944c924df606978876a4a4281b2e42aab9b92c840fbfb38bffd8957", "text": "play a heavy role in the selection of indicators. The process of assigning values to indicators affects whether the data generated on each indicator are replicable, that is, whether it is feasible for independent researchers to reproduce the data generating process, and reliable, that is, whether an independent attempt to assign values to the indicators produces the same data. Hence, the method whereby values are assigned to indicators should be a factor in itself in considering whether certain indicators should be included or not. In short, the selection of indicators must be made looking backwards, to the concepts that are being measured and the theoretical content of these concepts, and forwards, to the measurability of these concepts and the quality of the relevant information that is available or can be collected. With regard to this task, some interesting points emerge from an inspection of the indices under review (see column 3 in Table 2). An obvious conclusion to be drawn is that, differences concerning the various indices\u2019 overarching concept and conceptual dimensions aside, most of them (the exception is the OCED\u2019s SIGI) rely largely on the same indicators, such as Literacy Rate; Primary (net), Secondary (net), and Tertiary (gross) Level Enrolment; Earned income (PPP US$); Labor Force Participation; Professional and Technical Positions; and Parliamentary Seats (see Table 3).12 These indicators have some advantages, in that data on these indicators are readily available for most of the world and the process whereby the data are generated is, within reasonable limits of feasibility, a reliable one (see column 4 in 11 One way to think about the selection of indicators is that it constitutes the operational definition of the concept being measured and hence that, in making choices about indicators, it is imperative to avoid a mismatch between the theoretical and operational definition of a concept. The use of multiple indicators to measure the same concept or conceptual dimension, that is, that are not mutually exclusive, can be justified as a way to produce a more robust measure. But if the goal is to produce an index that measures many conceptual dimensions, and an assumption is made that each indicator measures a different part of a conceptual dimension, the use of multiple indicators leads to the problem of redundancy and double counting in the aggregation process. The concern about extraneous indicators is driven by the need to avoid introducing indicators that do not belong and that would therefore thwart the meaning of the measure and cloud its interpretation. 12 Capitalization is used to distinguish references to the conceptual dimensions and indicators of the indices under review from other uses of the same words. 14 Table 2).13 But the weaknesses associated with these choices out of convenience should be recognized. One problem is that the selected indicators fail to capture the full meaning of the conceptual components they are supposed to measure. Thus, to take the most extreme example, it is hard to avoid the sense that Parliamentary Seats, as an indicator by itself, is too narrow a measure of the UNDP\u2019s GEM conceptual component Political Participation and Decision-making. But other problems emerge as index creators attempt to make do with readily available information. One problem is the use of what could be labeled extraneous indicators, those that fully or partly, are measures of conceptual components other than those 13 This assessment does not seek to dismiss the serious concerns expressed by Srinivasan (1994) about the reliability and comparability of many of the data used in these indices. Moreover, it does not take into account some blatant errors introduced by those responsible for generating gender indices. For example, with regard to the indicator Positions as Legislators, Senior Officials and Managers (female/male ratio), the World Economic Forum data point to sudden changes, from 0.27 to 0.48 in Italy between the 2007 and 2008 report, from 0.09 to 0.30 for Bangladesh between the 2006 to 2007 reports, and from 0.08 to 0.58 for France between the 2006 to 2007 reports! (Hausmann, Tyson, and Zahidi 2006: 37, 64; 2007b: 42, 72, 87; 2008: 94). These changes are, on the face of things, incredible and indeed the data for the early year differ from those reported by the World Economic Forum\u2019s own data source, the International Labor Organization\u2019s LABORISTA datasite. In other words, concerns about data reliability cannot be put to rest. 15 they are claimed to measure.

In both instances, strictly political information about legislators, is mistakenly presented as a measure of an economic dimension.14 And this is the case with the World Economic Forum GGGI\u2019s indicator Heads of State (number of years over last 50 years), a slightly misnamed indicator, in that it focuses on presidents and prime ministers, that uses information about the past as an assessment of the present, counter to what is done for all the other GGGI indicators. The OCED\u2019s SIGI differs considerably from the other indices with regard to the selection of indicators. This index breaks new ground by not letting the scarcity of readily available data constrain the selection of indicators and by calling for indicators that address key spheres of social life in which gender differences could be a factor even though they are not readily available. However, the generation of data on most of the SIGI\u2019s indicators through expert coding is a matter of concern. The use of expert coding is a well-established method of generating data. Moreover, the sources of information used to carry out the coding are made public and the information itself is public in nature (J\u00fctting et al. 2008). But the standard practice of reporting the results of an intercoder reliability test is not followed by the SIGI\u2019s creators. Especially because some of the indicator scales are vaguely formulated, we are left with serious doubts about the reliability of the data on the SIGI\u2019s indicators.15 In sum, the five indices under review rely on indicators that exemplify some important strengths, but also have shortcomings. Probably most significantly, while the selection of indicators for which data are easily accessible is associated with a failure to tap into the full meaning of each conceptual dimension, a problem most evident in the GDI, we find that attempts to overcome this problem by selecting indicators for which data are not readily available has led to a different problem\u2014the use of indicators of dubious reliability. 1.3. Indicator Scales The third task in developing a measuring instrument concerns the design of scales for each indicator (see Table 1). As discussions about levels of measurement highlight, decisions 14 The simultaneous use of the Legislators, Senior Officials and Managers and the Parliamentary Seats indicators by the GEM and GGGI, as well as the Social Watch\u2019s GEI, also leads to a problem of partial redundancy. 15 A similar critique applies to the GGGI\u2019s indicator Wage Equality for Similar Work. Data on this indicator is collected through a question in an expert survey (Porter and Schwab 2008: question 9.13) about which little is 16 regarding scales should be guided by the criteria that indicator scales should offer as much nuance, that is, as many distinctions, as is justified. But it is also critical to emphasize that indicator scales should be consistent with the concept being measured, that is, that the choices about scales\u2014much like choices about the indicators themselves\u2014should be made in light of the concept that is being measured. The issue of indicator scales is a moot question for most indices. This is so because most indices, as pointed out earlier, rely on data that are readily available, as opposed to data that have been collected specifically for the purpose of generating an index, and simply operate with the scales designed by the original data collectors. Thus, in these cases, the indicator scales could be considered to be predetermined and that the choice about scales was made by index creators when the indicators were selected. However, index creators did make distinct scaling choices regarding all indicators in two indices, the UNDP\u2019s GDI and the OCED\u2019s SIGI,16 and interestingly approached this decision in quite different ways. The UNDP\u2019s GDI relies on data collected by sources other than the UNDP and hence on indicators measured according to predetermined scales. But because the GDI is conceived as an index to be compared to the Human Development Index (HDI) and hence retains a focus on absolute levels of attainment of certain goals, the GDI\u2019s indicators are rescaled using the same procedures as in the HDI. Specifically, rescaling is carried out to normalize scales that have different metrics, using the notion of goalposts with minimum and maximum levels, and to adjust the Earned Income indicator, in line with the idea of diminishing returns, through the log transformation of this indicator. That is, the rescaling of the GDI\u2019s indicators is well justified. The OCED\u2019s SIGI is similar to the GDI in that it rescales three of its 12 indicators, in a way that is quite reasonable.

These scales are all ordinal scales, which reflect a sensitivity about the distinctions that can justifiably be made in light of available information (J\u00fctting et al. 2008). Moreover, the work involved in developing such scales should be duly recognized. But their weaknesses should known. For example, the degree of agreement among the respondents is not reported and, since the data are not publicly available, independent researchers are not able to conduct test to assess the reliability of the data. 16 Beyond these two indices, only two scaling decisions were made, The UNDP\u2019s GEM Earned Income indicator is rescaled by using the same notion of goalposts as the GDI. And he World Economic Forum GGGI includes a scaling choice with regard to the Heads of State indicator, which is measured with a simple count, of the number of years over the past 50 years during which a country has had a male and a female president or prime ministers. 17 also be noted. The main problem is that most of the scales are one-sided, addressing inequalities that disadvantage girls or women. Thus, potential inequalities that work against boys and men are not even envisioned and the possibility of empirically studying gender equality as it is broadly understood is closed.17 In addition, some confusion is introduced because the one-sided scales for some indicators, such as Parental Authority and Inheritance, posit a relationship between the situation of men and women; while the one-sided scales for other indications, such as those for the Female Genital Mutilation and Violence Against Women indicators, focus on restrictions to the rights of girls and women while making no contrast to the situation of boys and men.18 As a result, the SIGI\u2019s indicator scales do not prepare the way for systematically collecting gender-disaggregated data and, furthermore, combines, in a largely implicit manner, truncated measures of gender inequality and measures of distinctive women\u2019s rights. 1.4. An Interim Reflection The amount of attention index creators put into the three elements of a measuring instrument discussed thus far, relative to what they dedicate to the fourth element, the choice of the rule to aggregate indicators, varies considerably. In the case of the OCED\u2019s SIGI, the generation of data on indicators is clearly the core concern. The SIGI\u2019s real value added is the production of new data on indicators of key spheres of social life; in contrast, the aggregation of these indicators is hardly discussed and appears as little more than an afterthought.19 For the other four indices (GDI, GEM, GEI and GGGI), the reverse is true. The generation of data on indicators is not a goal for the creators of these indices\u2014indeed, the work done by data collectors and standardizers is a precondition for these indices\u2014and hence the value added is given by the methodology of aggregation. But even in these cases, it is important to recognize the impact of decisions, explicit or implicit, regarding conceptual dimensions, indicator selection, and indicator scales (we return to this point in Section 3). As the methodological framework presented in Table 1 seeks to show, these three elements are 17 This problem also affects the GGGI\u2019s indicator Wage Equality for Similar Work, which is based on a question about women\u2019s earnings relative to men, and thus excludes a priori the possibility of collecting data that might show that women earn more than men (Porter and Schwab 2008). 18 Finally, the Polygamy indicator scale is simply puzzling, because no reference to men or women is made and hence it is unclear if it refers only to polygyny, only to polyandry, or to both. 19 The rule to aggregate indicators into sub-indices at the level of conceptual dimensions is simply mentioned in a footnote in the article on the SIGI\u2019s methodology (Jutting et al. 2008) and the rule to aggregate these sub- indices into the SIGI index is not mentioned in any publication. Rather strangely, an unpublished working paper states that the \u201csocial institutions indicator\u201d is calculates by adding the four sub-indices (Jutting et al. 2006: 20) when the available data on SIGI is calculated as the average of the four sub-indices. 18 integral parts of a measuring instrument designed to produce an index. And they affect both the interpretation and validity of these indices. 2.

Aggregation presupposes that the three tasks discussed earlier have been completed and, as mentioned, aggregate data is affected by the choices made in dealing with these tasks. But the task of aggregation involves a distinct choice, concerning the rule to aggregate indicators, and the aggregation rule is the most complex and technical element of a measuring instrument used to generate indices with gender-differentiated data. Because most of the indices aggregate data on indicators originally disaggregated by gender, aggregation involves two distinct steps. On the one hand, as is standard for any index, aggregation involves the combination of the values of all indicators and all conceptual dimensions. An example, to take the UNDP\u2019s GEM, is the combination of the values of the Professional and Technical Positions indicator and the Positions as Legislators, Senior Officials and Managers indicator; and the combination of the values of the index\u2019s three conceptual dimensions: Power over Economic Resources, Economic Participation and Decision-making, and Political Participation and Decision-making (see column 2 and 3 of Table 2).20 On the other hand, aggregation of data that has been differentiated by gender also involves the combination of the male and female values for each indicator. An example, again referred to the UNDP\u2019s GEM, is the combination of the male and female values of the Professional and Technical Positions indicator. The choice of aggregation rule revolves around two general questions: what is the relationship among indicators? and, what weight should be assigned to the indicators? And selected aggregation rule must abide by a general criterion: it should be theoretically justified and, inasmuch as possible, empirically tested. But these general questions are formulated in different terms in the specific context of the two steps in the aggregation process. Likewise, compliance with this general criterion can only be assessed within the context of the different issues relevant to each step. Thus, in what follows, we address the delicate choice of the aggregation rule made by the creators of the five indices under review one step at a tine, 20 When a conceptual dimension is measured with only one indicators, as is the case of the GEM\u2019s Political Participation and Decision-making dimension, no aggregation of indicators is necessary and the value of the relevant indicator\u2014in this case the Parliamentary Seats indicator\u2014is the value of the conceptual dimension. 19 starting with the distinctive challenge of choosing a rule to aggregate data disaggregated by gender. 2.1. The Rule to Aggregate Male and Female Values for Each Indicator All indices with gender-differentiated data have a common goal: to overcome the weakness of depictions of reality that rely on simple averages, that is, an additive aggregation rule, that provides an absolute measure that necessarily overlooks possible differences in the situation of women relative to men.21 However, in seeking to move beyond simple averages, index creators face several choices. First, to generate a measure that addresses the relationship between women and men, index creators must determine the standard to be used in comparing the data on women and men for each indicator. Second, to generate a relational measure, index creators must decide what weight to assign to deviations from this standard. Third, index creators must decide whether to combine the relational measure generated by the prior two choices with an absolute measure, and if so, what weight to assign to the relational and the absolute measure. Interestingly, even though there is a large degree of overlap across the UNDP\u2019s GDI and GEM, the Social Watch\u2019s GEI and the World Economic Forum\u2019s GGGI with regard to the selection of indicators and data sources, index creators largely part ways regarding these choices. Regarding the choice of standard, these indices use a 50/50 ratio, understood as the point of parity, practically as a default option. The only exceptions concern the Life Expectancy indicator in the GDI, the Healthy Life Expectancy indicator in the GGGI, and the Number of Births indicator in the GGGI (see column 6 in Table 2).22 But concerning the weight assigned to deviations from the chosen standard, two options can be distinguished. Both UNDP indices give equal weight to deviations from the standard of parity that favor men and women (this option is sometimes refereed to as a \u201cdouble-sided scale\u201d). That is, they measure inequality as it is generally understood. In contrast, the GEI and GGGI assign no weight at all to deviations from the standard of parity favoring women and only count inequalities that disadvantage women (this option is sometimes referred to as", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "58b5162c-bfef-4126-93ed-ea4e4b1b4e2b": {"__data__": {"id_": "58b5162c-bfef-4126-93ed-ea4e4b1b4e2b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/01", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4292f2964352d96558f0f324e675a5d279327e183bb2cf8b0799bf16dfa4b39b"}, "3": {"node_id": "51ffd7c5-29ac-42dd-8e63-62a0cc4b85c4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5beaac1a9f4632e811e3cc2d5e377bef1119c2ff5985a4dba40ae85e7800c097"}}, "hash": "cb40d1f121f438155e0e709108f4e781c35fb15823af5aed0edfe65ed82327d1", "text": "a \u201csingle-sided scale\u201d). That is, they measure inequality only from the perspective of women.23 Finally, with regard to the third choice, three options can be distinguished. The UNDP\u2019s GDI seeks to 21 A simple average also gives equal weight to the situation of women and men. 22 The two UNDP indices, and the GEI, also make an adjustment for the share of women and men in the population. 23 In the 2005 version of the GGGI, deviations from the standard of parity favoring women were given the same weight as deviations favoring men, but interpreted not as an indicator of inequality but rather as a measure of women\u2019s empowerment or of \u201cwomen\u2019s supremacy over men\u201d (Hausmann, Tyson and Zahidi 2007a: 22). 20 retain the information about the absolute level of attainment of goals conveyed by simple averages and thus aggregates a relational and absolute measure using the harmonic mean of these two measures, an aggregation rule that assigns a \u201cmoderate\u201d weight to their relational measure vis-\u00e0-vis the absolute measure (UNDP 1995: 73; 2007: 358-60). The UNDP\u2019s GEM aggregates a relational and absolute measure of the Earned Income indicator, again using the harmonic mean, but uses only a relational measure for the other indicators. And the GEI and GGGI rely, more simply on relational measures only, and thus do not take the absolute level of the attainment of goals into consideration. The different options selected by index constructors are relatively well justified and the aggregation process is largely replicable,24 but basic questions can be raised about some choices. Concerning the two UNDP indices, the standard of parity chosen for the GDI\u2019s Life Expectancy indicator is convincingly defended (Anand and Sen 2003a: 142, 2003b: 211, 213- 14). But the reliance on a 50/50 ratio for the GEM\u2019s Parliamentary Seats indicators could be disputed. For example, if women fall short of gaining 50 per cent of the seats in parliament, this may be due to the lack of a level playing field but also to a whole host of other factors. Thus, this standard is more consistent with a measure focused on equality of results than a measure of \u201copportunities\u201d, which the UNDP suggests that the GEM is (UNDP 2007).25 The decision to give equal weight to deviations from the standard of parity that favor men and women is justified in light of the stated purpose of the UNDP to address gender equality in general as opposed to, say, the disadvantages of women relative to men. Finally, the rationale for use of the harmonic mean to aggregate relational and absolute measures in the GDI and GEM is spelled out in a paper by Anand and Sen (2003b). As these authors explain, the core idea is that this aggregation rule is meant to capture the degree of inequality aversion in a society and impose a penalty for deviations from equality, such that the measure that is produced is, to use the UNDP\u2019s vocabulary, moderately lower than a measure solely based on a simple average. But no justification is offered for assigning a moderate weight to inequalities as opposed to any other weight and, even though this weighting choice is shown to have a large potential impact (Anand and Sen 2003b), no results of an empirical test that 24 The OECD\u2019s SIGI is similar, with regard to this step in the aggregation process, to the GEI and the GGGI, but the choice of aggregation rule is embedded in the design of their scales, a decision that hinders the SIGI\u2019s replicability. 25 Another problem with this indicator is that not all countries have a parliament. In those instances, the UNDP simply drops the country from the GEM, a rather drastic decision probably driven by the fact that Parliamentary Seats is the only indicator of the Political Participation and Decision-making conceptual component. 21 would gauge the impact of picking different weighting are reported. In short, it is hard to dispel the sense that this weighting choice is quite arbitrary.26 Concerning the Social Watch\u2019s GEI, though its use of a 50/50 ratio as a standard of parity is a reasonable choice for most indicators, the same question raised regarding the GEM\u2019s Parliamentary Seats indicators applies to it.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "51ffd7c5-29ac-42dd-8e63-62a0cc4b85c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "51ffd7c5-29ac-42dd-8e63-62a0cc4b85c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/01", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4292f2964352d96558f0f324e675a5d279327e183bb2cf8b0799bf16dfa4b39b"}, "2": {"node_id": "58b5162c-bfef-4126-93ed-ea4e4b1b4e2b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cb40d1f121f438155e0e709108f4e781c35fb15823af5aed0edfe65ed82327d1"}}, "hash": "5beaac1a9f4632e811e3cc2d5e377bef1119c2ff5985a4dba40ae85e7800c097", "text": "In turn, though the GEI\u2019s assignment of no weight to deviations from the standard of parity favoring women is justified by Social Watch\u2019s stated interest to draw \u201cconclusions about critical deficiencies in what women are able or allowed to do\u201d (Social Watch 2005), it is important to note that such a decision makes it less general than the UNDP indices and hence limits the index\u2019s use.

This decision gets around the problem the UNDP faces in assigning weights to relative and absolute measures, but it creates a new problem, most evident with regard to the Parliamentary Seats indicator.

The option to assign no weight to deviations from the standard of parity favoring women entails, as with the GEI, a loss of generality but is justified 26 For a critique of this weighting scheme, that also questions the use of the same weight for all of the GDI\u2019s indicators, see Bardhan and Klasen (1999). 27 Logically speaking, given Social Watch\u2019s commitment to developing a relative measure, they would in effect have to say that a country in which men and women hold the same number of seats in parliament is indistinguishable from, to give a real example, a country in which the military has taken power and decided to rule without a parliament. 22 cryptically, with nothing more than the enunciation that the index creators made this choice because they find it \u201cmore appropriate for [their] purposes\u201d (Hausmann, Tyson and Zahidi 2007). In contrast, the decision to rely solely on a relational measure is better justified, in terms similar to those put forward by Social Watch (Hausmann, Tyson and Zahidi 2007). But, as with the GEI, the sole reliance on relational measures creates its own problem. Specifically, when a country has no parliament, the GGGI drops this indicator and reweights the remaining indicators of the Political Empowerment conceptual dimension in what amounts to an ad hoc and unacknowledged procedure that reduces the comparability of the data. All indices, in sum, entail some questionable choices regarding how they aggregate male and female values for each indicator. 2.2. The Rule to Aggregate the Values of All Indicators and Conceptual Dimensions The aggregation of the male and female values for each indicator results in combined male/female values for each indicator, which themselves must be aggregated in a second step to generate the index value. The relationship among the indicators (and among conceptual dimensions), and the weight of each indicator (and each conceptual dimension) is, again, the key issue. However, in dealing with part of the aggregation process, index creators are not concerned with the relationship between, and the weight of, male and female values of each indicator. Instead, the focus turns to the aggregation of groups of indicators into sub-indices at the level of conceptual dimensions, and the aggregation of the sub-indices into a single index. Thus, attention focuses sequentially on: i) the relationship among, and the weight of, indicators used to measure each conceptual dimension (if only one indicator is used to measure a conceptual dimensions, this step is skipped), and ii) the relationship among, and the weight of, each conceptual dimension. With regard to the procedure used at this stage in the aggregation process, the five gender indices under review select, with only a few exceptions, the same option: an additive aggregation rule that assigns the same weight to all the indicators that measure the same conceptual dimension, and the same rule to aggregate all the conceptual dimensions (see column 7 in Table 2). The only exceptions concern the decision to give equal weight to the set of indicators that measure a conceptual dimension.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d277c59e-6432-47af-9917-952e282b03c2": {"__data__": {"id_": "d277c59e-6432-47af-9917-952e282b03c2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/01", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e7aa96a63be8137ffbe51e35316e73ca09eede646a6db95ff4c8dbe07e62582c"}, "2": {"node_id": "3052cbfe-e863-4a57-bf57-d62551b58981", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "44b296bd1abcf5322ab267d3fdbf1fef6688fe570bacbd5f5f6161016e51b866"}}, "hash": "269facd5a75c215645365c1fc73cea63c27abc282b2b574d54955fad777a558b", "text": "A minor exception in this regard is provided by the UNDP\u2019s GDI, which assigns different weights to the indicators of the conceptual", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ef7d2857-3cbd-4934-8d80-085d8d9f537a": {"__data__": {"id_": "ef7d2857-3cbd-4934-8d80-085d8d9f537a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/01", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "75e8fcc95c6ca1bad60af2f7a8658d3908e3ce70d6a8cc64169c3b0b42a60b35"}}, "hash": "75e8fcc95c6ca1bad60af2f7a8658d3908e3ce70d6a8cc64169c3b0b42a60b35", "text": "dimension Knowledge.28 A more significant departure from the norm is offered by the World Economic Forum\u2019s GGGI, which assigns variable weights to each indicator 28 The Literacy Rate component is assigned double the weight of the combined three enrollment indicators. 23 according to its standard deviations relative to that of other indicators of the same conceptual dimension, giving more weight to indicators with a lower standard deviation and using the weights calculated for the 2006 index in subsequent versions of the index (Hausmann, Tyson and Zahidi 2007).29 The clarity regarding the aggregation procedure adopted by each index and the relatively high replicability of the aggregation process notwithstanding,30 the extent of theoretical justification and empirical testing is quite low. The UNDP does offer a cogent justification for the aggregation rule used in the HDI, and hence by implication to the GDI, based on an assessment of their importance, the distinction between stock and flow indicators, and the possibility of substitutability across indicators (Haq 2003; Jahan 2003). But the use of an additive aggregation rule that assigns equal value to each set of indicators and to each conceptual dimension is usually treated more or less as a default option, needing little justification. And where explicit justifications have been offered, they have not been convincing. For example, the World Economic Forum GGGI\u2019s weighting scheme amounts to saying that greater weight should be assigned to indicators for which the situation around the world is fairly similar (Hausmann, Tyson and Zahidi 2007). But it is not clear, for example, why a ban forbidding women to hold seats in parliament in a certain country should be considered less of a problem simply if it is widely practiced in other countries. Furthermore, the GGGI\u2019s use of weights calculated for the 2006 index in subsequent versions of the index\u2014the rationale being the desire to ensure the comparability over time of the index\u2014has the effect of allowing the situation in an arbitrarily picked year to determine whether certain problems will be given greater or lesser weight in the future. The GGGI anchors weighting decisions in global trends, which might be positive or negative, offering thus a relative as opposed to a universal standard, and then obfuscates matters more by contradictorily disregarding future trends\u2014a questionable procedure.31 Another problem is that index creators appear to be unaware of how choices regarding the way indicators are grouped under different conceptual dimensions and the number of indicators affects the aggregation process. The distinction among conceptual dimensions and 29 As a result of this procedure, the maximum difference in weight between indicators is 2.4. For the weights assigned to each indicator, see Hausmann, Tyson and Zahidi (2007). 30 The replicability of the aggregation process is ensured because both the aggregation procedure is articulated clearly and the underlying data, that is, the data on each indicator, is made public by the index producers or is otherwise publicly available. However, when comparing the data used by the index producers to the data from the sources cited by the index producers, we have found numerous discrepancies. 31 To be consistent, given the justification offered by the creators of the GGGI, the empirically derived weights would have to recalculated each year, using the data on all the years that were being compared. 24 the groupings of indicators is important in that it provides a framework within which choices about aggregation can be addressed in a more nuanced way than if all the indicators were treated as direct measures of an overarching concept. But the impact on the process of aggregation of the selection of extraneous indicators (on these indicators, see Section 1.2) is not acknowledged.32 And, more broadly, the impact on the weights of indicators on the way indicators are grouped into conceptual dimensions, and the number of indicators used to measure each conceptual dimension, is likewise never addressed. These two factors indirectly but strongly affect the weighting of indicators. Indeed, as a result of these factors, in addition to the formal aggregation rule, the actual weight of each indicator varies considerably both within each index and across the indices: within these indices some indicators have eight times the weight of other indicators, and across these indices some indicators have 11 times the weight of other indicators (see Table 4).33 Yet this important aspect of the weighting process goes practically unnoticed. 32 The use of the indicator Legislators, Senior Officials and Managers as a measure of an economic-oriented conceptual dimension in the UNDP\u2019s GEM and the World Economic Forum\u2019s GGGI undermines the theoretical justification for the grouping of indicators into distinct conceptual dimensions and the internal", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "52e52b94-18e3-414c-a617-b1a9c2edee87": {"__data__": {"id_": "52e52b94-18e3-414c-a617-b1a9c2edee87", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/01", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "47272b284f41b8ab2fbb7b3c66c21aef40b8fe1e2c37e34f5e7c70ba54876748"}}, "hash": "47272b284f41b8ab2fbb7b3c66c21aef40b8fe1e2c37e34f5e7c70ba54876748", "text": "balance among indicators within each conceptual dimension. Moreover, the inclusion in these two indices of another indicator that measures the presence of men and women within the legislature\u2014the Parliamentary Seats indicator\u2014leads to a slight problem of redundancy that affects, surreptitiously, the weighting of indicators by double counting the same information. The Social Watch\u2019s GEI uses the indicator Legislators, Senior Officials and Managers but it is not an extraneous indicator in that case because it is used as an indicator of the broader but vaguer conceptual component Empowerment. Nonetheless, because this indicator is included alongside the Parliamentary Seats indicator, the GEI also suffers from a slight problem of redundancy. 33 Another carryover factor from other elements of the measuring instrument that is relevant to this discussion concerns the indicator scales. Specifically, in the case of the OCED\u2019s SIGI, no consideration is given to the appropriateness of aggregating indicators measures with different scales, including various ordinal scales. 25 Finally, and most generally, the constructors of the five indices under review do little to present ideas about alternative ways in which they might have constructed the index and, more pointedly, no tests are reported that compare the impact of different aggregation rules and estimate the robustness of the chosen aggregation rule.34 Such tests could focus on different parts of the measuring instrument that affect the process of aggregation. And such tests could play an important role in the validation of an index. For example, the weighting of the World Economic Forum GGGI\u2019s Heads of State indicator (see Table 4) raises a red flag, which reinforces doubts posed earlier (see Section 1.2) about the suitability of this indicator. Does it make sense to posit, as this index does, that considering the year 2009 the difference between having 0 or 29 percent female enrollment in universities is equivalent to the difference between never having had a female head of state and having had a female head of state during four of the past 50 years, maybe all in the 1980s? Thus, one legitimately wonders how the World Economic Forum\u2019s GGGI would look if this indicator were weighted differently or if it were altogether excluded from the index, and expects index 26 producers to address these concerns. Indeed, it is the responsibility of index creators to, at the very least, consider alternative but feasible ways of constructing an index and to present the results of tests that assess the impact of these differences. Yet the producers of the reviewed indices have all failed to shoulder the burden of performing such sensitivity analyses. 3. An Overall Assessment The assessment of the five indices under review can be summarized in the form of answers to the two questions posed in the introduction: What are the five reviewed indices a measure of? And, how well do the five reviewed indices stand up to the criteria we highlight in our methodological framework? 3.1. What do These Indices Measure? To answer the first of these questions, it is fundamental to note that the two key factors shaping the meaning of these indices are the overarching concept the index seeks to measure, and the choices made in aggregating the male and female values for each indicator. Indeed, these indices differ in their meaning\u2014a matter of keen interest to the users of these indices\u2014but their meaning is not evident in all cases from a reading of the index\u2019s name or even of the description offered by the index creators. The GDI is the best explained index and probably the easiest one to understand, no doubt because of its clear focus on the concept of development and the wide dissemination of the HDI. As the UNDP states in the report that introduced the GDI, this index \u201cmeasures the same basic capabilities as the HDI [human development index] does, but takes note of inequalities in achievement between women and men\u2026The GDI is simply the HDI, discounted, or adjusted downwards, for gender inequality\u201d (UNDP 1995). But, to correctly interpret the GDI, it is also important to recall that, inasmuch as it is a gender measure, it is a general measure of gender inequality, which considers inequalities favoring men and women.35 The GEM has not been as well explained as the GDI by the UNDP. The concept of empowerment used in the index\u2019s label was never developed as fully as the concept of development. Moreover, the explanation that the GEM focuses \u201con women\u2019s opportunities rather than their capabilities\u201d (UNDP 2007) is not very helpful. The GEM\u2019s indicators, as 34 The only partial exception concerns the GDI, in that the UNDP states that tests were conducting", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a789bf2d-1676-44db-a5e2-7a4ceae60f5a": {"__data__": {"id_": "a789bf2d-1676-44db-a5e2-7a4ceae60f5a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/01", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "269a47e629ef01791cfaae0bbb4e336a5e877194cacd50fdfcc3d0f1ac31853f"}}, "hash": "269a47e629ef01791cfaae0bbb4e336a5e877194cacd50fdfcc3d0f1ac31853f", "text": "to assess the impact of assigning different weights to the HDI\u2019s indicators (Haq 2003: 128). However, no results were reported and similar tests appear not to have been done with the GDI indicators proper. 35 The GDI\u2019s general conception of gender inequality could be seen as making it hard to understand, because it is not directly apparent whether inequalities favor men or women. But this problem of interpretation is resolved through an analysis of disaggregate level data. 27 pointed out above, include some indicators that address results more than opportunities. In addition, the GEM\u2019s inclusion of one of the same indicators used in the GDI\u2014Earned Income\u2014makes this contrast between opportunities and capabilities somewhat puzzling, explanations notwithstanding (UNDP 1995). Finally, since the GEM relies on the same general concept of gender equality as the GDI, this emphasis on women is misleading. To make sense of the GEM it helps to think of it as a measure that taps into some dimensions of the concept of human development not included in the GDI. But the distinction between the GEM and the GDI is not as neat as that between the GDI and the HDI. There is some overlap due to the inclusion of one common indicator. And, to make matters more complicated, there is also some overlap between the GDI and GEM in that the GEM follows the GDI in combining relational and absolute measures for one indicator but not for the others. Thus, it is not possible to interpret the GEM as a precise complement to the GDI. The GEI and GGGI are rather similar indices. Their creators do not explicitly state what concept is being measured. That is, though the indices advertize that they are measures of gender equality, they do not start out, as the GDI does, with a clearly formulated and well theorized concept and hence leave implicit what the index\u2019s overarching concept is. Thus, the best one can do is consider the conceptual dimensions of these indices and impute that they are measures of human development, as defined by the UNDP and interpret these indices as measures of development that conceptually subsume (especially in the case of the GGGI) both the GDI and the GEM. But there are two other key differences between the GEI and GGGI, on the one hand, and the GDI, on the other hand. One difference is that the GEI and GGGI, as their creators clearly state (Social Watch 2005; Hausmann, Tyson and Zahidi 2007), are measures of the situation of women relative to men that do not take into consideration the aggregate absolute situation of women and men. The other difference, somewhat ambiguously addressed by the index creators, is that the GEI and GGGI consider inequalities favoring men but exclude from their index any inequalities that favor women. Indeed, though Social Watch (2005) accurately argues that the GEI can be used to draw \u201cconclusions about critical deficiencies in what women are able or allowed to do\u201d, the name of their index\u2014the Gender Equity Index\u2014suggests that it is a measure of gender equity plain and simple. Likewise, the name of the World Economic Forum\u2019s index, the Global Gender Gap Index, is only somewhat accurate\u2014gender gaps can go in either direction\u2014and the creators of this index confusingly suggest that they are measuring gender equality broadly speaking when they prominently state that the GGGI is \u201ca tool for\u2026tracking global gender- based inequalities\u201d (Hausmann, Tyson and Zahidi 2007). Thus, in interpreting the GEI and 28 GGGI, it bears remembering that unlike the UNDP indices, these two indices measure the narrower concept of female disadvantages relative to men. Finally, the interpretability of the OECD\u2019s SIGI is hampered by other problems. The point of departure for the measurement of the SIGI is a critique of the narrowness of the indicators used by the other four indices and the intent to provide a measure that goes beyond the other indices is unambiguously stated. Indeed, the overarching concept of social institutions is elaborated sufficiently to make it clear how SIGI is an index that supplements the other indices (Jutting et al. 2008). Nonetheless, the interpretation of the SIGI is not straightforward. As the GEI and GGGI, the SIGI only considers inequalities favoring men. But it includes relational measures, based on a comparison of the rights of women relative to men, as well as absolute measures, of the rights of women that have no obvious male counterpart. Moreover, the lack of symmetry in the type of indicators and indicator scales makes it quite cumbersome to get a clear idea of what precisely is being measured.

How Well are Methodological Criteria Met? To answer the second question, how well do the indices stand up to the criteria we highlight in our methodological framework? it is important to highlight some strengths, including the reliance of well established distinctions to differentiate conceptual dimensions, the inclusion of indicators that incrementally tap into more aspects of gender, the use of indicators for which reliable data on most countries of the world are available, and the replicability of the aggregation process (see Table 5). In short, the valuable contributions made by the creators of indices with gender-differentiated data should be duly recognized. Succinctly put, these indices constitute a resource for the study of development and a range of rights, which has allowed analysts to portray gender disparities in a more comprehensive and integrated manner than was possible prior to 1995. However, a full answer to the second question must acknowledge several methodological weaknesses in all five indices. Problems were detected regarding the theorization of the index\u2019s overarching concept, the choice of indicators, the reliability of indicators, the aggregation procedure, and the lack of sensitivity analyses that are essential elements in the validation of measures. Indeed, some standard and basic methodological criteria are simply ignored. And these shortcomings are costly. In some cases, they make it difficult to interpret the indices clearly and see how these measures might be considered as partial but supplementary measures. And in all cases, they cast doubts about the quality of the 29 data that are produced with these measuring instruments. Undoubtedly, having an index, especially one of global empirical scope, is better than having none, even if the index suffers from methodological weaknesses. But users of these indices should be cautious when interpreting these indices\u2014they measure different things and are anything but interchangeable\u2014and when conveying the sense of confidence they have in the conclusions drawn from an analysis of these indices.36 36 Going beyond the methodological issues we addressed in this paper, we have serious reservations about using data on these indices as time series. Yearly data on all indicators are simply not available and in some cases the data on indicators used to calculate the index for a certain year can span up to 10 years. Nonetheless, the producers of these indices sometimes use their data to discuss address \u201cevolution and trends,\u201d to \u201ctrack progress over time\u201d and to identify \u201ccountries progressing and regressing\u201d (Hausmann, Tyson, and Zahidi 2007a; Social Watch 2005; 2008a). We would suggest that the data we currently have does not allow us to talk with confidence about trends over time. 30 4. Conclusion Cross-national data on the multiple aspects of gender has a growing relevance to a range of policy areas. In addition to their standard uses in academic research on the causes and consequences of gender inequality and other gender-related matters, these data are used as tools to set agendas, especially by raising awareness of problems, and to keep governments and a variety of organizations accountable, particularly by monitoring compliance with certain standards and goals. Moreover, beyond the fairly visible global initiatives mentioned in the introduction, there is evidence that in some world regions and countries, data on gender equality are becoming part of the policy process.37 These are undoubtedly positive indirect effects of the production of data, that confirm that there is something to the old saying, \u201cWhat gets measured gets done\u201d. But the use of data on gender also draws attention to the quality of the data and the need to both conduct evaluations of commonly used measures that differentiate by gender and to engage in efforts to generate better measures. Indeed, if the data that are used in the policy arena are questioned, the very legitimacy of using data in the pursuit of collective goals suffers. Thus, issues of measurement, though involving intricate methodological questions, are anything but merely academic curiosities. Rather, there are real stakes to getting measurement right. This paper has sought to contribute to this challenge through an assessment of five commonly used indices of nearly global scope, identifying three broad implications for further work in this area. First, we have emphasized the importance of taking measurement methodology seriously and, in particular, drawn attention to the need for an explicit methodological framework in work on measurement. Though the value of such a framework has been recognized in discussions of measures of development (Booysen 2002), current discussions of measures with gender-differentiated data do not rely on such a", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a999fee-2f23-4abc-9ac2-4fba4aa1183a": {"__data__": {"id_": "4a999fee-2f23-4abc-9ac2-4fba4aa1183a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/01", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "59898a0b8862e795ddc130cbd0a4a98bc205afc8dee082a171f604b37dd93c9b"}, "3": {"node_id": "997c346b-fc7b-4952-a47f-c62f03669eaf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/01", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c69f9fc79959a8970c9df0d64f7ba0ddf8dcd07a7c6f0eb25690e52d8f684c97"}}, "hash": "23f704f7204637f812c955f0a92881a12b3d18550c150de74e62767c74fb88af", "text": "framework. Yet, as we show, the meaning and validity of a measure can only be ascertained if consideration is given to the range of methodological choices highlighted in our framework as well as to the relationship among the different elements of a measuring instrument. Hence, future research on data that incorporates a gender perspective should build more explicitly on a broad and integrated methodological framework. Second, the assessment of indices provided in this paper has implications for users of these indices. The current availability of multiple indices is a great resource. But it also 37 Within the European Union, a gender equality index in currently under development (Plantenga, Figueiredo, Remery and Smith 2003). On the use of data on gender equality in the UK and Ireland, see Breitenbach and Galligan (2006). 31 creates a problem for users. Indeed, the availability of multiple indices\u2014which could support different conclusions\u2014places a burden on users to offer a rationale for opting for one index over the others. That is, before putting a measure to substantive use, it is necessary to understand what each index actually measures, a more complicated matter than may seem at first sight, and to assess how valid and reliable these measures are. Thus, our assessment, briefly summarized in section 3, serves the immediate purpose of clarifying how the five reviewed indices should be interpreted and how much confidence we should have in them\u2014 two critical matters which have not always been well-addressed by the producers of indices that rely on gender-differentiated data. Finally, as this paper illustrates, the development of measures is an incremental process in which a lot of the learning comes from doing and necessarily making mistakes. Thus, it is critical that researchers acknowledge the uncertainty they have regarding their data and the need to make changes to improve the quality of the available data. Admittedly, it is not always easy to make such an admission when the data are used in a policy environment, given that policy makers tend to equate quantitative data with science and science with certainty. And unwilling to make changes\u2014making a change is akin to admitting error\u2014is a common occurrence in data initiatives that have a large institutional backing. But this conservatism is unwarranted. To be sure, data producers who are interested in having an impact on policy must offer sufficient justification to warrant the judgment that the quality of their data that is good enough to be used at the present in the public sphere. But such a commitment to act responsibly is not weakened by a public recognition that the data, not despite being knowledge-produced through a scientific method but precisely because it is a product of a scientific method, is open to debate and subject to revision in the future. 32 Bibliography Abdullah, Rashidah. 2000.

E-mail: kmenonsen@gmail.com 2 Abstract Since the Fourth World Conference on Women (1995), gender mainstreaming has been almost universally endorsed as the strategy of choice for the achievement of gender equality and women's human rights. Governments, donor agencies, civil society organisations, women's movements and other international and national actors in development have worked to actualise the commitment to gender mainstreaming mandated by the Beijing Platform for Action. However, despite the sustained investments in mainstreaming by all actors in development and considerable progress in terms of enabling policy frameworks, there is general agreement that translating gender mainstreaming policy objectives into real-life outcomes is fraught with challenges and contradictions.

Governments, donor agencies, civil society organisations, women's movements and other international and national actors in development have worked to actualise the commitment to gender mainstreaming mandated by the Beijing Platform for Action. However, despite the sustained investments in mainstreaming by all actors in development and considerable progress in terms of enabling policy frameworks, there is general agreement that translating gender mainstreaming policy objectives into real-life outcomes is fraught with challenges and contradictions. This paper presents a critical review of the gender mainstreaming experience in the Asia- Pacific region. It is not the outcome of an academic exercise, but is focused on highlighting the complex issues involved in interpreting concepts and implementing strategies at the field level. The first section of the paper presents a brief overview of the historical origins of gender mainstreaming and its location within the larger canvas of development. The basic conceptual framework that underpins the approach is discussed with a focus on its political moorings in feminist theory and its normative grounding in discourses on women's rights, human rights and human development. The second section of the paper reviews the insights and lessons from the global experience of diverse actors, counterposing these against experiences in the Asia-Pacific region to assess the extent to which they reflect an understanding of mainstreaming as social transformation. The final section surveys the pros and cons of the mainstreaming approach and presents some possibilities for strengthening its potential as a vehicle for achievement of women's rights and gender equality. 1. GENDER MAINSTREAMING: THE CONCEPT 1.1 The evolution of an approach The much-used (and sometimes abused) term gender mainstreaming made a formal entry into the official development discourse at the Fourth World Conference on Women, Beijing, 1995, where it was endorsed as the appropriate mechanism for achieving the goals of gender equality and empowerment of women. The Beijing Platform for Action document enjoins national governments and other actors in development to \u201cpromote an active and visible policy of mainstreaming a gender perspective in all policies and programmes so that, before decisions are taken, an analysis is made of the effects on women and men, respectively.\u201d1 Subsequently, the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) reaffirmed the need for the international development community to take action on gender mainstreaming, which was described as follows.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "508c7fe3-da03-4055-b58a-a2fde3a5eda8": {"__data__": {"id_": "508c7fe3-da03-4055-b58a-a2fde3a5eda8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/02", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/02", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/02", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "30f5da461f4ffcc0943c35b4a2bcf460eb21b9a0b50b858a49cee4646446553b"}, "2": {"node_id": "fa67bec4-df81-4dd8-be14-94a99db4502f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/02", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "40dde1ae242409ced9d1427c3faeea49f3c6ab03adabca394bfe6620fcd74643"}}, "hash": "d9975ab99689884488853c23dabde08d125e331d0f4126ac5cf3a549c060d1a0", "text": "\u201cMainstreaming a gender perspective is the process of assessing the implications for women and men of any planned action, including legislation, policies or programmes, in all areas and at all levels.

See United Nations 1996. 4 not perpetuated. The ultimate goal is to achieve gender equality.\u201d2 While it remains the benchmark for the UN System and most development actors, this definition is not without its own internal contradictions (Box 1). In the years since Beijing, affirmations of gender mainstreaming have become ubiquitous in the development sector. All major multilateral and bilateral agencies have put in place policy frameworks and programmes for gender mainstreaming. National governments in most countries have established \u201cwomen's machineries\u201d and administrative mechanisms for mainstreaming. Clear intergovernmental mandates for gender mainstreaming have been developed for all the major areas of the work of the United Nations, including disarmament, poverty reduction, crisis prevention and recovery, macro-economics, health, education and trade. The UN Security Council Resolution 1325, adopted in October 2000, outlines the importance of giving greater attention to gender perspectives in peace support operations.3 Specific mandates also exist for ensuring that gender perspectives are taken into account in the major planning processes and documents within the United Nations including the medium-term plans, programme budgets and programme assessments4. 1.2 Historical progression of approaches to gender in development The conceptual framework for gender mainstreaming evolved from critiques of the \u201cwomen in development\u201d (WID) approaches and programmes implemented since the early 1970s by several international development agencies. Questions regarding the impacts of these programmes gathered momentum during the UN Decade of Women. The consensus was that while many of these stand- alone projects were innovative and well-designed, they had largely failed to challenge or change the hierarchies of power and privilege that lay at the root of women's marginalisation from 2 ECOSOC 1997. See the Agreed Conclusions on Mainstreaming the Gender Perspective into all Policies and Programs in the United Nations System. 3 United Nations Security Council 2000. 4 See United Nations General Assembly 1997 for the Resolution of December 1997 (A/Res/52/100) and ECOSOC (2001) for Resolution of 2001(2001/41). Box 1: The ECOSOC definition: Feminist ideologies versus realpolitik? The ECOSOC definition of gender mainstreaming is politically significant because it frames gender inequality as a structural, rather than a \u201ccultural\u201d problem. By implicitly recognising that gender biases in current policies and programmes are implicated in the reproduction of gender inequality, this definition validates feminist analyses of the structural roots of gender inequality. However, by placing the onus for change on regular policy makers, the ECOSOC definition creates both opportunities and hazards. The rooting in feminist analysis is counterbalanced by the need to \u201csell\u201d the notion to mainstream actors. Thus, the ECOSOC definition and strategies derived from it are framed in a way that is meaningful to the policy elite such as civil servants and politicians. For instance, the ECOSOC definition can be (and often has been) read as an assurance that gender mainstreaming gives equal weightage at all times to both women and men \u2013 an interpretation that depoliticises and blunts its strategic edge. In fact, the framing of the definition in terms of the differential interests of \u201cmen\u201d and \u201cwomen\u201d can be traced back to the fierce opposition from religious and pro-life groups at Beijing to the idea of gender as a social and relational category, rather than an essentially biological phenomenon. 5 development5. This marginalisation was reinforced through the institutional arrangements for the implementation of \u201cwomen's projects\u201d which remained ghettoised in WID Units and national women's machineries that were often under-resourced, poorly staffed and peripherally located within the larger institutional framework6. The failure or, at best, limited success of efforts to \u201cintegrate\u201d women into ongoing development projects made it increasingly clear that the terms and conditions of participation in development were very different for women and men. Evidence to substantiate this view came from feminist scholars and women's movement activists across the world. For instance, feminist economists challenged the notion of the household as an altruistic economic unit that operated to maximise benefits for all its members.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bb8e05d0-5ca5-4198-923f-b8862d731907": {"__data__": {"id_": "bb8e05d0-5ca5-4198-923f-b8862d731907", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/02", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/02", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/02", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b0e658e43832515a6f8d326da3bcfcfddad36f12d07bd740d920c9e993091d1e"}, "2": {"node_id": "164a9e7f-813f-42cb-9fd6-840cafb80a74", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/02", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a2ab9ed2f846edda023a6cfdf8fbe2843c5dceb19141c0d5781c0cafec34a649"}}, "hash": "a4ca7d4b0f72bbbed913b937fa11682b78aa6ca968b9cadaf904a471cfbb8069", "text": "The ideological underpinnings and macroeconomic implications of women's unpaid and care work were painstakingly unravelled7, as were the links between gendered patterns of division of labour within the household and job stratification, wage disparities and exploitation of women's labour in the world of work8 At the same time, feminist activism was \u201cbreaking the silence\u201d on violence against women, exposing hidden sites and forms of violence such as sexual violence by intimate partners and families, incest, child sexual abuse and violence against women who transgressed heterosexual norms.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e6c54a6-8767-452e-b59b-1474eee4033c": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e6c54a6-8767-452e-b59b-1474eee4033c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/02", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/02", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/02", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a51fde1e6793b65a96d2f7126f06fbcb1c1bbd35c579052f3b393a73bbf014ed"}}, "hash": "a51fde1e6793b65a96d2f7126f06fbcb1c1bbd35c579052f3b393a73bbf014ed", "text": "Violence against women was exposed as a constitutive element of patriarchy and the framing of violence was a \u201cprivate\u201d issue was demolished through making visible institutionalised mechanisms of violence such as discriminatory legal frameworks and coercive population policies9. Women's movements from the global South were also pointing to the inadequacy of existing development paradigms with their implicit construction of women as a homogenous group, ignoring the ways in which other markers of inequality, such as class, race and caste, shape institutional gender relations.10 These critiques of dominant development paradigms were counterposed with demands for an alternative approach that recognised and addressed the social relations and institutions within which gender inequality was constructed and reconstructed.11 An alternative approach that emerged through these debates is characterised as the \u201cgender in development\u201d (GAD) approach. GAD analysis goes beyond women's exclusion from development, and trains the lens on the entire landscape of social, economic and political structures and institutions in a given society that subordinate women and ultimately lead to exclusion. The GAD framework emphasises that ending women\u2019s subordination requires more than the redistribution of economic resources \u2013 rather, it involves the redistribution of power. Drawing on the theoretical foundations of radical feminism, GAD underlines the way in which sexual difference is transmuted into gender inequality and woven seamlessly into social, political and economic structures, practices, discourses and relations in the context of particular societies. GAD frames development programmes not just as conduits to meet material needs, but as vehicles to engage women and men as agents in transforming gender relations, thereby creating more lasting and sustainable change. Arguments for \u201cinstitutionalisation\u201d of gender concerns through a GAD approach gained force as reviews by key actors threw up evidence to show that development agencies and 5 Razavi and Miller 1995a. 6 Jahan 1997 7 Waring 1988. 8 Elson and Pearson 1981. 9 Kabeer 1994. 10 Mohanty 1991. 11 Sen and Grown 1985. 6 development projects reflected and replicated the same institutional mechanisms through which women's subordination is perpetuated in society12. The clear implication was that delivering on gender equality in programmes and projects would require development organisations to reorder their own structures and practices to reflect a greater degree of gender equality. Table 1 summarises the main distinguishing features of the WID and GAD frameworks. Table 1: WID and GAD - A comparison WID GAD Focuses exclusively on women. Compares situations of women and men to identify differentials in access, participation and benefits. Focuses on the gender relations that generate such differences. Problem analysis: \u2022 Women's lack of participation in development; \u2022 Women's lack of capability and experience to compete equally with men. Problem analysis: \u2022 Gender inequality; \u2022 Unequal power relations between women and men that constrain women's participation in development; \u2022 Lack of recognition by policy makers of the extent to which women are engaged in development but on an unpaid and undocumented basis. Responses: \u2022 Training and capacity building to enable women to compete equally with men; \u2022 Developing new activities for women to increase their role in development; \u2022 Special projects for women. Responses: \u2022 The use of gender statistics: sex- disaggregated data showing the differences between women and men, and data on specific gender issues such as counting and valuing unpaid work; \u2022 Gender training to raise awareness of gender issues and the extent to which they affect policies and programmes; \u2022 The use of gender analysis to identify differential impacts on women and men and to develop measures to address such differences. 1.3 Mainstreaming: A radical concept Gender mainstreaming is the primary strategy for translating the GAD framework into action. Conceptually, it represents an advance from other right-focused strategies for gender equality such as equal treatment under the law and targeted equality policies. By interrogating social institutions and development actors, the mainstreaming approach shifts the focus from manifestations of gender inequality (such as discriminatory laws and unequal access to resources) to its structural underpinnings (see Table 2). 12 Goetz 1997. 7 Table 2: Comparison of strategies for gender equality STRATEGY DIAGNOSIS What is wrong?

As an influential \u201cthink piece\u201d from the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA)13 pointed out, an effective gender mainstreaming strategy should initiate and sustain change processes at multiple levels: \u2022 The organisation itself \u2013 its policies, procedures, culture and people. \u2022 The development interventions supported by the organisation, which lie within the intersection of its own work with the work of its partners. \u2022 The larger national context, including the socio-economic, cultural and political environment in the country; the policies and programmes of development partners; and the perspectives and strategies of the women\u2019s movements and other civil society actors. It is now generally accepted that gender mainstreaming involves changes in both \u201cinternal\u201d organisational functioning and \u201cexternal\u201d operational procedures. Internal action is required to align the systems, structures and procedures of the organisation with the goals and values of gender equality. These may include changes in staffing and personnel policies, such as hiring more women or appointing women to leadership positions, as well as changing the \u201cculture\u201d of the organisation to make the workplace an arena where both women and men can experience equality. The \u201cexternal\u201d dimension generally refers to the steps needed to mainstream gender into development 13 Schalkwyk et al. 1996. 8 operations such as design, implementation and evaluation of programmes and projects. These steps may include integrating gender equality concerns into programmatic goals, strategies and resource allocations, as well as providing specialized gender technical input such as gender analysis and assistance for the design, implementation and evaluation phases. The internal dimension can be further disaggregated and conceptualised as playing out in different domains14. \u2022 The technical domain is constituted of the capacities, tools and instruments for gender mainstreaming. Gender experts, guidelines and tools for integrating gender into the project cycle, gender training modules and materials are all located within this domain. \u2022 The political domain is the site for integration of gender equality concerns into processes of planning and decision-making within the organization. Within this domain hierarchies are institutionalised - in turn, this determines access and control over resources and decision- making in the organisation. \u2022 The cultural domain is the arena in which the environment and daily practice of the organisation are defined, shaped and validated. While processes in this domain may not be guided by clearly articulated rules and procedures, they are nonetheless critical to gender mainstreaming. Since it is in this domain that the gap between policy and practice is created, it is also the space where it can be negotiated and contested. Each of these domains is intricately linked to the others. In turn, each domain and the system as a whole are influenced by multiple factors in the external environment \u2013 national development agendas, global discourses, civil society, women\u2019s movements, donor priorities and geo-political processes and issues. Power relations are woven into each domain and are manifested in different ways. In the political domain power is visible in forms of leadership, in the ability to influence processes of decision-making, in the creation and maintenance of hierarchies and the control of resources and priorities. In the technical domain, unequal power relations are reflected in the ways in which concepts, discourses and methodologies are defined and shaped \u2013 in deciding what is \u201cvalid\u201d and what is not, what is \u2018sound\u2019 and what is not, what is \u2018objective\u2019 and what is not. In the cultural domain value systems, attitudes, and relationships all reflect power relations that perpetuate gender inequality. It is the ability to make these power hierarchies visible while interrogating their impacts on gender equality that provides a critical edge to the mainstreaming approach. Ironically, this is also the reason why mainstreaming attracts distrust, hostility and resistance from institutional actors who feel that the immediate costs of such a radical approach may well outweigh its long-term benefits. 1.4 From politics to development: Mainstreaming, human rights and human development At first glance, it appears surprising that concepts as radical in their intentions as GAD and gender mainstreaming have gained such wide acceptability in development circles. Campaigns mounted by international women's movements in the lead-up to the Beijing conference can certainly claim a major share of the credit for this. However, the success of women's rights advocates within the development establishment in linking gender mainstreaming with a range of collateral benefits \u2013 from political stability and economic growth to environmental sustainability -", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d9e9fa33-73ec-40a9-b8b1-62707cf93996": {"__data__": {"id_": "d9e9fa33-73ec-40a9-b8b1-62707cf93996", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/02", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/02", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/02", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "53cce3394392c4999fbb019169f51278f3db43ee692c19589e79d38ae3ec5413"}}, "hash": "53cce3394392c4999fbb019169f51278f3db43ee692c19589e79d38ae3ec5413", "text": "must also be 14 Menon-Sen 2005. 9 recognised. The Beijing Platform for Action proclaimed: \u201cThe advancement of women and the achievement of equality between women and men are ... the only way to build a sustainable, just and developed society.\u201d15 In 2000, promoting \u2018gender equality\u2019 was identified as a key component of the UN\u2019s Millennium Development Goals. UN Resolution 1325, which declared that the empowerment of women was critical to the processes of both peacemaking and democratisation, has affirmed this view. Another key element that increases the acceptability of gender mainstreaming for development agencies is its complementarity to the human rights-based approach. Both strive to ensure greater equality and both involve an interrogation of the impact of development activities on different individuals and groups, particularly the most marginalised and disempowered in a given society. The overarching normative validation for gender mainstreaming as a strategy for women's rights is the Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), which constitutes a comprehensive bill of rights for women. CEDAW is based on three inter-related core principles \u2013 equality, non-discrimination and state obligation for securing women's rights. CEDAW has been described as an effective convergence between the human rights stream and the gender in development stream, since mainstreaming is a necessary precondition for effective implementation of CEDAW16. Gender mainstreaming is also congruent with the concept of human development, pioneered by UNDP in its Human Development Reports. The human development approach conceptualises development as the broadening of people\u2019s choices, created by expanding \u201ccapabilities\u201d. Central to the notion of capability is the ability to live a long and healthy life, to be well nourished and clothed, to be knowledgeable, and to have access to the resources and opportunities that ensure an adequate standard of living. Other less quantifiable capabilities include the ability to have self- esteem, to be treated with dignity, to be able to be connected\u2014that is to be able to care, to be cared for, and to be free of systematic social exclusion due to discrimination or other factors. It includes too the freedom to have a voice in economic, social and political arenas: to be empowered and to exhibit agency. In this approach inequality is seen as an \u201cunfreedom\u201d because it contributes to social exclusion and can lead to disempowerment, lack of political and economic voice, and possibly to the undermining of other basic capabilities. It is important to recognise that mainstreaming alone cannot deliver gender equality. Claiming rights is a political process, and requires the active agency of women themselves in challenging and changing the structures and institutions that underpin unequal power relations. Agency \u2013 the ability to act as an agent of change \u2013 is itself an outcome of a process of empowerment, whereby which women acquire the capacities and capabilities to make choices and act on those choices to achieve valued ways of being and doing. Empowerment can also be a route to (as well as outcome of) women's political mobilisation at the grassroots which in turn can lead to women's gaining a public voice and demanding change in institutions and structures of governance17. Prugl (2004) points out that equal rights/empowerment and gender mainstreaming can both be conceptualised as strategies to change discourses and rules. Both seek to construct women and men as having equal value but differ in the means to accomplish this reconstruction of identities and rights. Whereas equal rights strategies focus on formal rules with attendant enforcement mechanisms, gender mainstreaming targets the deeply entrenched informal rules and uncodified or 15 See United Nations 1996. 16 O\u2019Neill 2004. 17 Kabeer 1999. 10 invisible norms within institutions. Whereas rights strategies rely on the policing powers of the state, gender mainstreaming relies on the power of bureaucracy to define and categorise discrimination. Both these strategies depend for their success on women's movements. While strategies to change laws involve advocacy through pressure groups positioned in opposition to the state, gender mainstreaming relies on the skill of movement actors to operate within the state. A comprehensive framework has been proposed by Rao and Kelleher (2000) to explain how human rights can provide a normative and ethical basis for \u201ctop down\u201d processes such as policy reform through gender mainstreaming, as well as for \u201cbottom up\u201d processes of women's mobilisation, empowerment and gaining voice (Figure 1). This framework is a useful one in the context of gender mainstreaming because it clarifies the links between institutional change and social change strategies.

This framework provides the conceptual grounding for working on \u201csupply side\u201d issues such as opportunity structures, incentives and capacity to respond to women, as well as on \u201cdemand side\u201d issues such as strengthening women\u2019s awareness of their own agency, voice and collective power to hold institutions to account. Gender mainstreaming has the potential to contribute to this process through changes in the relations of power within both formal and informal development institutions and institutions of governance, thereby creating the space and opportunities for women to contribute to and influence development discourse and practice. 11 1.5 Definitions and interpretations: Multiple meanings? As discussed above, diverse strands of critique and enquiry have contributed to the evolution of gender mainstreaming as an approach, with the consequence that it is defined and interpreted in multiple ways18. Moreover, the boundaries between WID, GAD and mainstreaming are neither watertight nor well-defined. The field today presents a wide range of practices, from WID-like \u201cintegrationist\u201d approaches that seek to \u201cfit\u201d gender concerns within existing development interventions, to \u201ctransformative\u201d or \u201cagenda-setting\u201d approaches premised on a complete overhaul of the existing development agenda from a gender equality perspective19. Although the ECOSOC definition is internationally accepted as the macro template for gender mainstreaming, other agencies have adapted and modified it to reflect their own operational concerns. For instance, WHO defines mainstreaming as \u201cthe integration of gender concerns into the analyses, formulation and monitoring of policies, programmes and projects, with the objective of ensuring that these reduce inequalities.\u201d20 The World Bank gender strategy document describes the aims of gender mainstreaming as \u201cmaking Bank interventions more responsive to country gender conditions and commitments; making these interventions more strategic; and improving the alignment of Bank policies, processes and resources to support such interventions.\u201d21 A presentation on gender mainstreaming archived on the UNDP website22 provides a simple and functional three point definition that distinguishes between the process of gender mainstreaming (organisational change), its outputs (gender aware policy and practice) and goals (gender equality in society). Lack of the \u2018process\u2019 element is identified as the shortfall in other current definitions, leading to incomplete actions and confusion between the means and ends of mainstreaming. An additional complication is created by the fact that, although gender mainstreaming is universally recognised as a strategy to achieve gender equality, the understanding of what constitutes equality can vary widely. There is also confusion regarding the terms \u201cequity\u201d and \u201cequality\u201d (Box 2). Box 2: Equality and/or equity: Contested notions The terms \u2018gender equality\u2019 and \u2018gender equity\u2019 are often used interchangeably. Although there are overlaps, these are distinct concepts. Equality is sameness or uniformity. It is also understood as impartiality. In law, a conventional interpretation of equality implies \u2018treating likes alike\u2019 or non- discrimination. Social equality means all people have the same status in respect of specific rights and obligations like property, voting, security, speech, health or education. Equity is understood differently based on the context. Like equality, equity is also defined as fairness, impartiality. Equity can be on the fringes of law or even outside it. It is sometimes understood as legal principles supplementary to stricter formal laws that might operate too rigidly to obtain \u2018natural justice\u2019. The concern is with a state of justice rather than being technically legal. 18 Mukhopadhya et al. 2006. 19 Jahan 1995. 20 WHO 1998. 21 World Bank 2002. 22 UNDP n.d. 12 It appears that equity is consistent with policies based on proportionality rules or principles based on \u201cequitable inequalities\u201d to take account of (compensate for) existing needs and capacities. On the other hand equality implies similarity of one thing with another in quality and quantity. Corrective mechanisms against cumulative and existing inequalities, therefore, look for polices of affirmative action, and often push for arguments for \u201ctreating equals equally and unequals unequally\u201d. While these ideas are fairly clear in addressing economic inequalities or in devolution of resources, they are much less so in applying them to gender gaps.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3e5e4658-9625-4982-8470-8494a57ab2e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "3e5e4658-9625-4982-8470-8494a57ab2e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/02", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/02", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/02", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e77962dc84c367393ab0b96f6342708577056810a9329c6b7f3e22b8e18baa4d"}, "2": {"node_id": "c3748fb1-fd67-4c21-ab5e-5d72edb3cae4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/02", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fee67744916d09c4d7bc74cf1d3ee1ffe4ccc6e91bcfa02534163c9e01cf7100"}}, "hash": "6b7650c1ce943b602f89f0394330c616efdaa19b8a68e21540a5cfcf1b3d0ee4", "text": "Critics of equity principles in the context of gender argue that equity allows discretionary standards in which interests are presumably \u201cbalanced\u201d \u2013 generally resulting in the preservation of patriarchal power in all respects.

From a theoretical perspective, only the third model has the potential to deliver gender justice because this is the only one that involves the institutional transformation necessary for effective equality, while the first two models clearly retain the standards of the gendered status quo. In contrast, development agencies would probably take the view that all three models fall within the realm of gender mainstreaming. Corner (1999) makes the useful point that mainstreaming embraces two different but related aspects - \u201cmainstreaming women\u201d and \u201cmainstreaming gender\u201d. Although the notion of \u201cmainstreaming gender\u201d is derived from GAD, it is prone to being interpreted in purely technical terms (gender disaggregated data, gender analysis, gender training) and is therefore less controversial. On the other hand, \u201cmainstreaming women\u201d represents the more political aspect of mainstreaming, and implies women's equal participation not just as beneficiaries, but as active players in all decision-making processes. 2. GENDER MAINSTREAMING: THE EXPERIENCE TO DATE 2.1 The global \u201cstate of play\u201d In the years since Beijing, a number of reviews have been carried out to assess the impacts and outcomes of efforts at gender mainstreaming, most of them at the initiative of international development agencies. Most contributors to a recent comprehensive collection23seem to share a sense of disappointment at the way in which the original conceptualisation of mainstreaming as a political process of reordering hierarchies of power and transforming development agendas, has been depoliticised and \u201cdumbed down\u201d by the very actors who are vocal in advocating for it. For 23 Porter and Sweetman 2005. 13 instance, a recent review of UN agencies24 found that many had not even taken the first step of carrying out gender analysis of policies and programs. Overall, though, most development agencies have moved from exclusion of women to treating them as a marginalised group with special needs and interests. This is equivalent to the integrationist approach, criticised by feminists as the \u201cadd gender and stir\u201d formula where the norms continue to be set with reference to men, while unequal social relations and women's real strategic interests - through which they can achieve change in their positions in society - are both ignored. Thus, instead of gender mainstreaming leading to transformation of the mainstream, the notion of gender equality has itself been depoliticised in the course of its engagement with the mainstream25. There is a striking similarity in the findings of a wide range of different studies and reviews of progress on gender mainstreaming - whether of international agencies, national governments or NGOs \u2013 over the last decade. Jahan (1997) listed lack of accountability measures, lack of tracking of policy implementation, and gaps between mandates and resources as critical barriers in four major international agencies. An AusAID review26 found that continuing conceptual confusions between WID and GAD hampered the environment for implementation of gender mainstreaming. In a review of mainstreaming in 14 international agencies, Moser and Moser (2005) found that although all of them had adopted the terminology of gender and gender mainstreaming and put the appropriate policy frameworks in place, effective implementation was hampered by lack of conceptual clarity, limited internal capacities, weak accountability mechanisms, inadequate monitoring and \u201ccultural\u201d resistance from within the organisation. Similar studies on institutional frameworks for gender mainstreaming in global organisations - such as one by Razavi and Miller (1995b) of the ILO, the World Bank and UNDP - have reached the same conclusions. A 2005 global study of national machineries for women conducted by the UN Division for the Advancement of Women (DAW) in the lead-up to the Beijing Plus Ten review notes a number of challenges that have persisted since 1995. These include: lack of political will and leadership, lack of stability in terms of their position within the government, limitations of human resources and finances, poor coordination with civil society and other government departments, and inadequate mechanisms for accountability, data collection and monitoring mechanisms27. Many of these constraints have continued to put brakes on gender mainstreaming despite being repeatedly identified as key areas for change. For instance, the issues raised by the global evaluation of gender mainstreaming in UNDP28 are almost the same as those underlined in 1998 by Schalkwyk29 - lack of conceptual clarity on gender, limited understanding and skills of programme staff, lack of commitment from managers and leadership, weak mechanisms for tracking and accountability, lack of space and support for learning", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9bb4fb9b-8609-4b70-97ff-49d5b7a09161": {"__data__": {"id_": "9bb4fb9b-8609-4b70-97ff-49d5b7a09161", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/02", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/02", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/02", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e30876c5e0a6360ce7b0f81e9e92da559fa7a91b96f85f7eb6530af71573d449"}, "3": {"node_id": "ed33297c-961d-4dd8-9059-601ebdda38ce", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/02", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1995070b762af4569d79b6525cd57e16a6f3b6cf4b3a6eab1efb901959b33bab"}}, "hash": "b327aa893740526e4e0f24ccaea59527c519a3ba2f059221fbf4e204d53668ab", "text": "and sharing lessons and inadequate allocation of financial resources for gender mainstreaming.

These were also the issues highlighted in the AusAID review31. In all these situations, the lack of accountability mechanisms and a culture of lip-service to political correctness fuel the phenomenon of \u201cpolicy evaporation\u201d32. Efforts, no matter how well-meant, to broad-base responsibility for mainstreaming across organisational units have often led to situations where gender is seen as \u201ceveryone's task and nobody's responsibility\u201d33. For instance, when the Dutch government attempted to mainstream gender in the policy-making process, all gender equality offices at the local level were closed down. As a result, accountability was diffused and equality policies disappeared from local government.34 A decadal review of the mainstreaming experience in DFID found that gender equality policies focused on programmes in social sectors with little attention given to gender in programmes for economic opportunities and decision-making. While several good approaches had been piloted by the agency, these were not consistently applied. Evidence on \u2018policy evaporation\u2019 was inconclusive, with the availability and quality of evidence declining from programme planning, through commitments and expenditures to the implementation and organisational levels. The review suggested that the benefits of gender mainstreaming in terms of its impacts on gender equality were \u201cat best embryonic and at worst still to become visible.\u201d35 In analysing her experience as a technical consultant on gender mainstreaming, das Pradhan (2004) points to the composition of the international pool of expertise in key sectors as a barrier to integration of gender concerns into technical projects. International agencies usually look for consultants with the seniority and credibility to engage at policy levels in the recipient country. This criterion privileges active senior public servants, former senior public servants and academics. While these specialists may be highly competent and skilled in their particular field of expertise, many international technical specialists, particularly those who fit the \u2018status\u2019 criteria, do not have either developing country experience or gender expertise. In addition to these apparently ubiquitous barriers to implementation of gender mainstreaming, Mitchell (2004) has pointed to the daunting scale and scope of the concept as articulated by UN agencies, and suggests that failure is inevitable since the bar of expectations is set too high. In the same vein, Brenner (2009) suggests that the difficulty of implementing mainstreaming reflects the inability of feminists to back up their critiques of mainstream development with pragmatic \u201csolutions\u201d. The holistic and transformative aims of gendered approaches to development, such as mainstreaming, therefore remain aspirational and have proved difficult if not impossible to realise in practice. 2.2 The Asian experience Even a cursory review of the literature on the Asian experience of gender mainstreaming is enough to highlight the fact that a lack of consensus on the interpretation and implications of the term make it difficult if not impossible to reach any general conclusions on the overall \u201csuccess\u201d or \u201cfailure\u201d of the approach. 30 Painter and Ulmer 2002. 31 AusAID 2002. 32 Longwe Sara 1995. 33 Mehra and Rao Gupta 2006. 34 Verloo 2001. 35 Watkins 2004. 15 It is clear from the literature that the term \u201cgender mainstreaming\u201d is applied to a continuum of approaches and strategies for women's rights and/or gender equality, with integrationist approaches at one end and \u201ctransformative\u201d interventions at the other.

Develop technical capacity - develop manuals and guidelines, prepare trainers and train planners and programme staff in the use of gender analysis, gender statistics, gender budgeting and gender auditing. 2. Institutionalise women's participation - advocate and implement measures such as affirmative action or quotas to increase women's roles in decision making, particularly in politics, leadership and governance. 3. Institutionalise gender mainstreaming - issue regulations etc to ensure the use of gender tools for planning and programming; appoint gender focal points and specialists to support gender mainstreaming. 3. Social capacity building - change work & social arrangements, as well as attitudes & behaviours, so that women can operate on an equal basis with men in the mainstream. 4. Policy advocacy - influence policy makers at the highest levels to mainstream a gender perspective in macroeconomic, finance and trade policy, and in political affairs. 4. Capacity building for men - change men's gender attitudes, eliminate gender-based violence, and enhance men's capacity to share unpaid domestic and caring work more equally with women. 16 2.2.1 Gender mainstreaming in economic development The literature on gender mainstreaming in economic development is dominated by \u201cintegrationist\u201d interventions. Diverse strategies have been adopted to increase women's participation in paid work and to bring women into specific sectors of the economy. For instance, Malaysia and the Philippines have adopted policies and programmes aimed at facilitating the entry of women into exporting and to assist existing women exporters and entrepreneurs36. Research has been undertaken in Viet Nam to identify agricultural machinery that best meets the needs and economic situation of women farmers37. There are a few examples of projects that have tried to bring women into sectors that are generally considered gender-neutral38. Thus, the ADB-funded Khulna-Jessore Drainage Rehabilitation Project in Bangladesh contracted landless women\u2019s societies for construction work and recruited women into user groups designed to oversee operations and management. Similar success is claimed for the Bangladesh Rural Infrastructure Development Project, aimed at economic and social development through improving roads, bridges and culverts, tree-planting, construction of local government complexes and improvements to rural markets (including construction of \u201cwomen\u2019s sections\u201d). According to an internal review, \u201cmainstreaming gender enabled over 2,000 women to obtain steady employment and wages for the duration of the project; increased business skills and opportunities for women in retail; enhanced women\u2019s mobility and self-confidence; and improved household living standards, nutrition and education for children.\u201d39 Interventions such as these, rooted in a vision of equality based on \u201ccatching up\u201d or \u201cclosing the gap\u201d between women and men, are essentially efforts to include women in mainstream development regardless of the gendered nature of the mainstream. Such projects take little account of the fact that globalisation and structural changes in the economic environment in the countries of the region are impacting women's economic activities in several ways. Thus, the focus on women entrepreneurs in some countries has served to shift attention away from the situation of an increasingly vulnerable female labour force in these countries. Increased access to paid employment in export-oriented industries is often cited as a successful example of mainstreaming, even if the quality of this employment is questionable. Women\u2019s enterprises have been supported through trade promotion activities, but women are often concentrated in sub-sectors that have been adversely impacted by globalisation. For instance, a review of an aquaculture project for women project found that women\u2019s gains in small-scale aquaculture were jeopardised because investment is concentrated towards large-scale aquaculture activities where women are poorly represented40. Microcredit programmes for women's economic empowerment are a standard element of gender mainstreaming in many poverty programmes.

Moreover, the overwhelming focus on microcredit has reduced the resources flowing to other programmes with potentially empowering outcomes, such as adult literacy programmes. 2.2.2 Gender mainstreaming in public finance and public policy The limited technical capacities of women's movements and national machineries for women (such as women's departments and women's bureaux) have hampered efforts to mainstream gender equality into public finance and public policy. Interventions in this sector have had mixed results. A study42 of the impact of the Paris Declaration on aid effectiveness, gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment in Indonesia, Nepal and Papua New Guinea found that all three countries have made ongoing efforts to strengthen public finance management systems and promote performance based management by linking development strategies to annual and multi-annual budget processes. While some progress has been achieved in integration of gender equality priorities in national development and poverty reduction strategies, there has been general evaporation of the gains when it comes to the integration of specific targets and indicators in the results and budgeting frameworks. While there has been a notable opening of policy spaces for civil society and local community participation in national development planning processes, especially in Nepal and Indonesia, the study points to the need for strengthening the capacities and empowering women\u2019s machineries and gender equality advocates to enable them to participate effectively. The study found that where gender equality priorities are not adequately mainstreamed in national development plans and budgets, there is a risk that gender equality will evaporate in policies supported through development assistance. While gender mainstreaming is often perceived as a donor agenda, the analysis of donor policies and programmes in the three countries covered in the UNIFEM study reveals limited support for gender equality priorities despite strong national commitments in Indonesia and Nepal. Very few donor-supported projects integrate gender equality as their key priority. In addition the implementation of programme-based approaches including Direct Budget Support and Sector Wide Approaches has often resulted in shrinking of spaces for innovative mechanisms for financing gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. Harmonization in terms of common arrangements for funding, monitoring and reporting among donors remains very limited in all three countries. As a result there is a general lack of institutionalised donor and government coordination mechanisms in support for gender equality43. Despite the above constraints, efforts undertaken to strengthen public finance management systems provide an opportunity to \u2018en-gender\u2019 government budgets, which can provide a strategic entry point for making macroeconomic policies more gender aware. Gender budgeting seeks to transform macroeconomic frameworks by getting government to look at economy and society through a gender lens. Gender budgeting can also be a tool in challenging many of the basic assumptions of conventional poverty analysis by making visible issues such as intra-household disparities and the contribution to the economy of women's unpaid work44. Since budget analysis involves all government ministries and departments, it provides a 41 Menon-Sen 2003. 42 Corner 2008. 43 Corner 2008. 44 Norton and Elson 2002. 18 practical opportunity for officials across sectors to integrate gender into their areas of work. Given the central role of the finance and planning in budget management and general policy decision-making, gender budget initiatives could integrate gender issues into government operations and financial management, leading to increasing resources for gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. Gender budgeting has been an area of intensive focus for UNIFEM, UNDP and other donors in the region. Gender budgeting in Nepal takes place within the framework of overall reform of the budget system. This initiative is the result of collaboration between UNIFEM, women's groups and gender experts and the women's ministry on one hand, and the Planning Commission, sector ministries and the Ministry of Finance on the other. A gender budgeting audit in education, health and agriculture at central level and in three districts at the district and village levels was carried out in 2002. An inter-agency Gender-Responsive Budget Committee was formed within the Ministry of Finance and a follow-up study on how to make the annual national budget gender-responsive commissioned in 2006.

A scoring system classifies expenditures in all sectors in terms of indicators that measure their impact on women and administrative arrangements for classification at the local level where funds are actually spent and information on impact is most readily available. In the Republic of Korea, according to the 2006 National Finance Act, the submission of a gender budget and gender-balanced reports will be mandatory from the 2010 fiscal year. In anticipation of this, in its budget guidelines for 2007-08 the Ministry of Strategy and Finance has instructed that every ministry specify gender related demands and use special formats that incorporate gender45. While gender budgeting is a long-term investment and cannot be expected to show quick results, it has also been pointed out that the emphasis in these efforts has so far been primarily on process rather than outcomes46 - tracking of expenditures and impacts has not yet been systematically attempted. In India for instance, the UNIFEM-led gender budget initiative resulted in a chapter on gender inequality in the government's annual pre-budget Economic Survey for 2000-01, and a separate statement on gender budgeting in the Union Budget 2005-06. All departments are required to present gender budget statements and as many as 54 out of 71 ministries/departments have set up gender budgeting cells47. Nevertheless, macroeconomic programmes and poverty programmes remain conspicuously gender insensitive48. In Nepal, health, agriculture and education were the areas selected for a gender audit of the Finance Ministry. Among other things the audit found that the Ministry of Finance considers all its policies and tax measures to be gender neutral. New guidelines requiring ministries to state the effects of their programme on women and poverty are not fully operational49. Ensuring the availability of disaggregated data on key issues is an essential tool for gender mainstreaming at the policy level. Initiatives to engender national Census operations have been undertaken in some countries in the region. In Nepal, questions related to women's status and empowerment such as female ownership of land, house, and livestock were included in the 2001 45 UNIFEM 2008. 46 United Nations 2004. 47 Chakraborty 2011. 48 National Alliance of Women's Organisations India 2006. 49 UNDP 2003. 19 Census. UNIFEM and women's groups were consulted in developing the instruments and output tables. More than 20 percent of the enumerators were women50. In India, a special effort was mounted to capture women's work, including unpaid work, in the 2001 Census51. This included collaborations with women's organisations and gender advocates to identify key issues, gender training for all levels of personnel, an expanded definition of work, special forms and instruments, instruction manuals with illustrations of women's work and an intensive media campaign, resulting in a significantly higher netting of women's economic activity. 2.2.3 Legislating for gender equality The focus of gender mainstreaming in several Asian countries has been on strengthening legislative frameworks and introduction of laws for affirmative action. A recent example is Nepal. Following the re-establishment of democracy in 1990, the electoral system has been revised and quotas for women created in the national assembly (50 percent) and in local government (20 percent). The Civil Service Act has been amended to lower the age bar for entry and reduce the probation period for women. Amendments to the civil code have established women's right to abortion, marital property and divorce. The Citizenship Act has been amended to allow citizenship to be transferred through the mother as well as the father. In 2006, the Interim Parliament passed a resolution to reserve one third of posts at all levels within government and one third of decision-making positions within political parties, for women. Women\u2019s rights groups are now campaigning for passing of appropriate legislation for the implementation of these resolutions52. Similarly, women's groups in the Philippines have campaigned successfully to put in place a number of laws protecting and expanding women's rights and freedoms. The Act Promoting the Integration of Women as Full and Equal Partners to Men in Development and Nation Building requires ministries to earmark 5-30 percent of official development assistance funds for programs and activities for women. The General Appropriations Act of 1998 also requires government agencies to set aside an amount from their appropriations for projects designed to address gender issues. These, as much as other laws designed to address specific issues such as violence against women and sexual harassment at the workplace, have been successful because of campaigns by women's groups and support from the media, civil society and some key members of the House and Senate53.

Quota systems have had notable success in South Asia. For example, in Bangladesh, through a special provision, there are 30 seats reserved for women in the Parliament to ensure their participation in politics, in addition to 300 elected seats. Initiatives taken by the government can also be an effective tool. In Viet Nam, women were elected to a little over 25 percent of seats in the national assembly, as a result of government guidelines and provision of professional and managerial training to women candidates by various ministries and institutions.56 Quota systems appear to be particularly effective in engendering local government. For instance, in India, constitutional amendments in 1993 introducing 33 percent reservations for women in local bodies are universally acknowledged to have had a definite and positive impact on the political participation of women. Evaluative studies of the Panchayat Raj Institutions system have concluded that women have been able to assert control over resources and have successfully challenged male officials. Significantly, women have also chosen to tackle issues as water, alcohol abuse, education, health and domestic violence. However, entrenched power structures and traditional male-dominated social systems continue to pose barriers for elected representatives to exercise their rights, unless they can mobilise social and familial support57. A remarkable example of transformative gender mainstreaming in governance comes from Timor-Leste, the world's youngest nation, where the first election was held in 2007 and has been documented by UNIFEM58. Nearly half the voters were women. Of the 65 new members of parliament, 20 were women. During the election, women candidates signed on to a Women's Political Platform, emphasising their common goal of giving women's issues a prominent place on the political agenda. The Election Monitoring Commission, a group of men and women gender equality advocates, kept a close watch on the commitments to gender equality of political parties. Women constitute nearly 30 percent of MPs, hold three out of nine cabinet posts (including the key ministries of Justice, Finance and Social Solidarity) and occupy an increasing number of seats on village councils. Women in elected office are backed up by a Women's Parliamentary Caucus, a Parliamentary Committee on Gender Equality, Poverty Reduction and Rural Development; a Secretary of State for the Promotion of Equality under the Office of the Prime Minister, and, most recently, a Prime Ministerial Commission for Gender Equality. These remarkable achievements are a result of a conscious policy of engaging women in state-building.

GABRIELA, an alliance of progressive organisations for the rights of women and indigenous people, has been a vocal and visible opponent of government policies in the country. GABRIELA has campaigned against the forced disappearances and brutal killings of suspected rebels; waged militant opposition to the influence of international financial institutions over the Philippine economy and politics; and denounced government corruption. GABRIELA's entry into the political arena was enabled by the enactment of the 'Party List System' Law in 1995, which transformed the electoral system and enabled excluded groups such as women, workers and farmers to form 'sectoral' parties to contest 20 per cent of the 250 seats in the Philippine House of Representatives.61 Under the law, each voter has two votes when electing Members of the Lower House, one for the individual district representative and another for the 'sectoral party' of her/his choice. By broadening the political space to which women had access, the party list system not only allowed electoral representation but also supported the political organisation of women. In 2001 GABRIELA fielded their Secretary General as a Party List Representative under the Bayan Muna (Country First) Party. She won, and was re-elected in 2004. In 2007, GABRIELA ran again and earned 3.94 per cent of total votes, winning seats for two representatives. The election of GABRIELA's representative in 2001 greatly advanced the women's rights agenda in the Lower House. She played a major role in the passage of pro-women legislation such as the Anti- Trafficking in Persons Act and the Anti-Violence Against Women and Children Act. In 2007, the two GABRIELA representatives filed legislative proposals regarding the work benefits of Filipino women and migrant workers, divorce, marital infidelity, prostitution, protection of women and children in conflict areas, and the welfare of female prisoners.62 Gabriela is now campaigning for the passage for a comprehensive legislation on reproductive health and rights. 2.2.5 Gender mainstreaming in civil society organisations Experiences of gendered institutional change in NGOs, though comparatively few, have been extensively documented and analysed in recent years. A detailed process report of an intensive long-term project of gender mainstreaming in NGOs63 in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Palestine describes the many difficulties, negotiations and compromises involved in translating abstract issues such as gender equality and gender mainstreaming into practice. Whereas most large development organisations usually start with engendering their programmes and turn the gender lens onto organisational issues only at a later stage, if at all, the strategy adopted by this project was the reverse one. The starting point was an explicit recognition that gender- unaware organisations are unlikely to produce gender-aware outcomes. The NGOs involved saw the putting in place of an organisational gender policy as a first step to institutionalising their commitment to gender equality. While gender policies remained in place even after the completion of the project, infrastructure such as Gender Units could not be continued due to lack of funds.

For instance, one of the participating NGOs from India, the Gorakhpur Environmental Action Group (GEAG) now conducts research on specific gender issues and is involved in a regional advocacy campaign combating violence against women and a campaign for the rights of women farmers64. It has also undertaken a gender impact assessment of its major programmes. Promoting small local women's groups remains a central strategy for GEAG. In a similar vein, documentation of a long-term intervention with BRAC, Bangladesh65 (reportedly the largest NGO in the world) highlights the use of action- learning as a tool for integrating gender equality concerns into all aspects of the functioning of the organisation. A functional level of gender sensitivity and gender competence was built within the organisation through a cycle of situation analysis, action-planning and implementation to address both organisational and programmatic issues.

The study found that the liberal feminist organisation could capitalise on the programme only to a limited extent and could not engage effectively with the state to negotiate for more flexibility in implementing the programme. The activist group was able to modify the structure of the programme to integrate it effectively with its own ongoing work on health rights. However, while this organisation has created new spaces and opportunities for the empowerment of the women it works with, its sphere of influence is limited to a small area. The leftist women's group has used the microcredit programme as a platform for mobilising large numbers of women who have gone on to confront the government on issues of domestic violence, right to food and corruption in local bodies. The results of this study serve to underscore the lesson that transformatory gender mainstreaming does not happen by default. How gender mainstreaming is interpreted in practice depends on the context and the political priorities and commitment to gendered change of the implementing organisations. 3. THE WAY FORWARD: SOME POSSIBILITIES The experience of gender mainstreaming thus far would seem to have been unsatisfying for all those who have invested in it \u2013 feminists who developed the theoretical framework and lobbied for its adoption as a principle of development, gender advocates within development agencies who have struggled to translate it into operational terms, donors who expect to see returns from years of capacity-building and stockpiles of tools and instruments, and most of all, women who are struggling for their rights and livelihoods in the face of mounting odds. Yet there is also little doubt that gender equality \u2013 the original goal of gender mainstreaming \u2013 remains as far from being realised as it was in 1995. Gender inequality, operating in synergy with inequalities of class, caste, race and sexuality, continues to curb and constrain the lives, violate the rights and undermine the dignity of millions of women in the Asia Pacific region. Indeed, it could 64 Gorakhpur Environmental Action Group n.d. 65 Rao et al. 1999. 66 Chari n.d. 23 be argued that neoliberal macroeconomic policies, the rise of religious fundamentalisms, militaristic ideologies, exclusive constructions of nationalism and, most of all, the increasing acceptance of violence as a valid political instrument have worsened women's situation in the post-Beijing decade, pushing millions of women in the global South to the very edge of survival. While the debate around gender mainstreaming is an ongoing one, the possibilities for the way forward that have come up for discussion fall into three broad categories. These are: \u2022 Strengthening implementation based on the existing conceptual framework; \u2022 Broadening and deepening the conceptual framework to address emerging realities; \u2022 Bringing women's rights/women's empowerment back to the centre of the development discourse. 3.1 Strengthening implementation Many practitioners are of the opinion that it is too early to pass judgement on the success or failures of gender mainstreaming, simply because it has nowhere been implemented in totality. Mehra and Rao Gupta (2006) argue that gender mainstreaming in most agencies has focused on internal organizational dimensions, such as staffing, policies, development of indicators, and training, which are only preconditions or precursors to interventions at the operational level67. They point out that the tendency to confuse the goals of mainstreaming with the means leads to the unrealistic expectation of immediate and comprehensive institutional change. The alternate approach they propose is grounded in the fundamental ideas that showing quick results on the ground is motivating and helps to lower organisational resistance. They suggest an instrumental approach that focuses on high-priority issues where improving development effectiveness can deliver benefits to women in terms of meeting their needs and improving their lives. The gradual accretion of such changes can contribute to building credibility for mainstreaming and contribute to the larger goals of gender equality. Such an approach would involve identification of strategic operational opportunities that will yield visible results for women on the ground; research and analysis to demonstrate the costs of gender inequality and/or the value addition of gender equality; deployment of gender experts who also have sector-specific competence and credibility; development of a clear and specific action plan that steers clear of \u201cdoing everything at all levels\u201d and allocation of sufficient resources to make a visible impact. Suggestions for strengthening implementation can also be gleaned from evaluation reports and the findings of internal reviews. Issues that are common across most of these reviews are summarised as follows68. \u2022 Conceptual clarity and understanding of the goals and principles of mainstreaming among key decision makers; \u2022 Appropriate organisational arrangements and processes for the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29cf8a17-1b45-46ce-84e8-f4b86f33df07": {"__data__": {"id_": "29cf8a17-1b45-46ce-84e8-f4b86f33df07", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/02", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/02", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/02", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "478b3d7b67b69ca7a100dba3d5100937a0e0a2c9eccc01d87ce089efd4627e4a"}}, "hash": "478b3d7b67b69ca7a100dba3d5100937a0e0a2c9eccc01d87ce089efd4627e4a", "text": "implementation of mainstreaming; \u2022 Adequate gender tools and staff skilled in their application; \u2022 Capacity and building to facilitate women's participation and empowerment. More than a decade ago, Jahan (1995) listed the actions to be taken by development agencies in pursuing gender equality. She emphasised the need to differentiate between instrumental and substantive policy objectives. She suggested the establishment of short-term and long-term goals 67 Mehra and Rao Gupta 2006. 68 Corner 1999. 24 with clear priorities and budgets. Goals and timetables need to be incorporated into policy objectives so that monitoring and evaluation does not become elusive. These recommendations continue to be relevant even today. The need to address the resistance (and sometimes even hostility) to gender mainstreaming of duty-bearers in general, and men in particular, has been much discussed. Involving men as promoters and actors in gender mainstreaming is acknowledged to be essential, but \u2018foolproof\u2019 guidelines are hard to find. An expert group on the issue convened by DAW69 emphasised that funding for work with men boys should not be at the expense of funding for gender equality work with women and girls. They also recommended that work with men should be done in partnership with women and women\u2019s groups so as to lessen the risk of men colluding in or becoming complicit with dominant and oppressive forms of masculinity. Drawing on successful experiences of partnership between a Northern donor and community NGOs in Cuba, Stuart (2009)70 underlines the importance of a supportive environment at the community level for effective implementation of mainstreaming projects. She found that the more participatory the approach of the implementing NGO, the more the beneficiaries were able to express their positive appreciation of gender diversity, and see the benefits of complementarity. She identifies the following key factors. \u2022 Presenting gender equality as good for women, men and families, rather than portraying women as victims and men as villains. This makes it easier for men to be champions and to be actively involved; \u2022 Willingness to start from partner and community reality, and build, no matter how modestly, rather than requiring some ideal starting point; \u2022 Managers who are able to foster positive collaboration among scientists, social scientists and women and men in the communities; \u2022 Awareness by partners that attention to gender mainstreaming is increasingly important for many donors, and will become a condition of funding where it is not already. 3.2 Broadening the conceptual framework Apart from critiques of the way in which it has been implemented, recent discourse has focused attention on the limitations of the notion of gender as an analytical tool. Gender analysis focuses primarily or exclusively on differences between women and men and does not take the differences among women sufficiently into account. Kerr (2001) argues that this failure to distinguish gender from other aspects of identity such as class, religion, race, ethnicity, age, ability, caste, sexuality, and location slows the transformative potential of the mainstreaming approach. Riley (2004) points out that it is problematic in the long term to pursue a strategy that identifies gender inequality as the primary axis of exclusion, and makes a strong case for broadening the mainstreaming agenda so as to take into account other parameters that constitute and regulate difference. Even as far back as 1995 in Beijing, some grassroots women's movements had pointed out that the conception of gender equality encapsulated in the PFA is a narrow one that focuses on sex- based discrimination and ignores issues of racial, political, economic and cultural inequality and injustice. The Caucus of Indigenous Women has stated that the Beijing PFA fails to challenge racism and environmental exploitation, and the draft had been manipulated by the Northern powers 69 United Nations Division for the Advancement of Women 2003. 70 Stuart 2009. 25 to obscure causal connection between neoliberal macroeconomic policies and women's poverty71. Gender mainstreaming based on this formulation is therefore likely to benefit women of the \u201cdominant culture\u201d and reinforce the marginalisation of others. The notion of \u201cintersectionality\u201d, although still very much a work in progress, aims to respond to these concerns. An intersectional approach to analyzing the disempowerment of marginalized women attempts to capture the impacts of interactions between multiple forms of subordination. It addresses the issues of women existing at the intersections of racism, patriarchy, class, caste, race and other systems of discrimination. Crenshaw (2000) describes the dynamics of intersectional subordination as being based on structural, political and representational factors, and argues that intersectional subordination is invisible, since women who experience multiple forms of discrimination being either \u201cover- included\u201d or \u201cunder-included\u201d by gender or race discrimination frameworks. \u2018Over-inclusion\u2019 is likely", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c376728c-9d96-4655-b219-013746d3c7e6": {"__data__": {"id_": "c376728c-9d96-4655-b219-013746d3c7e6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/02", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/02", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/02", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2e5b2950fa48b166ca175383a720eec1f457b0c3e5c2a60faac593646959837e"}}, "hash": "2e5b2950fa48b166ca175383a720eec1f457b0c3e5c2a60faac593646959837e", "text": "when a problem is presented as gender subordination without consideration of the simultaneous racial or ethnic subordination (as in the case of trafficking, where trafficked women are usually identified purely as victims of sexual violence). \u2018Under-inclusion\u2019 on the other hand can occurs when a subset of women experience a problem that is invisible because it is not the experience of women from the dominant group (for instance, administration of injectable contraceptives in population programmes, which does not affect women who do not use state health facilities). Thus far, discussions on intersectionality have human rights rather than gender mainstreaming as a starting point. However, Kerr (2001) points out that a growing number of development organisations are adopting rights-based approaches to development over a gender mainstreaming approach. An intersectional analysis of identities such as race and gender can help to resolve tensions between respect for diversity and recognition of the universality of women\u2019s human rights. In its 45th session, the Commission on the Status of Women discussed intersectionality and recommended that governments, UN agencies and civil society groups adopt an \u201cintegrated and holistic approach to the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women and girls, in particular women subject to multiple discrimination.\u201d72 The actions recommended for this purpose have direct implications for gender mainstreaming policies and strategies. Reviewing the evidence on gender mainstreaming through an intersectionality lens, Riley (2003) concludes that developing a more comprehensive gender mainstreaming tool, that accounts for other modes of subordination as well as gender, could result in a gender mainstreaming strategy that is more relevant, contextual, attuned to the reality on the ground, and thus more transformative and more effective in achieving development goals. At the same time, she cautions that efforts to expand ways of understanding and analysing are likely to be constrained in their impact if the barriers and challenges experienced in gender mainstreaming to date are not addressed. 3.3 Sharpening the focus on women's rights and women's empowerment Although feminists and women's movement activists were primarily responsible for advancing the mainstreaming agenda in the 1990s, many are now expressing scepticism and disillusionment with 71 Tauli Corpuz 1995. 72 UN 2001. 26 the way in which gender mainstreaming has played out since Beijing. The main points emerging from the numerous critiques by feminist activists can be summarised as follows. \u2022 As presently articulated, gender mainstreaming is a weak and essentially technocratic concept that obscures the linkages between gender inequality and social change73. It should be considered a theoretical formulation that requires deepening and detailing before it can be translated into interventions74. \u2022 Gender mainstreaming, and more generally \u201cgender speak\u201d (exemplified by apolitical and conceptually unsound statements like \u201cgender is about men and women\u201d) have undermined the basic goals of women's struggles for rights and justice and have pushed back the past gains of women's movements75. \u2022 Gender mainstreaming has become an excuse to reduce resources flowing to women. Gender units and gender programmes have been dismantled in some agencies and countries. In others, budget analysis shows that there has been a significant reduction in allocations to women's programmes. Post-mainstreaming in many donor agencies, project proposals that focus on women tend to be rejected or returned with the direction to \u201cinclude men\u201d76. \u2022 Mainstreaming has \u201ctechnified\u201d and \u201csoftened\u201d political issues and separated the notion of gender from its feminist roots by skirting contentious issues of men's roles in gender oppression. This \u201csoft feminism\u201d is considered more appropriate to the mainstreaming discourse because it is more acceptable to men77. \u2022 Gender mainstreaming has shifted the focus away from outcomes to process. There is a mismatch between the huge amount of information and tools, gender training and policy directives of gender mainstreaming and the outcomes in terms of changes in women's condition or position.78 An increasing number of voices are now heard advocating a return to a women's rights approach, or at least integration of a sharper and more unequivocal focus on women's rights into mainstreaming strategies. Kerr (2003) traces two distinct strands in efforts for gender equality since Beijing \u2013 the women's rights approach and the gender and development approach \u2013 that have proceeded largely on separate tracks. She points out that more and more agencies - \u201cfrom Oxfam to UNICEF\u201d - are shifting from mainstreaming to rights-based approaches. Rights-based approaches, unlike mainstreaming, avoid any confusion between ends and means by keeping the end result \u2013 equal rights for all \u2013 in constant view. A rights agenda provides standards by which to measure success, and clearly links results to programme objectives and procedures. However, she also warns that the rights discourse is equally vulnerable", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8829b892-f655-4451-b765-6a204689e58d": {"__data__": {"id_": "8829b892-f655-4451-b765-6a204689e58d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/02", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/02", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/02", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "41109cfa9e46ecdae7de7e4cb67ad5df1adc1927236e6a6b3b62fd1ced609876"}, "3": {"node_id": "b8f4d61a-fbeb-417e-80e0-1fb551e9291c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/02", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5eea0619dbdaa7b24b11d3a840b851d2e80048cd00bf7afab3977ef6460a0374"}}, "hash": "5bccbcf52679635edc668b6b59d8c71857f7b54dac4001fc78685c16e3ded553", "text": "to co-optation, distortion and depoliticisation as any other approach. Acknowledging the feminist underpinnings and conceptual strengths of the gender and development approach, she argues for a stronger convergence between all approaches and strategies for women's rights and gender equality. O'Neill (2004) makes a strong case for grounding gender equality efforts in CEDAW as a practical strategy for convergence between gender mainstreaming and women's rights. Drawing on her own experience, she describes how, in the last 20 years, CEDAW reporting in the Pacific Island 73 Daly 2005. 74 Sandler 2004. 75 Win 2004. 76 Johnsson-Latham 2004. 77 Bjork 2002. 78 Riley 2004. 27 countries has changed from a bureaucratic exercise to a powerful tool for improving the status of women. She sees this as a powerful example of gender mainstreaming at partner-country level. She underlines that in implementing CEDAW, governments are effectively taking a rights-based approach, since the convention serves as an international bill of rights for women. She lists the following advantages of using CEDAW and the CEDAW reporting process: \u2022 Governments and civil society organisations must perforce work together to give effect to CEDAW. \u2022 It provides an opportunity for women\u2019s offices to provide leadership and to increase their profile. \u2022 Reporting on implementation prompts governments to action, since they want to be seen in the best light when under international scrutiny. \u2022 Statistics and data need to be gathered regularly, and reporting provides a baseline against which progress can be measured over the longer term. \u2022 The CEDAW Committee assists governments to identify priority areas for future action. This has the potential to encourage government agencies to take specific medium-term actions to address issues and improve women\u2019s status or become more responsive to women\u2019s needs; \u2022 Reporting provides a measurable and visible focus for activists to put pressure on their government. Reporting can diffuse accountability and responsibility for actions across ministries, and take the pressure off the under-resourced women\u2019s offices. O'Neill points out that this list is very similar to the standard definition of gender mainstreaming, yet it is driven by a specific women\u2019s rights approach and end objective. 3.4 Is there a future for gender mainstreaming? As the above discussion makes clear, gender mainstreaming is far from dead. Even its most trenchant critics do not deny the strength or continuing validity of the concept. Indeed, most if not all critiques are twinned with persuasive arguments for revisiting, broadening, deepening or otherwise strengthening the mainstreaming approach to make it a sharper and more effective tool for achievement of women's rights and gender equality. The work of \u201cgender people\u201d inside and outside development agencies has generated an impressive body of analyses, tools and methodologies of gender mainstreaming. \u201cInsiders\u201d have a good idea of what works and what does not work, and why. It would be a pity if this body of knowledge were not used to ensure more focused gender equality outcomes for development projects. More importantly, and despite all the gaps in implementation, gender mainstreaming has been successful in creating space for raising women's rights issues in non-confrontational ways within the development discourse and development organisations. This hard-won territory cannot be easily surrendered \u2013 difficult as it is, this is the arena where practitioners and theoreticians must continue to engage in the struggle for a world where women and men can work together for freedom, security and dignity for all. 28 BIBLIOGRAPHY Agbon, Nelia. 2008. \u201cThe Philippines Experience in Gender Mainstreaming\u201d.

These inequalities are reflected in erosion of biological resilience at birth of females, neglect of sex/gender-specific health needs of these three groups, human rights violations that endanger the lives and health of these three groups, male sex selection at birth and lesser access to health care in the context of privatization. Gender inequalities in economy have an adverse bearing on gender inequalities in health. Equally, gender inequalities in health adversely influence gender inequalities in economy. Deep-rooted causes of gender inequities in health and the economy in Asia-Pacific can be traced to unequal distribution of power and resources (between women and men, men from privileged and marginalized backgrounds and sexual and gender minorities and heterosexual women and men), unequal voice and agency of the three groups, and weak accountability of power holders to these rights holders. This in turn can be traced to unequal position within social relations and social institutions. Gender inequalities in health, economy and underlying reasons can be seen as vicious spirals. Gender inequalities in health and economy are worst in South and West Asia, but at the same time China, Republic of Korea, Vietnam, Singapore and Malaysia reflect a skewed sex ratio at birth. In South & West Asia, China and Republic of Korea patriarchy is deeply entrenched. A combination of \u2018rights\u2019 and \u2018development\u2019 measures are suggested to reverse vicious spirals leading to gender inequalities in health and economy. From a \u2018rights\u2019 lens all governments should sign and ratify without reservations relevant international human rights instruments and optional protocols, pass legislation pertaining to rights of women, marginalized men and sexual/gender minorities to participation, equality, health, and minimum amount of property, and strengthen powers of national women\u2019s and human rights commissions. Government and donors should create mechanisms for reflecting voices of these groups in policies, legislation and practice on gender, health and economy. They should move from cost effectiveness as a criterion for priority-setting to a rights based approach. From a development lens, governments and donors should increase budgets to health and social security for those in the informal sector, integrate gender and health within all economic programs, integrate economic component within health programs, regulate private health sector, engender public health & administration, and improve sex-disaggregated where gaps exist. NGOs should strengthen voice of the three groups.

almost all Asia- Pacific countries manifesting themselves in five different ways listed below: \u2022 The biological health advantage of females in terms of resilience at birth is eroded through gender-based discrimination by adulthood in 78 per cent of Asia-Pacific countries, reflected in gender differentials in infant and under-five survival in 32 per cent of countries and a female-to-male healthy life expectancy ratio of below 1.06 in 71 per cent of countries. \u2022 Specific health needs of women, men and sexual/gender minorities arising out of the intersection", "start_char_idx":

and gender are grossly under-addressed in the majority of Asia- Pacific countries, reflected amongst other aspects in a maternal mortality ratio (MMR) of over 100 in two-thirds of Asia-Pacific countries. Diagnosis and treatment for sex- specific cancers for men and women (e.g. penile and cervical cancer), sex reassignment surgery for transgender groups, assisted reproductive technologies for lesbians and genital surgery for inter-sexed are rarely available in public health facilities. \u2022 Human rights violations that discriminate against the health of women, girls, poor boys, and sexual/gender minorities are found in almost all Asia-Pacific countries. Such violations vary from country to country, but include male sex-selection before birth (in 29 per cent of countries on which data was available), female genital mutilation (in 17 per cent of countries on which data was available), greater malnutrition amongst girls than boys in the 0-5 age group (other than weight by height), early and forced marriage, adolescent pregnancy, lack of access to safe abortion (other than for sex selection) , virginity testing and violence within the family and outside. Homosexuality amongst males is a crime in 55 per cent of Asia- Pacific countries and amongst females in 37 per cent of countries, and examples of violations of health rights of transgender, bisexual and inter-sexed people are common. Poor boys are vulnerable to being trafficked for sexual purposes, though to a lesser extent than girls in most countries. \u2022 Although the economic ability of women and sexual/gender minorities to pay for health services is lower than that of men of similar economic status in Asia-Pacific countries, women pay for health services according to their economic capacities and not according to their need for services in at least 36.6 per cent of Asia-Pacific countries. This also discriminates against health access of poor men. \u2022 Norms on dominant masculinities lead to higher prevalence of tuberculosis, cardiovascular diseases, HIV and intentional and unintentional injuries (including traffic accidents) amongst men than women. However, tuberculosis is underestimated amongst women, and the gender gap in the incidence of HIV is reducing across 9 generations. Deaths due to sexually transmitted infections (STIs) other than HIV are higher amongst females than males in Asia-Pacific. Gender inequities in health, overall, more adversely affect the health of women and sexual/gender minorities than men of similar economic and social backgrounds. South and West Asian countries, with few exceptions, perform worse than East Asia and the Pacific with regard to gender inequities in health. In all countries women, men and sexual & gender minorities from economically, socially and politically marginalized groups face gender inequities in health to a greater extent. Industrialized countries perform better with regard to most health indicators in absolute terms, but not necessarily on gender and health equity issues. Son preference indicated in adverse sex ratios at birth persists in large parts of South Asia, and in China, the Republic of Korea, Viet Nam, Malaysia and Singapore. Message 2 Gender inequities in the economy have a strong bearing on gender inequities in health in Asia-Pacific through six pathways listed below. \u2022 The gender division of labor results in greater workloads for women and girls than for men and boys, and leads to differences in occupational health risks in all Asia-Pacific countries. The burden of caring for the sick falls disproportionately on women within the family (particularly in poor families). \u2022 Intra-household biases against females in distribution of food, education expenditure and health-care expenditure leads to greater malnutrition (weight and height by age) and health risks for women and girls and lesser access to health care in about half of the Asia-Pacific countries on which data was available. However, weight by height malnutrition is higher amongst boys in a few countries, as is access to secondary and tertiary education in some. \u2022 Gender inequities in earned income (in all Asia-Pacific countries), control over their own income, and ownership of land and assets imply that women have less ability to spend on their health, in particular when faced with catastrophic illness. \u2022 Low and unequal presence of women and sexual/gender minorities in the formal sector implies that they have less access to health insurance/security than men and less access to means to pay for health-care services. \u2022 Women\u2019s, men\u2019s and gender/sexual minorities\u2019 sex-specific health needs are rarely taken into account in the work place (other than maternal health within the institution of marriage). \u2022 There are direct violations of the right to health and sexual rights and reproductive rights against women, against sexual/gender minorities and against men with stigmatized illnesses in the work place Again, South and West Asia and developing countries perform", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee9b9a75-1a56-4afd-83e2-0ff635b68827": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee9b9a75-1a56-4afd-83e2-0ff635b68827", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2d2188ab99ec29df1459d2b2a5f146ac8c41bf3786ecc290925130917672d28b"}}, "hash": "2d2188ab99ec29df1459d2b2a5f146ac8c41bf3786ecc290925130917672d28b", "text": "worst on most gender and economic equity indicators, with the exception of Japan where inequities in the economic field fall near the developing country average. 10 Message 3 Gender inequities in health lead to gender inequities in the economy in Asia-Pacific through six pathways identified below. \u2022 The health morbidities and stigma from gender/sexual based violence lead to job loss for women who were previously working, or loss of the ability to go out to work. \u2022 Poor health (South Asia) and a lack of reproductive and sexual rights of women (all sub-regions) lower their ability to move up the economic ladder. \u2022 Poor access to controversial services (e.g. legal abortion other than for sex selection) and low-priority sexual and reproductive health services (e.g. cervical cancer, penile cancer, sex reassignment surgery) in public health facilities leads to loss of income for women, men and sexual/gender minorities. \u2022 Men, women and sexual/gender minorities with stigmatized illness are vulnerable to loss of employment and are denied promotion and training. \u2022 Often, widows whose husbands die of AIDS lose access to the land and house owned by the late husband, especially when they test positive for HIV. \u2022 The high expenditure of men on tobacco, alcohol and substance use in poor households in several countries (linked partly to inability to fulfill an expected bread- winning role) leads to a lower contribution of men toward household needs, and less ability of women to use part of their income to improve their enterprises. Message 4 Deep-rooted causes of gender inequities in health and the economy in Asia-Pacific can be traced to three features of Asia-Pacific culture, social mobilization and governance. \u2022 Unequal distribution of power between women and men and between sexual/gender minorities and heterosexual men and women in societal institutions, namely households, communities, markets and the state. This goes hand in hand with patrilineal inheritance systems, patrilocal residence systems and the practice of dowry in some countries. \u2022 Unequal voice and agency of women and sexual/gender minorities and that of heterosexual men who wish to challenge the dominant construction of gender identities from community to national levels. \u2022 Weak accountability of power holders in institutions of society listed above to address gender inequities in health and economy. Patrilineal inheritance and patrilocal residence systems are prominent in South and West Asian countries, and used to exist in China, Viet Nam, and the Republic of Korea. Issues of unequal voice, power and weak accountability, gender inequity in health and gender inequity in the economy reinforce each other through vicious cycles. 11 Message 5 Good practices exist for breaking the vicious cycle -- through promoting gender equity in health, gender equity in the economy, and through strengthening power, voice and accountability. These practices can be classified into the \u2018development\u2019 and \u2018rights-based approaches\u2019 both of which are important. \u2022 The development approach, wherein action is more by government, donors and development NGOs: Examples of good practices under this approach include expanding government health expenditure as a percentage of total government expenditure in Nauru, expanding public health expenditure as a percentage of total health expenditure in Afghanistan, promoting universal social health insurance in Thailand covering women\u2019s sexual and reproductive health needs, putting in place maternity insurance laws for women in enterprises in China, adding gender and health components to economic programmes targeted at women in Bangladesh, adding gender and livelihoods components to health programmes targeted at women in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, expanding girls\u2019 access to secondary education in Bangladesh, sensitizing men on gender-based violence and on their own health needs in Fiji, sensitizing religious leaders in Cambodia on the reproductive health needs of women, men and young people and working with men as partners and parents to promote gender equity in health. \u2022 The rights-based approach, wherein action is more often taken by civil social actors and aims at expanding voice and agency of the marginalized to demand accountability of power holders on gender equity in health and the economy. Examples of good practices within the second approach include advocacy by groups working around rights of sexual/gender minorities in Japan to stop victimization of transgender people in the work place, by women\u2019s rights groups in Pakistan to remove rape from the ambit of sharia laws, advocacy by women\u2019s rights groups to ban the practice of giving birth in cowsheds in parts of Nepal, pressure groups of rural women claiming gender specific health entitlements in India and Bangladesh, advocacy by groups working with sexual/gender minorities in Nepal to legalize homosexuality and same sex marriage, and media campaigns by men who believe in alternative masculinities in Philippines against", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "df777f99-d7a3-47af-a7e0-f777154637db": {"__data__": {"id_": "df777f99-d7a3-47af-a7e0-f777154637db", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "68f6bbcb751b9471c3d0c44a0f1ea506baeb41f4f9f61a368cd97e9543b6422f"}, "3": {"node_id": "3e535c33-06aa-4986-bb90-8c54e077dbff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "22d4f1b48ab76b06b73fe7e2d8f90b2d662c1170bee83013819a24c243ec8d72"}}, "hash": "c5641fff5aa92b6d8526286959530d2915da70fc0feede44682d5c2fbb3ecfb1", "text": "dominant construction of masculinity and violence. While these efforts are laudable there are more examples of citizens/others holding the government to account to promote gender equity in health and economy, than of holding leaders of community, market organizations and household heads to account. Strategies to make government provide controversial services e.g. abortion other than for sex selection, enforcing land rights) or expensive health or economic services (e.g. breast or penile cancer treatment or universal unemployment insurance) have been less successful, than the provision of maternal health services or micro-credit to women. Accountability for the sex-specific health needs of sexual/gender minorities and their voice in public spaces is still minimal. National legislation on the right to participation in public policy formulation and oversight, right to health, right to food and livelihood security, and right to gender equity is not in place in many countries, and political equity is still a far cry. 12 Message 6 It is important to strengthen the accountability of government, donors, markets, communities and heads of households in Asia-Pacific to gender equity in health and the economy through policy/legal changes from above and pressure from below through the following strategies. Rights-based approach \u2022 Making international human rights instruments work for gender equity in health and the economy in the region though pressing governments that have not done so to ratify International Covenant on Economic and Socio Cultural Rights (41 per cent) and Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) (1 per cent) and CEDAW optional protocol (71 per cent) and ICESCR optional protocol (yet to be opened for ratification), and pressing for Asia-pacific Human Rights Court. \u2022 Encouraging national governments to pass legislation on the right to participation, right to health, right to gender equity and right to livelihoods and property, and to bring their national legislation and policies into line with ICESCR and CEDAW. Promoting general accountability legislation such as public interest litigation and the right to participation to monitor implementation. \u2022 Strengthening the powers and capacities of national women\u2019s commissions to address gender inequities disadvantaging women and girls in health and the economy, and that of national human rights commissions to take up health and economic violations against marginalized men and sexual/gender minorities. \u2022 Supporting programs to strengthen voice and informed agency of women, sexual/gender minorities and men who want to challenge dominant masculinities at all levels: local, district, provincial, national, sub-regional and regional levels; in particular with regard to norms that support son preference, homophobia, male inheritance, patrilocality, dowry, and male decision making. \u2022 Movement by government and donors beyond cost-effectiveness to a rights-based perspective on health priority setting so that the sexual and gender-specific health needs of women, sexual and gender minorities and men are addressed, including access to safe abortion other than for sex selection, access to services for the health consequences of gender-based violence, diagnosis and treatment for reproductive cancer and infertility amongst women and men, sex reassignment surgery for transgender people, assisted reproductive technologies for lesbians, treatment for prostate/penile/testicular/anal cancers of men, de-addiction services for those with substance use problems, and public health messages on masculinities and traffic accidents, tobacco use, substance use and violence. Development approach \u2022 Increase government allocations to health (including sexual and reproductive health) and increase public expenditure as a proportion of total health expenditure. Bi-lateral donors for their part need to fulfill their commitments to health made at International 13 Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) held in 1994 and the Millennium Summit. \u2022 Improve economic, social and health security of those in the informal sector through employment guarantee schemes with equal wages, unemployment insurance, access to small and medium-scale credit, safe markets with sex/gender segregated toilets, cr\u00e8ches for workers, health and accident insurance for workers and pension schemes. \u2022 Integrate gender and health with economic interventions targeted at women, sexual/gender minorities and poor men, and integrate gender and economic empowerment into health interventions targeted at women, sexual/gender minorities and poor men. \u2022 Regulate private health and economic sectors so that they comply with national legislation on gender, health and economic equity. \u2022 Engender public health and administrative systems through engendering policies, budgets, research, education and training, and strengthen the position of women, marginalized men and sexual/gender minorities within relevant departments.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3e535c33-06aa-4986-bb90-8c54e077dbff": {"__data__": {"id_": "3e535c33-06aa-4986-bb90-8c54e077dbff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "68f6bbcb751b9471c3d0c44a0f1ea506baeb41f4f9f61a368cd97e9543b6422f"}, "2": {"node_id": "df777f99-d7a3-47af-a7e0-f777154637db", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c5641fff5aa92b6d8526286959530d2915da70fc0feede44682d5c2fbb3ecfb1"}}, "hash": "22d4f1b48ab76b06b73fe7e2d8f90b2d662c1170bee83013819a24c243ec8d72", "text": "\u2022 Improve sex-disaggregated data at regional/national levels on gender and health economic issues on which as yet no comparable United Nations (UN) data is available, such as women\u2019s ownership of land, reported incidence of domestic violence, access to screening for sex-specific cancers in men, legal status of homosexuality, legal access to abortion other than for sex selection", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5a2b542-9864-40c0-858c-2ce3d4bbdc81": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5a2b542-9864-40c0-858c-2ce3d4bbdc81", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "17d26d889097caa61b6518c5529330e84f1c663c37626587b84519ef879efb0f"}}, "hash": "17d26d889097caa61b6518c5529330e84f1c663c37626587b84519ef879efb0f", "text": "etc. Political and legal equality of women, marginalized men and sexual gender/minorities is essential for promoting gender equity in health and the economy. 14 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background Gender inequities in health disadvantaging Asia-Pacific women and girls persist throughout their life cycle, violating their right to the highest standard of health as enshrined in the General Comments to the ICESCR 2000 as well as their sexual and reproductive rights (UN 2000; WHO 2000a, , 2005a, 2006a). Gross violations of the health rights of women and girls in Asia-Pacific does not mean that the health of all men and boys is favorable in all countries or in all health realms. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that the lower life expectancy of males when compared to females worldwide and in Asia-Pacific may be attributed not just to the female biological advantage at birth, but also to higher rates of traffic accidents, consumption of tobacco, substance use, and risky behavior amongst men and boys; all of which are related to the dominant construction of masculinities (WHO 2002 2003a). The violation of rights to health and of the sexual and reproductive rights of sexual and gender minorities is another concern globally, and in the Asia-Pacific region. The links between gender inequities in health and gender inequities in the economy have not been adequately explored in development research in Asia-Pacific, other than the relationship between gender, work and occupational health and gender, poverty, and health (with a focus on women and men). Whether issues such as unequal ownership of assets, unequal access to markets and incomes, unequal intra-household distribution of food, health and education, and unequal presence of women in economic leadership have a bearing on women\u2019s health has been little explored. Equally, the influence of women\u2019s morbidities and health rights violations on economic equity has been inadequately analyzed. Gender inequities in health and the economy affecting men and sexual/gender minorities have received less attention in research than those affecting women. The wider influence of lack or enjoyment of power, accountability and voice on gender inequity/equity in health and economy is another area where greater light is required. 1.2 Objectives This paper seeks to bridge these gaps in the literature by examining the links, if any, between gender, health inequities and economic inequities in the Asia-Pacific region, documenting good practices in promoting gender equity in these two spheres through addressing the links, and suggesting policy measures to promote gender equity in health and economic status in the future. The focus of this paper is not just on gender, women\u2019s health and women\u2019s economic status, but also that of men and of gender/sexual minorities. The broader purpose of this paper is to contribute to the drafting of United Nations Development Programs (UNDP) Asia- Pacific Human Development Report (HDR) 2009 which focuses on Gender. The two sub- themes of the HDR are economic equity and politico-legal equity, with gender-based violence, culture and gender identities (including masculinities and gender minorities) as cross-cutting issues. The overarching framework of the HDR is the centrality of power and voice of women, marginalized men and gender/sexual minorities. In keeping with this broader purpose, the specific objectives of this paper are the following: \u2022 To capture major gender inequities in health in the Asia-Pacific region that have a bearing on the lives of women, men and gender/sexual minorities, 15 \u2022 To examine the linkages between gender inequities in health and in the economy in the Asia-Pacific region. \u2022 To analyze how unequal distribution of power in society, inadequate voice (of marginalized persons) and weak accountability of power holders to women, marginalized men and gender/sexual minorities have perpetuated gender inequities in health and the economy. \u2022 To document good practices in promoting gender equity in health and the economy and the links between them, and in challenging unequal power and voice and weak accountability. \u2022 To frame important policy messages to foster gender equity in health and the economy through addressing the links, as well as the underlying causes. Though the paper sought to examine the links between gender equity in health and economy, there was little on this topic, there was more material on the links between gender equity in economy and health. 1.3 Structure The paper is structured as follows. The second section of this paper defines terms and concepts used in the paper and outlines the framework adopted to examine gender inequities in health and the economy (based on a review of literature). It also explains the indicators used in the paper, sources of data, and classification of sub-regions used for analyzing data.

The fourth and main section begins by providing an analysis of gender and health inequities in the region, using both statistical evidence and findings from qualitative research. It then examines evidence of the impact of gender and economic inequity on gender and health inequity and the evidence of the impact of gender and health inequity on economic inequity. The fifth section analyses the underlying unequal distribution of power and voice in society disadvantaging women, marginalized men and sexual/gender minorities which underpin gender inequities in the region. It also examines the strengths and weaknesses of processes of accountability of power holders in society \u2013 in state, markets, communities and households-- for gender equity in health and the economy. Comparative data on Sub- Saharan Africa is provided in Sections 3-5 where available in aggregated form. The sixth section summarizes good practices in reducing gender inequities in health, economy and power/voice through breaking unfavorable inter-linkages. The seventh section draws out policy implications that flow from the review of literature and the data for promoting gender inequity in health and the economy. 2. METHODLOGY: DEFINITIONS, FRAMEWORK AND INDICATORS 2.1 Definitions Concepts and terms such as health, right to health, economy, gender equity, gender equity in health, gender equity in the economy, gender analysis and a rights-based approach to development are outlined in this section. 16 Health The constitution of WHO defines health as \u2018a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\u2019 (WHO n.d). The General Comment to the ICESCR on the Right to Health, 2000 (see Box 1) calls for the right of all persons to enjoy the highest attainable standard of health conducive to living a life in dignity (UN 2000). . The Right to Health Box 1. The Right to Health The Right to Health includes: \u2022 The right to maternal, child and reproductive health. \u2022 The right to healthy, natural and safe workplace environments. \u2022 The right to prevention, treatment and control of diseases. \u2022 The right to health facilities, goods and services. \u2022 The right to control one's health and body, including sexual and reproductive freedom, and the right to be free from interference, the right to be free from torture, non-consensual medical treatment and experimentation. The services have to be available, accessible, acceptable, and of appropriate quality. The following special topics are also to be kept in mind by national governments in health service provision: principles of non-discrimination and equal treatment, gender perspective, women\u2019s right to health, children\u2019s and adolescents\u2019 right to health, and right to health of older people, people with disabilities and indigenous people. Source: United Nations 2000. This paper examines whether the rights to health of women, men and sexual/gender minorities in Asia-Pacific are respected, protected and fulfilled. Economy The \u201cfree dictionary\u201d defines the term economy as a system by which the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services is organized in a country or communityi This paper extends this definition to include how production, distribution and consumption of goods and services are organized in the country or community, as well as the household. It also examines how equitably these goods and services, as well as responsibilities, are distributed. Gender equity The concept of gender equity in this paper denotes the equivalence in life outcomes for women, men and, sexual/gender minorities; recognizes their different needs and interests; and requires redistribution of power and resources in favor of women, marginalized men and sexual/gender minorities. Gender equity is hence concerned with \u2018justice and fairness\u2019, and not \u2018sameness\u2019 which is implicit in the concept of gender equality (adapted from Reeves and Baden 2000). The concern of this paper is more with equity than equality. 17 Gender equity in health Gender equity in health implies the absence of injustice in health outcomes, in meeting sex/gender differentiated health needs, and in fulfillment of health rights of men, women and gender minorities (Sen et al. 2007). Gender equity in health implies that the following five principles are upheld. \u2022 Where biological sex places one sex at a health advantage, this should be reflected in better health outcomes for that sex. \u2022 Where biological sex differences interact with social determinants to define different health needs for women, men and sexual/gender minorities the principle of gender equity would imply that these different needs are addressed adequately. \u2022 Where no plausible biological reason exists for unjust health outcomes (e.g. early marriage of girls), social discrimination or", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c64b54c-8c1f-46a2-807e-177bcecb2dcb": {"__data__": {"id_": "8c64b54c-8c1f-46a2-807e-177bcecb2dcb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d36b89adb9b46a214c44d135642d508b273bea9fab876e9d7220efea04537492"}}, "hash": "d36b89adb9b46a214c44d135642d508b273bea9fab876e9d7220efea04537492", "text": "violation of rights should be considered the prime reason and addressed accordingly. \u2022 Where no plausible biological reason exists for different health outcomes (e.g. greater incidence of traffic accidents amongst men), social norms should be considered the prime reason and changed accordingly. \u2022 Where economic ability to pay for health services varies among women, men and sexual/gender minorities and different economic groups amongst them, they should contribute to health financing according to their economic capacities and not according to their need for services. (Sen et al 2007; PAHO n.d.) An important question posed by this paper is: how gender equitable is health services and outcomes in the region. Gender equity in the economic sphere Adapting from Murthy RK and Oxfam Great Britain (2007) gender equity in the economic sphere means: \u2022 Equity in access to, ownership of and control overii family and community resources and assets by women, men and sexual/gender minorities. \u2022 Equitable participation of women and men in reproductive work; and women\u2019s ability to control their own labour within the household. \u2022 Equity in markets, in terms of participation rates, allocation of roles and tasks, the terms and conditions of work (including wages), earnings, access to training and promotion opportunities, ability to rise to leadership positions. \u2022 Biological needs of women, men and sexual/gender minorities are taken into account by policy makers and employers (for example, leave for sex-specific health needs) as well as their social needs (for example for flexible working hours). 18 This paper examines how far gender equity in these economic aspects has been achieved in the region and has a bearing on gender equity in health. Gender analysis Gender analysis refers to the variety of tools used to understand the relationships between men and women, their activities and constraints, their access to and control over resources and power and their specific needs and interests. Gender analysis recognizes that gender and its relationship with race, ethnicity, caste, class, age, sexual/gender orientation, disability, and/or other social determinants of status is important to understanding the inequities that are seen in society between heterosexual men and heterosexual women, and between sexual/gender minorities and heterosexual men and women (adapted from CIDA 1999). Gender analysis is used throughout this paper to unravel underlying reasons that sustain gender inequity in health and the economy in Asia-Pacific. Rights-based approach to development A rights-based approach to development is a conceptual framework for the process of human development that is normatively based on international human rights standards and operationally directed to promoting and protecting human rights. The human rights based approach identifies \u2018rights holders\u2019 and their entitlements and duty bearers and their obligations, and works towards strengthening the capacity of rights holders to make claims and duty bearers to fulfill their obligations (United Nations 2006). This paper considers gender and health/economic equity to be closely linked to realizing rights enshrined in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 2.2 Framework to examine gender inequities in health and economy Antecedents to the framework A review of literature on health equity by Gwatkin (2007) suggests that the attention to health inequities began in the 1990s. Whitehead (1992) observed that differences in health care access and outcomes are not only unnecessary and avoidable, but in fact unfair and unjust. In the 1990s, Evans and Brown argued through a series of articles that the place of residence, race, occupation, sex, religion, education, socio-economic status and social capital are important determinants of health inequity (Evans and Brown 2002). Marmot in 2006 observed that poor health amongst disadvantaged groups results not just from lack of material resources, but also from psychological factors such as lack of empowerment (Marmot 2006). Analysis of gender inequities in health and the inter-relations between gender norms, inequity and health was not the main attention of most of these early researchers on health inequity (Gwatkin 2007). A major landmark in summarizing and analyzing international evidence on gender inequities in health was the edited book Engendering International Health: The Challenge of Equity, by Sen, et al. (2002) which brought together articles that forcefully argued that to fully comprehend the distribution of health and illness, one needs to include not only sex, but also gender in one's analysis. One chapter of this book explored the link between women\u2019s work and women\u2019s health (Ostlin 2002).

In addition, women in developing countries earn lower wages than men, have fewer chances for training and promotion, have to make do with tools suited to the height and weight of men, have to combine their paid work with unpaid and often unsafe work at home, and have to work for extremely long hours. The 2006 WHO publication, \u2018Gender Equality, Work and Health: A review of the evidence\u2019 further explored the link between these three aspects (Messing and Ostlin 2006). Unlike much of the literature on gender, work and health, which tend to take a unidirectional linear view that gender inequities in the work place have a bearing on gender inequities in health, the literature on gender, poverty and health point to the vicious circle linking gender, poverty and ill health. As early as 1998, Oxaal and Cook observed that poverty leads to women\u2019s overwork, hazardous work and poor nutrition (given intra-household gender inequalities). Certain conditions of ill health (including malnutrition) amongst women lead in turn to women\u2019s economic exclusion and subsequent ill health, pointing to the cycle of ill health and poverty (Oxaal and Cook 1998). The WHO series on gender, poverty and health has explored not only the vicious linkages, but virtuous cycles that are possible when one addresses the underlying causes of poverty and ill health through a gender lens (WHO 2005a, and 2006a). The WHO Pacific report \u2018Integrating Poverty and Gender into Health Programs: Foundation Module on Poverty\u2019 points out first, that higher incomes lead to better health and better health improves income and welfare, and second that higher incomes in women\u2019s hands lead to better health care for themselves and their children. The module argues that greater income in women\u2019s hands leads to better nutrition and greater access to ante-natal care (ANC), and improved maternal health improves their ability to earn an income. Citing evidence from China, Indonesia and Sri Lanka the module also observes that an increase in iron supplementation for anemic workers increased their work productivity, incomes and leisure time. This in turn could lead to better health (WHO 2006a). While not citing concrete evidence, the module argues that assets in women\u2019s names, absence of intra-household inequalities in the distribution of food, nutrition, and education, and reductions of women\u2019s work load could all lead to reducing gender inequities in women\u2019s health that disadvantage women. What then are the reasons for gender inequities in health, work and poverty? Sen et al. (2007) contend that gender-discriminatory values, norms, practices and behaviors, differential exposure and vulnerability to diseases, disabilities and injuries, biases in health systems and biases in health research are principle reasons for gender inequities in health outcomes. They note that these discriminatory values in turn are shaped by gender and social relations of caste, class, race, ethnicity, sexual/gender orientation etc. One could argue that the unequal distribution of power in societal institutions -- states, markets, households, communities -- shapes the marginal location of women, marginalized men (and different groups amongst them) and sexual/gender minorities in these social relations. The unequal distribution of power is both caused by, and manifested in, the weak accountability of power holders and inadequate mobilization of women, marginalized men and sexual/gender minorities to voice their needs and interests. 20 Framework on gender (in) equity in health and the economy This paper builds upon the frameworks pertaining to three issues: i) gender inequities in health, ii) gender, health and work and iii) gender, poverty and health to postulate a framework of \u2018vicious spirals\u2019 and \u2018virtuous spirals\u2019 to explore the links between gender (in)equity in health, the economy and issues of power, accountability and voice.

This vicious circle is particularly marked in the case of women, sexual/gender minorities and men from marginalized groups. At the same time the picture is not entirely bleak.

She observed that female education also has a similar effect. To support her claim on the links between economic and health indicators, studies in South Africa have shown the positive effects on women\u2019s health of combining micro credit with health programs, as well as the impact on women\u2019s health of promoting property rights (Sen et al. 2007). However the literature on virtuous cycles is much less prevalent than that on vicious cycles globally and in Asia-Pacific, pointing to the need to document positives linkages. 2.3 Indicators, databases and classification of countries Indicators for analysis A variety of indicators have been used here for examining gender [in]equities in health and the economy and issues of (lack of) power, voice and accountability. Some indicators are female-to-male ratios, some apply more or only to females, males or sexual/gender minorities, and a few are general ones which have greater ramifications for marginalized groups. A total of 82 indicators, which are outlined in Table 1 have been used for analysis in this paper. Of these 82 indicators, inter-country data was available on 36, and not available on the others. Unfortunately, inter-country data are not published in the UN/World Bank databases on a variety of controversial health outcomes for women (e.g. abortion rates, incidence of violence against women), nor on access of men and sexual/gender minorities to health services specifically required by them (e.g. access to treatment for prostate cancer or sex-assignment surgery). This lack of data also applies to sex-specific health needs which are not seen as a public good, such as access to treatment for cervical cancer in public health facilities. Table 1.

POPULATION, POVERTY AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT PROFILE OF ASIA-PACIFIC An overview of the population, poverty and human development profile of the Asia-Pacific countries/areas (from now on referred to as countries) is provided to set the context for the analysis of gender inequities in health and linkages with gender inequities in the economy, which follows in the next section. \u2022 Population: The total population of 40 countriesiv of the Asia-Pacific region on which data was available was 3,700 million in 2005, which is significantly higher than the population of Sub-Saharan Africa at 722.7 million (UNDP 2007). The majority of the population of Asia-Pacific live in East, South and West Asia (computed from UNDP 2007). The average population size of Pacific countries (2.3 million) is much smaller than that of East Asia (122.4) and South and West Asian countries (176.4 million). The average population of developing East Asian countries is more than that of industrialized countries, but in the Pacific the trend was the reverse. China and India together account for approximately two-thirds of the regional population. \u2022 Spatial distribution of population: Data available on 32 countriesv of the region from the HDR 2007/2008 suggests that 44 per cent of the population in these countries lived in urban areas in 2005. The comparative figure for Sub-Saharan Africa was 34.9 per cent. The proportion of urban population was higher than the Asia-Pacific average in the case of East Asian countries (53.2 per cent) and lower than the average in the case of South and West Asian (28.4 per cent) and Pacific countries (40.7 per cent) (computed from UNDP 2007).

The comparative figure for Sub-Saharan African countries stood much lower at 0.493 for the same year. Only 9 of the 32 Asia-Pacific countries (36 per cent) were classified as high human development countriesviii with the rest being classified as medium human development countries. The East Asian and Pacific countries recorded slightly higher levels of human development (0.764 and 0.759 26 respectively) than the regional average, while South and West Asian countries recorded significantly lower levels of human development (0.634).

GENDER INEQUITIES IN HEALTH AND ECONOMY 4.1 Gender inequities in health As elaborated in the section on definitions, gender inequities in health could take five forms: erosion of the female biological advantage at birth, failure of public health facilities to meet sex/gender-specific health needs, violation of human rights which have a bearing on health, high-risk behavior of men due to the construction of masculinities and inequitable health financing systems. Examples in Asia-Pacific of gender inequities in health arising out of all these five factors are presented in this section. See Table 3 for a summary. The terms women and men when used in this report refer to heterosexual women and men, and the term sexual/gender minorities refers to lesbians, gays, bi-sexual, transgender and inter-sexual people. 28 Table 3. Summary of gender inequities in health in Asia-Pacific Principles on gender equity in health Illustration of violation of the principle in Asia-Pacific Principle 1: Where biological sex places one sex at an advantage this should be reflected in better health outcomes for that sex Biological health advantage in terms of female advantagexv at birth eroded progressively with age through discrimination and neglect in 78% of 41 Asia-Pacific countries on which data was available reflected in greater/same female IMR, under-five mortality rate, adult mortality rate and healthy life expectancy below the stipulated 1.06. Principle 2: Where biological sex interacts with gender to create different health needs for women, men and sexual/gender minorities these needs should be addressed Several of the Asia-Pacific countries have not met: -Specific health needs of women such as access to full ante-natal care, institutional delivery, maternal nutrition, emergency obstetric care, cervical and breast cancer prevention/treatment and safe abortion needs (other than for sex selection). These factors in turn have led to high maternal mortality ratio in some countries. - Specific health needs of men such as prevention, screening and treatment for prostate cancer, testicular cancer, penile cancer and sexual dysfunctionxvi. - Universal access to contraception for heterosexual couples and adolescents. - Specific health needs of sexual/gender minorities such as access to sex-change operations for transgender people, genital surgery for inter-sexed people, assisted reproductive technologies for lesbians and anal cancer amongst gays. Principle 3: Where no plausible biological reason exists for unjust health outcomes, gender discrimination should be considered the main reason Violations of principle 1, and: Gender discrimination in the region leads to violations of right to health and of sexual and reproductive rights of women and girls reflected in male-biased sex ratio at birth, greater female malnutrition (other than height for weight), practice of female genital mutilation in some countries, early marriage of girls, adolescent pregnancy, women bearing the burden of contraception, and physical and sexual violence against women and girls in and outside families in many countries Discrimination against sexual and gender minorities persists in the region, with 45% of countries having decriminalized homosexuality for men and 63% for women Principle 4: Where no plausible biological reason exists for different health outcomes for men and women, gender norms (but not discrimination) should be considered the main reason Higher rates", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "46386bab-23ac-4c25-8c7b-ca1eb7a9dc35": {"__data__": {"id_": "46386bab-23ac-4c25-8c7b-ca1eb7a9dc35", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b663515732606c82ad6e9e4d8cfd365283d070b3f43f7bf3262647a590df2ac5"}, "3": {"node_id": "88ea9d4d-eb68-4601-94c1-8e486efd0dc5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "113e7cf63f4139527d4a4f3de356d2099fcd96739e6a4448be2d9458ef4c6dd8"}}, "hash": "80ab2d7b5e1a5f427349df6d963b9f6ae94386b684847d0b938e8328b7bd5aca", "text": "of substance use and risky health behaviour lead to greater death rates due to tuberculosis, HIV (in Asia), traffic accidents and public violence amongst men, homosexual men and transgender (male to female) people than amongst women 29 Principle 5: Where economic ability to pay for health services varies across women, men and sexual/gender minorities (and different groups amongst them) they contribute to health financing according to their economic capacities and not according to their need for services. Though economic ability of women and transgender/intersex people to pay for health services is lower, they pay for health services according to their economic capacities and not according to their need for services in at-least 36.6% of 41 Asia-Pacific countries on which data was available 4.1.1 Erosion of the female biological advantage at birth The female biological advantage at birth is eroded progressively with age through discrimination and neglect in 78 per cent of Asia-Pacific countries. Worldwide, infant, child and adult mortality rates for males are higher than that of females, and women outlive men. According to the Global Gender Gap Report 2008 the healthy life expectancy of women should be 1.06 times that of men (World Economic Forum 2008 xviii; where females are more disadvantaged ( xvii). The female XX chromosomes are supposed to enhance chances of females surviving the first year, the first five years, and even morbidities such as cancer (Micheli 1998; Fikree and Pasha 2004; Fuse and Crenshaw 2005). The biological advantage of females over males at birth does not apply to vulnerability to obesity, to diseases/conditions associated with low levels of hemoglobin, to osteoporosis after menopause and to contracting sexually transmitted infections from infected male partners WHO 2000a, 2003b, 2006a). The biological advantage also does not apply to the added vulnerability of women during pregnancy; when exposure to diseases like malaria can be additionally dangerous. In the Asia-Pacific region this biological advantage at birth is eroded due to discrimination and neglect in the majority of countries, and takes several forms discussed below. Consolidated comparative data is provided for Sub-Saharan Africa where available, \u2022 Female infant mortality rate higher than or equal to male infant mortality rate in 10 of 41 Asia-Pacific countriesxix on which data was available from World Health Statistics 2008 (WHO 2008a). In China, Viet Nam, Palau, Tonga, Nauru, Tuvalu and India female infant mortality was higher than male infant mortality in 2006. In Federated States of Federated States of Micronesia, Japan and Nepal female and male infant mortality rates were equal in 2006, indicating that gender discrimination persists even in these two countries. In the 41 countries as a whole, however, female IMR on average (un-weighted) was lower than male IMR in 2006 (ratio of female-to- male IMR is 0.85). The ratio of female-to-male IMR is lower than the regional average in South and West Asian countries (0.83), but higher in East Asia at 0.87 and same in Pacific at 0.85. In developing Asia-Pacific countries the ratio of female-to- male IMR is slightly higher than the regional average 0.88, while in industrialized countries the ratio is lower than the regional average at 0.78. \u2022 Female under-five mortality rate is higher than or equal to male under-five mortality rates in 10 of 41xx Asia-Pacific countries on which data was available as of 2006 30 (WHO 2008a). These include China, Nauru, Palau, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and India. In Federated States of Micronesia, Republic of Korea and Singapore the female under-five mortality rate was the same as the male under-five mortality rate. In the 41 countries as a whole, however, the female under-five mortality rate was lower than male under-five mortality rate (ratio of female-to-male under-five mortality rate was 0.89) in the year 2006. It is notable that the ratio of the female-to-male under- five mortality rate is slightly higher than the ratio of female-to-male infant mortality rate pointing that the biological health advantage is reduce after the first year of life. The ratio of the female-to-male under-five mortality rate in South and West Asian countries is slightly higher than the 41-country average (at 0.92), and more or less the same in East Asian and Pacific countries (at 0.88).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "88ea9d4d-eb68-4601-94c1-8e486efd0dc5": {"__data__": {"id_": "88ea9d4d-eb68-4601-94c1-8e486efd0dc5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b663515732606c82ad6e9e4d8cfd365283d070b3f43f7bf3262647a590df2ac5"}, "2": {"node_id": "46386bab-23ac-4c25-8c7b-ca1eb7a9dc35", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "80ab2d7b5e1a5f427349df6d963b9f6ae94386b684847d0b938e8328b7bd5aca"}}, "hash": "113e7cf63f4139527d4a4f3de356d2099fcd96739e6a4448be2d9458ef4c6dd8", "text": "In developing Asia-Pacific countries the ratio of the female-to-male under-five mortality rate is slightly higher than the regional average of 0.92, while in industrialized countries the ratio is lower than the regional average at 0.81. \u2022 The ratio of female-to-male healthy life expectancy at birth is below 1.06 in 29 of 41xxi Asia-Pacific countries on which data was available as of 2002 (WHO 2008a).

The ratio of female-to-male healthy life expectancy is lower than the average in South and West Asian countries (1.01) and the Pacific (1.03), but higher in East Asian countries (1.05). That is, only East Asian average comes close to meeting the biological advantage standard of 1.06. The female-to-male healthy life expectancy ratio was higher in industrialized (1.06) than developing Asia-Pacific countries (1.03), with the difference being less marked in Pacific industrialized countries. The countries that recorded lower female-to-male healthy life expectancy as of 2002 were Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, and similar healthy life expectancy at birth were India, Tonga, Tuvalu and Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \u2022 Adult mortality rate for females is higher than that for males in 4 countries out of 41xxii on which data was available (WHO 2008a). These include Palau, Tonga, and Tuvalu in the Pacific and Bangladesh in South Asia. In no country of the region was the adult mortality rate the same for both sexes. In the 41 countries, the female adult mortality rate was lower than that of males as of 2006 (ratio of 0.73). The ratio of the female-to-male adult mortality rate was higher than this average in South and West Asia (0.78) and the Pacific (0.81), and lower in East Asia (0.64), showing that the female advantage is lower in the first two sub-regions. The ratio of the female-to-male adult mortality rate was lower in developing Asia-Pacific countries (0.76) and higher in industrialized Asia-Pacific countries (0.57). In total, in 32 countries out of 41 there were sex differences in infant, under-five mortality or adult mortality, or the female-to-male healthy life expectancy ratio was below 1.06. 31 4.1.2 Specific health needs of women, men and sexual/gender minorities ignored Specific Health needs of women, men and sexual/gender minorities arising out of the intersection of biology and gender are grossly under-addressed in more than 75 per cent of Asia-Pacific countries. Sex and gender intersect to create specific health needs for women, men and sexual/gender minorities. This sub-section examines whether or not these health needs are met. While regional and sub-regional performance is summarized below for industrialized and developing countries. Specific health needs of womenxxiii \u2022 ANC coverage was less than 80 percentxxiv in 9 of 12 Asia-Pacific countriesxxv (75 per cent) for which data was available for the years 2000-2006, namely Cambodia, Viet Nam, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Bangladesh, India and Nepal (WHO 2008a). The three countries amongst the 12 wherein ANC coverage was 80 per cent or more were Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Indonesia and Maldives, In the 12 countries (all developing) average ANC coverage was only 54.9 per cent showing a gross neglect of a health care need which affects only females (and on average approximately 3 times in their lives assuming a total fertility rate of 2.9 which is the regional average for 2000-2005). ANC coverage in South and West Asian countries on which data was available was lower than the average in the 12 countries (at 46.8 per cent), while the reverse was true in the case of East Asian countries on which data was available (59 per cent). No data on ANC coverage was available in Pacific countries or in industrialized countries. Amongst the 12 countries, ANC coverage varied from 16 per cent in Bangladesh to 95 per cent in Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Apart from the fact that ANC coverage is limited, an issue is that ANC services do not include preventive messages and measures to reduce susceptibility to conditions such as Malaria (Sen et al. 2007). ANC coverage seems to be better in Sub-Saharan Africa than Asia-Pacific, with the figure standing at 72 per cent in 2007 (World Bank n.d.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f65b5b3b-6218-423f-bfaa-48e7287b9307": {"__data__": {"id_": "f65b5b3b-6218-423f-bfaa-48e7287b9307", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "000ed3a88a4552997bb1fab705956a001ad1b1938ff4f81a7df887c1bac49211"}, "2": {"node_id": "585e7d46-db1f-4230-b097-f888ca3c7ba0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3cae9d094253039333a33c83c89e51b2b9a1834885bc0af16e930d996e14c2c2"}}, "hash": "5e3d6762c1bfc85392f946976002e55b1147d92f4c403e61c8220a5a7f2a2027", "text": "), but the total fertility rate was higher in Sub-Saharan Africa at 5.5 (UNDP 1997), a further factor putting women at greater risk. \u2022 Fewer than 80 per cent of births xxvii xxviii).

The average proportion of low birth weight newborns was 11.7 per cent in the 37 Asia-Pacific countries, when compared to 14 per cent for Sub-Saharan Africa for the period 1998-2004 (UNICEF 2006a). The proportion of low birth weight newborns was higher than the average for Asia- Pacific in South and West Asia at 20.8 per cent, and lower than the average in East Asia at 9.9 per cent and in Pacific at 8.4 per cent. The proportion of low birth weight newborns was higher than the average at 12.4 per cent in Asia-Pacific developing countries and lower than the average at 7 per cent in the industrialized countries.

In Bangladesh and Mongolia abortion was available on demand only in the first trimester, in Singapore up to the second trimester and in Republic of Korea with few restrictions (not specified). In the other 31 (out of 41) countries (76 per cent) women were denied abortion on demand, and had to prove grounds such as threat to life or health, mental illness, fetus abnormality, rape, or various social reasons. While the rates of sexual violence within the institution of marriage and in public spaces are significant, 26 out of 41 countries (63 per cent) do not allow for legal abortion on the grounds of rape. A greater proportion of countries in the Pacific sub-region were denied abortion on demand in general/first/second trimester and on grounds of rape than countries in other sub-regions.

High maternal mortality ratio (MMR) and lifetime maternal mortality risk One of the results of lack of access to ANC, skilled birth attendance, adequate maternal nutrition, legal access to safe abortion and lack of access to emergency obstetric servicesxxxiii xxxiv xxxvi is a high maternal mortality ratio. The maternal mortality ratio is higher than the WHO target of under 100 (per 100,000 births) by 2020 (World Health Assembly 1998) in 20 out of 30 countries as of 2005 and higher than the global average of 400 in 9 of the 30 countries on which data was available as of 2005 (WHO 2008a). The ten countries amongst the 30 that had already achieved the \u2018less than 100\u2019 target were China, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mongolia, Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka. The 9 countries that recorded a maternal mortality ratio of more than 400 were Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and India. For the 30 Asia-Pacific countries, the average MMR was 302.7 as of 2005, compared with 900 for Sub-Saharan Africa as of 2007xxxv. The MMR was higher than the average at 525.3 in South and West Asian countries, lower than the average in East Asian countries at 215 and Pacific countries at 182.6. The MMR was higher than the average at 335.6 in developing countries and lower at 6.3 in the industrialized countries. All the industrialized countries had reached the World Health Assembly target of a maternal mortality ratio of less than 100 by 2020. Amongst the 30 countries, Afghanistan recorded the highest maternal mortality rate at 1800 as of 2005 and Australia the least at 4 (WHO 2008a). The picture on lifetime maternal mortality risk is slightly different from the maternal mortality ratio, as this data takes into account both MMR and total fertility rate. This data was available for 11 countries from Progress of the World\u2019s Women: 2008/2009, namely Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Indonesia and Timor- Leste for the year 2007 (UNIFEM 2008). The lifetime maternal mortality risk was highest for Afghanistan at 1 in 8 women (that is one chance of a woman in dying in eight pregnancies) and lowest for Indonesia at 1 in 97 women. The countries that recorded a lifetime maternal mortality risk of more than 1 in 50.6 (the average for the 11 countries on which data was available) were Afghanistan, Nepal, Timor-Leste, Lao People's Democratic Republic and Cambodia. The average lifetime risk of maternal death, was higher for Sub-Saharan Africa at 1 per 37 in 2005 when compared to 1 in 1097 for East Asia and the Pacific (combined) and 1 in 86 for South Asia for the same year as per UNIFEM\u2019s Status of the World\u2019s Women, 2008/2009.

The 12 countries were the same as those for pap-smear, and again Australia and New Zealand were the only two countries where more than 50 per cent of women had undergone mammography. In the 14 countries of Asia-Pacific as a whole, the average proportion of women who had had a mammography was only 11.8 per cent. Only 1.6 per cent of women in the 5 South and West Asian countries had had mammography and 5.3 per cent of women in the 7 East Asian countries had had mammography. On the other hand 60 per cent of women in the 2 Pacific countries (both industrialized) had had mammography. The proportion of women who had accessed mammography was a low 3.8 per cent in the 11 developing Asia-Pacific countries for which data was available and higher at 41 per cent in the 3 industrialized Asia-Pacific countries. Amongst the 14 countries, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Pakistan recorded the lowest proportion of women who had accessed mammography at 1 per cent, and New Zealand recorded the highest at 63 per cent. Access to mammography is important for early diagnosis of breast cancer, which increases survival chances. In South Asia there were 76,000 female deaths due to breast cancer in 2001 (accounting for 1.17 per cent of female deaths), while in East Asia there were 93,000 deaths due to the same reason (accounting for 1.5 per cent of female deaths in that year). No case of deaths due to breast cancer amongst men was reported -- it is a rare but not impossible occurrence. \u2022 Access to ovarian cancer screening is also limited. Its incidence is only slightly lower than the other two types of cancers specific to females. 25000 women died of ovarian cancer in 2001 in East Asia and Pacific and 21000 in South Asia in the same year (Lopez et al. 2006) Specific health needs of men The specific health needs of men arising out of intersection of sex and gender include services for treating hydrocele, penile cancer, prostate cancer and sexual dysfunction. While it is men\u2019s biological sex that exposes men to these health conditions (women do not suffer from the same), it is the construction of dominant masculinities that leads to many men\u2019s failure to learn about their bodies or look after them, coupled with a tendency to seek health services at the last minute. It has been reported that many men feel that worrying about their 35 health would be an indication sign of \u201cfemininity\u201d (Instituto Promundo 2002; Goldie n.d). Further, men\u2019s sex-specific health needs have been neglected by providers, and preventive/screening measures are not part of essential service packages in most Asia-Pacific countries. In the past decade there has been considerable attention to targeting preventive sexual health messages for men, but often these have been limited to promoting safe sex services and preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS. \u2022 Prostate cancerxliv. In 2001, 21,000 men died of prostate cancer in South Asia, and the disease accounted for 3 per cent of deaths amongst men in that year (computed from Lopez et al. 2006). In East Asia and the Pacific (combined) the comparative figures are 16,000 men dying of prostate cancer constituting 2.3 per cent of all male deaths during the same year (ibid 2006). Prostate cancer affects 1 in every 12 men over the age of 50. After the age of 40, it is advised that all men should have regular medical examinations for prostate cancer. When diagnosed early, prostate cancer has a high cure rate but when neglected it becomes incurable and leads to death. (Instituto Promundo 2002). \u2022 Sexual dysfunctionxlv: Sexual dysfunction can take the form of erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation and retarded ejaculationxlvi. The number of males affected by erectile dysfunction was estimated to be 80.9 million in Asia in 1995, with the number of males affected being projected to increase to 199.9 million by 2025. The age- adjusted prevalence rate of erectile dysfunction was estimated at 22 per cent in Malaysia and 34 per cent in Japan in 2005, with the rate increasing with age (Nicolisi et al. 2003). \u2022 Testicular cancer: Testicular cancer accounts for 1 per cent of all cancers in men globally and is the most common form of cancer among men in the age group 15 to 35 years of age (Instituto Promundo 2002) There is no country, sub-regional or regional data on incidence of testicular cancer in Asia-Pacific, however it is known to be higher amongst Caucasians than Asiatics.

Testicular cancer occurs in only one of the testicles and once removed has no impact on the sexual and reproductive functions of the man. Testicular cancer is relatively easy to treat, particularly when detected in the early stages, through self examinationxlvii. Such self-examination training to detect cancer in early stages is neglected in sexual and reproductive health awareness camps (Instituto Promundo 2002). \u2022 Penile cancer:xlviii Penile cancer accounts for 20to 30 per cent of all cancers in men living in Asia, with the incidence higher in developing countries than industrialized ones (Stanford Cancer Center 2009). Lack of adequate hygiene (in the case of the poor, partly due to lack of access to sanitary water and toilet facilities) is one of the greatest causes of cancer of the penis. Male circumcision reduces the risk of penile cancer. When discovered in the early stages, cancer of the penis can be cured and easily treated. If left untreated or caught late, it can spread to internal organs and cause mutilation or death (Instituto Promundo 2002; Stanford Cancer Center 2009) 36 Specific health needs of sexual/gender minorities There is little research on specific health problems of lesbians, gays, bisexual, transgender and inter-sexed people, and virtually no cross-country data on the extent to which these have been addressed. The exception is research into the high incidence of HIV amongst gay and bisexual men and strategies for combating HIV amongst men who have sex with men (Lee 2000). The available literature points to sex-specific health issues which vary with whether the person is lesbian, gay, transgender or inter-sex. These concerns are rarely addressed in sexual and reproductive health education or in terms of inclusion of preventive and curative measures in public facilities. \u2022 Specific health needs of inter-sex persons. Inter-sexed people are those who are born with indeterminate genitalia, and may need access to genital surgery. However, such facilities are not easily available in public health facilities in several of the developing Asia-Pacific countries. \u2022 Specific health needs of transgender people. A section of transgender people may seek to undergo sex reassignment treatment. The process of gender reassignment is long and involves psychiatric, endocrinology, and surgical evaluation. The process of hormone therapy is required before any surgical procedure. In addition to the risk of liver abnormalities with estrogen use, there is also the rare possibility of pituitary tumor. For female-to-male transgender persons, androgen therapy carries an increased risk for heart disease, endometrial hyperplasia, and subsequent endometrial carcinoma. Gender reassignment surgery may cause sexual dysfunction. Those who use hormone therapy but decide not to undergo surgery continue to be at risk for endometrial cancer (female-to-male persons) and prostate cancer (male-to-female persons) (Lee 2000). \u2022 Specific health needs of gay and bisexual men. Gay and bisexual men practice anal or/and oral intercourse. Anal-receptive intercourse is associated with an increased risk of infection with HIV, human papillomavirus, hepatitis B virus, and herpes virus. Anal and oral insertive intercourse is strongly associated with inflammation of the urethra, risk of HIV and gonorrhea infection. People who practice anal-receptive intercourse and are infected with HIV have a greater risk of developing anal cancer than men with HIV practicing vaginal intercourse (Lee 2000). While some heterosexual men also practice anal intercourse, the proportion of gay and bisexual men practicing anal intercourse is greater. \u2022 Specific health needs of lesbians. Lesbian women tend to less use oral contraceptives than heterosexual women, and may be more vulnerable to breast cancer (Lee 2000). Lesbians may require artificial insemination services if pregnancy is desired, but such services are not offered in public health facilities in developing Asia-Pacific countries. There is also an assumption amongst lesbians and health providers that certain diseases common amongst heterosexual women, such as cervical cancer or HIV through sexual intercourse, do not affect them. However, this is not true, as human papillomavirus and HIV can be transmitted through vaginal secretions (Lee 2000). 37 Box 5.

As a result commitments made under the General Comment 2000 to the ICESCR on rights of all to the highest standards of health are not met. Some of the important sex/gender specific needs that are not addressed are: screening and treatment for breast and cervical cancer, health responses to gender-based violence (for women irrespective of sexual orientation), prostrate, penal and testicular cancer (for men irrespective of sexual orientation), anal cancer (in particular, for men who have sex with men); assisted reproductive technologies for lesbians; sex reassignment surgery for transgender people. The case of the \u201cEssential health package\u201d in Bangladesh under the Health and Population Sector Programme (Phase I-1999-2003) is an example. The programme includes only family planning, emergency and essential obstetric care, prevention and control of STDs and HIV/AIDS, control of communicable diseases, child health, limited curative care (for accidents and injuries) and behaviour change communication; it ignores specific health needs of sexual/gender minorities, men and even women other than maternal health and family planning (Arrows for Change 2003; Jahan 2003) Behavioral change messages do not address the diverse sex-specific needs of different groups. Source: World Bank 1993; WHO 2000b; Arrows for Change 2003; Jahan, 2003; Castillo et al. 2005. 4.1.3 Gender and rights violations Gender-based violations of human rights (including sexual and reproductive rights) which have a bearing on health can be found in almost all countries A third type of gender and health inequity arises not merely through ignoring sex/gender specific health needs, but through outright violations of human rights (including sexual and reproductive rights) which have a bearing on the health of women, girls and sexual/gender minorities. For each example, regional and sub-regional performance, developing and industrialized country performance and details of marked underperformance are given below. Sexual and reproductive rights violations against women and girls \u2022 Females have a lower chance of being born in 6 out of 21xlix Asia-Pacific countries for which data on sex-ratio at birth was available. The Global Gender Gap Report, 2008 of the World Economic Forum compares the sex-ratio of the country with the normal sex-ratio at birth of 0.94 (World Economic Forum,2008). The 6 countries out of 21 which have a sex-ratio of below 0.94 (year unspecified) are India (.89), China (.90), Republic of Korea (.93), Viet Nam (.93), Malaysia (.93), and Singapore (.93). 38 The rest recorded a sex-ratio of 0.94 (World Economic Forum 2008). By comparison, none of the 24 of the 45 Sub-Saharan Africa on which data was available recorded sex ratios at birth below 0.94 (World Economic Forum 2008) These data indicate a marked son preference in the 6 countries cited above and prevalence of sex selection before birth (either during pregnancy or at the point of conception). A smaller number of the female population contributes to higher age gaps between spouses, trafficking of girls and at times to several brothers marrying one wife. India and China both have legislation prohibiting sex selection, but it is not clear if the other countries have such legislation (ARROW 2005). \u2022 Gender inequity in rates of malnutrition and access to preventive health care amongst children and adults: Country data on malnutrition in children and adults by sex was difficult to come by. The assessment, Situation of Women and Children in Nepal, 2006 by UNICEF Nepal notes that 45 per cent of children were underweight and 43 per cent showed stunted growth; and more girls than boys are malnourished with regard to height and weight-for-age indicators, while more boys show low weight-for- height indicators. The same report notes lower rates of full immunization of girls than boys, with 48 per cent for the poorest girls, compared with 56 per cent for the poorest boys (UNICEF 2006b). The NHFS 2005-6 in India, while not providing sex- disaggregated statistics on the nutrition of children, observes that the body mass index of 33 per cent of women is below normal, when compared with 28 per cent in the case of men. The proportion of both women and men whose body mass index is below normal is higher in rural areas and among those with no education (who tend to be poorer) (Government of India 2006).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe894123-d8a1-4944-9996-cf279dae85d7": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe894123-d8a1-4944-9996-cf279dae85d7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e3df32d74816b7b460c7115f7ef43c12926937ea7a0b8408c337a335c14d62ed"}, "2": {"node_id": "fe7dfb68-bc1d-4260-90d2-2910ab42649c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0aab8b81ffd7b4183b4224001715a63c69118f18636c5080480f4d04971dede9"}}, "hash": "a113edeb3a2f26248293612f9930fd1619f41ed63e69db9911a93649ec842beb", "text": "Rates of anemia and forms of malnutrition amongst adolescent girls and adult women (15-49 years) are high in Bangladesh, Nepal and India for which data was available, but there was no comparative data on prevalence of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d4f9ba3-f967-4cb4-905c-0affde172a4a": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d4f9ba3-f967-4cb4-905c-0affde172a4a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8a0e5858eb5dff18970e33bfd07ca1c557731e106406b4547f9c643a974bdf77"}}, "hash": "8a0e5858eb5dff18970e33bfd07ca1c557731e106406b4547f9c643a974bdf77", "text": "anemia and malnutrition amongst adolescent boys to make a comparison (ARROW 2008). The rate of anemia amongst pregnant women was a high 51 per cent and 57.9 per cent in Bangladesh and India in 2004 and 2005-6 respectively (ARROW 2008; and Government of India 2006). By contrast, gender inequity in malnutrition among disadvantaged girls was not observed in Sub-Saharan Africa (Haddad et al. 1996). \u2022 Early marriage amongst girls and violation of rights to childhood and sexual rights: Data on early marriage amongst girls, a violation of the rights of girls in general, and their sexual rights when the marriage is forced as in parts of South Asia, was available for 21 countriesl (all developing) from the OECD database on Gender, Development and Institutions ( OECD 2009) The data indicates that the incidence of early marriage was 15.9 per cent in the 21 Asia-Pacific countries (year unspecified), and present to some degree in all 21 countries. However, the same data base suggests that the prevalence of early marriage (15-19 years) in Asia-Pacific is lower than in Sub- Saharan Africa where the incidence of early marriage was 28.9 per cent in 37 countries on which data was available. Amongst the 21 Asia-Pacific countries the incidence of early marriage was highest in South and West Asia at 27.3 per cent and least in East Asia at 9.3 per cent, with countries of the Pacific falling in between at 15.5 per cent. The incidence of early marriage was highest in Bangladesh at 48 per cent and lowest in Singapore and China at 1 per cent (year unspecified). Although early marriage is legally banned in most countries of the region, religion-based personal laws are ambiguous in some countries (Center for Reproductive Rights 2004 2005; ARROW 2005, 2008). 39 \u2022 Adolescent fertility (15-19 years), leading to adverse reproductive health outcomes: Comparative data on adolescent fertility rates was available for 26 countriesli from World Health Statistics, 2008 for the period 2000 to 2006 (WHO 2008a). In the 26 countries of Asia-Pacific as a whole, the average adolescent fertility rate was 45.7, when compared to a rate of 118 for Sub-Saharan Africa as of 2007 (World Bank n.d.). The adolescent fertility rate was higher than the Asian average at 77.3 in South and West Asian countries and lower at 32.1 in East Asian countries and 30.7 in Pacific countries for the period 2000 to 2006. The adolescent fertility rate was higher at 49.5 in developing countries and lower at 16.3 in industrialized countries for the period 2000 to 2006. The adolescent fertility rate (see definition)was highest in Afghanistan at 151 and lowest in Republic of Korea at 2. \u2022 Women do not have full decision-making power over reproduction and women bear the burden of contraception in several Asian countries. The government, men and older relatives often determine the number of children women should have and when they can have them. While most countries of the region have adopted anti-natalist population policies, some such as Mongolia have adopted pro-natalist policies and others like Singapore have adopted an ethnically based policy where some communities are encouraged to have more children and others fewer (Center for Reproductive Rights 2004, 2005). The anti-natalist policies of China have resulted in the promotion of forced abortion after the birth of a first child (Center for Reproductive Rights 2005), yet another concern is who bears the burden of contraception. According to the ICPD+10 monitoring report covering nine countries, it is women who bear the burden of contraception in these countries -- India, China, Pakistan, Nepal, Indonesia, Cambodia, Malaysia and Philippines (ARROW 2005). To illustrate, NFHS 3 2005-6 provisional data for India indicates that the contraceptive prevalence rate was 56.3 per cent for all methods and 48.5 per cent for modern methods of contraception (Government of India 2006). Female modern methods (male sterilization and condoms) accounted for 13 per cent of modern contraceptives, and male methods (female sterilization, intra-uterine devices and pills) accounted for 87 per cent of modern contraception (ibid 2006). \u2022 Physical and sexual violence against women in domestic and public spaces. Country statistics on prevalence of domestic violence are not easy to come by. WHO conducted a study on domestic violence covering 10 countries including Japan, New Zealand, Bangladesh, Samoa and Thailand in the Asia-Pacific region. The study rated the prevalence of \u2018ever experienced\u2019 physical or sexual domestic violence at 15 per cent in Japan (1 per cent during pregnancy), 24 to 42 per cent in New Zealand (no data during pregnancy), 35 to54 per cent in Samoa (10 per cent during pregnancy), 53 to 62 per cent in Bangladesh", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "91e0755b-c21c-4c33-9803-c80e5c94d6f0": {"__data__": {"id_": "91e0755b-c21c-4c33-9803-c80e5c94d6f0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "358a9030371f38b3da66051a5df4aec7984f7ae50b0511e2fe597fcd5676cdc0"}, "3": {"node_id": "ac77e5f6-6414-46d6-b7cb-31280fda5bf7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b653de94144ba5991484b46c5d9fa824b4de9678387d34f98ee01c0daaf45bef"}}, "hash": "2041a9f4c2ac8c709b8f88872fe99c7ae32f44ba515a5792b32aa7be3cdb5577", "text": "(10-12 per cent during pregnancy), and 41 to 47 per cent in Thailand (4 per cent during pregnancy) (WHO, 2005b, 2005c, 2005d, 2005e, and 2005f). A study on domestic violence by ICRW in India, cited in UNIFEM 2003 in its report \u2018Ending Violence Against Women\u2019, found the reported incidence of violence in India to be 40 - 66 per cent, with higher rates in urban slums and amongst those with no schooling (UNIFEM 2003). The same publication stated that in Asia- Pacific the incidence of reported violence varied from 10 per cent in the Philippines to 67 per cent in Papua New Guinea (UNIFEM 2003). However, the low reported figures of domestic/intimate partner violence in Japan and Philippines (and amongst educated women in India) needs to be viewed with skepticism as there is a culture of silence on reporting domestic /intimate partner violence. The WHO study also 40 suggests that physical and sexual violence against women in public spaces, taking the form of sexual harassment, molestation, rape, trafficking etc., is also common, though not as high as domestic violence (WHO 2005b, 2005c, 2005d, 2005e, and 2005f). \u2022 Prevalence of customary practices that are harmful to women\u2019s and girls\u2019 health and sexual and reproductive rights: While some customary practices in the region are beneficial to women\u2019s health (e.g. long periods of breast feeding which reduces vulnerability to breast cancer), there are several that are not. Data from the Global Gender Gap Report 2008 on 18 Asia-Pacific countrieslii indicates a prevalence of female genital mutilation in Malaysia, Indonesia and Pakistan (Women\u2019s Economic Forum, 2008). The same report notes a higher prevalence of FGM in Sub-Saharan Africa (present in 18 of 23 countries on which data was available). The Reproductive Health Organization notes that some communities in India practice female genital mutilation as well (Reproductive Health Organisation 2005). There appears to be no law in these countries against female genital mutilation (UNIFEM 2003). In parts of China, India and Republic of Korea the practice of female infanticide occurs occasionally even though legally punishable. In parts of South Asia as well as Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea the practice of forced marriage is not rare, and girls have little choice with regard to the partner (Griffen 2006). In Kiribati, girls upon marriage are expected to prove their virginity on consummation of the marriage, failing which they are ostracized (Griffen 2006). Another customary practice that is harmful to women\u2019s health is the practice of dry sex (removal of vaginal fluid with absorbent materials) which removes sexual pleasure for women (Reproductive Health Organisation 2005). In parts of the Philippines, there is severe restriction placed on women\u2019s weight gain during pregnancy, which leads to poor maternal health (Reproductive Health Organisation 2005). In other instances, particular groups of women such as dalits (untouchables) in parts of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra in India are supposedly married to a local God, but in practice exploited sexually by upper castes. These are just a few examples of how some harmful customary practices affect women\u2019s/girls\u2019 health and sexual and reproductive rights. Some of these practices are sanctioned by conservative religious forces who interpret religious texts out of context, to justify discriminatory practices. Box 6. Health consequences to women and girls of sexual and reproductive rights violations \u2022 The practice of FGM frequently leads to severe bleeding, problems in urinating, and later to childbirth complications, fistula and other disabilities of the mother, and increased chances of newborn deaths (WHO 2008b). \u2022 Child bearing in the age group 15-19 years doubles the rate of deaths due to pregnancy-related complications compared to pregnancies in adult women, increases the rate of neonatal mortality and also increases the total fertility rate (Adhikari 2003). \u2022 Physical and sexual violence against women and girls is one of the important reasons for mental illness amongst women (WHO 2002). Extreme forms -- such as causing burns and injuries -- can lead to death. Sexual violence can further lead to genital and other injuries, sexually-transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS, 41 pelvic pain and pelvic inflammatory disease, urinary tract infections, unwanted pregnancy, unsafe abortion and even death (UNFPA 2000).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ac77e5f6-6414-46d6-b7cb-31280fda5bf7": {"__data__": {"id_": "ac77e5f6-6414-46d6-b7cb-31280fda5bf7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "358a9030371f38b3da66051a5df4aec7984f7ae50b0511e2fe597fcd5676cdc0"}, "2": {"node_id": "91e0755b-c21c-4c33-9803-c80e5c94d6f0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2041a9f4c2ac8c709b8f88872fe99c7ae32f44ba515a5792b32aa7be3cdb5577"}}, "hash": "b653de94144ba5991484b46c5d9fa824b4de9678387d34f98ee01c0daaf45bef", "text": "\u2022 Physical and sexual violence against pregnant women is one significant cause of maternal mortality (UN 2006) \u2022 Dry sex can lead to painful intercourse for women (Reproductive Health Organization 2005) Source: UNFPA 2000; WHO 2002; Adhikari 2003; Reproductive Health Organization 2005; UN 2006; WHO 2008b.

These countries include Cambodia, China, Hong Kong China, Japan, Republic of Korea, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Mongolia, Viet Nam, Indonesia (other than the province of Aceh), Philippines and Thailand in East Asia, Australia, Marshall Islands, New Zealand, Niue, and Vanuatu in the Pacific, and Nepal in South Asia. In another 7 countries (18 per cent of countries) female homosexuality is not considered a crime under the law, but male homosexuality is criminalized. These countries include Singapore, Tuvalu, Tonga, Nauru, Kiribati, Fiji, and Cook Islands. There was no country where female homosexuality is criminalized but male homosexuality is not. Altogether, in 24 of 38 Asia-Pacific countries (63 per cent) female homosexuality is not a crime, while in only 17 out 38 Asia-Pacific countries (45 per cent) is male homosexuality not criminalized. That is, in this respect norms on dominant masculinities are stronger than those on dominant femininities. A total of 14 of 38 (37 per cent) countries ban both female and male homosexuality. These include Afghanistan, Bhutan, India (under dispute), Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Maldives, Islamic Republic of Iran in South and West Asia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa and Solomon Islands in Pacific, and Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia and Myanmar in East Asia. All three industrialized countries in Asia-Pacific have legalized homosexuality, while the developing countries in Asia-Pacific are lagging in this area. In particular, governments of developing countries in the South and West Asian sub-regions are most conservative on their stands, East Asia is more liberal, with the Pacific falling in between. Information on whether countries where homosexuality is legal permit same-sex marriage is available for 16 of 17 countries that permit both female and male homosexuality (Wikipedia 2009). With the exception of Nepal, none of the countries recognize same-sex marriage. There is no data on whether countries where only female homosexuality is not a crime allow same-sex marriages. Apart from legal discrimination, sexual and gender minorities are discriminated against in society. Cases of being thrown out of house or village when LGBTI people reveal their identity are not uncommon. Transgendered and inter-sexed people often end up eking out a livelihood through sex-work. Lesbians and gays are at times forced into heterosexual marriage in parts of South Asia. An ethical issue in the case of inter-sexed minors is whether parents have a right to opt for genital surgery (and choose one sex over another) on their own when a child is under 18 years of age. In Asia, the poor cannot afford genital surgery in private hospitals and leave the children to grow as they are, and these constitute another 42 group suffering discrimination. Wealthy parents, however, may opt for genital surgery (Warner and Bhatia 2006). While instances of sexual violations against heterosexual boys are less frequent than violations against women and girls, they nevertheless exist. In tourist spots in Asia-Pacific, boys from poor households may be compelled into prostitution for survival. 4.1.4 Social Construction of Masculinities and Gender Differentials in Health Gender norms lead to different health outcomes for women, men and sexual/gender minorities There are gender norms that disadvantage men which are not necessarily considered gender discrimination, but arise from the construction of dominant masculinities, where the transition from adolescence to adulthood is associated with consumption of tobacco, drinking alcohol, fast driving, boarding running buses, having sex with multiple partners and substance use (WHO 2002, 2003a). These unhealthy behaviours adversely affect men\u2019s health, and the health of women who relate with them (Nessa et al. 2008). However, the gap between men and women who use tobacco and other substances is lower amongst the younger generation than the older. \u2022 Gender norms lead to higher current tobacco use amongst adult males than females in 27 of the 28 Asia-Pacific countriesliv for which data was available, and more adversely affect the health of adult males as of 2005 (computed from WHO 2008a). The lone country where tobacco consumption was higher amongst adult females than adult males was Nauru in the Pacific. In New Zealand and Australia the current prevalence of tobacco use was only slightly higher amongst adult men than adult women (the female-to-male ratio for tobacco use was over 0.75 in both these countries). In the 28 countries the ratio of adult female-to-male current tobacco use was 0.27.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "79019695-1153-49ef-b6b3-071447d849a9": {"__data__": {"id_": "79019695-1153-49ef-b6b3-071447d849a9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5b20f363800e2ed5c34615448996418bbd1e5b62043f61224328feb3d9012c76"}, "2": {"node_id": "076d5132-6c6b-494e-98de-6216fd214a35", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5d51a047a686b6d1efc1cd950594d852a964ca273233dab97a9e091139d2886f"}}, "hash": "eeb8fe5c35b4a73ddec06afd7ac13eddbb7634fc90c56c061f10237751d07a8f", "text": "The ratio of female-to-male current tobacco use was higher in the case of the Pacific (0.50), below the average in South and West Asia (0.24), and below the average in the case of East Asia (0.15).

In New Zealand and Cook Islands a greater proportion of adolescent girls use tobacco than boys. The female-to-male ratio in tobacco use was more than 0.75 in Republic of Korea, Fiji, Federated States of Micronesia, Samoa, Tuvalu, and Bangladesh (WHO 2008a). Tobacco use by men and women adversely affects their health and is one of the contributing causes of tuberculosis, lung cancer and oral cancer. In women it increases chances of cervical cancer as well (Sen et al. 2007). 43 Box 7. Adverse health consequences for men of unhealthy behaviour arising out of gender norms Women are more \u2018biologically\u2019 exposed to HIV transmission from men to women through heterosexual sex (WHO 2003b). However, gender norms lead to higher incidence of HIV amongst males than females (15-49 years) in 17 lviii lv (61 per cent) of 28 Asia-Pacific countries for which data was available (year unspecified) from the State of the World\u2019s Population, 2007 with the incidencelvi similar in 10lvii (36 per cent), and greater amongst females in one -- 3 per cent (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) (UNFPA 2007). The HIV prevalence rate was highest for males in Papua New Guinea at 1.8 (followed by Thailand at 1.7) and for females in (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) at 1.6 (followed by Thailand and Papua New Guinea at 1.2). While it is difficult to compute averages (as figures are not specific), the HIV prevalence rates seem slightly higher in East Asia than South and West Asia (with the exception of India and Nepal), and for developing compared with industrialized countries. As data was available on few Pacific countries it is difficult to comment on the sub-region. The higher prevalence of HIV amongst males than females (15-49) years may not hold true for the age group 15-24 years, where prevalence amongst females is higher than males as of 2007 according to the World Development Indicators database (0.2:1 in East Asia and Pacific and 0.3:1 in South Asia) but not as stark as in Sub-Saharan Africa (3.3:1)(World Bank n.d.) Mortality due to tuberculosis and road traffic accidents is higher for men than women in both East Asia and the Pacific and South Asia (Lopez et al 2006, on behalf of the World Bank). However, all men may not be equally vulnerable to tobacco use, substance use and excess alcohol consumption. According to micro studies from India, Indonesia, Samoa and Papua New Guinea men from low-income groups engage in the above practices more than those from middle/high-income groups. Inability to perform socially accepted roles as breadwinners may drive men to adopt harmful practices (Ng et al. 2007 Nasir and Rosenthal 2008, Sorensen et al 2005, Neufeld et al. 2005, Mishra et al. 2005). This may not apply to road accidents. Evidence from Afghanistan and Samoa suggests that road accidents are higher amongst young men irrespective of income groups (Sugerman et al. 2005, Lippe et al. 2008). Source: Lopez et al. 2006 ; Mishra et al. 2005 ; Nasir and Rosenthal 2008 ; Ng et al. 2007 ; Neufeld et al. 2005 ; Sorenson et al. 2005 ; WHO 2008a. \u2022 Gender norms lead to greater acceptance of multi-partner sex amongst men than women. Data on legal acceptance of polygamy is available for 17 Asia-Pacific countrieslix(all developing), which indicates that the practice of polygamy is prevalent in 8 of the 17 countries namely Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, India, Islamic Republic of Iran, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka from the Global Gender Gap Report, 2008 (World Economic Forum, 2008). The nine countries where polygamy was not reported were China, Japan, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Viet Nam, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand, Australia and New Zealand.

In these countries, females may find it more difficult to pay for private health services than men as they earn less, and most of the private expenditure is in the form of out-of-pocket paymentslxi (WHO 2008a). These countries include Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Viet Nam, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Public expenditure was more than private health expenditure in all the 15 Pacific countries for which data was available, while the reverse was true in the case of 6 of the 9 (66.7 per cent) of the South and West Asian countries (with the exception of Maldives, Bhutan and the Islamic Republic of Iran). The case of East Asian countries fell in between, with 9 of the 16 (56.3 per cent) countries recording higher private than public expenditure on health. Public expenditure was 75.5 per cent of total expenditure in industrialized Asia-Pacific countries, 57.9 per cent in developing Asia-Pacific countries, and 61.0 per cent in the region as a whole. \u2022 As part of health sector reforms, several countries have introduced user fees in public facilities in Asia-Pacific. To give an example, user fees have been introduced in 6 of the 8 Pacific developing countries (studied by WHO) in the last decade wherein public expenditure has been traditionally higher than private health expenditure. These countries include Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, Cook Islands and Federated States of Micronesia. The Government of Tonga and Samoa have been cautious in the past about introducing user fees, though Samoa has recently stated an interest in such fees (WHO, 2008c). In Cook Islands, user fees are applicable for people in the age group 17 to 60 years (ibid, 2008a). While it is too early to comment on the impact of user fees on gender and economic inequities in health, experience from Andhra Pradesh in India suggests that user fees could have a gender- differentiated impact. With an increase in user fee revenues earned by a sample of 219 public sector hospitals managed by Andhra Pradesh Vaidhya Vidhana Parishad from Rs 3.062 million in 2001/2 to 7.751 million ($69591 to $176159 at Rs 44 to a US$) in 2003/04 the proportion of deliveries in hospitals accounted for by the poor declined from 74 per cent to 53 per cent during the same period, and the proportion of surgeries accounted for by the poor declined from 82 per cent to 74 per cent. That is, in general utilization by the poor declined and the utilization of delivery services decreased even more, indicating that the introduction of user fees has a gender- differentiated impact. Though user fee exemptions were supposed to have been in place for the poor, these were not effectively operational (Mahal and Veerabhraiah 2005). 45 \u2022 Universal social insurance exists in only a few countries, which is important given that majority of women workers are engaged in the informal sector (see next section). In a study on health financing in 8 Asian countries (Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, China and Viet Nam) universal social insurance was provided in only one, Thailand (Ravindran 2005). Following economic reforms in the 1980s, China dismantled its commune-level prepayment cooperative medical scheme, which had been partly subsidized by the government. The dismantling of the prepayment scheme affected maternal and reproductive health services adversely, aside from family planning services which continued through another delivery stream. However, a scheme was reintroduced in 1998 through the World Bank supported Health VII project in 71 poor counties out of approximately 2400 counties (ibid 2005).

Social security expenditure as a percentage of total government expenditure was 12.3 per cent in developing countries and 39 per cent in industrialized countries as of 2005. \u2022 Coverage of the poor in general and of poor women by private health insurance is minimal, and many private insurance packages do not cover important health needs of women and gender/sexual minorities. Private health insurance as a percentage of total private health expenditure was only 4.4 per cent for 40 Asia-Pacific countries for which information was available for 2005 from the World Health Statistics, 2008 with 80.9 per cent being out-of-pocket expenditure. Further, private health insurance normally does not cover several health service needs that affect women such as institutional deliveries or treatment for morbidities arising from gender-based violence. Neither are specific needs of sexual/gender minorities such as sex reassignment surgery or genital surgery covered. (Ravindran 2005; Murthy and Ravindran 2005). Quite often private insurance does not cover preventive health services. It is not clear whether male-specific cancers are covered through private insurance. 4.2 Impact of gender inequities in the economy on gender inequities in health Gender inequities in the economy have a bearing on gender inequities in exposure to health risks, ability to access health care, compliance with treatment, and on violations of sexual and reproductive rights in work place. These often adversely affect the health of women, sexual and gender minorities, and men in risky occupations. Five pathways that link gender inequities in the economy and health can be identified, which are elaborated in this section. 4.2.1 Pathway 1 The gender division of labor results in heavy work load and greater health risks for women/girls and different occupational health risks for women/girls and men/boys \u2022 Gender differences in work load and women\u2019s health: Data on total work hours in market and non-market activities was available for five countries for the period 1997 to 2005 from the Human Development Report 2007/2008 namely India, Republic of 46 Korea, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. The data indicates that in all five countries women work longer hours than men on a typical day, with the difference being least in the case of New Zealand (3 minutes more) and highest in India (1 hour and 6 minutes more). In Australia, women work 17 minutes more than men, in Japan women work 30 minutes more than men, while in Republic of Korea women work 39 minutes more (in rural areas 36 minutes more). That is, gender differences in work load are not automatically less in industrialized countries, with much depending on gender norms. Japan is reported to impose rigid gender norms and hence it is not surprising that the work load of women is much more than that of men, when compared with New Zealand or Australia. Though the work load of women is higher than that of men, in all countries the proportion of time spent by women on market activities is significantly less than that of men (other than in rural parts of Republic of Korea. Non-market activities include fetching water, cleaning and cooking, taking care of children and the elderly and taking care of the sick and people with disability. The heavier work load of women leads to greater musculoskeletal problems (including during pregnancy) and less time to access health care services (WHO 2000a). In Nepal, the heavy work load of women in the hill and mountain areas in the immediate post-delivery period leads to a high incidence of uterine-prolapse (UNICEF 2006b) The work load of women in Sub-Saharan Africa may be heavier than in Asia-Pacific, as in the former women have less access to improved water and sanitation facilities, and their economic participation rates are higher. \u2022 Gender division of tasks and different health risks for women and men: 30.5 per cent of women in 20 Asia-Pacific countrieslxiii for which information was available from the Human Development Report were engaged in agriculture, 16.5 per cent in industries and 51.6 per cent in services for the period 1995-2005 (computed from UNDP 2007). The comparative figures for Sub-Saharan Africa are 67.3 per cent, 7.1 per cent and 25.3 per cent respectively as of 2007 (UNIFEM 2008). Further, in Sub- Saharan Africa women also played a major role in managing food crops in Asia. The figures for 17 developing Asia-Pacific countries (35.1 per cent, 17.1 per cent and 46.1 per cent respectively) are different from industrialized ones (4.3 per cent, 12.7 per cent and 83 per cent respectively), with a greater proportion in agriculture", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1457471f-1f0d-4d4f-82db-9323d7e2352f": {"__data__": {"id_": "1457471f-1f0d-4d4f-82db-9323d7e2352f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e8eaf49d4ba0fe701ee447d4bd86750361e1cfd8b2f2d3cbee8c30bd28ab82ed"}}, "hash": "e8eaf49d4ba0fe701ee447d4bd86750361e1cfd8b2f2d3cbee8c30bd28ab82ed", "text": "in the case of the former. A greater proportion of women workers are engaged in agriculture in South and West Asia than in East Asia (information was available on few Pacific countries). As observed by Ostlin (2002), there is a strong division of labor in each of these sectors. In agriculture, women in much of Asia-Pacific were responsible for tasks such as weeding, transplanting, and winnowing, while men were responsible for tilling the land and irrigation. Harvesting was done by both women and men. The weeding and transplanting work that women do involves bending for long periods of time leading to back pain and water-borne diseases (WHO 2000a). Similarly, there is a division of tasks/roles in industrial occupations. A study of women in the garment industry in Fiji noted that women had to sit in a fixed position and do repetitive jobs, and that they suffered from body pains, obesity, bladder and kidney problems. Fewer men are engaged in the garment industry, and most are engaged in supervisory posts; in general, they did not face similar problems (Chand 2006). In the service sector, where the proportion of women is increasing in Asia-Pacific countries, there are occupational health risks as well. Women in night shifts in business process outsourcing offices experience considerable stress and experience changes in their menstrual cycles. At times the gender division of task disadvantages men\u2019s health. Men who dominate the mining sector, for example, were found to suffer from high 47 rates of respiratory infections, mercury poisoning or to have lower body mass index than men in other occupations in China and Thailand. The few women in mining had even lower body mass index than men (Du et al. 2008). Men who were involved in deep sea fishing had a high rate of cataract problems and headaches (WHO 2006a) 4.2.2 Pathway 2 Intra-household biases against females in distribution of food or education expenditure or health care expenditure leads to greater health risks for women and girls and less access to health care in several Asia-Pacific countries. \u2022 Intra-household biases in food allocation lead to gender differences in nutrition status. There is no country data on gender bias in allocation of food. A review of literature on intra-household food distribution by the International Food Policy Research Institute covering India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan in South Asia and Philippines in South-East Asia (apart from other developing countries) noted that in South Asia, of 24 studies comparing food and protein intake of males and females, 11 showed a pro-male bias, 4 showed a pro-female bias and 9 showed no bias. Less gender bias in food allocation was observed in Pakistan. In India, boys were also prioritized in breast feeding. There was no trend of decreasing inequity in food intake with a rise in income, although inequity is greater in poor households during lean periods. In the Philippines, of 16 studies, 8 show a pro-male bias, none show a pro- female bias and the rest reveal no bias. Gender bias was however more prominent amongst adults than children in the Philippines (Haddad et al. 1996). The same study noted no gender bias in food allocation in Sub-Saharan Africa (ibid 1996). \u2022 Park and Rukumnuaykit note gender bias in food allocation against girls in China as well, with fathers in poor households cutting their food intake when boys are born but not when girls are born (cited in Gammaage 2006). Studies in the Pacific have noted that in Papua New Guinea, girls were given less food than boys, while in Fiji it is women who eat last (Griffen 2006). It is hence not surprising that data from South Asia and the Pacific suggest that malnutrition rates are higher amongst females than males amongst children, anemia rates are higher amongst females than males and that body mass index of adult women is less than that of men (see section on gender inequities in health). \u2022 Intra-household inequalities in education expenditure and gender inequities in health: There was little country data on intra-household expenditure on education by sex. An indirect indicator lxvii lxiv is gross enrollment at primary, secondary and tertiary schooling. Data as of 2005 from the Human Development Report, 2007/2008 suggests that there is a gender bias against females in primary enrolment in 9 countries out of 30lxv, in secondary enrolment in 16 countries out of 30lxvi and at tertiary levels in 9 countries out of 26 for which data was available .

In absolute terms, female gross enrolment was 105 per cent at primary levels, but only 71 per cent in secondary levels and 27 per cent at tertiary levels in the Asia-Pacific countries for which data was available (developing countries, 104.9 per cent, 64.9 per cent and 19.8 per cent respectively). Gross enrolment at secondary and tertiary levels for females (as well as males) was lowest in South and West Asia and highest in East Asia, with 48 the Pacific countries falling in between. This may imply that a substantial proportion of girls are vulnerable to early marriage in South and West Asia and the Pacific. (Selvaratnam 1988). It may also imply that girls need to contribute to household tasks, other discrimination etc. The gender gap disadvantaging girls in primary, secondary and tertiary gross enrolment is higher for Sub-Saharan Africa when compared with Asia-Pacific for 2005, and absolute levels of female primary, secondary and tertiary enrolment are lower at 92 per cent, 28 per cent and 4 per cent respectively (UNDP 2007). \u2022 Intra-household biases in health care expenditure lead to less access of females to treatment for health conditions. There is little country data on gender bias in health care expenditure. A study of urban households in Bangladesh observed that girls suffering from severe diarrhea were less likely to be seen by a licensed allopath (adjusted for income), while in rural households female children suffering from diarrhea were less likely to receive an antibiotic (Larson et al. 2006). A study in rural China covering 5057 people noted that females were more likely to go blind as a result of cataract, corneal opacity and glaucoma all of which were treatable, than men, (Li et al. 2008). In Papua New Guinea, a study of 4348 people noted that distance to health facilities was a deterrent to seeking health care, with differences observed across age and sex. Attendance decreased markedly with a distance of 3.5 kilometers and above. Female patients showed higher distance decay during infancy, but less distance decay in adolescence and adulthood when compared with males (M\u00fcller et al. 1998). 4.2.3 Pathway 3 Gender inequities in earned income, control over household income, and ownership of assets mean that women have less cash-in-hand for health care expenditure \u2022 Gender inequalities in earned income: Data on 29 Asia-Pacific countrieslxviii from the UNDP\u2019s Human Development Report 2007/2008 indicates that the ratio of female-to- male earnings was only .52 (year unspecified) and there was no country in which females earned as much as or more than males (computed from UNDP 2007). Data was not available by age, marital status or occupation. The comparative figure was 0.6 for 24 Sub Saharan African countries on which data was available from the Global Gender Gap Report, 2008 (World Economic Forum 2008). The same report indicates that female economic activity rates as a percentage of male economic activity rates was 67.6 per cent for 32 Asia-Pacific countrieslxix for which data was available, indicating the potential for gender disparities in wageslxx. The comparative figure for Sub-Saharan Africa was 73 per cent as of 2005 (UNDP 2007). Disaggregating data for Asia-Pacific further, the ratio of female-to-male earned income was lowest at 0.41 in South and West Asia and highest in the Pacific at 0.58, and falling in between in East Asia at 0.53. In developing countries, the ratio of female-to-male earned income was 0.51 and in industrialized countries was 0.62. The countries where female IMR is higher than or the same as male IMR and where under-five female mortality was higher than or the same as male under-five mortality correspond with countries where females earn 52 per cent or less of what males earn, other than Viet Nam and China (where the one-child population policy may have a role to play).

As they were paid such low salaries, these women stated that they were pushed into prostitution to supplement income. They were subjected to physical violence, alcohol and substance use, both self-taken and forced, and receive meager wages. The prevalence of HIV amongst women in the garment industry was noted to be high (Nishigaya 2002). A study by Sarkar et al. (2008) of 580 women compelled into prostitution in Eastern India (from India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan) noted that one in four had been trafficked; including some sold by their own poor family members without their knowledge. Physical and sexual violence on entry to the work was higher among those trafficked than among those who had joined knowingly. Overall condom use with the last two clients was only 38 per cent. The incidence of HIV/AIDS was higher amongst trafficked women. Source: Nishigaya 2002; Sarkar et al. 2008. \u2022 Gender inequalities in control over household income and gender inequities in health: Country data on control over household income was not available. A micro-level study commissioned by UNDP in the early 2000s found links between control over income and access to skilled birth attendance. The study observed that women who were part of self-help groups (SHGs) which had received training on gender and social issues exercised greater control over their income and had greater access to skilled birth attendance than non-members with similar economic and education status when the group started. The study covered 157 poor women who were not members of SHGs and 293 members who were members of SHGs which were formed under the South Asia Poverty Alleviation Program. Only 31 per cent of non-members exercised full or major control over their income and only 19.5 per cent over their husbands\u2019 income. Only 45 per cent of those who had undergone delivery in the last three years had access to skilled birth attendance. In contrast, amongst members of the UNDP- initiated South Asia Poverty Alleviation programme who were in the same income group when they joined the group, 52 per cent reported having control over their income and 46 per cent over their husband\u2019s income. Of members who had delivered in the last three years, 68 per cent had access to skilled birth attendance. While the income of programme members was 1/6th more than the income of non-member households, the percentage of skilled birth attendance was nearly 40 per cent more amongst members; indicating that control over their own and their spouse\u2019s income 50 could play an important role in improving women\u2019s access to health care. This aspect merits further investigation, as access to health information could also have played a role (Murthy et al. 2005). Similar positive benefits in women\u2019s access to health services were noted in Uttar Pradesh when micro-credit interventions are linked with gender inputs -- including an emphasis on women\u2019s control over their income (GEAG 2004). \u2022 Gender inequalities in land ownership and health rights violations against women: The OECD Women, Gender and Institution database http://webnet.oecd.org/wbos/index.aspx , provides data on male preference in inheritance of land for 14 Asia-Pacific countries (year unspecified) The report gives a score of 0-1 for equity in gender preference in inheritance with a score of 0 denoting equity and 1 denoting high levels of male-preference inequity. According to this scoring, male preference in inheritance is absent or low (less than or equal to 0.2) in Myanmar, Thailand, Fiji, Sri Lanka, Philippines, Indonesia and China and is strongly present (score of 0.7 and above) in Bangladesh, Islamic Republic of Iran, Pakistan, Malaysia, India, and Nepal; with Viet Nam falling in between (0.5). But the classification of China as scoring low in China in the light of evidence of the light of evidence from secondary literature to the contrary. . Though this database did not cover several Pacific countries, Griffen (2006) notes that traditional equal land rights of women and men were eroded under European colonization and now in several Polynesian Pacific countries land is owned by men. A joint study of 502 married women in Kerala, India by the Institute of Economic Growth and Center for Development Studies observes that those who own land faced less domestic violence than women who did not. As many as 49 per cent of the women who owned neither land nor house suffered long-term incidence of physical violence, compared with 18 per cent and 10 per cent respectively of those", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5a5edcbe-3872-4893-93fb-a6e77c3e1905": {"__data__": {"id_": "5a5edcbe-3872-4893-93fb-a6e77c3e1905", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "808ee95eb3a3077fe1bcbefeabe1006aae95a81631d8ffb81d677981d5ec0ee3"}}, "hash": "808ee95eb3a3077fe1bcbefeabe1006aae95a81631d8ffb81d677981d5ec0ee3", "text": "who owned either land or a house, and 7 per cent of those who owned both. The percentage of women facing violence who left the violent situation was much higher among the propertied (71 per cent) than among those without property (19 per cent). Few propertied women returned after leaving. Dowry harassment by husbands or in-laws was also lower amongst women with property (InfoChange News and Features 2003). Gender inequalities in infant and under-five mortality rates are not present in the countries scoring low on male preference as the per the World Health Statistics, 2008 (WHO 2008a). The reverse is true in the case of the countries wherein male preference in inheritance prevails (other than Islamic Republic of Iran). Land ownership in Sub-Saharan Africa varies, with Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia following matrilineal inheritance systems (under threat with individual registration process), Lesotho and Swaziland following patrilineal inheritance system, and several promoting clan ownership (Benschop 2004). However, women have access to their own land in Sub Saharan Africa for cultivation of food. Bride price rather than dowry is the norm in most of the Sub-Saharan countries. 4.2.4 Pathway 4 Low and unequal presence of women in the work force in the formal sector means they have less access to health insurance/security than men while working, and less access to means to pay for health care services and to meet their health needs 51 Almost all women like men in agriculture in Asia-Pacific work in the informal sector. Data on employment in the informal sector as a percentage of non-agricultural employment for the period 1998-2002 was available from the Human Development Report, 2007/2008 for four Asia-Pacific countries: Indonesia, Philippines, India and Pakistan (UNDP 2007). The data indicates the presence of a slightly greater proportion of women than men in non-agriculture in the informal sector, other than in Pakistan; where the proportion of men in non-agricultural in the informal sector was higher than that of women. On average, 68 per cent of women in non-agriculture were in the informal sector in these four countries, with the proportion being higher for Indonesia and Philippines and lower for India and Pakistan (UNDP 2007). Taken together with the agriculture sector, a majority of women workers in developing Asia-Pacific countries work in the informal sector. Though this is also true for men workers, the proportion of men in the informal sector is slightly lower given that they are slightly less often engaged in agriculture than are women (37 per cent of women workers vs. 35 per cent of men workers). This increases gender inequities in access to health care especially in those countries where private expenditure on health as a proportion of total health expenditure is higher than public health expenditure, which is the case in 36.6 per cent of Asia-Pacific countries. 4.2.5 Pathway 5 Women\u2019s and gender/sexual minorities\u2019 specific health needs are rarely taken into account in the work place, and rarely does the work place promote parenting roles of males. \u2022 Maternity leave: Given that women workers are mainly engaged in the informal sector in developing Asia-Pacific countries, they are not eligible for maternity coverage from employers. Data from the Global Gender Gap Report, 2008 provides details on the period of maternity leave provided for by law in 19lxxii lxxiii Asia-Pacific countries in the formal sector (World Economic Forum 2008). The data suggests that on an average, women are legally eligible for 3.0 months of paid maternity leave in these 19 Asia-Pacific countries, with the period being 2.9 months in developing countries and 3.5 months in industrialized countries. The number of months of paid maternity leave was slightly higher in the Pacific at 3.0 months when compared with South and West Asia at 2.8 months (information was available only on Pacific industrialized countries, which makes the figure artificially high). Amongst the 19 countries, the number of months of paid maternity leave ranged from 1.7 months in Nepal to 5 months in Viet Nam, where a greater proportion of women belong to unions. The number of months of maternity leave was lower than Viet Nam at 3.5 months in Japan and New Zealand. That is, levels of economic development of a country do not guarantee increase in paid maternity leave; the sensitivity of the government to maternal health needs of women as well as women\u2019s presence in trade unions makes a difference. This is equally true of parental leave, with Australia scoring a low 1 out of a possible 15 on the Gender Equality Index (in parental leave), Japan scoring 5 and New Zealand 8; and all three ranking below the average figure for", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "48b9c83c-4dfc-4b74-acac-8e629fa94ae4": {"__data__": {"id_": "48b9c83c-4dfc-4b74-acac-8e629fa94ae4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "776abb6568fbb2b2ea3a68429174844a12b6255bec2ec7a37d03f9904641d2c1"}}, "hash": "776abb6568fbb2b2ea3a68429174844a12b6255bec2ec7a37d03f9904641d2c1", "text": "21 industrialized countries. The scores may be lower if one takes into account the actual practice of men availing themselves of parental leave, and taking care of children (Ray et al 2008). \u2022 Data on the amount of paid maternity leave for those in the formal sector was available for 19lxxiv Asia-Pacific countries from the Global Gender Gap Report, 2008 (World 52 Economic Forum 2008). On average, by legislation 90.6 per cent of the wage was supposed to be provided in the 19 countries during the maternity leave period .The proportion of salary paid during the maternity period was higher in South and West Asia (94.5 per cent) than in East Asia (86.8 per cent). (Information was only available on industrialized countries of the Pacific, which makes the figure artificially high). The percentage of maternity leave paid was higher in developing countries (91.4 per cent) than in industrialized countries (80 per cent). That is, the higher the numbers of months of maternity leave, the lower the proportion of salary paid by law. Fourteen countries mandated 100 per cent payment of maternity leave, namely China, Republic of Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Viet Nam, New Zealand, Niue, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. \u2022 In the formal sector (and even less so in the informal sector), there is no policy of taking into account the sex-specific health needs of women or sexual/gender minorities beyond socially sanctioned motherhood. To give an example, single women live-in heterosexual couples and lesbian couples who choose to have a child are rarely allowed maternity leave or benefits in several developing Asia-Pacific countries. In some countries, maternity leave is rarely given for married couples who adopt. Seldom is extra leave available for miscarriages or induced abortion (where legal), and in fact there is a taboo about discussing miscarriages and abortion in several countries. There is no provision for reduced travel for women employees during the first two days of monthly menstruation when the flow may be heavier. In low-paid jobs such as stitching in the garment sector, there are restrictions on how many times women can use toilets, while observers report that men supervisors take frequent breaks for smokinglxxv. Sexual/gender minorities, in the rare instances that they find work in the formal sector, do not get paid leave or receive health benefits for sex assignment surgery or for availing themselves of assisted reproductive technologies. 4.2.6 Pathway 6 There are direct violations of the right to health and sexual rights affecting women, sexual/gender minorities in the work place and men/women with stigmatized illnesses. \u2022 Mental, physical and sexual rights violations in the work place: Though there is little global/UN/data site/country data on incidence of sexual harassment against women, boys and gender minorities at the work place, harassment is not uncommon in Asia- Pacific countries. Human Rights Watch (2008) notes that millions of women from Asian countries including Indonesia, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, and Nepal migrate to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon, Singapore and Malaysia as legal or illegal domestic workers. Most countries exclude domestic workers from protection under their labor laws, leaving domestic workers with little remedy against exploitative working conditions. Authorities in both receiving and sending countries receive thousands of complaints of labor exploitation or abuse each year. While most cases involve unpaid wages, food deprivation, and long working hours with no rest, a significant number of cases include allegation of verbal, physical, and sexual abuse. But many cases are never officially reported, due to domestic workers' confinement in private homes, lack of information about their rights, and employers' ability to deport them before they can seek help. The psychological and sexual health of migrant domestic workers is an important issue (Human Rights Watch 2008). 53 \u2022 Mental violence against sexual and gender minorities in the work place: While data on the incidence of discrimination against gender and sexual minorities in the work place is hard to come by, there is perhaps no country in Asia-Pacific where no discrimination is found. Discrimination takes the form of not being given employment (if orientation is disclosed), being asked to leave work if the employer finds out their sexual/gender identity, not being allowed to use female/male toilet once their gender orientation is known, and being denied medical expenses for any health needs specific to them. All these lead to considerable stress and stress-related morbidity such as high blood pressure (GayJapanNews et al. 2008). See Box 9 for an example. Box 9.

However, she continued to wear women\u2019s clothes to her office. Her employer fired her in April 2002. The woman subsequently filed a lawsuit and won the case in June 2002.

However, there is no legislation against discrimination of gender minorities in the work place, leading to considerable agony and stress for the majority of gender minorities in Japan. Source: GayJapanNews et al. 2008. 4.3 Impact of gender inequities in health on gender inequities in the economy Gender inequities in health impact gender inequities in the economy through five pathways discussed below. 4.3.1 Pathway 1 Health morbidities and stigma from gender/sexual-based violence force women who were previously working to lose their jobs or prevent them from going out and work. There is little information on the impact of gender/sexual-based violence against women on their work force participation, participation in group economic activities, or earnings of women, and virtually no cross-country data on this issue. However, micro studies from Uttar Pradesh, India indicate that fear of increased domestic violence is one of the reasons why some women do not join economic programs initiated by the government or NGOs (Gorakhpur Environment Action Group 2004). Disfigurement through gender-based violence could lead to women opting to drop out of work, as was the case of some of the adult womenlxxvi lxxvii survivors of acid violence in Bangladesh. Public ridicule was not uncommon. (Acid Survivors\u2019 Foundation/Save the Children Sweden Denmark 2005). Even women professionals in the formal sector, when subject to harassment at the work place by their husbands or ex-partners, are at times given a warning by their employers not to ruin the \u2018work atmosphere\u2019 and reputation of their company . 54 4.3.2 Pathway 2 Poor access to controversial and low priority sexual and reproductive health services, even where legal, leads to loss of income for women, men and sexual/gender minorities. Some reproductive health services, even when legal, are not easily available in public health facilities. A case in point is abortion, which is available on demand in only 6 out 42 Asia- Pacific countries for which information was available. Women hence have to make repeated visits to public health facilities to prove either that their life is at risk, or that they have been raped, or that there is abnormal development of the fetus. Hence many go to private providers, often providing unsafe abortion at high costs. Women seeking abortion lose considerable time, earnings and at times assets, affecting their long-term economic security (Potdar et al. 2008). Other health services required by women are less controversial, but not easily available in public health facilities in developing Asia-Pacific, and hence even the poor have to access these from providers at considerable cost and loss of earnings. A case in point is infertility services for women and men, which are not available in many low- and middle- income developing countries such as India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, Cambodia, and Lao People's Democratic Republic. This may also be true of men with testicular, penile or prostate cancer, screening and testing of which is not part of essential service packages. Such loss of income may also be true in the case of poor trans-gender persons who need treatment for unsafe castration/emasculation though this aspect has been little studied. 4.3.3 Pathway 3 The high expenditure of men on tobacco and alcohol in poor households in several countries leads to lower contributions by men for household needs, and lessens the ability of women to use part of their income to improve their enterprises. As mentioned in the section on gender inequities in health, tobacco, excess alcohol and substance use amongst males is higher than amongst females, and according to a few studies higher in poor households than economically well off households due to greater economic stress. Such unhealthy behavior reduces men\u2019s economic contribution to the household, and in extreme cases women have to run the household purely with their own earnings. In worst cases, men who are addicted to substances demand part of women\u2019s earnings for their habits. As a result, poor self-employed women who live with partners who are prone to tobacco use, substance use, and excess alcohol consumption are rarely able to invest in expansion of their enterprises. 4.3.4 Pathway 4 Loss of employment of men and women living with HIV It is not uncommon", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d6a06445-7721-4dc4-a872-7fc99a420d6a": {"__data__": {"id_": "d6a06445-7721-4dc4-a872-7fc99a420d6a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "94f75493edb42084c5a5badc092659679266c4f85c5e921d9b844d8815ef428a"}, "3": {"node_id": "cd50ba04-5e2e-4c64-b63f-fb0784c3821a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e950ec2d6f8cb216c0a81c211465c135220bb1150af4af694c9569d542ca6843"}}, "hash": "12a6fac6e22121dc63ed1ba34e2c23fbeab54d58f0edaea0b49bcb316fec79a7", "text": "for men and women living with HIV in Asia-Pacific to be dismissed when an employer finds out about their condition. Laws protecting against such discrimination are not common in most Asia-Pacific countries. A study in Indonesia, Philippines, India and Thailand carried out in 2003 covering 753 HIV-positive respondents revealed that one in five people reported some discrimination within the workplace setting. The Philippines cohort experienced the highest proportion of workplace discrimination, with people losing their jobs (33 per cent), or with job description or duties being changed (44 per cent), or losing prospects for promotion (21 per cent). The study unfortunately did not 55 examine whether men or women living with HIV suffered greater work place discriminated. Such discriminatory practices cause considerable mental agony, and increase inability to pay for treatment (Paxton n.d). 4.3.5 Pathways 5 Loss of access of women to housing and land when husbands die of stigmatized conditions such as AIDS In parts of South Asia wives are blamed when men die of HIV or tuberculosis. At times they are denied access to land and houses owned by their husbands. Such economic violations are higher when wives are found to be HIV positive. HIV-positive women have little access to resources for their own treatment (Swaminathan et al. 2007)). In the case that the wife dies first from communicable diseases, the widower is not denied access to the few assets such as jewels which she may have owned. 4.3.6 Pathways 6 Gender inequities in DALYS due to gender differences in mortality and morbidity The sum of years of potential life lost due to premature mortality and the years of productive life lost due to disability (due to morbidity or physical disability) is referred to as DALY (disability-adjusted life year). Though the concept of DALY has come under criticism from a gender lens as it places value on cost-efficiency and overlooks the rights to health of women, marginalized men and sexual/gender minorities (see Castillo et al. 2005 for a critique), data produced by the World Bank on mortality and burden of diseases disaggregated by sex, age and two sub-regionslxxviii provides interesting insights (Lopez et al. 2006 on behalf of World Bank). \u2022 Total DALY from all causes is slightly higher for females than males in South Asia, but not East Asia and Pacific. \u2022 Gender inequities in infant, child and adolescent health and poor maternal health in several South Asian countries and the greater mortality of South Asian females in the 0-4, 5-14, 15-29 and 80+ years age groups leads to a greater burd
