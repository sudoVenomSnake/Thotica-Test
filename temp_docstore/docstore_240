These structures and systems have over the years been ignored or manipulated in ways that perpetuate human rights violations. The KNCHR believes that there is need to revive and encourage cultural structures and practices that can be used to protect the vulnerable in society, especially women and children. There is need to breathe life into known but little used alternative methods and traditional cultural safety nets, which have since time immemorial been used to redress disputes and prevent human rights violations. Using cultural frameworks to address human rights and development is imperative: in spite of the protection offered by national laws and formal institutions, many vulnerable members of society are unable to seek redress from the mainstream legal justice system in their claim for their rights. The formal legal system has by and large worked to the detriment of the vulnerable in society in regard to the protection and enforcement of their human rights. In the case of land for example, which is so critical to securing livelihoods, women\u2019s share of land ownership is a meagre 5 %. Why deal with traditional structures? Cultural institutions form the first line of governance structure in the lives of many rural communities in Kenya. The majority of families in the country conduct their transactions on issues such as ownership and inheritance of property in accordance with customs. To effectively intervene in matters relating to human rights, one must therefore address issues relating to customs and traditions. Human rights defenders need to dialogue with elders; they need to identify and work with cultural structures that are supportive of human rights and development. Since cultural institutions are a real and present structure in Kenyan society it is important to acknowledge this and to work with them in addition to formal structures. This is not to downplay the role of formal structures. Rather, we need to recognize that, whereas the legal and formal structures are important, they are not accessible to the majority. Therefore, insisting on only working with them amounts to the marginalization of those unable to access them. We believe that only a multi- dimensional approach in addressing human rights and development will help to achieve the realization of ESC rights for the most vulnerable. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 32 Module 2 The Project Experience in Luo Nyanza The KNCHR in partnership with Health Policy Initiative (Futures Group) and the Luo Council of Elders (Luo is one among several Kenyan communities) has been involved in \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d work under its women\u2019s property and inheritance rights project that challenges the status quo regarding culture and human rights. The project aims to apply cultural norms to strengthen the protection of the property inheritance rights of widows and orphans in the context of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Those knowledgeable in the culture and traditions of the Luo are aware that the current practices of disinheriting widows and orphans of their land and property are not part of the Luo culture. Traditionally, land belonged to the wife and the children; men had no right to impose their will on land use. This is a case where traditional culture provides protection to vulnerable groups and is therefore an ally for development. It also promotes debate about negative practices within cultural institutions that may be harmful to human rights and development. Achievements: \ufffd A documentation centre was set up in the town of Kisumu for all of the Luo in the province of Nyanza \ufffd A documentation officer and community liaison officer were identified and contracted \ufffd A documentation tool for identifying cases for relocation was developed and documentation began in November 2006. By mid-March 2007, a total of 76 cases had been documented and 21 others were referred to other local organizations for legal assistance. The tool identified different needs of the widows including materials for putting up houses; transport to go back home and carry household materials; court fees to pursue documents of administration of estates, marriage certificates, title deeds, taking orphans to school, among others \ufffd Guidelines on the relocation fund were developed and ready by mid-March 2007. The guidelines included the following elements: the background of the project, a description of the fund and who could benefit from it, the types of assistance that the fund could support, the levels and nature of support, etc. \ufffd A booklet on Luo", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cbaab5c4-4a2b-419a-bde7-b5ae1f648d63": {"__data__": {"id_": "cbaab5c4-4a2b-419a-bde7-b5ae1f648d63", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2278eb99187b42dad03cf73534a241d31c29304e243b065993c02294b848a4e5"}}, "hash": "2278eb99187b42dad03cf73534a241d31c29304e243b065993c02294b848a4e5", "text": "culture and the rights of women to own and inherit was developed \ufffd Property was distributed C. The Connection to Good Governance The elements of what is often called good governance range from poverty alleviation to capacity development in the justice sector, to improving basic infrastructure and human services, to enhancing local decision-making. Good governance is an Module 2: Equality, Development and Rights \u2013 Making the Connections Equitas 33 Module 2 umbrella concept that provides a framework for the many project documents and international development assistance programs. What does this have to do with human rights? In many of these \u201cgood governance\u201d projects, international partners and donors do not treat ESC rights as driving the policy agenda, which is often closely linked to economic policy decisions. But women can be hard hit by good governance decisions and economic policies such as structural adjustment programs, privatization of services that cut back on necessary social services, and other decisions that increase women\u2019s burdens as unpaid caregivers. This makes it harder for women to take up paid employment because they have less time to work outside of the home. Good governance, however defined, should be driven at least in part by ensuring that legal standards are recognized as overarching norms. They should be enforceable. NHRIs should insist that the connections be made to human rights in all governance programs, including economic ones. The following Ugandan example illustrates this point. Example: An NHRI's rights-based approach to poverty in Uganda 32 Poverty is an economic and social rights issue, with a major impact on women. In 2004, Uganda used a rights-based approach to poverty eradication to ensure that human rights were the ultimate goal of development and provide a rights framework for social planning. The Uganda Human Rights Commission championed this approach, targeting governance and poverty eradication as a fundamental human rights issue, both a development target and a good governance issue. Few major national policies are delivered through laws alone. As a general rule, Governments use \u201cpolicy instrument mixes\u201d that include not only laws but also administrative arrangements, guidelines and rules, public education policies and programs to effect governance objectives.33 NHRIs must pay attention, then, to this broader policy \u201cmix\u201d in order to effect any kind of meaningful change, and to be enabled to do so. This includes looking at taking a rights-based approach in areas that are usually thought of as an area of pure Government and policy decisions. As the above Ugandan example illustrates, developing a \u201crights-based\u201d approach to major governance objectives, such as poverty alleviation, can be a broad strategic priority for NHRIs. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 34 Module 2 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \ufffd Goal 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger \ufffd Goal 2: Achieve universal primary education \ufffd Goal 3: Promote gender equality and empower women \ufffd Goal 4: Reduce child mortality \ufffd Goal 5: Improve maternal health \ufffd Goal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases \ufffd Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability \ufffd Goal 8: Develop a global partnership for development In 2000, the UNDP Human Development Report, Human Rights and Human Development made the explicit link between ESC rights and human development. In 2005, the UNDP\u2019s Human Development Report International Cooperation at a Crossroads: Aid, Trade and Security in an Unequal World made reference to the close ties between a country\u2019s development and inequalities on the one hand, and the well-being of women on the other hand. From prenatal care to maternal health; from household incomes to nutrition and education, these indicators of inequality are also the indicators of women\u2019s ESC rights. They also happen to be the basic measures for the development ranking of nations. For NHRIs, women\u2019s rights are not only legal standards but also central to the indicators of well-being, which help us to know when States are achieving and missing their targets. More broadly, the capacity to make the connection to good governance is profoundly linked to poverty, development, and decentralization initiatives (which move more decision-making to local levels). The MDGs are important tools in creating the links between women\u2019s ESC rights and measures of how well we are progressing towards equality through human development and good governance. D. The Millennium Development Goals There are eight UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that range from halving extreme poverty, to halting the spread of HIV/AIDS, to providing universal primary education, all by the target date of 2015. They form a blueprint agreed to by all the world\u2019s countries and all the world\u2019s leading development institutions.

All eight MDGs are important to women and girls. MDG Goals 3 and 5, of course, address women directly. However, even the more general MDGs are linked to inequality and discrimination facing women, in part because infringements of ESC rights often have a disproportionate impact on women and girls. Module 2: Equality, Development and Rights \u2013 Making the Connections Equitas 35 Module 2 For example: girls tend to receive less primary education than boys in some developing countries (Goal 2); the reduction of child mortality has particular implications for girl children, who are the victims of gender selection preferences for males, and who tend to be less well-nourished than boys (Goal 4). The realization of the UN MDGs, whose target date is 2015, is the material result of the successful implementation of women\u2019s ESC rights. Development goals are related to the following ESC rights: Housing, and clothing, for example when women: \ufffd Are denied access to housing because they are widowed, single, have children, or receive Government assistance, or they are forcibly evicted from their homes and lands and rendered homeless Health, when women: \ufffd Cannot access basic public health services, such as sanitation, because they are required to pay for services, or because services are not available locally \ufffd Die in childbirth because of inadequate maternal health care and facilities35 \ufffd Are subjected to harmful cultural practices that affect their health and physical integrity Education, when girls: \ufffd Are denied or cannot access primary school education \ufffd Are charged for tuition fees and uniforms for public schools, which might result in receiving less education than boys who are given preference \ufffd In single women-headed households are less likely to go to school than girls in male-headed households \ufffd Cannot travel safely to school Employment, when discriminatory laws, policies and practices prevent women from: \ufffd Seeking work \ufffd Working on terms equal to men \ufffd Returning to work after maternity leave, accessing maternity benefits and being able to access working arrangements to facilitate nursing and caring for young children36 \ufffd Forming trade unions Each MDG is linked to specific ESC rights, which in turn engage the State\u2019s responsibility to respect, protect and fulfill the rights. The MDGs thus offer a \u201croad map\u201d to NHRIs that are trying to determine priorities in their respective countries in part by providing progress indicators to track and monitor specific goals. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 36 Module 2 The following examples illustrate how the MDGs can be used to set priorities for women\u2019s rights.

These are the findings of a study on domestic violence conducted by the Cambodian Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs published on 3 May 2006. According to the study, more than 30% of the Cambodian population is of the opinion that physical violence is appropriate if a woman questions her husband\u2019s privileges, quarrels with him or fails to show him sufficient respect. A third of people interviewed went as far as to consider shot wounds, acid attacks, and even murder to be legitimate in these circumstances.

The MDGs and the UNDP Global Reports on Human Development together have helped to develop benchmarks and targets. NHRIs, among others, can use them to identify objectives and track progress. Some goals tackle the disadvantages that women experience in the social structures and institutions: more specific targets have been developed as priorities that can help NHRIs in choosing their own priority areas. Although the MDGs are a blueprint, they require national ownership and adaptation to the country context, and this is important to women\u2019s equality. For example, there are countries that have moved beyond the limited nature of Goal 3 (promoting gender equality and promoting women) and Goal 5 (improving maternal health) and added new dimensions to the gender equality goals, for example in the areas of violence against women. E. Gender-based Violence Gender-based violence is a form of discrimination against women. Violence against women and girls has been described as a problem of pandemic proportions. One out of three women around the world has been beaten, coerced into sex, or otherwise abused in her lifetime \u2014 with the abuser usually someone known to her. According to UNIFEM, violence against women is: \u201cperhaps the most pervasive human rights violation that we know today, it devastates lives, fractures communities, and stalls development.\u201d Statistics paint a horrifying picture of the social and health consequences of violence against women. For women aged 15 to 44 years, violence is a major cause of death and disability. In a 1994 study based on World Bank data about ten selected risk factors facing women in this age group, rape and domestic violence rated higher than cancer, motor vehicle accidents, war and malaria. Moreover, several studies have revealed increasing links between violence against women and HIV / AIDS. Women who have experienced violence are at a higher risk of HIV infection: a survey among 1,366 South African women showed that women who were beaten by their partners were 48 percent more likely to be infected with HIV than those who were not.38 The right to security for women was introduced through the recognition of full women\u2019s rights. Since so much violence against women is in the home, women\u2019s advocacy groups pushed to extend human rights protection - into the \u201cprivate\u201d realm in order to get at pervasive violence against women in its many forms. Violence against women is being reframed, from a private matter within a family, or from something ancillary to military conflicts, to a fundamental violation of the right to life, liberty and security of the person. States are obliged to take steps to deal with these issues and indeed, should do so regardless of whether such matters are perceived as private or public. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 38 Module 2 UNIFEM highlights the following key areas affecting women: \ufffd Domestic and Intimate Partner Violence \ufffd Sexual Violence \ufffd Harmful Traditional Practices \ufffd Trafficking in Women and Girls \ufffd HIV/AIDS and Violence \ufffd Crimes against Women in Situations of Armed Conflict \ufffd Violence against Women as a Human Rights Violation For example, violence in the family, dowry-related deaths and attacks, acid throwing, and other forms of violence violate women\u2019s dignity and equality. Many rights scholars and advocates have articulated examples of human rights violations related to women\u2019s rights: rape as a war crime in conflict areas, for example, especially on the heels of Bosnia, Rwanda and Darfur. CEDAW does not explicitly mention violence against women, but the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, which is responsible for interpreting and monitoring implementation, has clarified in its General Recommendation No. 19 (1992) that States Parties to the Convention are obliged to \u201ctake all appropriate means to eliminate violence against women.\u201d39 General Comment No. 16 of the Committee on Economic, Cultural and Social Rights (2005) makes explicit the link between violence against women and equality, by clearly positioning violence as a form of discrimination. Gender-based violence is a form of discrimination that inhibits the ability to enjoy rights and freedoms, including economic, social and cultural rights, on a basis of equality. States parties must take appropriate measures to eliminate violence against men and women and act with due diligence to prevent, investigate, mediate, punish and redress acts of violence against them by private actors.40 Related issues in this area include: \ufffd Women\u2019s right to physical integrity, especially in vulnerable situations such as displaced", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a072cfbb-934e-433e-98d0-0c2e790adf95": {"__data__": {"id_": "a072cfbb-934e-433e-98d0-0c2e790adf95", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b71e68f641db4ea3abae4af1f88e989471a5bf1544bf68ffe58d9f31d4cd780a"}, "3": {"node_id": "00213e86-84d6-4d66-8d80-fcbc44347704", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0a0fc07b0fc0df8b2fbc55ecb700cb7e962922dd16c8ecde6c514ddaf9220b98"}}, "hash": "cacdbf1457493149a52d95968c52e06968dd41f3b9676839574f425eea4a2d0b", "text": "persons centres and refugee camps \ufffd Practices of \u201chonour killings,\u201d domestic and dowry-related violence The following two examples show some of the work that can be done by NHRIs alone or in partnership with NGOs.

Much work still remains to be done to ensure that the police force considers \u201chonour crimes\u201d as serious crimes and investigate them accordingly. Some of this work lies in the social and cultural education required at the family and community levels. Example: Domestic Violence in Nepal: an NHRI Strategic Priority41 In the National Human Rights Commission of Nepal\u2019s Strategic Plan for 2004-2008, it committed to: \u201chelp improve the legislative and regulatory mechanisms for control and cessation of: a) domestic and dowry-related violence against women and b) trafficking of women.\u201d While these forms of violence are or should be criminal offences, traditional views often place such acts \u201cwithin the family\u201d. This in itself raises ESC rights issues because of the interplay of social and cultural dimensions attached to these practices. In many countries, domestic and intimate partner violence is recognized as a human rights issue in principle but in practice, few NHRIs pursue active programs to address the impact on women and girls. This is an important but untapped area for NHRI activity. For example, NHRIs can advocate for the creation of appropriate criminal offences where none exist, or for changes in the burden of proof required to bring a complaint of domestic violence. Complementing these initiatives, NHRIs can launch public awareness programs and engage in targeted discussions with local leaders and community workers aimed at alleviating violence. To better understand the implications of these ideas for ESC rights, NHRIs need to make violence against women a priority issue, rather than a matter that is just handed over to the police. Section 3 Key Concepts There are several key concepts relevant to understanding ESC rights and how they apply to women\u2019s equality. Although some have already been touched on, they merit further discussion. These are: \ufffd Discrimination \ufffd Equality (formal and substantive) \ufffd Interdependence and indivisibility \ufffd Intersectionality \ufffd Non-retrogression and Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 40 Module 2 Article 1 CEDAW The term \"discrimination against women\" shall mean any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field. \ufffd Temporary special measures A. Women\u2019s Equality and Discrimination42 Women\u2019s equality depends on the elimination of discrimination, but in the area of ESC rights, it is not always easy to see what the discriminatory \u201cact\u201d might be, let alone how to address it. Article 1 of CEDAW (see the box at the right) offers a definition of discrimination. Sex or gender discrimination is discrimination that occurs or is more likely to occur when the person is female. Sex Discrimination or Gender Discrimination The term \u201csex discrimination\u201d is used in the international instruments, although general comments and academic literature suggest that the term \u201cgender discrimination\u201d better reflects the social and cultural aspects of discrimination against women. For example, the Montreal Principles state that: The terms \u201cgender\u201d and \u201csex\u201d should both be understood as referring to the range of economic, social, cultural, historical, political and biological constructions of norms of behaviour that are considered appropriate for women and men. Implicit in such an understanding of \u201cgender\u201d or \u201csex\u201d\u2026 is that male and female norms have been constructed so as to privilege men and disadvantage women. \u201cGender\u201d and \u201csex\u201d discrimination can be used interchangeably, and both \u201cgender inequality\u201d and \u201csex inequality\u201d are used to refer to the disadvantaged position of women.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "00213e86-84d6-4d66-8d80-fcbc44347704": {"__data__": {"id_": "00213e86-84d6-4d66-8d80-fcbc44347704", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b71e68f641db4ea3abae4af1f88e989471a5bf1544bf68ffe58d9f31d4cd780a"}, "2": {"node_id": "a072cfbb-934e-433e-98d0-0c2e790adf95", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cacdbf1457493149a52d95968c52e06968dd41f3b9676839574f425eea4a2d0b"}}, "hash": "0a0fc07b0fc0df8b2fbc55ecb700cb7e962922dd16c8ecde6c514ddaf9220b98", "text": "Whichever term is used \u2013 whether sex or gender discrimination - we are, at least in this Handbook, referring to more than just discrimination based on the biological differences between men and women.

(2005) \ufffd Sexuality, noting that sexual harassment of women and violence against women are forms of sex discrimination. Violence against women is also a criminal offence in most countries43 Does Intention Matter? Discrimination targets outcomes and impacts, and not intentions or sexist attitudes. For example, gender-neutral laws, policies and practices can nonetheless keep women at a disadvantage by failing to address their needs and realities or their economic, social and cultural disadvantages. This means that a gender-neutral law may still be discriminatory if the effect of the law is to impair women\u2019s ESC rights. A law or policy must be evaluated in terms of its effect on women, in light of women\u2019s real circumstances. The underlying intention is not required as an element of proof. Acts or Omissions Beyond explicit acts or legally sanctioned discrimination, there are also cases where just refraining from or omitting to act will result in discrimination. An example of an omission giving rise to discrimination is the failure of a Government to enact new rules or laws to correct discriminatory situations. For example, in some countries, the laws of evidence require that a woman is obliged to have external corroboration of domestic violence, such as evidence of serious and visible injuries (lacerations, broken bones), before an assault charge will be laid. By failing to amend the applicable laws and give appropriate direction to the police, the State is omitting to address the rights violation. This in itself is a violation of human rights. B. Equality (Formal and Substantive) CEDAW requires the elimination of discrimination against women because this is necessary to ensure equality between men and women.44 There are different but interconnected concepts in the area of equality. One is called formal equality, and the other is called substantive equality. Formal Equality Sometimes called de jure equality, formal equality simply means that men and women are treated the same way. For example, a neutral rule that allows an employer to hire someone new if an employee is away for several months results in formal equality because it treats everyone the same. But, it clearly discriminates against women by failing to recognize that women need maternity leave and return-to- work guarantees. Clearly, formal equality will rarely be enough to Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 42 Module 2 Article 3 ICESCR The States Parties to the present Covenant undertake to ensure the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of all economic, social and cultural rights set forth in the present Covenant. ensure equal rights \u2013 to do this, something more is needed: substantive equality. Substantive Equality Paragraph 6 of General Comment No. 16 on Article 3 of the ICESCR recognizes the importance of ensuring substantive equality in the interpretation of ESC rights. The rights set forth in the Covenant are to be enjoyed by men and women on a basis of equality, a concept that carries substantive meaning. (para. 6) Substantive equality is concerned with the effects of laws, policies and practices. In practical terms, this means that just being neutral is not enough. Substantively equal enjoyment of rights cannot be achieved through the mere passage of laws or promulgation of policies that are gender-neutral on their face. Gender-neutral laws and policies can perpetuate sex inequality because they do not take into account the economic and social disadvantage of women; they may therefore simply maintain the status quo. [Formal equality] does not, by itself, provide [real] equality. \u2026 Whether the measures taken to protect rights are adequate must always be assessed against the background of women\u2019s actual conditions, and evaluated in the light of the effects of policies, laws and practices on those conditions.45 C. Interdependence and Indivisibility All rights \u2013 civil, political, economic, social and cultural \u2013 are interdependent and indivisible.

The centrality of interdependence was affirmed during the 1993 Vienna World Conference on Human Rights. Although human rights are interrelated and interdependent, no rights claims can operate in isolation to infringe gender equality. While there are inevitably conflicts between rights, it is an error to see such conflicts as requiring a particular or uniform set of outcomes. Rather, equality is assessed on a case by case basis, bearing in mind the overall importance of ensuring that nothing is interpreted to minimize gender equality. D. Minimum Core Obligations In international law ESC rights are to be \u201cprogressively implemented\u201d to the \u201cmaximum extent of available resources.\u201d Nonetheless, all States have minimum core obligations that are immediately binding and are to be implemented in full. Module 2: Equality, Development and Rights \u2013 Making the Connections Equitas 43 Module 2 Despite the flexibility of progressive realization, there is nonetheless a minimum level of ESC rights. If a state fails to provide this bare minimum \u2013 food, essential primary health care, basic shelter and housing, and the most basic forms of education \u2013 then progressive realization cannot be used as an excuse for failing to meet these minimum core obligations. Failure is considered to be a violation of the minimal core obligations of the State and is \u201con its face\u201d, or prima facie, an infringement of the ICESCR. The practical result is that the burden of justifying why these basic rights are not being respected, protected or fulfilled falls on the State.46 Minimum core obligations are the immediate and essential dimension of all rights protected by the ICESCR but do not represent the ultimate achievement of such rights. In short, minimum core obligations exist irrespective of the availability of resources of the country concerned, or any other factors and difficulties. Countless human development reports and indices have pointed out that women are the primary family caregivers; they are generally designated as a vulnerable population in terms of exposure levels to poverty, lack of education, mortality and morbidity due to lack of adequate health care and maternal and reproductive health care in particular, and the likelihood of being a refugee or displaced person, among many other socioeconomic conditions. The failure to meet minimum core obligations has a particular impact on women and children. NHRIs should pay particular attention to the State\u2019s progress in meeting these obligations and should give priority to monitoring them as part of their efforts in promoting women\u2019s equality. E. Multiple Grounds of Discrimination: Intersectionality47 A human rights issue can involve multiple and intersecting grounds of discrimination and the interaction of these multiple grounds can have a particular impact on women who are already at a relative disadvantage. Many women encounter distinct forms of discrimination due to the intersection of sex with such factors as: race, language, ethnicity, culture, religion, disability, or socio-economic class. Indigenous women, migrant women, displaced women, and non-national or refugee women experience distinct forms of discrimination because of the intersection of their sex and race, or their sex and citizenship status. Women may also confront particular forms of discrimination due to their age or occupation; family status, as single mothers or widows; health status, such as living with HIV/AIDS; sexuality, such as being lesbian; or because they are engaged in prostitution. Intersecting discrimination can determine the form or nature that discrimination takes, the circumstances in which it occurs, the consequences of the discrimination, and the availability of appropriate remedies.48 This is why the Montreal Principles recommend that: To ensure that all women enjoy the benefits of their economic, social and cultural rights, specific measures are needed to address the ways in which women are Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 44 Module 2 differently affected in their enjoyment of a right as a result of the intersection of discrimination based on sex with discrimination based on other characteristics.49 The combination of various types of discrimination can, when experienced together, produce something unique and distinct from any one form of discrimination standing alone. An \u201cintersectional approach\u201d is one that takes into account historical, social and political contexts, while recognizing the unique experience of the individual. It allows for the interaction of different grounds involved to be acknowledged and addressed. For example, women may experience not only discrimination on the ground of sex, but may also experience the compounding effects of race, ethnic or religious identity, disability, age, class, or caste.

This is because groups often experience distinctive stereotyping or barriers based on a combination of race and gender. \ufffd An intersectional approach can recognize the combined effects of race, ethnicity and gender or other grounds as well. \ufffd A person from a minority ethnic group who is also a religious minority may face multiple forms of discrimination. \ufffd Women may be more likely to experience sexual harassment if they are more vulnerable by virtue of other social or economic factors, such as being a refugee, or having a disability.51 Example: Intersectionality: Addressing Women\u2019s ESC Rights in Human Rights Complaints An NHRI received a complaint from a young Black woman who alleged that she was sexually harassed in the workplace by her manager. The persistent and damaging effects of the harassment were aggravated by the stereotype held by the manager that Black women are socially inferior, more vulnerable, more sexually available and promiscuous. The victim\u2019s youth magnified the impact of these stereotypes on the victim. The investigating officer analyzed not only the obvious sex discrimination, but also investigated violations of human rights because of racist stereotyping and the resulting violation of the rights of women of colour in the workplace. Because of the victim\u2019s youth, a third element of analysis was added to the investigation, namely age. Using this intersectional approach based on three grounds (age, sex and race or colour), the remedy sought was significantly higher in terms of monetary compensation than it would have been if only one ground were involved. The human rights adjudicator specifically mentioned the special and damaging effects of this form of multiple grounds discrimination. - Based on a Canadian human rights case. Module 2: Equality, Development and Rights \u2013 Making the Connections Equitas 45 Module 2 F. Temporary Special Measures Because it has proved so difficult to achieve concrete gains for women in so many areas, special temporary measures are designed to ensure, or accelerate, equality. Legal support for temporary special measures can be found in Article 4 of CEDAW: (1) Adoption by States Parties of temporary special measures aimed at accelerating de facto equality between men and women shall not be considered discrimination as defined in the present Convention, but shall in no way entail as a consequence the maintenance of unequal or separate standards; these measures shall be discontinued when the objectives of equality of opportunity and treatment have been achieved. (2) Adoption by States Parties of special measures, including those measures contained in the present Convention, aimed at protecting maternity shall not be considered discriminatory. NHRIs should support States Parties who make use of temporary special measures such as positive or affirmative action, preferential treatment or quota systems to advance women's integration into education, the economy, politics and employment. Special measures related to maternity are referred to in Article 4(2) of CEDAW and by their nature can be permanent. For example, measures to provide women with maternity benefits, or to preserve women\u2019s jobs during maternity leave are permanent special measures and are not discriminatory since these initiatives enhance women\u2019s substantive equality.52 Temporary special measures, on the other hand, are part of a necessary strategy to achieve substantive equality for women and men in the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. General Recommendation No. 25 from the CEDAW Committee states that a temporary special program can be used to remedy the effects of past discrimination against women. As well, the obligation to improve the position of women by working toward substantive equality exists irrespective of any proof of past discrimination. The measures also serve to protect State-sponsored initiatives like hiring women from charges of discrimination against men. At the same time, not all initiatives qualify as temporary special measures. The following excerpts from General Recommendation No. 25 are especially important: 19. States Parties should clearly distinguish between temporary special measures taken under Article 4, paragraph 1\u2026 and other general social policies adopted to improve the situation of women and the girl child. Not all measures that potentially are, or will be, favourable to women are temporary special measures. The provision of general conditions in order to guarantee the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of women and the Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 46 Module 2 girl child, designed to ensure for them a life of dignity and non-discrimination, cannot be called temporary special measures. 20.

The duration of a temporary special measure should be determined by its functional result in response to a concrete problem and not by a predetermined passage of time. Temporary special measures must be discontinued when their desired results have been achieved and sustained for a period of time.53 In their reporting, NHRIs can refer to appropriate temporary special measures as evidence of State Party compliance with international instruments, or they may recommend the creation of such measures. In addition, NHRIs can recommend the creation of such measures in response to individual complaints. General Recommendation No. 25, cited above, specifically provides that the responsibility for creating special measures may be vested in Government \u2013 this would include not only the executive arm of Government such as women\u2019s ministries, women\u2019s departments within ministries or presidential offices, but would extend to independent Government bodies such as ombudspersons, or to the judiciary (courts and tribunals). The Committee also recommends that States Parties ensure that women in general and affected groups of women in particular, have a role in the design, implementation and evaluation of such programs. Collaboration and consultation with civil society and NGOs representing various groups of women is especially recommended. Example: Retrogressive Measures in Women\u2019s ESC Rights In order to comply with structural adjustment programs a State slashes its social expenditures budget. As a result, the health care system becomes weaker, and hospitals in rural areas are to be closed. Rural women, women who are pregnant and who have HIV/AIDS are particularly affected by such measures, which are retrogressive in nature. The introduction of user fees in secondary education which had formerly been free of charge is a retrogressive measure. When resources are scarce, families often choose to send boys to school and keep girls at home. G. Principle of Non-Retrogression International law imposes an obligation on States to realize ESC rights progressively. States should not, therefore, introduce \u201cretrogressive measures\u201d, which \u201cdirectly or indirectly, lead to backward steps being taken with respect to the rights recognized in the Covenant.\u201d54 Module 2: Equality, Development and Rights \u2013 Making the Connections Equitas 47 Module 2 According to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, any deliberately \u201cretrogressive measure\u201d taken by a State Party may be a violation of Art. 2 of the ICESCR.55 If a State Party does adopt a retrogressive measure, the measure must not be discriminatory, and it should only be adopted after \u201cthe most careful consideration of all the alternatives\u201d, and further \u201cjustified by reference to the totality of the rights provided for in the Covenant and in the context of the full use of the maximum available resources.\u201d 56 Retrogressive measures often come in the form of the privatization of services such as water and education. Cuts to social expenditures such as social security, health care services and childcare may be retrogressive measures as they are most often undertaken deliberately to enhance economic efficiency, to pay down debt and for related fiscal reasons. Of course, these measures increase the costs for such services and decrease their availability to women and girls. Not only are women often deprived of these services, they are then often relied upon to provide these very services themselves \u2013 for free. NHRIs should consider retrogressive measures seriously as points of departure for investigations and monitoring of ESC rights violations. Section 4 The Role of National Human Rights Institutions States have three broad sets of obligations in international human rights, namely the obligations to respect, protect and fulfill human rights. In order for these obligations to be become reality at the national level, States are required to take all appropriate steps, including legislative, to ensure rights are realized at the State level. Establishing NHRIs, is an important way of doing this, because NHRIs link the international human rights framework and the domestic or national sphere. NHRIs are established in accordance with basic principles, called the \u201cParis Principles.\u201d57 The Principles link the domestic protection of human rights and the international framework and require NHRIs to have as broad a mandate as possible in the promotion and protection of human rights. However, the Principles do not say a great deal about ESC rights (or indeed any particular category of rights). In the area of women\u2019s equality, one of the more challenging tasks facing NHRIs is to determine how they can best promote women\u2019s ESC rights.

Unfortunately, this role has too often either not been accorded to the institution or has been neglected or given a low priority by it. It is therefore essential that full attention be given to economic, social and cultural rights in all of the relevant activities of these institutions.\u201d In many countries, human rights commissions, Ombudsman offices and other public protection bodies have been working for decades, operating under national laws that were inspired or influenced by international law. In the last fifteen years, however, the number of NHRIs has surged, largely as a result of the United Nations\u2019 push to support these institutions \u201con the ground\u201d as a force for making international human rights obligations a national reality. The roles and responsibilities of NHRIs devolve directly from the State. A human rights institution is a State-sponsored and State-funded organization. It is part of the State, but is independent. There is no single model of an NHRI, and the national mechanisms chosen vary greatly. There are a variety of institutions. For example, the Ombudsman model is used in continental European countries and CIS States. Similarly, the scope and range of an institution\u2019s authority reflect the particular situation and needs of the people, its own economic capacity and its political maturity. Some institutions, for example, have jurisdiction only over the public sector in part because the private sector is so fragile.58 The OHCHR has placed NHRIs at the front lines of implementing international human rights obligations. As independent institutions with a mandate to combat discrimination and promote and protect universal human rights, NHRIs should also protect and promote the ESC rights of women.59 The CEDAW Committee\u2019s General Recommendation No. 6 specifically promotes the establishment and/or strengthening of effective national institutions that help formulate new policies and effectively carry out strategies and measures to eliminate discrimination. It is also important to remember that the 1993 Vienna Declaration and the 1995 Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action recognized women\u2019s rights and girls\u2019 rights as fundamental human rights. Their protection thus depends on the interconnected and interdependent nature of human rights protections. All the rights contained in the international human rights instruments \u2013 all of them \u2013 must be understood as applying fully to women.60 At the same time, however, women\u2019s rights and ESC rights in particular, depend equally on the specificity of women\u2019s experiences and differences, and on the capacity of human rights as a system to identify and address violations that affect women exclusively or primarily. In 1995, the United Nations emphasized that, although NHRIs in particular tend to be concerned with civil and political rights, they may also be empowered to promote and protect ESC rights.61 Module 2: Equality, Development and Rights \u2013 Making the Connections Equitas 49 Module 2 The role of NHRIs in ESC rights is addressed in General Comment No. 10 of the ESCR Committee (December 1998)62 which notes that \u201cnational institutions have a potentially crucial role to play in promoting and ensuring the indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights\u201d and that \u201cit is therefore essential that full attention be given to economic, social and cultural rights in all of the relevant activities of these institutions.\u201d63 The Committee also calls upon States Parties at paragraph 4 of General Comment No. 10 to include details of the mandate and relevant activities of NHRIs when preparing and submitting their periodic reports under the ICESCR. General Comment No. 10 also sets out the types of activities NHRIs can undertake to protect and promote ESC rights. These activities include: \ufffd Promoting educational and information programs designed to enhance awareness and understanding of ESC rights, both within the general public and among particular groups, such as the public service, the judiciary, the private sector and the labour movement \ufffd Scrutinizing existing laws, administrative acts, draft bills, and other proposals to ensure that they are consistent with the requirements of the ICESCR \ufffd Providing technical advice or undertaking surveys in relation to ESC rights \ufffd Identifying national benchmarks for measuring the progressive realization of ESC rights \ufffd Conducting research and inquiries to ascertain the extent of realization of particular", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "278f94b7-36b9-409f-a2fc-4cf962a64ae4": {"__data__": {"id_": "278f94b7-36b9-409f-a2fc-4cf962a64ae4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d646dfb7a590612ed7d15287c62ef3ba21fa50fa59d3187d8d18672e47022222"}}, "hash": "d646dfb7a590612ed7d15287c62ef3ba21fa50fa59d3187d8d18672e47022222", "text": "ESC rights, at the national level, or in relation to specific vulnerable communities \ufffd Monitoring compliance with regard to specific rights under the Covenant and providing reports to pubic authorities and civil society Indeed, in a recent statement by a UN official, it was noted that: OHCHR gives priority to the establishment and strengthening of NHRIs in compliance with the Paris Principles because they are the central element of strong and effective national human rights protection systems which in turn are key to peace, security and economic and social development. The Office provides tailored advice to a growing number of countries on appropriate constitutional or legislative frameworks regarding the establishment of NIs and on the nature, functions, powers and responsibilities of such institutions.64 Section 5 Legal Obligations of Non-State Actors Non-State actors are all individuals or organizations that are not part of the Government or acting on behalf of the Government. They include NGOs, the private sector (for-profit companies, multi-nationals, financial institutions, corporations), religious institutions, private or corporate landlords, individuals and Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 50 Module 2 private service providers. States have the obligation to protect women from human rights abuses that may be committed by non-State actors. None of these actors is a formal party to international human rights instruments, but that does not mean that non-State actors are exempt from international human rights obligations. Indeed, many of these actors are partners in the protection of women\u2019s ESC rights. The ICESCR and CEDAW (among other conventions) oblige States Parties to ensure that non-State actors are not in any way authorized to engage in activities that violate human rights. Article 5 of the ICESCR, for example, states that: Nothing in the present Covenant may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person, any right to engage in any activity or to perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights or freedoms recognized herein, or at their limitation to a greater extent than is provided for in the present Covenant. [Emphasis added]. When a State knows, or ought to know about human rights abuses and fails to act to take appropriate steps, then the State bears the responsibility of the action.65 As well, Article 2 of CEDAW states: States Parties condemn discrimination against women in all its forms ... and, to this end, undertake: (e) to take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women by any person, organization or enterprise. Exercising \u201cdue diligence\u201d of this nature can require the State to \u201ctake effective steps to prevent abuses, to investigate them when they occur, to prosecute the alleged perpetrators and bring them to justice in fair proceedings, and to ensure adequate reparations for the victims, including rehabilitation and redress.\u201d66 This is a critical activity for NHRIs, whose own monitoring activities are part of the \u201cdue diligence\u201d in their own work. Example: Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) Female genital mutilation (FGM) is a traditional practice carried out in many countries. It is often carried out in unsafe, unsanitary conditions. It is generally performed by members of the community, not by State authorities, and is defended on the basis of custom, culture and tradition. FGM gravely threatens women\u2019s equal right to health, physical integrity and sexuality. A State party to CEDAW, the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the ICESCR is obligated to take appropriate steps to prevent the violation and to eliminate traditional practices that harm girls. Laws against the practice are a start but engagement of the broader community is also required. For example, this may involve funding education and awareness campaigns for the community at large, as well as for community leaders, traditional birth attendants, midwives, health workers, etc. of the harmful effects of FGM. It may also include outreach \u2013 through NGOs \u2013 to women to inform them of their right not to submit to FGM and support them within their communities should they make this choice. Module 2: Equality, Development and Rights \u2013 Making the Connections Equitas 51 Module 2 The Committees on ESC rights and CEDAW have included this extended understanding of States Parties\u2019 legal obligations in their own General Comments. For example, in the CESCR\u2019s General Comment No. 16 on Article 3 of the ICESCR, the Committee states at para. 19: States Parties\u2019 obligation to protect under Article 3 of the ICESCR includes ... the adoption of legislation to eliminate discrimination and to prevent third parties from interfering directly or indirectly with the enjoyment of this right.

This obligation applies, for example, in cases where public services have been partially or fully privatized. A number of CEDAW\u2019s General Recommendations refer to the obligation on States Parties to ensure the compliance of non-State actors with treaty provisions. For example, General Recommendation 19 on violence against women emphasizes that States may be responsible for \u201cprivate acts\u201d if the State fails to act with due diligence to prevent violations of rights or to investigate and punish acts of violence (para. 9). And, the Committee recommends that States Parties should take appropriate and effective measures to overcome all forms of gender-based violence, \u201cwhether by public or private act\u201d (para. 24(a)). The Paris Principles are consistent with a broader application of the NHRI mandate to cover both the private sector and the public sector. NHRIs should ensure that the State is fulfilling its obligation to protect women from abuses committed in both the private sector and the public sector. This is especially important in the areas of discrimination in employment, housing, and goods and services because these are typically offered by the private and non-profit sectors. Some States only protect human rights in relation to the acts of public officials: however, human rights protection should exist regardless of who is responsible for the violation. Conclusion The ICESCR, CEDAW and many other international instruments form a group of rights that support the achievement of equality for women in all spheres of their lives. They include such rights as the right to: an adequate standard of living (housing, adequate food, shelter); health; education, etc. This group of rights presents several unique challenges in relation to women because of the particular way in which women\u2019s rights are embedded in historical, social, economic and cultural contexts. Cultural rights in particular create challenges for particular aspects of rights, but also offer opportunities for NHRIs working locally. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 52 Module 2 By examining more closely the basic concepts linked to women\u2019s ESC rights \u2013 notably discrimination, equality, intersectionality and special measures \u2013 it becomes easier to identify not only what these concepts mean, but how NHRIs can be more effective in using them to enhance the quality of life for women and girls. 53 Module 3 The Legal Framework 3 Photo courtesy Ria Holcak Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 54 Module 3 Overview of Module 3 Module 3 sets out the key elements of the legal framework as it applies to women\u2019s equality and economic, social and cultural (ESC) rights, and the role of national human rights institutions (NHRIs) in the protection of those rights. The legal or normative framework includes not only the human rights obligations that flow from international and domestic law, but also includes principles that inform the development of women\u2019s ESC rights and more generally the acceptance of universal human rights and respect for the rule of law. The table67 on page 55 illustrates a framework for analyzing the underlying principles of women\u2019s ESC rights and State obligations according to international human rights standards. \ufffd Section 1 \u2013 The NHRI Enabling Legislation, deals with the legal sources of an NHRI\u2019s mandate to address women\u2019s ESC rights, by examining enabling legislation, constitutional law and international law. \ufffd Section 2 \u2013 International Human Rights Framework, sets out the international legal framework for women\u2019s ESC rights. It includes non-treaty instruments such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and selected conventional (that is, agreed upon among nations) international instruments. \ufffd Section 3 \u2013 Bringing Human Rights Home, examines how different States transform international obligation into national law. \ufffd Section 4 \u2013 Other Relevant Instruments, sets out the main principles and guidelines that provide guidance to NHRIs in their work in equality and ESC rights. These instruments play a role of legal interpretation, even though they are not binding in the same way as a law.

Second, international instruments have legal effect and are a principal source of ESC rights at the international level. In some countries, ratified conventions or covenants are automatically part of the country\u2019s law. In others, the country must take an extra step and enact legislation. This is called \u201ctransformation\u201d, and is discussed later on in this Module of the Handbook. Declarations such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) have the effect of customary international law.68 Third, are principles that aid in interpreting instruments or laws, or that may set out basic standards that apply to NHRIs, as is the case for the Paris Principles, which are not legally binding. Example: A Broad NHRI Mandate: Human Rights Commission Act, 1994 South African Human Rights Commission69 \u201cWHEREAS the Constitution provides that the Human Rights Commission shall, inter alia, be competent and obliged to promote the observance of, respect for and the protection of fundamental rights; to develop an awareness of fundamental rights among all people of the Republic\u2026\u201d (Emphasis added). A. Enabling Legislation National human rights institutions are creatures of statute \u2013 they depend on laws (enabling legislation) for their existence and legitimacy, and to authorize their actions. A constitution may provide for the creation of an NHRI, and then the institution itself is created by a legislative act. Some countries use orders-in-council (or executive orders), proclamations or other legal instruments. However, a constitutional base and law passed by a national legislature are preferable to executive orders (Paris Principles). The Paris Principles provide that NHRIs should adopt a broad, liberal and purposive approach to interpreting and implementing their mandate. While a broad approach cannot be used to \u201cread in\u201d rights that do not exist, it can be used to interpret a set of rights more expansively and in a way that is more consistent with the achievement of human rights. Enabling legislation may provide for human rights generally, or it may define specific ESC rights.

Begin by examining the country\u2019s constitution: a. Does the constitution set out basic rights and freedoms, including the right to equality or non-discrimination on the basis of sex? b. Does the constitution recognize/ guarantee the rights contained in international instruments ratified by the country that include ESC rights? 2. Then examine the NHRI enabling law. a. Does the enabling legislation provide for as broad a mandate as possible for the NHRI to protect and promote all human rights as set out in international instruments ratified by the country? b. Is there a specific mention of ESC rights? c. Are there provisions to address equality of women and men and/or a prohibition against sex discrimination? 3. Has the country ratified international instruments such as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)? The following examples look at commissions that do not specifically protect ESC rights, but which nonetheless have programming in ESC rights. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 58 Module 3 Example: Kenya National Human Rights Commission Does the constitution guarantee human rights/ESC rights? The Constitution of Kenya does not explicitly set out ESC rights but it codifies fundamental rights and freedoms, and guarantees the enjoyment of them without discrimination. Does the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights\u2019 enabling law protect and promote ESC rights? The Commission is an autonomous NHRI established by an Act of Parliament in 2002. Its core mandate is to further the protection and promotion of all human rights in Kenya (Section 16 of the Constitutive Act of the commission). Economic, Social, Cultural Rights Program implemented by the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights The Program fulfills its mandate to protect and promote ESC rights by designing interventions that: - Address violations of rights \u2013 often providing broad policy responses since ESC rights are often the subject of systemic violations with broad causes and effects, they therefore require systemic responses - Monitor the realization of ESC rights through systematically tracking and assessing State performance against benchmarks and targets - Promote ESC rights, i.e., creating awareness and imparting knowledge about human rights - Conduct research and produce publications on ESC rights Module 3: The Legal Framework Equitas 59 Module 3 Example: The Philippines Commission on Human Rights Does the constitution guarantee human rights / ESC rights? The Philippines Constitution of 1987 stipulates that the Philippine Commission shall \u201cinvestigate \u2026 all forms of human rights violations involving civil and political rights\u201d and shall \u201cmonitor the Philippine Government\u2019s compliance with international treaty obligations on human rights.\u201d The 1987 Constitution guarantees rights, including ESC rights. As well, an NHRI is authorized to \u201cprovide appropriate legal measures for the protection of human rights of all persons.\u201d However, the Commission may only investigate civil and political rights violations. Because of the constitutional limitation on the power to investigate ESC rights complaints, the Supreme Court held in 1994 that the Philippine Commission could only investigate violations of civil and political rights. Does the constitution guarantee women\u2019s human rights? Protection of human rights (general) and women\u2019s labour rights (general), but no general equality guarantee. Does the NHRI enabling law promote and protect human rights as set out in instruments ratified by the State? No, but Executive Order 163 invokes authority to \u201cprovide appropriate legal measures for the protection of human rights of all persons\u201d subject to the limitation that only civil and political rights may be investigated. Have the Philippines ratified ICESCR and CEDAW? Yes. The Philippine Commission has interpreted its mandate broadly (and creatively) to ensure that it can undertake certain investigations of violations of ESC rights. Thus while the Philippines Commission on Human Rights cannot accept a direct complaint in the matter of an ESC right, it can accept a case dealing with a systematic violation of housing rights. Although this form of discrimination is a violation of ESC rights, it is also a violation of the equality guarantee in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). B. Justiciability States must implement the ESC rights in ratified international instruments. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights issued General Comment No. 9, and in reference to the domestic application of the ICESCR, the Committee wrote that \u201clegally binding international human rights standards should operate directly and immediately within the domestic legal system of each State party.\u201d70 However, the Committee is not concerned with how this is done.

Many countries argue that ESC rights are not judicially enforceable, that they are too vague to be monitored effectively, or that the basic obligations that are linked to ESC rights are matters for the legislatures, not courts or tribunals. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 60 Module 3 In response to the first and third concerns, States that have ratified instruments and that have included all or some ESC rights in their constitutions or in their NHRI\u2019s enabling legislation (or both), have already accepted international law. There are numerous examples of courts applying domestic and international law to protect ESC rights even where the Government has not formally transformed the norm into law. Moreover, the rights that are protected by most human rights commissions and ombudsman offices that address equality and non-discrimination \u2013 for example housing, employment and access to health care, to name but a few \u2013 are fundamentally about ESC rights. These issues have been adjudicated in the courts for half a century in countries like Canada, for example, where there is a long-standing tradition of NHRIs. In terms of the vagueness issue, international development agencies have been producing research on social and economic conditions and human well-being for decades. Far from being \u201cvague,\u201d these areas are the ones we know the most about. From the United Nations Development Programme\u2019s (UNDP) Human Development Index (HDI), to gender-related indices, to the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund\u2019s (UNICEF) rate of progress measurements, and the World Bank\u2019s World Development Reports, the problem is not insufficient or vague data, but rather how to marshal it all in the human rights context.72 As the Centre for Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has pointed out: \u201cHistorical neglect of ESCR is not a methodological obstacle. While there is always a need for additional indicators to measure compliance with specific rights, it must be emphasized that the definition of all rights changes and expands over time through concrete practice. The main obstacle to realizing ESC rights remains a lack of political will and commitment on the part of States, international institutions and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) whose responsibility it is to respect, protect and promote these rights for the benefit of all human beings.\u201d The Centre provides a few examples of ESC rights violations that are already being tried in courts around the world: \ufffd Forcible evictions \ufffd Terminating an employee without cause \ufffd Deliberate poisoning of a water supply \ufffd Discrimination in access to medical care, work, housing, education etc. \ufffd Banning unions \ufffd Depriving children of adequate food and water \ufffd Failing to provide any primary level education \ufffd Failing to provide basic health care facilities \ufffd Educational institutions in such poor condition that they are a risk to safety \ufffd Housing in such poor condition that it is a risk to safety. 73 Module 3: The Legal Framework Equitas 61 Module 3 There are two sources of conventional or treaty-based international human rights obligations The UN system has general application internationally, subject to individual State ratifications or accessions, declarations and reservations. Regional systems for human rights protection apply within territorial limitations, and include the African system, the Inter-American system, and the European human rights system. One of the most well-known and internationally significant of the cases showing the justiciability of ESC rights is the Grootboom Case, a South African case involving housing rights. The following summary is drawn from the Association for Women\u2019s Rights in Development\u2019s (AWID) publication, Strategies and Lessons from Experience: Respecting and Protecting the Right to Housing: the South African Experience.74 Example: Grootboom Case75 The Grootboom decision of the South African Constitutional Court involved about 900 people (including Irene Grootboom) who had been living in terrible conditions in the municipality of Oostenberg in South Africa. Most of these people had already applied for low-cost housing, but were becoming increasingly frustrated after many years of waiting with no response from authorities. Desperate, they decided to illegally occupy a vacant piece of private property across the road from the site that had been earmarked for low-cost housing.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "16f4b24d-83f7-411a-bd27-4f5c64328a58": {"__data__": {"id_": "16f4b24d-83f7-411a-bd27-4f5c64328a58", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e9b54072dc308cd84aa593d2e2ce34dff365f05f49b1cd0975e5d5f14db4611f"}, "2": {"node_id": "2831704d-4368-4d03-a8e0-948729028b0d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6f00e425b31483b6afafd61cded45b5b7a816ac6b7f70ffe1ba3be9c035ffcc7"}}, "hash": "b17d20ebc370cec01f07bcd037d5e9c9ebfc8f2848e6c524f7abd02d4b5e48af", "text": "The owner of the property applied for and received a court magistrates order to evict the occupying community.

The Government \u2026 [offered] access to a piece of land and some building materials, as well as access to basic services while they waited for housing to become available. Subsequently, however, the Government failed to honour its promise. The community then took their case to the High Court, basing their arguments on Section 26 of the South African Constitution, which states that: Everyone has the right to have access to adequate housing; and the State must take reasonable legislative and other measures, within its available resources, to achieve the progressive realization of this right. The court ruled \u2026that the community\u2019s right to have access to adequate housing had indeed been violated\u2026 [and] that a legislative or policy framework aimed at the progressive realization of social rights must be adequate to facilitate the progressive realization of the right within the prevailing resource constraints and that it must be comprehensive, coherent, balanced and flexible\u2026. Section 26 imposed a negative duty on States not to prevent or impair the access to housing, as well as a positive obligation to create an enabling environment for the fulfillment of this right. The State\u2019s housing plan must respond to the needs of crisis situations, and may not exclude any significant sector of society, especially vulnerable populations. The housing plan in this case did not meet these standards, and therefore the Government had a duty to rectify the situation. The Grootboom decision was a landmark decision: It recognized, first, that ESC rights enshrined in a Constitution were justiciable \u2013 that is, they could be adjudicated in a court of law and remedies found to compensate victims. The decision also recognized the obligation of the State to ensure access to these rights, irrespective of budgetary or other constraints. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 62 Module 3 Section 2 International Human Rights Framework There are three general sources of international law: \ufffd Treaty or conventional law \ufffd Customary international law \ufffd General principles of law This Handbook deals primarily with the first source and focuses on those conventions which contain provisions regarding women\u2019s ESC rights. Upon ratifying a treaty or convention, a State undertakes certain legal obligations. The meaning and application of these legal obligations are set out in the conventions themselves, and the interpretation of specific sections is provided in General Comments prepared by the Treaty bodies or committees that are responsible for a particular convention. The Committees on the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child are the main examples, and they routinely adopt General Comments and make General Recommendations to provide guidance on the interpretation and application of their respective covenants. These three committees are not the only ones that issue comments and recommendations, of course, but they are the focus of this Handbook as regards women\u2019s ESC rights. A. The UN International Human Rights System At the international level, instruments of particular importance are those that deal in substance with the rights, or categories of rights, under the International Bill of Human Rights, which consists of the UDHR, the ICESCR, and the ICCPR and its two Optional Protocols.76 These instruments impose basic obligations on States that have ratified the instruments. The following sections contain more detail on these selected key instruments:77 \ufffd Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) \ufffd Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples \ufffd Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) \ufffd Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) \ufffd Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) Module 3: The Legal Framework Equitas 63 Module 3 CEDAW Article 1 \u201cFor the purposes of the present Convention \u2018discrimination against women\u2019 shall mean any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field.\u201d \ufffd Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) \ufffd International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) \ufffd International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) \ufffd Optional Protocol to the ICESCR Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) The Universal Declaration of Human Rights", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5df714c4-c496-4499-b76a-c4bc44d5d69e": {"__data__": {"id_": "5df714c4-c496-4499-b76a-c4bc44d5d69e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1362d48d0235968091c2fcd70c315aa8320e01b97661cfc7a0843bec2f16c4ff"}}, "hash": "1362d48d0235968091c2fcd70c315aa8320e01b97661cfc7a0843bec2f16c4ff", "text": "is not a treaty or convention.

Article 21 provides that particular attention shall be paid to the rights and special needs of indigenous elders, women, youth, children and persons with disabilities. Article 22 also states that particular attention shall be paid to the rights and special needs of vulnerable individuals, including elders, women, youth, children and persons with disabilities in the implementation of the Declaration. Temporary special measures are to be taken, in conjunction with indigenous peoples, to ensure that indigenous women and children enjoy the full protection and guarantees against all forms of violence and discrimination. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) CEDAW is sometimes called the \u201cinternational bill of rights for women.\u201d Adopted in 1979, it is a comprehensive and legally binding instrument that prohibits discrimination against women and obliges Governments to take steps to advance equality of women. It draws no distinction between public and private life and does not accept culture as an excuse for discrimination. CEDAW protects women\u2019s rights to equality and non-discrimination in economic, social and cultural realms. The right to be treated on an equal basis in domestic and family matters is essential for women\u2019s economic and social rights. NHRIs should make particular reference to policies or practices that appear either in complaints or through the course of monitoring practices that discriminate against women in these key areas: trafficking in women, political and public life, nationality, education, employment, health care and family planning, economic and social benefits (including loans, access to bank mortgages and other forms of credit), participation in cultural life, issues involving rural women, property rights, and marriage and family relations. In General Recommendation No. 6: Effective National Machinery and Publicity, the CEDAW Committee states that NHRIs should have the resources, commitment and authority to: Module 3: The Legal Framework Equitas 65 Module 3 \ufffd Advise on the impact on women of all Government policies \ufffd Monitor the situation of women comprehensively \ufffd Help formulate new policies and effectively carry out strategies and measures to eliminate discrimination General Recommendations are a valuable source of information for NHRIs on reporting procedures and guidelines, as well as on substantive and thematic issues involving women\u2019s rights", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2b681eec-6dee-49cb-8ebf-ce50b1295535": {"__data__": {"id_": "2b681eec-6dee-49cb-8ebf-ce50b1295535", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7262bfcf5bbabc8e452d59c8d137b0248526318e536684ba86354a3aed3661d7"}}, "hash": "7262bfcf5bbabc8e452d59c8d137b0248526318e536684ba86354a3aed3661d7", "text": "and ESC rights. See Appendix 5 for relevant General Recommendations that have been issued by the CEDAW Committee. In 1999, the UN General Assembly adopted the Optional Protocol to CEDAW.78 By ratifying the Optional Protocol, a State recognizes the competence of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women \u2013 the body that monitors States Parties' compliance with the Convention \u2013 to receive and consider complaints from individuals or groups about States Parties that have ratified CEDAW. It should be noted that the Protocol contains (1) a communications procedure that allows individuals, or groups of individuals, to submit claims of violations of rights protected under the Convention to the Committee, and (2) an inquiry procedure enabling the Committee to initiate inquiries into situations of grave or systematic violations of women\u2019s rights. The Optional Protocol entered into force on 22 December 2000, following the ratification of the tenth State Party to the Convention, putting the Optional Protocol on an equal footing with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) which also have communications procedures. There is a role for NHRIs in the communications procedure, either to facilitate the process of making a complaint, or carrying forward a communication itself in the event that internal national processes are exhausted or do no exist. More details on this type of activity are found in Module 6. Despite these positive aspects, CEDAW has among the largest number of reservations by Governments. Most of the reservations focus on the core objective and underlying rationale of the Convention, namely the imperative of changing unequal power relations between men and women and this resistance undermines the very purpose of the convention.79 The NHRI\u2019s role in removing or objecting to reservations is also discussed in more detail in Module 6. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) According to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, \u201cdiscrimination on the basis of disability\u201d means any distinction, exclusion or restriction on the basis of disability which has the purpose or effect of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal basis with others, of all human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 66 Module 3 Article 6(1) of the 2006 Convention specifically recognizes the importance of multiple effects of discrimination for women with disabilities.80 Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) Girls have particular vulnerabilities in a number of economic, social and cultural areas such as education, health, and economic exploitation. For these reasons, the ESC rights provisions in the CRC may provide needed protections. The ESC rights included in this Convention include the rights to: \ufffd The highest attainable standard of health (Art. 24) \ufffd Benefit from social security (Art. 26) \ufffd A standard of living adequate for the child\u2019s physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development (Art. 27) \ufffd Education (Art. 28) \ufffd Protection from economic exploitation (Art. 32) In its General Comment No. 1 (2001) on the aims of education, the Committee on the Rights of the Child has noted that gender discrimination can be reinforced by school curricula that are inconsistent with gender equality, as well as by arrangements that limit benefits that girls can obtain from the educational opportunities offered, and by unsafe or unfriendly environments which discourage girls\u2019 participation. General Comment No. 1 also addresses discrimination against children with disabilities, including those with HIV/AIDS which is pervasive in many formal educational systems and in a great many informal educational settings, including in the home. All such discriminatory practices directly contradict the requirements in Article 29 (1) (a) that education be directed to the development of the child's personality, talents and mental and physical abilities to their fullest potential. Because NHRIs frequently work with their Governments in the development of human rights modules or curricula for schools, this is an important area of activity. In its General Comment No. 2 (2002), the Committee on the Rights of the Child sets out the role of independent NHRIs in the promotion and protection of the rights of the child. Article 4 of the CRC obliges States Parties to \u201cundertake all appropriate legislative, administrative and other measures for the implementation of the rights recognized in the present Convention.\u201d Independent NHRIs are an important mechanism to promote and ensure the implementation of the CRC; indeed, the Committee on the Rights of the Child considers the establishment of NHRIs as part of the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "592a20e3-599a-4fbc-8adb-4f0842b3eec5": {"__data__": {"id_": "592a20e3-599a-4fbc-8adb-4f0842b3eec5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca1166b7c927085909232dad212d43aee214375b52782e97bba57e04a754fd5c"}}, "hash": "ca1166b7c927085909232dad212d43aee214375b52782e97bba57e04a754fd5c", "text": "commitment made by States Parties upon ratification of the CRC to ensure the implementation of the Convention and advance the universal realization of children\u2019s rights. Module 3: The Legal Framework Equitas 67 Module 3 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) CERD forbids any \u201cdistinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin, which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise on an equal footing of human rights and fundamental freedoms in political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.\u201d For many racial minority women who file race and sex discrimination complaints, CERD provides an avenue to ensure that the race element is addressed in the economic, social and cultural realms. Article 5(e) of this Convention codifies a number of ESC rights including the right to: \ufffd Work, and free choice of employment \ufffd Just and favourable working conditions \ufffd Equal pay for work of equal value \ufffd Housing \ufffd Public health, medical care, social security and social services \ufffd Education and training \ufffd Equal participation in cultural activities \ufffd Access to any place or service intended for the general public International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) While this Covenant focuses on civil and political rights, Article 3 deals specifically with the equality of men and women, and thus creates a link with the rights set out in the ICESCR. Article 3 of the ICCPR provides that: The States Parties to the present Covenant undertake to ensure the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of all civil and political rights set forth in the present Covenant. General Comment 28 from the Human Rights Committee sets out the link between the ICCPR and ESC rights. Relevant sections are set out below: 3. \u2026 The State party must not only adopt measures of protection, but also positive measures in all areas so as to achieve the effective and equal empowerment of women. \u2026 4. States parties are responsible for ensuring the equal enjoyment of rights without any discrimination [and] to take all steps necessary, including the prohibition of discrimination on the ground of sex, to put an end to discriminatory actions, both in the public and the private sector, which impair the equal enjoyment of rights.81 Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 68 Module 3 This Article has been used to challenge discrimination against women in economic, social and cultural realms. As well, Article 26 of the ICCPR provides a broad right to be free from discrimination on any ground such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) The principal codification of ESC rights is found in the ICESCR. The ICESCR recognizes rights to: \ufffd Equality between women and men (Art. 3) \ufffd Work and favourable conditions of work (Arts. 6 and 7) \ufffd Form and join trade unions (Art. 8) \ufffd Social security (Art. 9) \ufffd Protection of the family, mothers and children (Art. 10) \ufffd An adequate standard of living including: adequate food, housing and clothing (Art. 11.1) \ufffd The highest attainable level of health and health care (Art. 12) \ufffd Education (Art. 13) \ufffd Free and compulsory primary education (Art. 14) \ufffd Take part in cultural life; benefit from scientific progress; and benefit from the protection of scientific, literary or artistic production of which one is the author (Art. 15) Some rights tend to be less \u201cvisible\u201d in discussions on women\u2019s rights, but it is important to point out that rights to own, manage and inherit property are also fundamental to women\u2019s equality. As well, the freedom from violence against women, including in the context of intimate partner and other forms of domestic violence, is closely linked to ESC rights. Articles 2 and 3 of the ICESR Outline State Party Obligations The key principles that inform State obligations to uphold ESC rights include the following: \ufffd To respect, protect and fulfill \ufffd \u201cUndertake to take steps ... by all appropriate means, including particularly the adoption of legislative measures\u201d \ufffd \u201cWith a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights\u201d \ufffd Not use retrogressive measures \ufffd Positive obligations \ufffd \u201cTo the maximum of its available resources\u201d Module 3: The Legal Framework Equitas 69 Module 3 ICESR Articles 2 & 3 2(1) Each State Party \u2026 undertakes to take steps\u2026to the maximum of its available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0f86470a-af39-47b1-a217-e4dcdbcfec1b": {"__data__": {"id_": "0f86470a-af39-47b1-a217-e4dcdbcfec1b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "351c3e5d3f0e7b846fa7b3b4c0f6486d45978c3f04fbcbc10fc4368c0a4fa669"}}, "hash": "351c3e5d3f0e7b846fa7b3b4c0f6486d45978c3f04fbcbc10fc4368c0a4fa669", "text": "full realization of the rights recognized in the present Covenant by all appropriate means, including particularly the adoption of legislative measures. 2(2) The States Parties \u2026undertake to guarantee that the rights enunciated in the present Covenant will be exercised without discrimination of any kind as to race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. 3.

Where appropriate, examples are provided to illustrate the analysis. Readers seeking more information should consult the OHCHR Handbook. The Obligation to Respect, Protect and Fulfill 83 To respect means that the State cannot take any action or impose any measure that is contrary to the rights guaranteed by the treaty or convention. This is sometimes referred to as a \u201cnegative obligation.\u201d States are required to repeal laws and policies that discriminate either directly or indirectly. According to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, this means that: States Parties must refrain from discriminatory actions that result in the denial of the equal right of men and women to their enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights (para. 18).84 To protect means that it is not sufficient for the State merely to refrain from breaching a particular right in international law; it must also ensure that others do not deny the right. The State obligation to protect includes the establishment and strengthening of democratic institutions \u2013 this requires State action, intervention and support. In short, States Parties must eliminate the practices that perpetuate inequalities, adopt legislative provisions on equality and non-discrimination and prevent third parties from interfering with the enjoyment of Article 3 (para. 19 and 20). To fulfill \u2013 States Parties must take steps to ensure that in practice women and men enjoy their economic, social and cultural rights equally, for example, by ensuring the availability and accessibility of remedies through appropriate venues such as courts and tribunals; adopting temporary special measures to accelerate women\u2019s equal Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 70 Module 3 enjoyment of their rights; and by undertaking human rights education and training programs for judges and public officials (para. 21). This is also referred to as \u201cpositive\u201d action on the part of the State. Such actions would include, for example, efforts to promote better understanding about human rights through effective education and information campaigns. The State is seen as the most appropriate vehicle for these efforts \u2013 as opposed to the international community \u2013 because such campaigns are likely to be most effective when they are designed and carried out at the national or local level and take the local cultural and traditional context into account. According to Principle No. 14 of the Montreal Principles, in order to fulfill the obligation of immediacy States Parties may be required to \u201crespect, protect, and fulfill\u201d simultaneously, rather than in stages, in order for women to enjoy substantive equality in economic, social and cultural realms. That is, depending on the infringement, a State Party may be required to both refrain from acting discriminatorily and to take positive steps to redress sex-discrimination and inequality in economic, social and cultural realms. The Obligation of Immediacy Some obligations require immediate implementation in full by all States Parties. General Comment No. 16 to the ICESCR states: The equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights is a mandatory and immediate obligation of States parties.85 The Montreal Principles also provide that: \u2026This obligation is not subject to progressive realization. The obligation is also an immediate one for inter-governmental bodies and quasi-State actors or other groups exercising control over territory or resources. \ufffd Thus, undertaking to guarantee that relevant rights will be exercised without discrimination and take steps towards full realization are of immediate effect. Minimum core obligations are also subject to the principles of immediacy \ufffd The obligation of immediacy may be subject to a standard of reasonableness \ufffd On the other hand, a State\u2019s failure to take steps within a reasonable time after the Covenant\u2019s entry into force is a violation of the Covenant \ufffd The immediacy", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8b7b299-c7fc-4f11-9207-4449f4b3d3dd": {"__data__": {"id_": "e8b7b299-c7fc-4f11-9207-4449f4b3d3dd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c21b38aec3039b17b516d6daa17894c49a7e0921bd03bf4a69fbb9743d8e7fb2"}}, "hash": "c21b38aec3039b17b516d6daa17894c49a7e0921bd03bf4a69fbb9743d8e7fb2", "text": "principle means that it is contrary to human rights law and the principle of dignity to allow discrimination to continue unaddressed for any period of time Module 3: The Legal Framework Equitas 71 Module 3 \u201cUndertakes to take steps ... by all appropriate means\u2026\u201d Legislative reform may be a necessary step, but it may not be sufficient. Administrative, judicial, policy, economic, social, educational measures are examples of the other steps that are usually part of the implementation of a given right and will be required of Governments to ensure these rights to all. This is where the promotional aspect of NHRI mandates becomes especially important. NHRIs can undertake partnerships with other institutions \u2013 including public authorities in their obligations under international law \u2013 to change not only the laws, but also the other \u201ctools of governance\u201d that are used to implement policy choices. \u201cWith a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights\u201d Progressive realization recognizes that States do not have limitless resources and cannot realize all ESC rights immediately. States may therefore work towards ESC rights over time, to the maximum extent permitted by their economies. At the same time, States Parties should move as expeditiously as possible towards the realization of rights (Limburg Principles, 21). States are obliged to ensure that inequalities experienced by disadvantaged groups are eradicated so that all groups are in an equal position to attain those rights and aspects of those rights that may be realized progressively. \ufffd The progressive realization of rights does not mean that States can defer indefinitely efforts to ensure full realization. (Limburg Principles, 21) \ufffd States must show discernible progress towards the enjoyment by everyone of the rights contained in the Covenant \ufffd The obligation of progressive realization includes an obligation not to take or permit backward or retrogressive measures. (See the section below on the Principle of Non-Retrogression) The obligation of progressive realization means that NHRIs must be vigilant, disciplined and regular in monitoring women\u2019s ESC rights. Regular and systematic data collection should be coupled with efforts to map the data against Government plans or other tools that show the Government\u2019s intention and progress in improving the quality of human rights for women. \u201cTo the maximum of its available resources\u201d Because States may not have sufficient resources, they may be able to justify the failure to ensure the full enjoyment of ESC rights. However, States cannot escape the minimum core obligations: \u201cResource scarcity does not relieve States of certain minimum obligations in respect of the implementation of economic, social and cultural rights.\u201d86 From the perspective of an NHRI, this means that it is critical to work with public institutions to develop and monitor feasible, long-term and progressive plans that are achieved over time. The ICESCR in Article 2(1) imposes an implicit, some would say Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 72 Module 3 explicit, obligation on first world countries to assist third world countries achieve this objective through economic and technical assistance. In other words, \u201cavailable resources\u201d may include development assistance from other countries and not just the nation\u2019s own resources. Positive Obligations All human rights \u2013 civil, cultural, economic, political, and social \u2013 impose both negative and positive obligations on States to prevent discrimination. States are required not only to refrain from infringing rights, but also to take positive steps to achieve equality. This means that merely not doing something may be insufficient: positive steps, such as taking an initiative, launching a program and allocating resources, including financial resources to address rights violations may also be required. NHRIs have an important role to play in encouraging countries to take needed steps. For example, the right to education may require States to take special measures to promote the education of girls. Similarly, the right to adequate housing may require a State not only to refrain from forcibly evicting people from their homes and lands, but it may also entail the provision of resources to ensure adequate housing for marginalized groups. The right to health means that States must take positive measures to ensure that their citizens have access to existing medication, as shown in the example. Positive measures generally require the progressive realization of rights through the development of programs and the expenditure of resources (e.g. the provision of services). Article 3 of the ICCPR, which creates a link between the equality rights of men and women, is also relevant to women\u2019s ESC rights.

States parties must provide information regarding the actual role of women in society so that the Committee may ascertain what measures, in addition to legislative provisions, have been or should be taken to give effect to these obligations, what progress has been made, what difficulties are encountered and what steps are being taken to overcome them. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights monitors implementation of the ICESCR. The Committee has issued General Comments on most of the rights contained in the Covenant, as well as on the domestic implementation of ICESCR rights and their relevance for NHRIs. The Committee has also addressed women\u2019s inequality with respect to all ICESCR rights through the adoption of General Comment 16, Article 3 of the Covenant.87 Module 3: The Legal Framework Equitas 73 Module 3 Example: Financial Resources for HIV/AIDS Victims A State decides to refuse to provide financial resources for HIV/AIDS victims within its borders. Women are being infected and dying from this disease disproportionately. As a result, women\u2019s right to equal enjoyment of the right to health is infringed. In this case, it is the State\u2019s failure to act that has caused the infringement. To remedy the situation, the State is obliged to act \u2013 take positive steps, e.g., to establish an HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment strategy; education/outreach, particular treatment programs (e.g., anti-retroviral), programs to assist those infected. The comments of the Committee are critical to understanding the nature and content of specific ESC rights. They include comments on broad themes or issues, such as the rights to: work, adequate housing, education and health. They also contain references to discrimination against women. The OHCHR table with regard to the relevant general comments is reproduced on the next page. The Optional Protocol to the ICESCR88 The Optional Protocol to the ICESCR was approved by the United Nations Human Rights Council on June 18, 200889. It will provide a mechanism for the submission of individual complaints to the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights if complainants are unable to obtain redress at the national level. It contains significant provisions that can contribute to the better promotion and protection of ESC rights: \ufffd States Parties to the Covenant joining the Protocol recognize the competence of the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to receive and consider communications alleging violations of the economic, social and cultural rights set forth in the Covenant. \ufffd The Protocol provides for the possibility of so-called \u201cinterim measures\u201d by providing that the Committee may transmit to the State Party concerned for its urgent consideration a request that the State Party take such interim measures to avoid possible irreparable damage to the victims of the alleged violations. \ufffd The Protocol also creates an inquiry procedure, setting out that if the Committee receives reliable information indicating grave or systematic violations of the Covenant, the Committee shall invite that State Party to cooperate in the examination of the information and to this end to submit observations with regard to the information concerned. The inquiry may include a visit to the territory of the State Party concerned. \ufffd The Protocol requires that States take all appropriate measures to ensure that individuals under its jurisdiction are not subjected to any form of ill-treatment or intimidation as a consequence of communicating with the Committee pursuant to the Protocol. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 74 Module 3 It is important to underline, however, that the Committee can only look into complaints originating from States who have signed the Optional Protocol.

Regional Systems A review of all the regional instruments that are relevant to women\u2019s ESC rights and the work of NHRIs is beyond the scope of this Handbook. However, key regional instruments are provided in the Tables in Appendix 3 and cross referenced to specific ESC rights. Module 3: The Legal Framework Equitas 75 Module 3 Section 3 Bringing Human Rights Home How does an international or regional instrument become part of national or domestic law? This question is central to the issue of justiciability which refers to the ability to use a human rights standard before the courts. The way in which international law becomes part of domestic law is part of a legal concept called \u201ctransformation\u201d. The way in which transformation works depends on the country, and whether the country is \u201cdualist\u201d or \u201cmonist\u201d. Most common law jurisdictions are dualist, meaning that an international instrument will only apply if it has been incorporated into law by national legislation.91 For instance, Commonwealth nations such as Canada and India92 follow this common law tradition, as do most Anglophone nations in Africa.93 In contrast, many countries with civil law systems are \u201cmonist\u201d, and they accept ratified instruments automatically as part of domestic law. This means that rights and duties exist without the need for specific legislation.94 For example, Article 94 of the 1983 Dutch Constitution provides that treaties have precedence in the Netherlands.95 A similar monist approach is taken by France, Germany96 and other countries with a civil law tradition, including Francophone countries in Africa. A. Domestic Application of International ESC Rights Statements such as the Limburg Principles97 and the Maastricht Guidelines98 suggest that States Parties are obligated to incorporate international instruments recognizing ESC rights within the domestic legal order. In fact, General Comment No. 3 of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights goes further and suggests that some provisions of the ICESCR are self-executing and do not even need to be formally incorporated into national law in order to have effect.99 States Parties are required to take all appropriate measures, including legislation, to ensure the full development and advancement of women. This applies to all fields, in particular in the political, social, economic and cultural fields, for the purpose of guaranteeing to women the exercise and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms on a basis of equality with men.100 B. Role of NHRIs in Domestically Incorporating Women\u2019s ESC Rights NHRIs\u2019 influence the domestic application of international instruments that advance women\u2019s equality through ESC rights by asking three questions: 1. Has the instrument been ratified by the Government? If so, NHRIs can make the argument that the State is obligated to incorporate the international instrument in national law (see above). If not, the NHRI can develop and implement a program that is meant to move the State towards ratification. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 76 Module 3 Similarly, if the State has ratified the instrument but listed reservations on its application, the NHRI can document the impact of those reservations and attempt to influence the State to remove them. 2. Is implementing legislation required?101 If so, the NHRI can actively encourage the State to pass legislation incorporating the treaty into domestic law.102 NHRIs can also review draft legislation to make sure that the provisions contained therein are appropriate and fully consistent with the treaty obligation. 3. Is the State unwilling to take the necessary steps to pass implementing legislation? If so, the NHRI can argue before the judiciary that unincorporated conventions still can have an indirect effect on domestic law. There are a number of common law cases that essentially hold that, where an ambiguity exists in domestic law, the State\u2019s domestic law will be interpreted in a way, which is consistent with the State\u2019s international treaty obligations.103 Moreover, the NHRI can also argue that Commonwealth courts have used international human rights law in their interpretation of domestic law.104 The NHRI also has an active and ongoing responsibility to advise their Government on an ongoing basis in relation to all these endeavours.

These types of instruments are called \u201csoft\u201d law. They are non-treaty standards, usually but not always, adopted within the framework of the United Nations system. Although not legally binding in and of itself, soft law helps interpret and explain treaty provisions and to develop new standards in emerging areas of international law.105 It can have persuasive authority, and/or provide practical guidance to States, NHRIs and other bodies in the implementation of treaty obligations. Meeting outcome documents and agreements can also reflect expert consensus on agreed meanings and areas for further development. In the context of women\u2019s ESC rights, particular reference should be made to the Vienna Declaration and the Beijing Platform for Action. Key principles relevant to NHRIs and women\u2019s ESC rights are discussed in this section: \ufffd Limburg Principles on the Implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (Limburg Principles) 1986 Module 3: The Legal Framework Equitas 77 Module 3 \ufffd Maastricht Guidelines on Violations of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (Maastricht Guidelines) 1997 \ufffd Montreal Principles on Women\u2019s Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (Montreal Principles) 2002 \ufffd Principles relating to the Status of National Institutions, (Paris Principles) General Assembly Resolution 48/134, 20 December 1993 A. Limburg Principles106 In 1986, a group of distinguished international experts in international law met at the University of Limburg in Maastricht, the Netherlands. They developed a set of principles called The Limburg Principles on the Implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights which provide views on the interpretation of key provisions of the ICESCR. The Limburg Principles preceded General Comment No. 3 (1990) of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on the nature of States parties\u2019 obligations under the Covenant, and were influential during the preparation of that general comment. The Limburg Principles also deal with reporting by States on their compliance with the Covenant. The Limburg Principles create an explicit link between Section 3, the equality section, of the ICESCR, and the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (DEDAW) and CEDAW. This is important because the interdependence of these two instruments is a strategy for ensuring the respect for women\u2019s rights across economic, cultural and social dimensions. B. Maastricht Guidelines107 More than ten years after the Limburg Principles, more than thirty experts met in Maastricht at the invitation of the International Commission of Jurists (Geneva, Switzerland), the Urban Morgan Institute on Human Rights (Cincinnati, Ohio, USA) and the Centre for Human Rights of the Faculty of Law of Maastricht University (the Netherlands). The objective of this meeting was to elaborate on the Limburg Principles with respect to the nature and scope of violations of ESC rights and appropriate responses and remedies. The result was the Maastricht Guidelines on Violations of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Discrimination against women in relation to ESC rights was stated to have been recognized in the ICESCR, and was to be understood in light of the standard of equality for women under CEDAW, which in turn requires elimination of all forms of discrimination against women including gender discrimination arising out of social, cultural and other structural disadvantages. These guidelines are especially relevant to NHRIs because they assist in understanding and determining violations of ESC rights and in providing remedies, in particular regarding monitoring and decision-making at the national, regional and international levels. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 78 Module 3 C. Montreal Principles The Montreal Principles were adopted at a meeting of experts held December 7-10, 2002 in Montreal, Canada. These principles are meant to direct the interpretation and implementation of the guarantees of non-discrimination and equal exercise and enjoyment of ESC rights, found in Articles 3 and 2(2), among others of the ICESCR, so that women can enjoy these rights fully and equally.108 The Principles set out the content and legal source of many women\u2019s ESC rights, and these are provided in detail below.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "48f07770-0126-4ffe-b133-cf0dc1228d48": {"__data__": {"id_": "48f07770-0126-4ffe-b133-cf0dc1228d48", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "74cc2ec7c3ea80360a357d187d94b272d086d4ce4a23984e8f92ed98d3c1f233"}, "2": {"node_id": "af7d123d-1df4-4282-a90d-679cd865b422", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "630bfc8a2efa5cfd4e5d9b586e006a42080621a0352ddf42bb02e4a0d95968fb"}}, "hash": "bb2d4cde543cd2feb633802c5dceb33b04f4012e3436cf3d71f4fcec420fba93", "text": "An adequate standard of living includes: \ufffd Food and freedom from hunger \ufffd Water \ufffd Clothing \ufffd Housing and freedom from forced eviction \ufffd Continuous improvement of living conditions 109 \ufffd Health (which means the highest attainable standard of mental and physical health throughout a woman\u2019s life cycle, including reproductive and sexual health and freedom 110) \ufffd Equal inheritance and ownership of land and property 111 \ufffd The right to social assistance includes social security, social protection, social insurance and social services, including special assistance before, during and after childbirth 112 \ufffd Training and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e3936f3e-a053-49da-aa77-b2477813a227": {"__data__": {"id_": "e3936f3e-a053-49da-aa77-b2477813a227", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eaba7ab6d02152ffc7cd36b2711f052b764772984aaeead279182ef1d3665c09"}}, "hash": "eaba7ab6d02152ffc7cd36b2711f052b764772984aaeead279182ef1d3665c09", "text": "education 113 \ufffd Employment rights include freely chosen work as well as just and favourable conditions of work including fair wages, equal remuneration and protection from sexual harassment and sex discrimination at work 114 \ufffd The right to form and join trade unions 115 \ufffd Protection from economic exploitation 116 \ufffd Protection from coerced and uninformed marriage; 117 \ufffd A clean and healthy environment 118 \ufffd Participate in cultural life 119 \ufffd Claim and enjoy the benefits of patents and intellectual property 120 \ufffd Nationality, and to bestow nationality on children 121 \ufffd Freedom from trafficking and exploitation; recognition of the human rights of trafficked persons 122 Module 3: The Legal Framework Equitas 79 Module 3 D. Paris Principles The Principles relating to the Status of National Institutions (known as the Paris Principles), were endorsed by the UN General Assembly in 1993. The Paris Principles are international minimum standards on the status and roles of NHRIs. These Principles were developed at a UN-sponsored meeting of representatives of national institutions in Paris in 1991, and subsequently endorsed by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and the General Assembly.123 NHRIs have special status in the international human rights community. Typically, NHRIs that conform to the Paris Principles have a unique mandate to work in the area of human rights. They are official independent organizations established by law, with specified powers and functions as set out in their enabling legislation. These institutions combine Government legitimacy and authority, with independence and a \u201cwatch-dog\u201d function that works in parallel with civil society.124 This gives them status, expertise, credibility, and greater access to State use of enforceable authority than either governmental or non-governmental organizations. NHRIs can be catalysts for action and positive change in relation to all human rights. Generally speaking, the Paris Principles require that NHRIs have: \ufffd Independence \ufffd Competence to protect and promote human rights \ufffd A broad mandate clearly set forth in a constitutional or legislative text, and based on universal human rights standards \ufffd Pluralism in membership and staff \ufffd Sufficient resources to fulfill their mandates and perform their functions in an independent manner \ufffd Adequate powers of investigation \ufffd A methodology of cooperation with Government, non-governmental and private-sector organizations and individuals, nationally and internationally In terms of activities and operations, the Paris Principles call for national institutions to: \ufffd Submit opinions, recommendations, proposals and reports concerning the promotion and protection of human rights \ufffd Promote and ensure the harmonization of national legislation, regulation and practices with international human rights instruments to which a State is a party \u2013 and their effective implementation \ufffd Encourage the ratification of international human rights instruments, or accession to those instruments, and to ensure their implementation Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 80 Module 3 \ufffd Contribute to the reports which a State is required to submit to United Nations bodies and committees, and where necessary, express an opinion on the subject, with due respect for the institution\u2019s independence \ufffd Cooperate with the United Nations and other organizations in the United Nations system, the regional institutions and the national institutions of other countries \ufffd Assist in the formulation of human rights education and research programs and to take part in their execution \ufffd Publicize human rights and make efforts to combat all forms of discrimination by increasing public awareness, especially through information and education, and by making use of all press organs In addition, national institutions may be authorized to hear and consider individual complaints and petitions concerning individual human rights violations. They may also encourage and facilitate mediation and alternative dispute resolution, and determine or recommend appropriate remedies. Although the Paris Principles make no specific reference to ESC rights, the Principles do state that \u201ca national human rights institution shall be vested with competence to promote and protect human rights.\u201d 125 NHRIs are to be given \u201cas broad a mandate as possible\u201d and this should be \u201cclearly set forth in a constitutional or legislative text\u201d, which shall specify \u201cits sphere of competence.\u201d They further state that \u201ca national human rights institution shall be vested with competence to promote and protect human rights.\u201d This includes ensuring that ESC rights are realized by both women and men, without discrimination. 81 Module 4 Organizing NHRIs to Achieve Women\u2019s ESC Rights 4 Photo courtesy Sneh Aurora Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 82 Module 4 Overview of Module 4 Module 4 looks at how National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) organize themselves internally to address women\u2019s equality through economic, social", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a6009d51-218c-4010-8123-8df7a948722e": {"__data__": {"id_": "a6009d51-218c-4010-8123-8df7a948722e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "de4e3f098e68bb00dcb808bf8fad760bae51ab3f8ce92676bc81cefbb7d78576"}}, "hash": "de4e3f098e68bb00dcb808bf8fad760bae51ab3f8ce92676bc81cefbb7d78576", "text": "and cultural (ESC) rights. Module 4 is divided into three sections: \ufffd Section 1 - Strategic Planning. Strategic planning has been a key area of focus for the United Nations and other organizations since the 1990s when the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights began promoting the development of NHRIs as the national guardians of human rights law and of international human rights standards. This section looks at good practices for making women\u2019s equality and ESC rights a priority in the NHRI planning process. \ufffd Section 2 - Institutional Capacity. NHRIs must \u201cwalk the talk\u201d. The internal organization of the institution \u2014 in its structure and its work \u2014 should reflect the values that the NHRI is attempting to foster among society at large. Five areas are discussed here: 1. Human Resources: Staffing and professional development strategies help NHRIs actively promote equality of women internally in terms of gender balance and women-positive policies. 2. Gender Mainstreaming v. Specific Programs for Women\u2019s Equality: This section discusses briefly the pros and cons of gender mainstreaming as opposed to specific programs dedicated to women\u2019s issues, and the implications for NHRIs. 3. Organizational Structure and Development: This section provides surveys a range of strategies NHRIs use to enhance their internal capacity to address ESC rights and women\u2019s equality. 4. Knowledge Management: NHRIs need to collect and analyze information about ESC rights and the specific situation of women in their country. They also need to be able to capture and report on their own data about their own organizations. These objectives require information systems, research capacity, access to data and analytical capacity. 5. Training: Successful program delivery for women\u2019s equality and ESC rights requires that staff have technical and professional knowledge, skills and abilities. \ufffd Section 3 \u2013 Coordination and Cooperation. NHRIs should be structured internally to cooperate and collaborate with a variety of stakeholders. This is especially important for women\u2019s ESC rights because of their contextual nature, and the fact that they are so often the result of complex and socially embedded factors, requiring networks and the engagement of multiple social actors. In short, cooperation is not a luxury for NHRIs \u2013 it is a necessity. The following topics are discussed in more detail in this section: donors, engaging civil society, Module 4: Organizing NHRIs to Achieve Women\u2019s ESC Rights Equitas 83 Module 4 Including Women\u2019s ESC Rights in Strategic Planning \u2013 Questions NHRIs Need to Address \ufffd What are the key issues facing women in our country, and how do we find out? \ufffd What does the country data say about the status of women\u2019s issues? \ufffd What are the minimum core obligations of the State in relation to women\u2019s equality rights? \ufffd What are the specific Millenium Development Goals (MDG) targets related to gender issues and equality? How is our country doing in meeting the targets? \ufffd What kinds of complaints are coming through our Commission\u2019s doors and what are they telling us about the issues that we should be treating as priorities? international cooperation, and cooperation with Government and independent agencies. Section 1 Strategic Planning NHRIs must develop and implement mechanisms to ensure that women\u2019s issues and ESC rights are included in their plans of action. This has to be done on two levels: \ufffd First, a gender perspective needs to be applied to all NHRI activities \ufffd Second, specific activities directed towards women\u2019s equality need to be developed As well, action plans should be monitored to ensure that results are being achieved. This requires planning and follow-up. It all begins with strategic planning \u2013 the identification of priority areas to which an NHRI will direct its resources, given the external situation and its internal capacities. Strategic planning is important for the NHRI because: \ufffd It helps direct energy and resources towards important, achievable program initiatives \ufffd It links planning to what is happening externally \ufffd It provides a mechanism through which progress can be measured \ufffd NHRIs can use planning to communicate and coordinate with other stakeholders in a transparent, mutually respectful and beneficial manner \ufffd Donors see planning as an indication of organizational maturity, and often set planning as a condition for supporting the NHRI in future \ufffd It is the first reference point for evaluations It is beyond the scope of this Handbook to provide a complete guide to strategic planning. There are, however, some important considerations to bear in mind to ensure that women\u2019s issues, and specifically women\u2019s issues relevant to ESC rights, inform the strategic planning process.

First, it is vital that an NHRI specifically include women\u2019s ESC rights issues within the strategic planning framework if it is going to be able to identify activities in the area that warrant its attention. This may seem self-evident, but it is not. The hidden nature of certain kinds of rights violations means that they may not be apparent unless one looks for them. It is equally vital to ask at every point of the strategic planning process whether the issue/proposal in question has a gender perspective and whether the proposed activities deal with identified gender issues. This applies to all program activities, whether they are related to specific women\u2019s ESC rights, or are of a more general nature. The same questions should be asked when monitoring progress in achieving these rights. This is part of how gender is both \u201cmainstreamed\u201d, so that it informs all the organization\u2019s activities and how it is given a specific focus at the program level. More about gender mainstreaming can be found in Section 2: Institutional Capacity. Second, developing strategic initiatives and priorities should reflect what is actually happening to women in the country. Third, because it is difficult to \u201cget at\u201d women\u2019s ESC rights, and because ESC work is progressive and long-term, making headway requires vision and organizational discipline to stay the course over a three to five year period \u2013 at least. Fourth, there should be meaningful and transparent participation of stakeholders with expertise in women\u2019s ESC rights, including women at the grassroots level. Successful planning processes should therefore begin by engaging the community at an early stage, through consultations and outreach, by seeking information on national priorities for women, and through meetings and focus groups with civil society. NHRIs can thus better identify and address women\u2019s ESC rights and better engage women themselves in identifying the issues that are important to them. Planning can also highlight particular challenges faced by women on thematic lines. This engagement is necessary to ensure the quality of the plan, to reflect the community\u2019s interest in it, and to allow for coordination and cooperation among stakeholders. Stakeholders should accept the plan as credible and understand why the institution has selected an area of activity and rejected others. The development of a strategic plan is not an end in itself. Rather, it is a \u201croad map\u201d that is only useful if it translates into a concrete plan of action that is monitored regularly, and adjusted as necessary, to ensure that the map is being followed and bringing the institution to the desired destination. Again, this Handbook cannot provide detailed guidance on action planning or monitoring. However, clearly both must involve the application of a gender perspective as discussed above. Module 4: Organizing NHRIs to Achieve Women\u2019s ESC Rights Equitas 85 Module 4 Possible NHRI Activities NHRI programming can: \ufffd Collect data on food security and the nutritional status of girls \ufffd Provide progressive reports on the relative status of girls, especially in rural areas \ufffd Accept complaints from local communities where essential food needs are not being met \ufffd Work with government officials to support the development of progressive plans to improve child nutrition, giving special attention to the gender gap In order to engage in these activities, the NHRI must have planned for this objective, developed the program, and dedicated internal human and other resources. Outcomes of international meetings and declarations can serve as starting points in identifying program choices for women\u2019s ESC rights. The MDGs and the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, for example, outline specific targets that can inform the planning process. This is especially true for those objectives that are linked to minimum core obligations. For example, the right to an adequate standard of living includes a minimum core obligation of access to adequate food. To meet this obligation, the following actions may be necessary:126 \ufffd Develop policies and programs to promote equitable distribution of food within the household \ufffd Formulate and implement, when necessary, specific economic, social, agricultural and related policies in support of female-headed households \ufffd Develop and implement anti-poverty programs, including employment schemes that improve access to food for women living in poverty, including through the use of appropriate pricing and distribution mechanisms \ufffd Promote\u2026household and national food security\u2026 [to improve] the nutritional status of girls and women \u2026", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cc5f1ac1-ed16-4110-a453-a40203a2da08": {"__data__": {"id_": "cc5f1ac1-ed16-4110-a453-a40203a2da08", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "254aa1562d5d6faaf654f97aca4acbb6909b9e57b789c74be914f227a161a8b3"}, "3": {"node_id": "f91dd64a-20cd-4278-a973-23e91f600078", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "80f4723c19c652d4a8540d730a8071ab8bcd4cf2fb732af057f0469a59053575"}}, "hash": "82cdb629f87ff26887db1863f879b10e68705c11611f7912c11bc12d9d264788", "text": "including a reduction of severe and moderate malnutrition among children under the age of five \u2026 giving special attention to the gender gap in nutrition, and a reduction in iron deficiency anaemia in girls and women by one third of the 1990 levels by the year 2000. The MDGs have regional and country targets that can be the basis of even more specialized planning. NHRIs can use these targets in their planning and work to support progressive implementation.127 Some regional targets as well as potential NHRI activities in this regard are set out below and on the next page.

Example: Strategic Planning for Women\u2019s Rights: East Africa In a developing country in sub-Saharan East Africa, a new human rights commission began its strategic planning process by: - Conducting interviews with key authorities, including Government, cabinet members, local leaders dealing with women and children - Meeting with law enforcement authorities and prison officials - Holding national consultations with the public and local leaders, including civil society Through this process the following pervasive issues, linked to cultural traditions and practices, were identified regarding women and girls: - Violence against women, including domestic violence (reportedly affecting as many as 70% of the women in the country) - Unfair division of labour in the home, relegating women to servile positions (in one region, women serve meals to their husbands while literally crawling on their knees) - Denial of access to education for girls, and discriminatory school curricula - Denial of inheritance rights for girls - Arranged and imposed, often early forced marriages - Abductions and rapes, including those that include forced marriages - Female genital mutilation - Discrimination against women in work, including stereotyped job assignments - Prostitution due to lack of alternative employment - Trafficking of women For the first year of operation, the following strategic priorities were identified regarding the rights of women and girls: - Collaboration to investigate trafficking of women and children - Review and development of education curricula for primary and secondary schools, as well as for teacher training colleges - Public education programs on the rights of women and domestic violence - Investigation and recommendations on domestic worker rights, in collaboration with the International Labour Organization (ILO) Resources on gender mainstreaming and planning, and on integrating gender analysis into the planning process can be found at: \ufffd UNESCO and Gender Mainstreaming http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php- URL_ID=8216&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html \ufffd ILO Action Plan on Gender Equality and Gender Mainstreaming http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/gender/newsite2002/about/action.h tm Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 88 Module 4 \ufffd Gender Mainstreaming (Rural issues) (RUAF Foundation) http://www.ruaf.org/taxonomy/term/30 \ufffd World Bank, Gender Mainstreaming in National Policy Planning and Resource Management Cycle http://siteresources.worldbank.org/PGLP/Resources/12.pdf \ufffd Commonwealth Secretariat, The Gender Management System Series http://www.thecommonwealth.org/shared_asp_files/uploadedfiles/%7B69C52 78C-137D-4517-A0F0-39493D0B8918%7D_Selected%20Resources.pdf Section 2 Institutional Capacity If the design and delivery of programs are to respond to the needs of women, then women must be involved in the development of such programs, which cannot function without appropriate management and administrative systems.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f91dd64a-20cd-4278-a973-23e91f600078": {"__data__": {"id_": "f91dd64a-20cd-4278-a973-23e91f600078", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "254aa1562d5d6faaf654f97aca4acbb6909b9e57b789c74be914f227a161a8b3"}, "2": {"node_id": "cc5f1ac1-ed16-4110-a453-a40203a2da08", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "82cdb629f87ff26887db1863f879b10e68705c11611f7912c11bc12d9d264788"}}, "hash": "80f4723c19c652d4a8540d730a8071ab8bcd4cf2fb732af057f0469a59053575", "text": "A.

Here are some questions that NHRIs should ask themselves as they embark on this internal reflection: \ufffd Are there women in senior positions in the NHRI ranks? \ufffd Are there women-positive policies, like maternity leave and alternative work arrangements for working women with families? \ufffd Are there temporary special measures in place to support the professional development of women who have potential in the organization? \ufffd Are steps being taken to ensure that temporary special measures do not generate hostility or resentment among male staff? \ufffd Do hiring and training take into account the skills that staff need to investigate ESC rights and women\u2019s equality issues? Module 4: Organizing NHRIs to Achieve Women\u2019s ESC Rights Equitas 89 Module 4 These answers affect the NHRI\u2019s internal morale and the external credibility. Some of the strategies used by NHRIs include: \ufffd Recommending the appointment of commissioners and appointing senior officials who are women \ufffd Gender balance among staff at all levels \ufffd Having management and internal structures that promote gender equality \ufffd Internal written policies on employment equity, equal opportunity, harassment (including sexual harassment) \ufffd Making public the proportion of men and women at the NHRI, as well as the internal policies (including those on employment equity and equal opportunity) \ufffd Training for commissioners and staff on equality and ESC rights \ufffd Developing temporary special measures such as internal professional development opportunities for qualified women The following example is drawn from an NHRI in Southeast Asia. Example: Professional Development Training for Women in NHRIs128 An NHRI with no women in senior ranks was having difficulty attracting suitable women candidates. A human resources advisor proposed a \u201cWomen in Development Program.\u201d Women would be recruited into core, non-administrative roles, and selected using modified selection criteria. Once selected, these women would be placed on probation while undergoing a training and development program (also open to their male counterparts). Women who would be deemed competent after the training, based on their performance during the program and subsequent on-the-job assessments, would fill the position on a permanent basis. The NHRI was advised to advertise the \u201cWomen in Development Program\u201d with modified selection criteria, which would increase the likelihood that women would apply. B. Gender Mainstreaming v. Specialized Approaches Gender mainstreaming has been a priority for many years for multilateral organizations, Governments and civil society. On the one hand, it ensures gender perspectives across all aspects of the work of an NHRI \u2013 from complaints handling to monitoring and promotional activities. However, experience at both the international and national levels indicates that without a dedicated focus on women\u2019s issues, in addition to mainstreaming, gender issues tend to be minimized or ignored. There is some evidence of under-investment in ongoing analytical and policy- oriented initiatives that are aimed at developing and strengthening equality for women. Gender mainstreaming requires that a gender analysis be conducted on all activities. Similarly, evaluation of the specific effect of the program on women\u2019s ESC rights should be integrated into the planning of the program itself. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 90 Module 4 Gender mainstreaming is not necessarily a global solution to the under-investment in women\u2019s ESC rights and some experts are critical of how gender mainstreaming has worked in practice: If gender mainstreaming was applied and understood as a strategy to address gender inequality \u2026 and achieve fundamental transformation by eliminating gender biases and power imbalances between men and women, it would certainly merit further investment. But one must look long and hard to find examples of gender mainstreaming being implemented \u2013 or even conceptualized \u2013 in this way. Gender mainstreaming, as practiced, is more often used as a strategy for obscuring and under-valuing the significance of gender inequality. 129 This does not mean, however, that gender mainstreaming is not useful, just that the practice has been problematic. Experience suggests that mainstreaming may be more effective if combined with specific interventions for women. A dual approach in the protection and promotion of gender equality and the protection of women\u2019s ESC rights can be achieved through: (1) mainstreaming gender perspective into all policies and programs dealing with ESC rights, and (2) implementing specific interventions to benefit women. C. Organizational Structure and Development How can an organization develop its structure to enhance its ability to address women\u2019s equality and ESC issues? Ideas that have been tested in NHRIs around the world are discussed in this section, ranging from gender mainstreaming as applied to committees, for example, to more specialized", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bdee7195-3cbc-404b-b521-64dcada3dff6": {"__data__": {"id_": "bdee7195-3cbc-404b-b521-64dcada3dff6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9f4488d9be2f07dc45596333df7dc74ddde0b7ad09aca593f01469f3dc244759"}}, "hash": "9f4488d9be2f07dc45596333df7dc74ddde0b7ad09aca593f01469f3dc244759", "text": "official and staff functions, to dedicated structures. Mainstreaming: Internal Complaints Committee Most NHRIs have internal complaints committees that are responsible for reviewing cases on a regular basis, identifying cases that appear to raise the same issues repeatedly and therefore are able to identify systemic problems, including cases of ESC rights and women\u2019s equality. Focal Points The term focal point is not universally accepted, but many organizations and NHRIs use it simply to indicate a point of responsibility within the organization or a liaison for an external initiative. That is how the term is being used here. If systemic issues involving ESC rights are not being adequately identified and addressed through the complaints process or otherwise, focal points can support the process. A range of strategies can be used, alone or in combination, ranging from a \u201csingle person\u201d focal point to special departments, units and cross-departmental committees. First, a commissioner can be appointed as head of women\u2019s issues or gender issues in the commission, which can have the effect of creating an internal and visible Module 4: Organizing NHRIs to Achieve Women\u2019s ESC Rights Equitas 91 Module 4 authority structure for women\u2019s equality issues. Activities undertaken by such individuals and their teams can include: \ufffd Strategic collaboration with Government or other stakeholders on identified ESC issues affecting women \ufffd Independent reporting on women\u2019s equality and ESC rights \ufffd Targeted community outreach and communications on ESC issues affecting women \ufffd Leading \u201cwomen\u2019s parliaments\u201d and consultative forums at the grassroots level to solicit the views of women in the community and to engage local leaders of NGOs or village-level leadership, about women\u2019s ESC rights \ufffd The official might also ensure, on an ongoing basis, that important planning and policy initiatives apply a gender perspective consistently. In other words, this could be seen as \u201cquality assurance\u201d that gender mainstreaming is actually taking place in the organization Example: Australia\u2019s Sex Discrimination Commissioner130 The Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is a national independent statutory Government body. The Sex Discrimination Commissioner has responsibilities relating to issues of discrimination on the basis of sex. She is specifically responsible for issues in relation to federal awards and equal pay under the Workplace Relations Act 1996. The Sex Discrimination Commissioner undertakes research, policy and educative work designed to promote greater equality between men and women. Recent projects have concentrated on paid maternity leave for women workers, career options for women in the finance industry, and eliminating sexual harassment from the workplace. The Commissioner has a broad educational role to highlight the rights of individuals, as well as the responsibility of all members of the community. The Sex Discrimination Commissioner is responsible for administering the federal Sex Discrimination Act 1984. The Act gives effect to Australia's obligations under the CEDAW and parts of ILO Convention 156 regarding family responsibilities. The Commissioner\u2019s responsibilities are to: - Promote equality between men and women - Eliminate discrimination on the basis of sex, marital status or pregnancy and, with respect to dismissals, family responsibilities - Eliminate sexual harassment Recent research and education projects have included researching the effect or consequences of pregnancy and potential pregnancy in the workplace through a National Inquiry, raising awareness of the Sex Discrimination Act amongst young women, and eliminating sexual harassment from the workplace. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 92 Module 4 Special Units and Departments In some NHRIs, there may be difficulties handling gender issues, and a mainstreamed approach may not be adequate. It may be also be that a commissioner who has specific responsibilities in this area needs the support of additional human and other resources. The special circumstances of girls and women may be such that a specialized structure is both necessary and appropriate. Under the direction of a senior official, some NHRIs have created specialized departments, units, or centres for activities related to women\u2019s ESC rights. Program responsibilities include: \ufffd Investigating complaints raising ESC issues and women\u2019s equality rights \ufffd Undertaking research and data collection \ufffd Promotional activities relating to women (and possibly children as well) \ufffd Developing and implementing mechanisms to ensure that all planning, programming and evaluating activities incorporate an equality focus NHRIs often specify that within these activities, special consideration should be given to the needs of disadvantaged persons within these groups. It is important that if this approach is taken, the separate structures do not become ghettoes or that other units are discharged of the general responsibility for women\u2019s rights issues. Three examples of such specialized units within NHRIs are provided below.

Objectives - Bring changes in the situation of women by promoting human rights values in Afghan society - Raise awareness by convening workshops and seminars as well as using mass media and other communication resources - Develop a national strategy for the betterment of women\u2019s rights in the country based on international human rights principles and standards Example: South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) \u2013 Equality Unit 133 Section 9 (4) of the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act of 1996 mandated Parliament to enact legislation within three years to prohibit or prevent unfair discrimination. Parliament enacted the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act No. 2 of 2000 (PEPUDA) and an Equality Unit was established within the SAHRC. The Equality Unit has a broader mandate than gender alone, but it does specifically address sex and gender discrimination: Vision The Equality Unit is committed to the achievement of social justice through the promotion of human rights and in particular the right to equality as set out in section 9 of the constitution and by promoting awareness of the PEPUDA, that seeks to ensure that the inequalities of the past on the basis of gender, disability and race are eradicated. Mission To promote the achievement of substantive equality in the Republic by: - Establishing a conceptual basis upon which the promotion of equality in South Africa should be measured - Monitoring and assessing the observance of the right to equality \u2013 including the implementation of PEPUDA - In collaboration with the Legal Department, investigating complaints around inequality - Conducting research on equality issues and making recommendations on remedies of unfair discrimination - Establishing working relationships with all the relevant stakeholders committed to the promotion of equality - Investigating complaints in connection with equality claims Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 94 Module 4 D. Knowledge Management This Handbook is premised on the idea that the promotion and protection of women\u2019s equality through ESC rights present unique and specific challenges to NHRIs. The capacity to identify progress depends on access to good socioeconomic data, including accurate and timely sex-disaggregated data and the ability to capture internal information about case management within the NHRI. Activities related to research and data collection, as well as the development of effective information systems to manage the data, is known as \u201cknowledge management\u201d. Information Systems Many NHRIs in developing countries, or in States in transition, still gather case statistics manually or use spreadsheets (Excel, for instance). Others have progressed to off-the-shelf databases to capture, generate and report on caseload profiles and to generate reports. As caseloads grow in size and complexity, and as regular reports are required, NHRIs need more capacity to understand their own caseloads, and to report on what is happening with complaints in their systems. Simple relational databases can help to identify patterns, trends and systemic issues. Basic data storage, data manipulation, retrieval and analysis are greatly facilitated by good information systems, and there are many effective ones on the market. Internal knowledge management capacity is especially important for an NHRI\u2019s ability to generate and analyze sex-disaggregated data. With a good system, internal case statistics can disaggregate (or isolate) data involving women\u2019s issues, including those that capture information on specific ESC rights. At a minimum, therefore, complaint management processes should be supported by information technology that enables the disaggregation of data about women\u2019s ESC rights in order to facilitate, standardize and improve the case management system.

Although a snapshot of an NHRI\u2019s current caseload does not necessarily determine strategic areas of intervention, effective knowledge management can, over time, identify trends and support strategic approaches by focusing resources on the cases that seem to make the most difference to women\u2019s equality. Other types of knowledge management activities that require long-term planning include: \ufffd Internal research programs that include women\u2019s ESC issues (either within the organization as a whole or in specialized units or centres) \ufffd Internal archives or documentation centres that systematically collect and classify data on women in relation to ESC rights and equality \ufffd Organizational evaluation programs to assess the progress of women\u2019s ESC rights and the impact of programs in relation to specific targets. Targets relating to both an NHRI\u2019s internal processes and its planned outputs should be assessed matching those targets to international targets where applicable Data Collection: For What? From Whom? The capacity to identify progress in the area of women\u2019s rights and ESC rights at the broader country level depends on the existence of good socioeconomic data, and access to such data. In developed countries, NHRIs generally have access to high quality data through national statistical agencies, although relatively few NHRIs avail themselves of such data systematically. This may be in part because of the tendency to focus on specific cases rather than on policy research and trends analysis from other agencies. Also, the link between human rights and human development is sometimes less explicit in developed countries. In developing countries and countries in transition, however, the obstacles are much greater. Reliable statistical agencies do not always exist. Sometimes the data do exist, but are lodged in various Government departments and are, for all intents and purposes, practically inaccessible. The best solution in these contexts is to rely on the international community. Through UN agencies, the World Bank, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), NHRIs can access pertinent information (especially data in relation to the MDGs). They can use international indices already in existence (such as the Human Development Index) to compare progress and set benchmarks. NHRIs can compare this data with their own internal statistical information to help them assess whether their own caseloads reflect the national situation. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 96 Module 4 E. Training Setting up and developing an NHRI is difficult work, and it is often preceded by intensive training on a range of human rights issues. Often, however, women\u2019s issues are \u201csqueezed into\u201d a few moments of general courses or sometimes they are not covered at all. The result is that general training rarely focuses on women\u2019s ESC rights except in very broad terms. Follow-up or specialized training is not always well integrated into actual practice nor is it well integrated with local issues. NHRIs should ensure that training on gender issues and on ESC rights is undertaken by staff at all levels, ensuring capacity to understand and analyze the issues. Gender sensitivity training for all NHRI staff should also be part of the training, not only for ensuring respect for women\u2019s ESC rights within the organization, but also for ensuring understanding of particular issues regarding sexual harassment and sex discrimination. Training should be coordinated to develop expertise in treaty obligations, national law, and strategies for engaging women in local leadership and communities. Training sessions should be delivered on site, wherever possible, to avoid disruption of work. They should move in sequence from the general to the particular, although there is no set pattern or particular order.

Multiple parties, sectors and States need to be involved to find solutions. NHRI require the active and ongoing engagement of others, including: the international community, regional institutions, Government bodies and institutions with parallel or complementary mandates (Commissions on women\u2019s issues, for example). While some activities, by their nature, cannot be carried out jointly \u2013 investigations, for example \u2013 other activities, by their nature, usually require cooperation. Among others, projects in the areas of research, or human rights education, or advice to Government, are particularly well-suited to cooperative approaches. However, cooperation requires that NHRIs have planned for the activities and have the staffing levels and resources to sit on external committees and engage in cooperative projects. ESC rights require engagement with many sectors of society and organizations, and they tend to focus less on individual responsibility. Some writers have observed that in civil and political rights cases, it is often possible to identify a single rights violation, a single violator, and a remedy to address the violation. It is difficult, if not impossible, to find a single violation or violator of ESC rights, because of their complex and structural nature.134 NHRIs should include cooperation and collaboration as specific objectives in their long-term planning so that: \ufffd The various agencies involved do not duplicate efforts \ufffd There are no gaps in programs \ufffd Consistent and clear messages are presented to the public Some NHRIs, for example, have created National Promotion and Education Committees that include representatives from NGOs, Government and community leadership for the specific purpose of encouraging and facilitating cooperation and collaboration. NHRIs should exercise their functions collaboratively in association with other democratic mechanisms that also have responsibilities for human rights protection Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 98 Module 4 and promotion, including Government, the judiciary, the legislature, the police and military, NGOs and civil society. NHRIs can help create structures for regular interaction and consultation among these stakeholders as well as other stakeholders, including academic institutions and the media. NHRIs should ensure that the roles and mandates of all stakeholders are clearly defined and understood. Some of the specific roles are discussed below. A. Donors Effective donor coordination in developing countries is critical for the success of the planning process, as well as in the technical capacity projects that support many of the strategies addressed here. For a number of reasons, NHRI-related capacity building in developing countries is often sporadic, with multiple, unrelated or even duplicated training being offered by different donors, often over similar time periods.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "89898f0f-e9e8-4da1-ba06-1e8b704e6d9b": {"__data__": {"id_": "89898f0f-e9e8-4da1-ba06-1e8b704e6d9b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fde964628d714a0222bf4900c078a49b5fde0da70a864d616921721aace0b28e"}, "2": {"node_id": "e164dfdf-2e73-45e1-8cc9-e493b63f37f6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f765975f07bf6bba4f1a92155e2a386e94bd6161cc1808779d2cc9b103d3b8fc"}}, "hash": "874f609e933cb057fc20ea5505471e931d2f105a39ecbc1954845d338b261990", "text": "This can occur because of pressure on donors to deliver aid dollars or lack of coordination among donors and/or NHRIs.

Some NHRIs specifically build donor coordination into their strategic planning objectives as part of their overall coordination objectives. B. Engaging Civil Society NHRIs should also recognize the fundamental role played by civil society and the private sector, and establish and maintain close contact and good relationships with these sectors. Because of the important responsibilities of non-state actors in human rights, NHRIs should create better linkages with employers and corporate citizens and with civil society more widely, including religious groups and local leaders. The Paris Principles require pluralism in the work of NHRIs, that is, the engagement of various sectors of society. They require NHRIs to develop relationships with NGOs devoted to human rights protection and promotion, economic and social development, combating racism, and to protecting particularly vulnerable groups.135 This requirement may be met by ensuring that the NHRI is set up in a way that facilitates dialogue, consultation and cooperation. Paris Principles specifically require NHRI relationships with NGOs devoted to promoting and protecting human rights. This means that the involvement of NGOs in strategic planning can provide advantages to NHRIs. Given the understanding of local issues that NGOs bring to Module 4: Organizing NHRIs to Achieve Women\u2019s ESC Rights Equitas 99 Module 4 Engaging African NGOs in NHRI Strategic Planning NGOs and other members of civil society in Uganda and Rwanda, including women\u2019s organizations, have been systematically involved in those countries\u2019 NHRI strategic planning. NGOs have participated in consultations for the identification and definition of priorities, and in the design of action plans as partners in certain aspects of program delivery. While final decision making always rests with the Commissions, true collaboration in the identification and design of priorities and programs is more effective in the long term. It is very important that this process includes women\u2019s organizations and that it extend to rural areas. the table, and their grassroots involvement and experience, their cooperation can improve mutual understanding of and support for the strategic priorities of NHRIs. Ultimately, the strength of cooperation and collaboration between NHRIs and the NGO sector starts with the planning process, and can be continued by including them in selected training sessions and in monitoring activities. NHRIs should pay attention to gender balance when they consult with NGOs, not only be sure to include women\u2019s NGOs, but also to encourage gender balance in NGOs they work with. The organizations might include: \ufffd Women\u2019s human rights NGOs \ufffd Community service organizations involved in providing services to women victims of domestic violence \ufffd Women\u2019s health groups, including reproductive health, sexual violence, mental health, etc. \ufffd Women\u2019s groups working in prisons \ufffd Groups working with women agricultural and migrant workers \ufffd Regional and local women\u2019s associations \ufffd Anti-poverty and legal aid groups \ufffd Women\u2019s legal and lawyers\u2019 associations \ufffd Self-help and entrepreneurship groups supporting women Establishing and maintaining close contacts with NGOs is vital for an NHRI. NGOs at the grassroots level have access to broad networks; they can also encourage community- level support for the work of NHRIs and information-sharing and monitoring about human rights situations on the ground. Partnering with NGOs, as well as with media and State officials on specific persistent social problems, or to follow up and monitor Government actions on women\u2019s issues. As the example from India on the next page demonstrates, issues affecting women can result in concerted and coordinated action.

As well, the reporting processes under human rights Treaty bodies are strategic opportunities for building partnerships and collaborative links among stakeholders. C. International Cooperation The Paris Principles recognize the importance of cooperation and collaboration with a wide range of organizations and groups in order to ensure the effectiveness of NHRIs.

In addition, international cooperation can considerably facilitate the work of NHRIs in connection with treaty monitoring and reporting, topics that will be dealt with in greater detail in later sections. Regional groupings of NHRIs also provide the opportunity for concerted action on selected topics that affects girls and women. Module 4: Organizing NHRIs to Achieve Women\u2019s ESC Rights Equitas 101 Module 4 Example: Regional Coordination and the Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions (APF) Trafficking Focal Point Network137 The Trafficking Focal Point Network is a regional network established in 1999. Network members are members, commissioners or senior staff from NHRIs in the Asia Pacific region, and include Australia, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, and Thailand. Members share information, undertake research and develop cooperative projects. Resource materials are shared and used in training programs and good practices are identified, documented and distributed among the network. Network members have also been involved in a number of successful interventions in cases of trafficking. The work of the network has helped improve the capacity of APF members to support regional Governments in their efforts to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking. A workshop was held in Sydney, Australia in 2005, entitled the APF Regional Workshop on Trafficking and National Human Rights Institutions: Cooperating to End Impunity for Traffickers and Secure Justice for Victims.138 Example: NHRI Cooperation with Special Rapporteurs139 There is a growing movement through the ICC and regional NHRI networks to enhance and strengthen cooperation between Special Procedures and mandate holders, and NHRIs. The APF\u2019s position paper on Special Procedures was adopted by the ICC during the institution-building phase of the Human Rights Council in 2007. NHRIs and regional bodies can invite Special Rapporteurs to their country or region to develop or enhance cooperation between NHRIs and Special Rapporteurs. In 2001, for example, the Independent Expert on the Right to Development was invited to attend and address the Asia Pacific Forum ESC Rights Workshop held in Hong Kong. APF had recognized that NHRIs had very little understanding of the processes or role of Special Rapporteurs (and, indeed, vice versa), and has used its regional platform to encourage a deeper understanding between NHRIs and Special Rapporteurs.

Cooperation with Government and Independent Agencies As Governments multiply their institutions to address one issue or another, the sheer number of independent institutions, or specialized bodies, can make issue-based governance bewildering and complex. The Paris Principles state that NHRIs should consult with other bodies responsible for human rights protection and promotion (e.g., ombudsman offices, mediators and similar institutions).140 This would also include Government departments that have specific responsibilities, say for women or children, or other established commissions, such as gender or women\u2019s commissions, which also have mandates to protect and/or promote the rights of women. There is nonetheless a question that often arises as to overlapping jurisdiction with other independent institutions, including specialized commissions such as audit bodies, ombudsman offices and the like. One strategy is to adopt the precedent for organizations (ombudsman, human rights commissions, etc.) to work together as peers, in a complementary and mutually supportive way.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e1f65964-c3f8-4c03-a4b9-5ece82238975": {"__data__": {"id_": "e1f65964-c3f8-4c03-a4b9-5ece82238975", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "13654201a4a04be70f48cbf2b96bfc14d2eb36a2dc8c1ee7f790f75825485a8a"}, "2": {"node_id": "131a7a64-9803-4d84-b467-f869e0ea459f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4159ebf1620ca0bd935d8b0e8156ba7c18383d7f35cdeca225a8bd51c064a2a3"}}, "hash": "cd4aa22093adec965a8fd33f516c9cf7590eac7f6bc98586dc197734d2318274", "text": "to work together as peers, in a complementary and mutually supportive way.

Module 4: Organizing NHRIs to Achieve Women\u2019s ESC Rights Equitas 103 Module 4 Example: Cooperation and Collaboration in Lobbying the Government: Malaysia142 In 2005, the National Human Rights Commission of Malaysia, SUHAKAM, in collaboration with the UNDP, organized a High-Level Policy Dialogue on \u201cA Human Rights Perspective on MDGs and Beyond.\u201d The session focused on adopting human rights principles in the development and implementation of country-specific MDG targets and indicators for Malaysia, and a specific objective to strengthen the bonds of partnership and relationship among the Government, UNDP, NGOs, and other organizations. Two Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were selected that have a direct bearing on women\u2019s ESC rights: - Goal 3: To Promote gender equality and empower women - Goal 5: Improve maternal health One objective was to facilitate the development of country-specific MDG targets and indicators for Malaysia. Among the issues discussed were the poverty level of female- headed households, the low female labour force participation, the lower-level employment of women, and maternal health. It was recommended that disaggregated data be collected on these issues, especially for vulnerable groups such as single mothers. Key Recommendations: - That working arrangements be made more flexible, particularly for women, to encourage female labour force participation, including allowing home-based jobs and providing child nurseries within or close to the workplace. - That care should be taken to ensure that the implementation of home-based jobs is done in a manner that does not reinforce the stereotyped roles of men and women - That the Government improves the country\u2019s maternity benefits to encourage more women to participate in the country\u2019s labour force. - That reproductive health should be added to the country-specific target to improve maternal health with particular focus on vulnerability to disease - That issues relating to pregnant teenagers being forced to drop out of schools by school administrations be addressed. Example: Collaboration on Eradicating Child Prostitution: India The Indian Human Rights Commission worked with the Department of Women and Child Development, the Government of India, the National Commission for Women (NCW) and UNICEF to deal with the problem of child prostitution. To better coordinate efforts, the Commission constituted a Core Group on Child Prostitution involving the above-mentioned groups. It also launched a massive media campaign on the issue of child prostitution, with the help of State Governments, UNICEF, the NCW and NGOs. The NHRC also worked with the NCW and the Department of Women and Child Development on the issue of child marriage. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 104 Module 4 Example: Joint Public Campaigns to Combat Female Genital Mutilation: Tanzania143 The Commission on Human Rights and Good Governance in Tanzania investigates cases of alleged abuse against women and children. Relevant issues include: sexual and gender-based violence, discrimination against women and girls and female genital mutilation (FGM). These issues require not only the Tanzanian commission\u2019s attention, but also require the intervention of Government and local leadership at all levels. Public campaigns by both the Commission and several Governments denouncing violence and prohibiting harmful traditional countrywide practices have been undertaken. Example: Promoting the Integration of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights into the Educational Curriculum: Northern Ireland144 The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission has developed a productive working relationship with the Department of Education. It is contributing to the development of the human rights elements of the school curriculum by commenting on draft proposals in that regard.

Conclusion According to the UN Handbook for NHRIs on ESC rights: \u201cTo deal with [women\u2019s] economic, social and cultural rights, a national human rights institution will need to consider whether or how its mandate includes those rights and whether and how its mandate extends to all types of perpetrators of violations of [women\u2019s] economic, social and cultural rights.\u201d145 Improving women\u2019s ESC rights requires both appropriate internal organizational policies and planning to ensure success and credibility. NHRIs around the world use a variety of creative strategies to protect and promote women\u2019s ESC rights. These strategies include: strategic planning, institutional capacity building, human resources strategies, organizational structure and training programs, as well as the development of knowledge management and information systems that are capable of capturing, presenting and analyzing disaggregated data on women\u2019s ESC rights. This Module has emphasized the importance of internal capacity building and cooperation in the long term. 105 Module 5 The Protection Mandate \u2013 Complaints Handling, Investigation and Monitoring 5 Photo courtesy Pamela Teitelbaum Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 106 Module 5 Overview of Module 5 Module 5 of the Handbook examines investigation and monitoring by national human rights institutions (NHRIs) in relation to women\u2019s equality and economic, social and cultural (ESC) rights. The Paris Principles provide that NHRIs should promote and protect human rights. The protection aspect of the mandate depends on the power of the NHRI to investigate and monitor human rights and, in most cases, to accept and investigate individual complaints. In the context of ESC rights, broad social and governance contexts that give rise to rights violations are not always easily attributable to single incidents or particular perpetrators. The classic investigative techniques that are well suited to most civil and political rights cases may not necessarily lend themselves as well to ESC complaints and women\u2019s equality issues. Although generalizations are difficult to make, it is often true that systemic approaches, grouped complaints and research-based approaches to establishing a fact base may be better suited to these complaints. The strategies that are discussed in this Module reflect the approach taken elsewhere in this Handbook \u2013 namely that a mix of gender mainstreaming and directed or targeted approaches is required to address women\u2019s ESC rights. \ufffd Section 1 \u2013 The Paris Principles and Investigations, examines the general mandate of NHRIs to investigate human rights violations and complaints under the Paris Principles. \ufffd Section 2 \u2013 Investigating Women\u2019s ESC Rights Violations, reviews how NHRIs investigate ESC issues and human rights complaints involving women\u2019s equality. It covers early intervention strategies such as counselling, identifying patterns and systemic issues, special considerations for interviewing women complainants and witnesses, case management strategies, operations manuals and access to justice issues related to remedies. \ufffd Section 3 \u2013 Public Inquiries, examines public inquiries as a key strategy for protecting women\u2019s rights. \ufffd Section 4 \u2013 Monitoring, focuses on monitoring human rights. \ufffd Section 5 \u2013 Alternative Dispute Resolution, briefly reviews alternative dispute resolution processes. Module 5: The Protection Mandate \u2013 Complaints Handling, Investigation and Monitoring Equitas 107 Module 5 Section 1 The Paris Principles and Investigations146 The Paris Principles, under the section entitled \u201cMethods of operation\u201d, state that all national institutions should have the authority to consider any issue within their jurisdiction, on their own initiative, on the proposal of a member, or when requested to do so by any petitioner. The Principles also state that NHRIs should have the authority to hear any person or obtain any information or document necessary to carry out their work. The Paris Principles do not, however, require that NHRIs investigate individual complaints. There are some accredited NHRIs that do not have this authority. In some jurisdictions, there is no national institution at all: for example in Europe and in two Canadian jurisdictions, commissions no longer receive complaints. Instead, parties file their complaints directly with a tribunal.147 However, these institutions are the exception. Most NHRIs have \u201cquasi- jurisdictional\u201d status, that is, in terms of their investigative powers: \ufffd They have the general authority to protect human rights and the specific authority to submit reports, recommendations or opinions on any situation of human rights as", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bbbfc026-3669-4112-91a3-a70759d39d21": {"__data__": {"id_": "bbbfc026-3669-4112-91a3-a70759d39d21", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "848821e9604b80ee57ec209d76d1385b23937def660aa13610a0597e24ecd20e"}}, "hash": "848821e9604b80ee57ec209d76d1385b23937def660aa13610a0597e24ecd20e", "text": "well as to consider any question falling within its competence. \ufffd They have the legislative authority to receive and deal with individual complaints, and may consider \u201ccomplaints and petitions concerning individual situations\u201d from any petitioner. \ufffd Any petitioner may be an individual, his or her representative, a third party, a non-governmental organization (NGO), a trade union or any other representative organization. For women, especially those who are vulnerable or who exert less power in their communities, this representative capacity can offer critical support in order to bring forward a complaint. Section 2 Investigating Women\u2019s ESC Rights Violations In general, the broad power to take up and investigate human rights violations is a core responsibility of NHRIs. Section 232(e) of the Beijing Platform of Action urges Governments to: Strengthen and encourage the development of programmes to protect the human rights of women in the national institutions on human rights\u2026 such as human rights commissions or ombudspersons, [and to accord] appropriate status, resources and access to the Government to assist individuals, in particular women, and ensure that these institutions pay adequate attention to problems involving the violation of the human rights of women. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 108 Module 5 Even if an NHRI\u2019s enabling legislation grants the basic power to investigate human rights matters, and to receive individual complaints, ESC rights cases do not always present themselves in neat or clear categories: few complaints are filed with a label saying \u201cthis is a women\u2019s ESC rights complaint.\u201d Human rights violations are often the product of broad social, economic, and governance contexts and not easily attributable to single incidents, causes, or particular perpetrators. As a result, case handling strategies and classic investigative techniques that are well suited to many civil and political rights cases (establishing event timelines, chain of evidence, simple cause-and-effect assumptions), while still relevant, may not necessarily be sufficient for ESC complaints involving women\u2019s equality. NHRIs also need the capacity to: network with human rights advocates, intervene early and effectively to counsel complainants; identify issues and patterns of human rights violations; and develop strategies for witness/victim interview techniques. A. Early Intervention and Counselling Several NHRIs use early information sessions and counselling for all parties in an effort to convey information about rights and obligations. These early services have the added advantage for NHRIs of providing an \u201cearly warning system\u201d to identify human rights issues and trends as they emerge, and to highlight discriminatory practices, including those affecting women. In some countries, counselling and support services may be particularly appealing for persons who experience stereotyping and discrimination, but who will not file a formal complaint. In some countries, for reasons of confidentiality and cultural norms, this may be a more appealing option for women. Example: Counselling Services in South Korea148 The National Human Rights Commission of the Republic of Korea offers counselling for clients who are subjected to discriminatory practices on the grounds of their disability, gender, and other reasons. The Human Rights Counselling Center provides a place for people to share their stories of injustice and receive information and support on various aspects of human rights violations. Counselling can range from general legal questions to information about human rights violations. Specific projects were supported to offer counselling to women with disabilities and women victims of conjugal violence. According to the Commission, \u201cdiscrimination against women and the disabled are still deeply embedded in the consciousness and social practices.\u201d As a result of the information the Commission obtained about discriminatory practices through counselling, the Commission has proposed policies to remedy discriminatory practices that still need to be established and implemented. B. Identifying Patterns and Systemic Issues NHRIs never have enough resources. Even in wealthier countries, women\u2019s ESC rights tend to receive limited attention. Therefore, it is critically important to focus scarce resources on the strategic cases pertaining to women\u2019s ESC rights. These Module 5: The Protection Mandate \u2013 Complaints Handling, Investigation and Monitoring Equitas 109 Module 5 should be cases that have been selected through the strategic planning process, and that appear to reflect current and serious issues for women. Information systems are a powerful tool to support NHRIs in identifying which cases to investigate and in creating a \u201cfact base\u201d for a specific type of case. Databases in particular have become indispensable for identifying patterns and addressing issues at a systemic level. Internal case statistics can be disaggregated to better address women\u2019s issues: as noted in Module 4, Section 2, although a snapshot of an NHRI\u2019s current caseload does not necessarily determine strategic areas of intervention for the future,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1fbe58e2-906b-4ea9-8a1f-dd93c875bbb5": {"__data__": {"id_": "1fbe58e2-906b-4ea9-8a1f-dd93c875bbb5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fee4e3f0b039aa2d7d22ba153c877280de41a5629c1c3ddce789c648db5c35f0"}}, "hash": "fee4e3f0b039aa2d7d22ba153c877280de41a5629c1c3ddce789c648db5c35f0", "text": "good data can help to understand what is happening generally. Information about the case load can become a primary data source for NHRIs, especially when the national country data is not easily available. Over time, an NHRI\u2019s information system can generate data that can, in turn, serve as a decision-making tool. (See the section on Knowledge Management in Module 4, Section 2.) Internal case management committees are a useful organizational mechanism in NHRIs. They can identify cases coming in, or under investigation that raise systemic issues or patterns of human rights violations. They are also a key strategy to mainstream gender issues in NHRIs. Most NHRIs have such committees, which track progress on cases ensuring that priority cases are brought to the attention of senior staff. They can also ensure that women\u2019s ESC cases are properly identified, flagged and resourced. These committees ensure, based on the data collection and monitoring referred to earlier, that proper resources are allocated to cases that raise systemic issues and that individual cases with shared features are grouped together or pooled, as appropriate. Example: Grouping or Pooling Cases on Women\u2019s Issues Statistical breakdowns of complaints can show a \u201cclustering\u201d of certain types of cases and reveal patterns of human rights violations. Rather than dealing with each on a case by case basis, and using up valuable resources, NHRIs can: - Group or pool cases in a single investigation - Remove underlying or structural barriers to equality This can create \u201ceconomies of scale\u201d, helping to solve a large number of complaints with fewer human resources or it can point the way to human rights issues that are especially serious. This approach can also facilitate collaboration with other national institutions with partly overlapping mandates. For example, if an NHRI\u2019s case management data shows that it has several cases involving the rights of women in employment (e.g., women being fired from their jobs while they were pregnant) those complaints might be grouped and investigated together since they involve a similar policy issue. Moreover, the complaints might illustrate the need for better worker-protection legislation, which the institution could champion, and a broad public education program for employers about protections for women. continued Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 110 Module 5 Grouping example continued An additional example in the area of women prisoners is the Canadian Human Rights Commission\u2019s work in the treatment of women inmates in federal institutional and community correctional services. Of particular concern was the treatment of incarcerated Aboriginal women and women with cognitive and mental disabilities. The Canadian Human Rights Commission agreed to conduct a broad-based review of the treatment of federally sentenced women on the basis of gender, race and disability, rather than dealing with individual complaints. In December 2003, the Commission released the report, Protecting Their Rights: A Systemic Review of Human Rights in Correctional Services for Federally Sentenced Women. It identified systemic barriers to full equality and puts forward 19 recommendations for action related to risk and need assessment; safe and humane custody and supervision; rehabilitation and reintegration programming; and mechanisms for redress.149 As part of a systemic approach, NHRIs need fact bases and data to understand where a country is in relation to its minimum core obligations, and/or the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). This information can serve as a critical starting point for investigations into ESC rights violations or women\u2019s equality rights. Example: Using the Millennium Development Goals \u2013 Cambodia As noted in Module 2, Section 2, the MDGs allow NHRIs to identify baseline information about goals, including gender equality. In the example cited earlier in the section on the MDGs, Cambodia has developed the following specific objectives to reduce violence against women.150 Overall Target: Reduce significantly all forms of violence against women and children by: - Specific Target 1: Ensuring that 100% of victims in cases of domestic violence are counselled by qualified personnel by 2015 - Specific Target 2: Ensuring that 100% of the population is aware that violence against women is wrongful behaviour and a criminal act by 2015 - Specific Target 3: Collecting annual statistics to monitor violence against women by 2005 In a hypothetical scenario where women complain about the lack of progress, either because the law was not brought into effect, or because no resources are dedicated to supporting women who are victims of violence, these goals and the development of data through annual statistics (Specific Target 3 above) can be used to build a case that a Government has not lived up to its targets, and this could support a human rights complaint.

Once a major systemic issue has been identified, the NHRI requires the internal capacity to manage it. Institutions use strategies like the creation of special \u201cissue- based\u201d teams that are mobilized to handle complex files. Module 5: The Protection Mandate \u2013 Complaints Handling, Investigation and Monitoring Equitas 111 Module 5 Example: Special Response Teams to Address Systemic Issues The Office of the Ontario Ombudsman has developed a set of criteria for identifying systemic cases and a special procedure for managing them. The following criteria were developed and are adapted here to focus on issues affecting women and women\u2019s ESC rights: - The case presents a serious and sensitive issue of high public interest for women and involves women\u2019s ESC rights - There are broad systemic implications for women\u2019s ESC rights - The facts are complex and/or are not agreed upon - There is no likelihood of an informal resolution to the complaint Once these criteria are met, a specialized team is struck within the institution, consisting of experienced investigators who conduct complex, issue-driven investigations according to structured investigation plans. It is helpful in such cases to use cross-disciplinary teams, e.g., policy research, legal, investigation and communications support, that are dedicated to the issue. C. Interviewing Women in Human Rights Investigations Women who step forward to file complaints or act as witnesses are vulnerable. NHRIs should be aware of the fact that this vulnerability may translate into exposure to reprisal, and that interviewing techniques may re-traumatize a victim. The following advice, based primarily on material developed by the United Nations, was developed in the context of violence against women, and cases involving refugees. While some of these comments have general application and may be adapted to other circumstances, special interview considerations are especially relevant to interviewing such women. Guidelines for Interviewing Women in Human Rights Investigations The following excerpt from field operations manuals set out relevant considerations that may be useful for NHRIs: Preparation \ufffd Conducting investigations into violations of women\u2019s rights requires that NHRI officers familiarize themselves with the domestic and international legal framework. \ufffd Interviewers should inform themselves of possible risks to the safety of interviewees and their families. \ufffd Women complainants may feel uncomfortable speaking to a male NHRI officer, especially if they are complaining about a human rights violation involving sexual violence. As much as possible, complaints by women involving sexual harassment and sexual violence should be handled by women officers. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 112 Module 5 \ufffd Personal comfort should be considered: officers should have drinking water and some tissues at hand. Interview Setting and Confidentiality \ufffd The interview should take place in a confidential and quiet setting, where the complainant, victim or witness (\u201cinterviewee\u201d) feels comfortable and safe. \ufffd The interviewee should be assured of confidentiality not only for herself but also her family. At the same time, interviewers should not offer to provide security and personal safety if they cannot actually follow up on this guarantee. \ufffd File and interview notes should be kept in locked and secure locations. \ufffd Interviews with perpetrators and other witnesses should not be back-to-back so as to avoid individuals meeting each other in waiting rooms. \ufffd Witness identity and details should not be disclosed with other witnesses. \ufffd The location should not lead others to assume that she is complaining about a perpetrator or has been a victim of conjugal or sexual violence. \ufffd Care should be taken not to draw attention to the interviewee. \ufffd If a victim is unable or unwilling to discuss the matter, staff should ask discreet and indirect questions. If she is still unwilling to share her problem, the staff member should not force the issue, but assure the person that staff are always available to assist if she is ready. Interview Techniques \ufffd Establish a basic rapport with the interviewee. The interviewer should take the time to introduce him/herself and the interpreter, explain clearly what his or her role is and the exact purpose of the interview. \ufffd The interviewee should be informed that she does not have to be interviewed, can refuse to answer any questions that she does not feel comfortable with, and can stop the interview at any time. \ufffd The interviewer should remain neutral, compassionate, sensitive and objective during the interview. \ufffd The interviewer should be aware of gender differences in communication, especially regarding non-verbal communication.

Recording Information \ufffd With an assurance of absolute confidentiality, notes should be taken discreetly during the interview. The interviewee should know that the conversation is being documented and why. Module 5: The Protection Mandate \u2013 Complaints Handling, Investigation and Monitoring Equitas 113 Module 5 Irrelevance of Previous Sexual History Except in Relation to Past Sexual Attacks \ufffd The previous sexual history of a victim of sexual assault is irrelevant except in relation to any previous sexual attacks. \ufffd Knowledge of any previous sexual (or other) attacks is relevant to both protection of the victim and her psychosocial well-being. Regarding protection, knowledge of a previous attack may suggest that the victim has been specifically targeted rather than chosen at random and may thus need urgent protection measures. Re-traumatization \ufffd Interviewers should be extremely careful not to re-traumatize victims. \ufffd This occurs when a \"triggering\" event causes the victim to be overwhelmed by memory and feelings from the previous trauma. As such, questioning should be done gently and discreetly and at the victim's own pace. Using Interpreters \ufffd The interpreter should be the same gender as the interviewee where possible. \ufffd The interviewer and the interpreter should be aware of linguistic and cultural issues in interpreting. For example, words such as \"rape\" or \"assault\" may have different meanings or connotations in the victim's language. \ufffd In some community services, staff use not only language interpreters but also cultural interpreters to ensure that the interviewee\u2019s context is properly understood and communicated. This may be especially useful when dealing with women from a minority group. Concluding Interview \ufffd At the conclusion of the interview, the confidentiality should be reiterated. Any follow-up actions should be explained. \ufffd Ensure that follow-up counselling as well as medical and legal assistance are made available. \ufffd The interviewee should also be given the opportunity to ask any questions.

Operations Manuals Operations manuals can help NHRIs establish and systematize case handling procedures. Operations manuals serve to establish and make concrete a stable set of rules and procedures about how cases are handled. Manuals typically provide step-by-step advice on dealing with cases, highlighting important areas of consideration, and they generally deal with all stages of complaint investigation, including complaint screening, handling and resolution, as well as complaint tracking and using flow charts to promote clarity. The manuals should be easy to read, with material that is easily accessible.

In the case of women\u2019s ESC rights, the publishing of this information can be especially important since women\u2019s NGOs do not generally have the same resources or capacity as other NGOs to make their views heard or to attend meetings held by NHRIs. E. Access to Justice Where there is a right, there must be a remedy. NHRIs may investigate cases, but in order to make proposed remedies enforceable, an order is generally required from a tribunal or court. NHRIs in many countries have enabling legislation that permits them to intervene before the courts and to support the applicant. This may be especially significant where women do not have the means to bring forward cases themselves. NHRIs can also intervene in public interest litigation on women\u2019s ESC rights and can strengthen them, intervening before the courts on specific issues. Women face particular barriers in developing countries in getting to the courts, and NHRIs can facilitate access. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has raised specific concerns about how accessible the courts are for women. In particular, NHRIs have a role in ensuring that women have the means and the information to obtain remedies through the court system. In cases with criminal implications, this requires the cooperation of the Attorney General or public prosecutor, as shown in the following Indian case. Example: Release of Bonded Labourers: Cooperation with Attorney General151 The Indian National Human Rights Commission noticed a press report which appeared in the Indian Express entitled \u201c84 Bonded Labourers Freed, Narrate Shocking Tales of Torture, Molestation.\u201d In the press report, it was stated that 84 bonded labourers alleged that they were beaten and the women workers, raped and molested. None of the workers were paid their wages. The Human Rights Commission obtained Police reports and inquired as to whether the labourers had actually been released. The Commission noted that it was not clear whether a District Magistrate had been seized of the file to issue the necessary release certificates. The District Labour Officer was ordered to ensure successful prosecution of the offender, in collaboration with the concerned Public Prosecutor and/or the District Attorney in order to take the case to its conclusion. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 116 Module 5 Section 3 Public Inquiries Many NHRIs have a mandate to undertake public inquiries on their own initiative into human rights situations or issues. These powers can highlight the issues women face in the realization of their ESC rights. Public inquiries are mechanisms through which an NHRI can examine systemic or general human rights issues in depth and from all perspectives. Typically, public inquiries involve the establishment of a panel with defined terms of reference, and a mandate to hold hearings to which witnesses can be summoned to testify. In its proceedings, an inquiry acts somewhat like a court, but with less formality. The ultimate purpose is to make comprehensive, sound recommendations for dealing with the issue under review. In addition, however, the inquiry is useful in monitoring Government activity in a defined area, and promoting public discussion and examination of an important issue, potentially bringing a hidden issue into the public domain. The extent of the powers available to a commission for this type of inquiry will be set out in its enabling law but should include the authority to summon witnesses and compel their appearance, as well as to receive oral and written testimony under oath. In 2007, the Asia Pacific Forum hosted NHRIs from across the Asia Pacific region to pool experiences and expertise on running national public inquiries as part of a pilot training program.152 Public inquires were identified as effective tools for addressing systemic discrimination and violations of human rights. According to expert Brian Burdekin, who facilitated several of the sessions, It\u2019s a strategy that allows a human rights commission to do three things simultaneously: investigate an issue, monitor Government performance and educate the community. Public inquiries have been held into a wide range of human rights issues, including: \ufffd Starvation deaths and the right to health (India) \ufffd Mental illness and homeless children (Australia) \ufffd Torture (Mongolia) \ufffd Accessible public transport (New Zealand) Formal seminars and group exercises provided participants with practical \u2018how to\u2019 strategies on: \ufffd Setting up a public inquiry, including choosing the inquiry subject, establishing terms of reference, developing an appropriate methodology, identifying stakeholders and undertaking sufficient planning and preparation \ufffd Resourcing a national inquiry, including the involvement of commissioners and staff, financial resources and community resources Module 5: The", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fb38aae3-4665-44a1-ad1b-79ecb0e17383": {"__data__": {"id_": "fb38aae3-4665-44a1-ad1b-79ecb0e17383", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c4482a8f822fcca1d87ee949ad580000edff36ae4da8c4a03d81958940550908"}}, "hash": "c4482a8f822fcca1d87ee949ad580000edff36ae4da8c4a03d81958940550908", "text": "Protection Mandate \u2013 Complaints Handling, Investigation and Monitoring Equitas 117 Module 5 \ufffd Educating and informing the community, including strategies for working with journalists and the media \ufffd Planning follow-up activities and advocating for the inquiry recommendations The initial mandate of a public inquiry is quite important, as it sets the parameters of why and how the inquiry will be set up and operated. Here is a sample mandate of a public inquiry on racial profiling, based on a 2003 public inquiry in Canada.153 Example: Racial Profiling: A Mandate for a Public Inquiry \u2013 Ontario, Canada The Ontario Human Rights Commission (OHRC) was concerned about the issue of racial profiling in Ontario: who engages in it, who is targeted, whether it is a legitimate practice and what can be done to prevent it. Despite some public discussion on the issue, two issues were absent: the real effect on people of racial profiling and the perception that it was occurring. Through a racial profiling inquiry, the OHRC hoped to fill this void by illustrating the human cost of profling. On December 9, 2002, the eve of International Human Rights Day, the Commission announced that it would conduct and inquire into the effects of racial profiling on individuals, families, communities and society as a whole. The Commission emphasized that racial profiling is a human rights issue by stating that it is wrong and contrary to the principles of the Ontario Human Rights Code. What the inquiry did: - Responded to community concerns about the impact of profiling - Looked at the effects of profiling - Measured the human impact of this practice - Considered profiling in a number of contexts including housing, services, education and private security - Took measures to ensure that participants do not reveal names or other information that could identify specific individuals - Respected the privacy of all individuals What the inquiry did NOT do: - Did not investigate individual allegations of racial profiling - Did not focus on one type of profiling or target a particular system in society, e.g. police - Did not focus on numbers or statistics - Did not set out to prove or disprove the existence of profiling; it is not another study - Did not accept anonymous submissions Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 118 Module 5 In the following example, the Australian NHRI launched a national inquiry into women and work. Example: National Inquiry into Pregnancy and Work \u2013 Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission154 In 1998, the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission was requested by the Attorney General to undertake a National Inquiry into pregnancy and workplace discrimination. The Inquiry involved extensive research and consultations with employers, employees, unions, health professionals, employer associations, Government agencies, community groups and students in metropolitan, regional and rural areas. The report entitled Pregnant and Productive: It's a right not a privilege to work while pregnant details the findings of the Inquiry and 46 recommendations. Launched in 1999, the report revealed the existence of widespread and systemic discrimination on the grounds of pregnancy and potential pregnancy in Australian workplaces. Key findings: - Many instances of pregnancy discrimination go unreported - Pregnancy discrimination takes many forms, some blatant, some covert, some detrimental to the health of the mother and the unborn child - A high level of ignorance and misinformation amongst employees and employers - Casual workers are particularly vulnerable (not entitled to benefits) - Women with the potential to become pregnant are denied employment, training and promotional opportunities - Pregnant women suffer harassment and victimization from colleagues - Partners had been denied leave to attend significant medical appointments or even the birth of the child - Employers misuse occupational, health and safety regulations to remove pregnant employees - Women conceal pregnancy because they fear discrimination at work Media and community interest generated by the Inquiry and the launch of the report far exceeded expectations. Analysis of media coverage found radio and television broadcasts in the two days following the report launch reached 4.5 million people (a conservative estimate) across Australia. Coverage in print and online media was also extensive with 21 articles published about the Report in the first 48 hours. There was also extensive follow-up across the Internet plus interest from neighbouring Asian and Pacific countries, the United Kingdom and Scandinavia. Interest from other overseas print and radio media followed.

In its General Comment No. 10, the Committee on ESC rights emphasizes that NHRIs should monitor States Parties\u2019 compliance with their obligations in the protection and promotion of ESC rights.155 Module 5: The Protection Mandate \u2013 Complaints Handling, Investigation and Monitoring Equitas 119 Module 5 What is monitoring? Monitoring means to observe, collect, catalogue, analyze data and report on a situation or event. It can have as its objective: education about human rights, the documentation of human rights abuses, preventative measures or advocacy. An institution should verify that its presentation of events or situations is factually correct. A monitoring report is essentially an account of what has been observed either directly by the institution or as reported by others. Generally, monitoring carried out by an NHRI should be: \ufffd Managed (planned, resourced, controlled and evaluated) \ufffd An ongoing, regular activity \ufffd Cyclical (usually) \ufffd Pro-active, while responding to priorities \ufffd Focused on results Monitoring State performance with regard to the ESC rights of women is strongly linked to the obligation of the progressive realization of ESC rights. The only way to determine progress is to evaluate and analyze progress over time. This underscores the importance of long-term tracking, baseline data, targets and indicators. \"Progressively\u201d means that although the benchmark or target can be reached over time, there has to be measurable progress and effort. The NHRI can examine Government resources to determine whether the Government is devoting the \"maximum of its available resources\u201d to meeting its obligations. (See the section on Gendering National Budgets in the next Module.) When women complain about violations of ESC rights because of the denial of the right to employment, fair working conditions, health services or housing, for example, they rely on NHRIs to provide basic information about the country situation and what efforts have, or have not, been made, to support the achievement of country commitments such as MDGs. NHRIs can also monitor the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action, as well as the implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) (if ratified by the State), relevant MDGs and of course, minimum core obligations.156 When monitoring the full realization of women\u2019s ESC rights, it is useful for NHRIs to consider: \ufffd Recognition of women\u2019s ESC rights both in law and policy as well as the social barriers to recognition of these rights (e.g. attitudes, etc.) \ufffd Intersectional approaches to address the situation of disadvantaged groups of women \ufffd Whether or not women actively claim and exercise their ESC rights. This is an indicator of overall empowerment and levels of information, as well as an indicator of the existence of effective mechanisms for redress for women affected by ESC rights violations Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 120 Module 5 Numerous tools have been developed to measure the extent to which specific ESC rights are being fulfilled. CEDAW and the ICESCR can be used to frame and monitor the implementation of the MDGs, trade agreements and outcome documents of world conferences. Indeed, the CEDAW Committee has made recommendations to some countries regarding the explicit link between monitoring progress on CEDAW and the MDGs. Monitoring women\u2019s ESC rights can be complex for several reasons. First, ESC rights are often general in nature, and so it is important to establish relevant ESC rights standards and content. As noted earlier, MDGs, or country-specific targets can help to provide this content. Investigations should be supported by data on development and well being, which can later be used before the courts if the matter is referred onwards to a judicial decision maker. The second difficulty is that women\u2019s ESC rights complaints often involve patterns of system-wide or systemic discrimination. This is why it is so important for NHRIs to have access to sound research, sex-disaggregated data and multi-disciplinary approaches to fact-finding and research in the context of a longer-term monitoring effort. Lawyers, sociologists and other social scientists work together to determine not only the fact base related to a given complaint, but also the broader context that surrounds a particular fact pattern. Monitoring should include the three dimensions of Government obligations to respect, protect and fulfill its ESC rights obligations. NHRIs work with many officials, donor agencies and NGOs in bringing together this data. As a result, monitoring and assessing the impact of a Government\u2019s policies and plans may necessitate a review and analysis of complex data, such as statistics related to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a1574fc4-07f8-4366-966c-5168e1bd48a8": {"__data__": {"id_": "a1574fc4-07f8-4366-966c-5168e1bd48a8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f0681c592571ddd0fb1136ef6a215098fbdb041e732687b1ab1e0ee14060a9e3"}}, "hash": "f0681c592571ddd0fb1136ef6a215098fbdb041e732687b1ab1e0ee14060a9e3", "text": "mortality or morbidity, levels of education, or numbers of unemployed, whether produced by the Government or by independent institutions and organizations. This in turn will require skills in the area of collection and analysis of primary and secondary data. The following two examples show indicators and tools that can support a NHRI\u2019s monitoring in gender-related areas. Module 5: The Protection Mandate \u2013 Complaints Handling, Investigation and Monitoring Equitas 121 Module 5 Example: Monitoring and UN Gender Indicators and Tools157 In 2001, the Inter-Agency Network on Women and Gender Equality, working with the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, began developing an inventory of activities, by type and actor, in order to make gender indicators available for policy making, looking at indicators from the user\u2019s perspective. Tools include technical guides to produce gender indicators, information on the primary sources of information used in the building of indicators, and principal means of dissemination \u2013 like statistical databases and publications. The information on gender indicators is organized along the main gender issues. Example: Monitoring Health Rights of Women: HeRWAI158 In 2006, a practical manual was developed by Aim for Human Rights entitled The Health Rights of Women Assessment Instrument. HeRWAI assists organizations to analyze what really happens with policies that influence women's health rights. In this way, they get powerful arguments to lobby for concrete actions which improve the situation of women. HeRWAI is based on CEDAW and the ICESCR. Using these and other tools like them, NHRIs can monitor a range of situations, from thematic issues like children\u2019s rights, to judicial decisions and general country monitoring. The following two examples illustrate the range of initiatives that an NHRI can undertake in relation to women\u2019s equality and ESC rights. Example: Monitoring Women\u2019s Detention Centres and Children\u2019s Homes in Sri Lanka159 The Monitoring and Review Division of the NHRI of Sri Lanka carried out several surprise visits to State Women\u2019s Detention Centres and Children\u2019s Homes in 2006. The purpose of these visits was to monitor the conditions in these custodial institutions, and to make recommendations to change policy regarding women\u2019s ESC rights, as well as to raise the awareness of Centre inmates and staff through a series of workshops. Specific women\u2019s rights addressed included the rights to education, health, food and housing. Immediate results from the monitoring activity included an improvement of the quality of food provided to women inmates, the establishment of medical facilities within certain Centres, and the provision of schooling and vocational training for children in Children\u2019s Detention Centres. Effective monitoring on women\u2019s issues can be used to support NHRI work in making recommdendations to the Government. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 122 Module 5 Example: Monitoring Economic and Social Rights in Afghanistan160 Through monitoring, the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission was able to assess the status of women\u2019s ESC and other rights through data that was collected through systematic monitoring of the human rights situation (Human Rights Field Monitoring). The basis of the analysis was information collected on key indicators for economic and social rights, from almost 8,000 interviews conducted between April and December 2005. Using this information, the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission drew preliminary conclusions and made recommendations to the Government and the international community towards improving the protection and realization of economic and social rights in Afghanistan. Among the recommendations was that the Government should prioritize reproductive (pre-natal and post-natal) and child health care, according to their obligations under international treaties to which Afghanistan is a party. What approach should an NHRI use in order to undertake monitoring projects? An innovative multidisciplinary and systematic approach has been developed by the Center for Economic and Social Rights (CESR). While the Center is an NGO, the proposed approach is also appropriate for NHRIs largely because of its focus on statistical data, context and the complex environment of economic and social rights. The following excerpts are especially relevant for women\u2019s rights. Example: A New Approach to Monitoring and Advocating for Economic and Social Rights161 The contribution that social scientists can offer to the human rights movement goes well beyond significantly increasing the ability of the human rights community to use statistical data. The wealth of research \u2026 about education, health, forms of inequality, and other human development issues\u2014 a whole field that most human rights NGOs are largely unaware of\u2014 can significantly enhance the quality of the monitoring capabilities of the human rights movement.

CESR is currently developing this multidisciplinary methodology. These unique monitoring tools are aimed to serve as the backbone for our advocacy work to bring about concrete policy changes to improve social and economic rights in multiple contexts. Using this multidisciplinary approach, CESR will monitor the multiple dimensions of Governments\u2019 obligations pertaining to economic and social rights, focusing on those rights violations that can be identified and critically assessed only through the use of socio-economic tools and quantitative methods. The most obvious cases are those related to the availability of resources. For example, CESR will compare the growth of a state\u2019s available resources (measured by per capita national income) with changes in socio-economic indicators (e.g., percentage of primary school enrolment or percentage of people with access to clean water), which can help identify potential violations related to the lack of progressive realization of economic and social rights according to maximum available resources.

ADR procedures that are relevant to the human rights context include mediation, conciliation, and traditional or customary community-based forums to resolve human rights issues and related conflicts. ADR strategies can play an important role in resolving complaints and developing systemic approaches to resolving broader institutional issues. Experience in other jurisdictions suggests the following lessons: \ufffd Unless the enabling law provides otherwise, ADR should be voluntary on the part of all parties \ufffd Voluntary ADR has a higher success rate than mandatory processes \ufffd ADR is most successful when they occur at or near the beginning of a complaint process. Shortly after a complaint is filed, for example, parties are offered a structured process to resolve their dispute in appropriate cases \ufffd In cases involving abuse of power, major policy issues, sexual harassment or assault, ADR is generally not considered appropriate On the other hand, cases of discrimination are frequently good candidates for some kind of ADR process. Even here, though, several basic considerations are especially relevant where women\u2019s equality rights are at play. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 124 Module 5 Power imbalances must be identified early and managed by the officer. For example, if a corporate respondent wishes to appear at a mediation session with several lawyers, whereas the complainant is not represented, it is appropriate to prevent lawyers from attending at least the early meetings. Shuttle mediation (going back and forth between the parties without requiring them to meet) is a useful technique to minimize trauma, and to ensure that confidentiality is maintained, especially where there is a potential for reprisal. Mediation is a structured attempt by the NHRI to help parties resolve a conflict, usually before the investigation is undertaken. The officer, or mediator, acts as a facilitator, not a decision-maker, helping the parties to tell their stories, identify their interests, and if possible, settle the matter. Mediators in the human rights context generally use an approach that takes into account not only the parties\u2019 interests (what they want out of the settlement) but also the parties\u2019 rights. Early mediation in NHRIs is successful when it is voluntary (both parties have chosen the process) because parties are apparently more open to negotiation and not enough time has gone by for their positions to become entrenched.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fbf52691-00fa-488a-bc11-6f61565e8fb2": {"__data__": {"id_": "fbf52691-00fa-488a-bc11-6f61565e8fb2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "31a2d2f451a495a67503154f682868c05fe640238adbf1c6aa7a73ea57ef6e9b"}, "2": {"node_id": "ef58fd49-0832-4606-8c39-123bb806cac2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a41ee04f22440b4dc2ddd2609d361df786808162aef61a60deab990c855d0379"}}, "hash": "568657175718f5ec1b3fcf4046c614f72ad6510a236a380da85f4e5a30c174cf", "text": "Conciliation tends to take place at the end of the investigation process, after findings are made.

Because women are not always comfortable acting as formal complainants, especially in cultures where the nature of a complaint may raise cultural issues, ADR offers a particularly interesting range of options to women seeking to address their concerns in a relatively non-confrontational way. In rural and traditional settings, a variation of ADR is a community-based process where NHRIs tap into traditional customary ways of solving conflicts in the community as a strategy for resolving human rights complaints. Finally, since not all violations of women\u2019s ESC rights are recognized by law, using ADR can bring an initial level of redress for women who might not otherwise have any avenue to pursue. Conclusion The investigation of women\u2019s human rights issues and strategies to handle complaints on ESC rights raise special considerations for NHRIs. Early intervention strategies, such as counselling, can defuse complaints or simply provide an avenue for outreach, support and general information. These may be useful in cultural contexts where women are less likely to file formal complaints, or where there is stigma attached to a human rights violation. Module 5: The Protection Mandate \u2013 Complaints Handling, Investigation and Monitoring Equitas 125 Module 5 Because NHRIs have scarce resources and because of the systemic nature of many women\u2019s equality rights violations, NHRIs should emphasize cases that have an impact on as many women as possible, or that represent serious human rights violations. Several techniques, such as pooling or grouping cases, are available to capture and collect data and information, which in turn permit the identification of widespread and systemic ESC rights violations. When interviewing women complainants and witnesses during investigations, NHRIs have a responsibility to protect women and to ensure their safety, without fear of reprisal. Information about NHRI processes, interview techniques and other relevant strategies are usually included in operations manuals. Public inquiries are good ways to bring systemic issues to the attention of the public at large. They offer minimal risks to women who would otherwise be complainants, since the NHRI is bringing forward the issue itself. The very fact that an NHRI decides to publicize an issue and conduct a broad investigation will provide a public and significant boost to an issue at hand. Most NHRIs use monitoring to measure progress over time; this requires information about a situation at a given point in time (the \u201cbaseline\u201d) and the identification of certain factors (indicators) which will demonstrate whether there have been positive changes. Monitoring also involves setting goals (benchmarks) to work towards. The approach may be used to track change relative to all categories of rights, but it is particularly useful in tracking achievements relating to ESC rights. This is because many of these rights are meant to be realized progressively. Alternative dispute resolution strategies can play a major role in resolving complaints and developing systemic approaches to resolving broader institutional issues. Again, because of cultural or social issues regarding women in a complainant role, less confrontational strategies such as mediation, or using community-based resolution, can offer effective solutions to human rights issues. 127 Module 6 The Promotion Mandate \u2013 Advice, Advocacy and Education 6 Photo courtesy Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Hareau Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 128 Module 6 Overview of Module 6 National human rights institutions (NHRIs) have the mandate to promote human rights in order to conform to the requirements of the Paris Principles. Almost all NHRIs have promotion in their mandates, carrying out a range of activities, from developing and disseminating publications, to running training and education sessions, to public awareness campaigns. These activities, while important, miss a central aspect of the promotional role for NHRIs when it comes to women\u2019s issues, namely that NHRIs must take a proactive leadership role in engaging social actors and the public in promoting women\u2019s rights and women\u2019s economic, social and cultural (ESC) rights in particular. Given how deeply embedded inequality is in legal, social, political and business cultures, supporting broad culture change for human rights is probably one of the most important, yet complex, aspects of an NHRI mandate. NHRIs must speak out about issues that no one else may be talking about on the public stage. Just as widespread efforts engaging all sectors are a necessary foundation for effective enforcement initiatives on the protection side of the mandate, multiple actors and sectors must engage in the promotion work for women\u2019s ESC rights in order to effect change on the needed scale.

The role of the NHRI in developing national actions plans and gender- focused plans is also discussed. \ufffd Section 2 \u2013 Human Rights Education, briefly examines how NHRIs can use human rights education to address women\u2019s ESC rights. Human rights education is defined by the World Programme of Action for Human Rights Education as \u201ceducation, training and public information efforts aimed at building a universal culture of human rights.\u201d Educational activities in both the informal and formal sectors should target discrimination and harassment. These include public awareness campaigns on key areas related to women\u2019s ESC rights, and on country targets and priorities, notably those that are in relation to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Module 6: The Promotion Mandate \u2013 Advice, Advocacy and Education Equitas 129 Module 6 Section 1 Advice and Assistance to Government Governments have broad responsibilities in the area of ESC rights. They generally control school curricula, provide health services and social infrastructure, and are by far the largest national employers and providers of services. They control policing, security and the armed forces. It is not surprising that in cases involving challenges to these social programs, Governments are not only valuable partners, but also very often respondents in human rights complaints. This is why the importance of providing advice and assistance to Government cannot be overstated. Once a State signs on to ESC-related treaties, it is required to guarantee women\u2019s ESC rights by ensuring the enactment of domestic laws, such as national constitutions and human rights laws. States are also obliged to regulate the conduct of third parties, such as employers, landlords, and service providers and to design and implement policies and programs to give long-term and full effect to women\u2019s ESC rights. This can include special measures and temporary special measures to accelerate women\u2019s equal enjoyment of their rights, conducting gender audits, and examining gender-specific allocation of State resources.162 In the following sections, these different dimensions of advice and assistance will be reviewed, starting with the \u201cgovernance dimension\u201d, namely advice on laws, policies and programs. A. Advice on Laws, Policies and Programs Under the Paris Principles, NHRIs should \u201csubmit to the Government, parliament and any other competent body, on an advisory basis, opinions, recommendations, proposals and reports on any matters concerning the protection and promotion of human rights.\u201d163 It may do so either at the request of the authorities concerned or through the exercise of its power to hear a matter without higher referral. Although the advisory mandates of NHRIs differ from institution to institution, many NHRIs choose all or some of the following activities: \ufffd Encouraging ratification of international human rights instruments on women\u2019s ESC rights \ufffd Assisting in the development of new legislation, if requested or on its own initiative, in matters relating to women\u2019s ESC rights \ufffd Promoting amendments to existing national laws to harmonize them with international standards \ufffd Submitting recommendations, proposals and reports on policies, programs and administrative practices relating to women\u2019s ESC rights, either to the head of State or directly to the attention of the relevant Government ministry, department or official Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 130 Module 6 Providing Legal and Policy Advice Unless the enabling law specifies otherwise, NHRIs have a wide number of avenues open in terms of providing legal and policy advice. NHRIs can provide advice to Parliament itself, and to parliamentary committees, the executive, and cabinet, the office of the prime minister or president, or individual ministers on women\u2019s ESC issues. Advice to Parliament and to parliamentary committees has been identified as especially important for NHRIs, since it ensures that top-level elected officials are made aware of the issues being raised. This represents an important source of alternative pressure on the Government itself. The choice of the recipient of the advice should be based on potential impact. Is there a statutory direction in the NHRI enabling law regarding who should get advice? Which authority or combination of authorities is best placed and most likely to act on that advice? Where is the debate happening, and at which level of Government?

Even if there is a domestic law in place, NHRIs should also pay attention to other types of instruments of governance, such as guidelines, regulations, policies and administrative practices, since these often have as much \u2013 if not more \u2013 impact on the actual practice of human rights than the formal legal framework. Very few major social policies are delivered through laws alone. As a general rule, Governments use \u201cpolicy instrument mixes\u201d that include not only laws but also administrative arrangements, guidelines and rules, public education policies and programs to effect governance objectives. NHRIs must therefore pay attention to this broader policy \u201cmix\u201d in order to affect any kind of meaningful change.164 Therefore, in addition to reviewing legislation, NHRIs should provide general policy advice to Government and comment on existing or proposed administrative arrangements, including those regarding women\u2019s ESC rights issues. In the case of existing arrangements, the NHRI may be aware of difficulties in implementation as a result of their program work, for example, in investigation or monitoring, or through women\u2019s groups. Whatever the source of the concern, such opinions should generally be provided first to the Government so that they have the opportunity to respond, and then can be conveyed to the public through press conferences or dissemination of press releases, or the publication and submission of reports. There may be cases where direct media contact is more appropriate, but in the area of ESC rights with its resource implications, States should generally be given reasonable time to review NHRI concerns and address them. A national institution can also advise the Government of other measures which could or should be undertaken in order to fulfill State obligations to ensure full realization of women\u2019s ESC rights. Such measures may include: \ufffd Implementation of affirmative action programs or temporary special measures \ufffd Development and implementation of public education initiatives \ufffd Establishment of departmental focal point or programs to advance women\u2019s issues Module 6: The Promotion Mandate \u2013 Advice, Advocacy and Education Equitas 131 Module 6 \ufffd Inclusion of women\u2019s ESC rights issues within policy initiatives or plans In other parts of this Handbook, we have identified the work of the Asia Pacific Forum and its NHRI \u201cfocal points\u201d on human trafficking. The New Zealand Human Rights Commission\u2019s engagement in this area provides an excellent example of the type of promotional work that can lead to substantial change, including legal and policy change. Example: Trafficking in Persons: New Zealand\u2019s Focal Point on Women165 The New Zealand Human Rights Commission has been working to combat trafficking in persons through the following activities: - Regularly consulting with different Government agencies and community groups on trafficking and trafficking-related issues - Awareness raising among the public, health professionals and police - Advocacy and policy-making initiatives One particular problem was the trafficking in women from Thailand, which was facilitated by the visa-free status between Thailand and New Zealand. As a result of the Commission\u2019s efforts, the Minister of Immigration suspended the visa-free status between New Zealand and Thailand, in part because of the abuse of the system by traffickers and those working illegally in New Zealand. B. Gendering National Budgets166 NHRIs should advocate for the identification and resourcing of activities that advance women and gender equality in national budgets. NHRIs can raise awareness about prioritizing critical women\u2019s ESC rights issues in the context of national budgets and public expenditure, based on the principles set out in the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), among others. CEDAW makes no specific reference to public expenditure or revenues, but it does impose a general obligation on States Parties to take \u201call appropriate measures\u201d, \u201cto take steps \u2026 to the maximum of available resources\u201d to eliminate discrimination against women, ensure the enjoyment of ESC rights, and to ensure \u201cthe full development and advancement of women\u201d (Articles 2, 3). Similar provisions exist in the ICESCR. As well, Article 3 of CEDAW imposes a requirement to ensure gender equality in relation to all human rights, including in their economic dimensions; and should be read in the light of the guidance on the requirements of international human rights law regarding resource allocation that has been provided by the ICESCR.

Example: Funding of the Commission on Human Rights (Mexico) \u2013 Concluding Comments of the CEDAW Committee168 The Committee recommends that the State Party ensure that the National Commission on Human Rights is provided with the necessary financial resources and personnel well trained in gender equality issues to effectively fulfill its function in regard to monitoring and evaluating the General Act on Equality between Women and Men. If a State fails to allocate appropriate resources to women\u2019s ESC rights, it will be unable to comply with its obligations. Because of the obligation on States Parties to \u201cachieve progressively the full realization of the rights recognized,\u201d States cannot wait indefinitely to take steps to ensure women are enjoying their ESC rights. Because States are required to use the maximum available resources to work towards achieving ESC rights, NHRIs can advocate for existing resources to be allocated efficiently and effectively with a view towards the achievement of women\u2019s ESC rights, without negatively affecting other human rights and the rights of other discriminated groups. Montreal Principle No. 18 also reiterates that States should ensure that resources are distributed in a manner that provides substantively equal enjoyment of ESC rights by women. This requires a two-fold analysis of Government budget allocations: \ufffd An overall assessment of the budget to ascertain whether maximum available resources have been spent in economic, social and cultural areas of relevance to women \ufffd Within particular economic, social and cultural budgetary \u2018envelopes\u2019 such as health, housing, education, income assistance, and employment, an assessment must be made as to whether budgetary allocations reflect the maximum available resources and whether those allocations have been made in a way that addresses the needs of women Several examples of recommendations and observations relating to gender, budgets and ESC rights offered by UN Treaty bodies are set out here, and are drawn from Diane Elson\u2019s very helpful work on this topic:169 \ufffd CEDAW Committee: General Recommendation No. 24 (20th session, 1999) 30. States parties should allocate adequate budgetary, human and administrative resources to ensure that women's health receives a share of the overall health budget comparable with that for men's health, taking into account their different health needs. \ufffd CEDAW Committee: Concluding Observations (Luxembourg, 2000) The Committee \u201cwelcome[s] the [Women\u2019s] Ministry's interest in, and support for, proposals to Module 6: The Promotion Mandate \u2013 Advice, Advocacy and Education Equitas 133 Module 6 conduct a gender analysis of the entire State budget. This will contribute to a better understanding of the way in which women and men benefit from governmental expenditures in all areas.\u201d \ufffd CEDAW Committee: Concluding Observations (Fiji, 2002) In 2002, when reviewing Fiji\u2019s report, the Committee \u201ccommend[ed] the efforts of the State party to strengthen gender mainstreaming and monitoring through the gender budget initiative, and a gender audit project.\u201d \ufffd CEDAW Committee: Concluding Observations (Austria, 2002) The Committee has, on at least one occasion, asked a State to conduct a gender analysis of its budget and to report on the results. In its concluding comments concerning Austria in 2000, the Committee \u201crequest[ed] the Government to ensure, on a regular basis, the evaluation and assessment of the gender impact of the federal budget as well as governmental policies and programs affecting women.\u201d It is, of course, impossible for NHRIs to impose budget allocations on the State. However, in light of the above examples, an NHRI can monitor progress and make recommendations to create budgets for specific women\u2019s programs, and can ensure that there is no retrogression or roll-back on previous commitments or budget cuts to established programs. As well, since it is not possible to sum up the total comparative impact of a budget in a single indicator, or even to focus on expenditures in order to assess the achievement of substantive equality, a step-by-step approach is suggested, in which a full range of dimensions of the budget are examined separately. The key dimensions are: 1. Public expenditure, NHRIs can monitor: \ufffd The extent to which priority is given to gender equality in public expenditures \ufffd The presence of discrimination against women and girls in public expenditures \ufffd The extent to which public expenditure is adequate for the realization of gender equality \ufffd Reform efforts to achieving gender equality through budgeting 2.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "922600ce-7754-44d0-90d9-96a53abadc91": {"__data__": {"id_": "922600ce-7754-44d0-90d9-96a53abadc91", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "09441c407de619e995d02c954693f01c746bd2eec63c3b990ebaa3e827a5fbd1"}, "2": {"node_id": "507d165a-abb6-4eef-b07f-209701f8b4d1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dad6deb1aee3df68c4e5b1174d66f45c656d1f07f1dabecb87dbed439bb951b1"}}, "hash": "a5c581f84ac90523958c83a61e450daeae05051636df8f5ba548dafd1640ff5d", "text": "Public revenue, especially taxation: \ufffd For example, CEDAW implies that women should be equally free to choose how to live", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "70fbb248-c2ee-4bd7-a809-56d6c93a61df": {"__data__": {"id_": "70fbb248-c2ee-4bd7-a809-56d6c93a61df", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9a6756efbe92df4601cebd7bf9116a2b5d92d8d44ff6b4b33703547c8019acee"}, "3": {"node_id": "d6eb5245-dc04-4e18-89a0-55e10c0896e3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "21f9bd91e5fc7160142c0f8d082b7ff6c56360fa1600ca12e3d434c9ad772a6e"}}, "hash": "64cc1ab4ad81f7dbc582e39d249e03d5fafbe2e4c2cea92aa2b18bdfbb2fa871", "text": "their lives; and the tax system should not favour one set of choices above another \ufffd The income tax system should be neutral regarding different types of families, taking into account the value of unpaid as well as paid work, and irrespective of the marital status and sex of the partners 3.

Advocacy for International Standards Activities NHRIs can undertake in this regard are outlined below. Advocating for the Ratification of International Instruments As a first step, it is useful for NHRIs to \u201cmap\u201d or \u201caudit\u201d the international instruments that need to be ratified by a country, including the recently approved Optional Protocol to the ICESCR, and to advocate for their ratification. As part of this same process, NHRIs should advocate for the removal of reservations, if any. Second, NHRIs can support non-governmental organization (NGO) campaigns for the ratification of these treaties, or removal of reservations, and use these opportunities to develop their own capacity, to cooperate with NGOs, and to raise awareness on women\u2019s ESC rights. Module 6: The Promotion Mandate \u2013 Advice, Advocacy and Education Equitas 135 Module 6 Third, NHRIs should encourage their Governments to nominate ESC and equality experts to international human rights Treaty bodies. Fourth, NHRIs should publish reports, either through special reporting mechanisms or in annual reports, on the importance of ratification of relevant instruments, drawing particular attention to the human rights situation affecting women in the country. Linked to this work is the ratification, in particular, of the Optional Protocol to CEDAW (OP-CEDAW). NHRIs can lead national initiatives for its ratification, which is an important step for greater protection of women\u2019s rights and for their incorporation into national laws and practice. Advocating for the Removal of Reservations to International Instruments Removing reservations to international conventions takes on special significance for CEDAW. Many States have ratified CEDAW, but an exceptionally large number have expressed reservations, most problematically in relation to Article 2 of CEDAW which sets out the basic principle of non-discrimination. These reservations open the door to the serious criticism that the reserving States have ratified the convention while seeking to escape from its most basic tenets, circumventing meaningful compliance with the convention. While there are many reasons expressed for the reservations, the most problematic ones are expressed for religious reasons. Other nations make objections to such reservations. The following example is a typical objection, expressed in the context of Denmark\u2019s objection to the reservations of Saudi Arabia in relation to CEDAW. The reservation was in relation to the fact that Saudi Arabia would not recognize a right in CEDAW that is incompatible with Sharia law. Denmark objected because, as it points out, the general reservation is essentially incompatible with women\u2019s rights.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d6eb5245-dc04-4e18-89a0-55e10c0896e3": {"__data__": {"id_": "d6eb5245-dc04-4e18-89a0-55e10c0896e3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9a6756efbe92df4601cebd7bf9116a2b5d92d8d44ff6b4b33703547c8019acee"}, "2": {"node_id": "70fbb248-c2ee-4bd7-a809-56d6c93a61df", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "64cc1ab4ad81f7dbc582e39d249e03d5fafbe2e4c2cea92aa2b18bdfbb2fa871"}}, "hash": "21f9bd91e5fc7160142c0f8d082b7ff6c56360fa1600ca12e3d434c9ad772a6e", "text": "Example: Denmark\u2019s Objection to the Reservations of Saudi Arabia in Relation to CEDAW170 10 August 2001 With regard to the reservations made by Saudi Arabia upon ratification: The Government of Denmark has examined the reservations made by the Government of Saudi Arabia upon ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women as to any interpretation of the provisions of the Convention that is incompatible with the norms of Islamic law.

Consequently, the Government of Denmark considers the said reservations as being incompatible with the object and purpose of the Convention and accordingly inadmissible and without effect under international law. The Government of Denmark furthermore notes that the reservation to paragraph 2 of Article 9 of the Convention aims to exclude one obligation of non-discrimination which is the aim of the Convention and therefore renders this reservation contrary to the essence of the Convention. continued Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 136 Module 6 Denmark example continued The Government of Denmark therefore objects to the aforesaid reservations made by the Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to the Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. These objections shall not preclude the entry into force of the Convention in its entirety between Saudi Arabia and Denmark. The Government of Denmark recommends the Government of Saudi Arabia to reconsider its reservations to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. NHRIs should advocate for the removal of reservations to conventions that are relevant to women\u2019s ESC rights, notably under CEDAW, and may even encourage their own countries to file objections against other nations that have made fundamental reservations to CEDAW. The second serious source of reservations is the reluctance of States to allow CEDAW to interfere in \u201cpersonal matters\u201d of its citizens. Given the fact that many areas of women\u2019s rights depend on and reside in the \u201cpersonal sphere\u201d this is a major issue of concern and should be addressed as a priority by NHRIs working in countries that have expressed reservations. For further resources: NHRIs in the Asia Pacific Region should be aware of the APF Advisory Council of Jurists (ACJ) and its role of providing advice on international law to APF Members. The ACJ has made a number of substantive recommendations to institutions in relation to women, ESC rights, particularly on ACJ references in relation to trafficking, human rights education, torture and the environment. All reports and recommendations can be found at: http://www.asiapacificforum.net/acj/references. More generally the site of the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) provides a great deal of information on its web site: http://www.ohchr.org Advocating for Implementation of International Standards After ratification or accession to a treaty, an NHRI has two primary objectives. These are to ensure that: \ufffd National laws are enacted, as needed, to give effect to the treaty \ufffd Existing laws that are incompatible with the new international obligations are amended accordingly Activities related to these objectives include: \ufffd Informing the Government as to the precise nature of the obligations under the ICESCR, CEDAW, OP-CEDAW, the CRC and other applicable instruments that encompass women\u2019s ESC rights Module 6: The Promotion Mandate \u2013 Advice, Advocacy and Education Equitas 137 Module 6 \ufffd Providing advice on laws that should be enacted (that is, is a national law needed to give effect to the ratified treaty? Or does it apply automatically?) (See Module 3, Section 3 \u201cBringing Human Rights Home\u201d). \ufffd Disseminating applicable General Comments in order to ensure that they are considered in the development and implementation of national law and policy NHRIs can lead initiatives to map out the existing remedies for human rights abuses at the national level, as part of the country\u2019s preparation for implementing OP-CEDAW. The reason is simple: domestic remedies need to be exhausted before proceeding under OP-CEDAW. NHRIs need to know what exists domestically before communications can be brought forward at the international level, and of course Governments need to know as well. This is why research, data and knowledge management generally are so important for NHRIs. Once the data is available on, for example, the country\u2019s status with respect to MDG\u2019s affecting women, it becomes easier to conduct the \u201crights gap\u201d analysis in relation to particular laws or social programs and to recommend changes in the wake of the ratification of new instruments. NHRIs, because of their expertise in human rights, may be able to identify issues which may have escaped the attention of legislatures or other Government bodies, and recommend changes and amendments to policies, approaches and laws.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"},

following example from Malaysia shows the role that an NHRI can play in initiating a broad debate on the effective implementation of CEDAW and related standards, including the development of appropriate legislation, policies and programs to support the rights of women. Example: SUHAKAM\u2019s Role in Promoting CEDAW \u2013 Malaysia171 In 2004, the National Human Rights Commission of Malaysia (SUHAKAM) organized two Forums on CEDAW following ratification. The Forums began with a general overview of CEDAW. This was followed by presentations by Government representatives on steps taken by the Government to implement CEDAW at the State level, and by NGO representatives on their perspective on CEDAW. Participants at the Forums discussed: - Pertinent developments on women\u2019s human rights - The Sarawak Women\u2019s Development Action Plan 2003 which aimed to promote and protect gender equality in Sarawak, and concentrated on seven key areas - family, health, religion, culture and art, sports, education and training, the economy and employment and women and the law continued Module 6: The Promotion Mandate \u2013 Advice, Advocacy and Education Equitas 139 Module 6 SUHAKAM example continued - Functions of relevant State agencies and departments, including the Department of Women\u2019s Affairs, and its seven committees - The work of leading local women\u2019s rights NGOs The Forums drew out areas of common concern that still needed to be addressed in order that women\u2019s rights (including their ESC rights) were fully realized. These included: - Lack of awareness on CEDAW and women\u2019s rights - Scepticism on the usefulness of CEDAW - Low participation of women at the decision-making level and at senior positions - Lack of institutional support for victims of domestic violence - Stereotyping the role of men and women - Lack of a comprehensive system to collate and maintain gender-disaggregated data at the State level - Issues with regard to marriage and its dissolution under native customary law, aboriginal custom and Sharia law - Poor implementation of the low cost housing and micro credit schemes for women, in particular single mothers - Poor implementation of laws such as the Domestic Violence Act 1994 and the Child Act 2001 - Laws that discriminate against women, for example laws against trafficking and prostitution, provisions of the Immigration Act 1959/63 and Immigration Regulations - Lack of shelters for survivors of rape and domestic violence - Insufficient schools, hostels and teachers in rural areas - Sexual harassment Based on the above, SUHAKAM made several general recommendations aimed at improving the state of women\u2019s human rights throughout Malaysia, including: - Establishing adequate, well-funded and safe shelter homes for victims of domestic violence in Sabah and Sarawak - Establishing a network linking State Government agencies and NGOs in Sabah and Sarawak to facilitate cooperation and strengthen existing work relations - Establishing a comprehensive system for collation of gender-disaggregated data at the State level and to ensure that this data is accessible to the general public - Increasing programs aimed at promoting awareness of women\u2019s rights and of CEDAW - Reviewing the laws and policies, such as native customary law or aboriginal custom, to ensure that they protect the rights of women. This may require the establishment of Native Courts, Special Family Courts and a Legal Aid system - Establishing laws, policies and action plans that ensure a working environment that accommodates working parents, including providing affordable and accessible child- care centres, and introducing the concepts of a home office, parental leave in addition to maternity leave, as well as active promotion", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "085237cf-960b-46bb-be52-20582ac454df": {"__data__": {"id_": "085237cf-960b-46bb-be52-20582ac454df", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dd2e634653ca794930da5ca9cfde20e982d40cbefa45bcc8a9f9d5f14f1154c2"}}, "hash": "dd2e634653ca794930da5ca9cfde20e982d40cbefa45bcc8a9f9d5f14f1154c2", "text": "of family-friendly benefits and entitlements. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 140 Module 6 Maximizing Effectiveness of NHRI Advocacy Efforts Aimed at Implementation of International Standards Proposals for legislative reform usually start in a line Ministry and by the time the policy work reaches the Ministry of Justice or Attorney General which usually has the responsibility to prepare the draft law, all the hard thinking as to the content of the legislation is already completed. Entering into discussions at this late stage may be too late as positions may have become fixed. Therefore, the sooner NHRIs get involved, the easier it is to influence positive outcomes. NHRIs should develop and maintain regular and substantive contact, at the staff level, with those who are responsible for preparing initial drafts of legislation, regulations, policy and procedures, as well as with more influential officials. Establishing these working relationships helps ensure that the national institution is aware of planned initiatives early in their life cycle and is positioned to influence change. NHRIs must be aware and take advantage of opportunities as they present themselves. A Parliamentary Committee may examine draft legislation, and may require input or consultation. Institutions should seek to put their views of proposed legislation on the record at this stage and, where necessary, use publicity and lobbying to influence positive change. Engagement of NHRIs at the International Level NHRIs can contribute to the progressive interpretation and expansion of standards on women\u2019s ESC rights at the international level by bringing local human rights expertise and experiences to the global discussions. Specifically, NHRIs can: \ufffd Advocate for and contribute to the development and adoption of general comments, general recommendations and other guidelines on women\u2019s ESC rights 172 \ufffd Join the global campaigns on women\u2019s ESC rights \ufffd Attend international conferences and use these venues to raise awareness on women\u2019s ESC rights issues NHRIs can also submit reports to the expert committees and accredited NHRI can speak in UN fora. D. Proactive Use of General Comments and Recommendations Core human rights conventions have Treaty bodies or Committees that will provide both General Comments and, in the country context, General Recommendations with respect to the state of realization of rights. Besides holding States accountable to their obligations, Committees are also responsible for developing legal interpretations of the terms contained in their conventions. Module 6: The Promotion Mandate \u2013 Advice, Advocacy and Education Equitas 141 Module 6 Individual States Parties to UN Treaty bodies are scrutinized through a constructive dialogue between Government officials and each Committee. As a result of this process, concluding observations and recommendations are issued by the applicable Committee aimed at acknowledging progress while identifying areas of concern and recommendations on the rights contained in the conventions. Concluding comments are aimed at assisting Governments to develop policies, laws and programs that are more conducive to substantive equality, human development, peace and other human rights goals. General Comments and General Recommendations clarify and elaborate on the content of the rights and obligations contained in the international covenants. They can assist NHRIs in their advocacy and in identifying areas of programming to protect and promote women\u2019s ESC rights in a variety of ways to reach different ends. For example, General Comments and General Recommendations can be used to provide guidance when NHRIs: \ufffd Measure progress of Government compliance vis-\u00e0-vis a particular State obligation under the Treaty. (This will be useful when NHRIs participate in the reporting process to the UN Treaty bodies.) \ufffd Develop content for a public awareness or training program \ufffd Use the material as supporting evidence in human rights complaints \ufffd Launch a public inquiry on an identified issue of State compliance \ufffd Support the Government in the development of gender focal points across Government which will provide systemic support for the progress of women\u2019s economic, cultural and social rights. \ufffd Determine what areas to monitor. i.e., choosing to monitor a Committee finding for purposes of measuring progress against a noted area of concern E. Assistance in Preparing National Plans In the 1993 Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the World Conference on Human Rights recommended that each State consider drawing up a national action plan for States to improve the promotion and protection of human rights.173 The Beijing Platform of Action also calls on all Governments to establish a national action plan on gender equality.174 In developing national action plans, States set their human rights priorities and identify appropriate mechanisms through which the plan will be implemented and monitored.

Although the plans are State responsibilities, NHRIs can make a significant contribution to their development, adoption, implementation and monitoring. In particular, NHRIs can ensure that the plan takes women\u2019s ESC rights into account. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 142 Module 6 NHRIs are sometimes called upon to take a lead role in coordinating the implementation of the plan. Where this happens, it should be clearly recognized that commitments in the plan impose obligations on Governments to take appropriate action. Responsibility for ensuring achievement of the plan\u2019s objectives cannot be transferred to others. It should also be clear that the NHRI must have the resources to carry out this lead coordination role without sacrificing other statutory responsibilities. NHRIs should participate in national coordinating committees and in wider consultative activities related to national action plans. NHRIs can facilitate and coordinate dialogue between the Government, relevant NGOs, and other civil society organizations. Participation and consultation will ensure transparency and broad support by bringing in a variety of insights and perspectives. Broad participation will also support effective implementation. In some instances, the work of a national institution can be powerful enough to inspire the development of a national human rights plan by a State, as was the case in New Zealand in 2005.175 Where national plans have been developed in countries that have NHRIs, these institutions have usually been closely involved in the planning process. In South Africa, for example, the impetus for drafting a plan came from the human rights commission in that country. Indonesia also followed a similar pattern. A national human rights action plan should reflect internationally agreed to guidelines and should be in line with international best practice. According to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in its Handbook on National Human Rights Plans of Action, a national action plan should:176 \ufffd Review a country\u2019s human rights needs \ufffd Fully address the importance of ESC rights and the indivisibility of human rights \ufffd Raise awareness of human rights issues among Government officials, security authorities, civil society organizations and the general public \ufffd Mobilize a broad spectrum of society in a cooperative atmosphere \ufffd Propose realistic activities \ufffd Set achievable targets \ufffd Promote linkages with other national programs, particularly in the areas of development and education \ufffd Generate commitment to action \ufffd Allocate responsibility for the implementation of each activity to an appropriate authority to ensure accountability for implementation \ufffd Include provisions for monitoring implementation and for evaluation at the conclusion of the period of the plan. NHRIs can ensure commitments to take legislative and administrative measures to entrench the recognition and observance of ESC rights, the elimination of discrimination, and a commitment to effective means of redress for violations of such rights as part of the plans. A strong gender perspective in the plan also ensures Module 6: The Promotion Mandate \u2013 Advice, Advocacy and Education Equitas 143 Module 6 that such plans are informed by and consistent with a comprehensive strategy for achieving equality. Key elements of national human rights action plans for protecting and promoting women\u2019s ESC rights include: \ufffd Commitment to take legislative and administrative measures to entrench the recognition and observance of women\u2019s ESC rights \ufffd Commitment to effective means of redress for violations of women\u2019s ESC rights \ufffd Benchmarks (from applicable platforms of action and Principles) for the realization of ESC rights in line with the country\u2019s human rights obligations, and specific programs to achieve related targets in areas such as the rights to: \ufffd an adequate standard of living, including nutrition and housing \ufffd health \ufffd education \ufffd social security \ufffd take part in cultural life \ufffd work \ufffd just and favourable conditions of work \ufffd form and join trade unions \ufffd Commitment to equity and non-discrimination in social policy, including adequate health, education and social security systems \ufffd Mechanisms to monitor regularly the observance or non-observance of women\u2019s ESC rights \ufffd Public inquiries into systemic problems in the areas of women\u2019s ESC rights \ufffd Programs of awareness of women\u2019s ESC rights both for relevant officials and workers and for the general public \ufffd Promotion of research and debate on women\u2019s ESC rights \ufffd Adaptation of the constitution and national laws to reflect CEDAW and the ICESCR and adoption of legal mechanisms and guarantees to ensure enforcement \ufffd Commitment of resources and political will to put in place policies and programs that deliver basic services in areas such as health, education, housing and social welfare, particularly", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "66371247-64ab-47a5-ab8d-27e152861445": {"__data__": {"id_": "66371247-64ab-47a5-ab8d-27e152861445", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cf9399cbadfc0de9cd7695b488e22bb57bf65dc6ea7b2a932fbef0ebbea5ab7d"}}, "hash": "cf9399cbadfc0de9cd7695b488e22bb57bf65dc6ea7b2a932fbef0ebbea5ab7d", "text": "to vulnerable groups, including women \ufffd Establishment of a Committee or other monitoring mechanism to monitor implementation \ufffd If not yet ratified, a commitment to ratify the ICESCR and CEDAW and the OP-CEDAW, as well as plan for the implementation of their provisions domestically Plans should also focus on promoting legislation, redress, monitoring and greater awareness and understanding of women\u2019s ESC rights. Awareness-raising programs Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 144 Module 6 should aim at alerting officials, parliamentarians, community workers, academics, the media and the general public to the fact that action in these areas is part of the effort to improve observance of women\u2019s ESC rights. In addition, it is critical that Plans provide a timetable for implementation, with allocation of responsibility for each activity and provisions for monitoring implementation and evaluation. Key outcomes of a national human rights plan include: \ufffd Increased awareness of ESC rights, e.g. rights to health, housing and education and the right to development \ufffd Establishing rights-based approaches to these issues, centring on the needs of people rather than the institutions, service delivery and the bureaucracy \ufffd Developing benchmarks which can later be used to track progress in other contexts, for example reporting under the ICESCR and CEDAW, or more generally for well-being and other social indices The following examples offer highlights of national action plans from several countries, with a focus on aspects dealing with women\u2019s ESC rights. Example: NHRI Assumes Lead Role in National Human Rights Action Plan \u2013 The Philippines177 The Philippines Commission on Human Rights had the central role in coordinating the Philippines Human Rights Plan 1996 \u2013 2002. A task force comprising representatives of the Government and NGOs was established to prepare the plan, with a structured process of consultation and review across the country. The task force established a special committee to review financing requirements for proposed activities under the plan and to identify sources of funds. The plan contained measures for legislative, administrative and other actions to address the issues affecting the human rights of the vulnerable groups which the task force identified. In regard to women, the plan noted the following priority human rights issues: - Discriminatory legislation - Violence against women - Failure to recognize women\u2019s rights, for instance in relation to health, reproductive rights, stereotyping, sexism and limited educational and employment opportunities Legislative measures included: - Amendment of legislation that was not responsive to the needs of women victims of violence - Redefinition of concepts of trafficking in persons, rape and domestic violence - Legislation to eliminate discrimination continued Module 6: The Promotion Mandate \u2013 Advice, Advocacy and Education Equitas 145 Module 6 Philippines example continued Administrative measures included: - Encouraging measures to promote the participation of women in politics and governance - Organization of support groups and projects to assist women victims of violence - Action on sexual harassment - Arrangements to protect migrant workers - Incorporation of a gender perspective at all levels of education and in the health system Example: National Action Plan on Gender Equity and Women Empowerment \u2013 Nepal178 In September 2003, the Nepal National Human Rights Commission submitted recommendations and opinions on the National Action Plan on Gender Equity and Women Empowerment to the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare. The Plan covers the following issues as they relate to women: poverty; education and training; health; the economy; power structure and policy making; the institutional structure to further women\u2019s development; human rights; communications; women and the environment; and children. The Commission made suggestions for implementation and for designating a body responsible for implementation, coordination, monitoring and evaluation. Suggestions included: - Providing loans without collateral for poor women - Making arrangements for the education of disabled girl students - Introducing programs to formulate laws required for controlling incidents of witchcraft and other violence - Programs for women who lost their husbands in the armed insurgency - Providing full-fledged rights to property - Consulting with concerned parties relating to the drafting of legislation aimed at increasing women\u2019s political participation - Introducing programs to disseminate true stories of women and their rights in the mass media The strategy of NHRIs contributing to national plans is now well established. For many countries around the world, there are examples of more targeted national plans dedicated entirely to specific gender issues, such as those of indigenous women\u2019s groups. The following examples illustrate the wide range and variety of available options.179 \ufffd Plans and programs for defence of rights of indigenous women (Guatemala) \ufffd Basic Plan for Gender Equality (Japan) \ufffd Action Plan", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "81e6b5fb-8dea-442e-ba58-a4f8f6885bd0": {"__data__": {"id_": "81e6b5fb-8dea-442e-ba58-a4f8f6885bd0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b9963e62602e6526fe58f2a6739ad8b587e24bd7925bb62d33ce2081d8884d7f"}}, "hash": "b9963e62602e6526fe58f2a6739ad8b587e24bd7925bb62d33ce2081d8884d7f", "text": "on the Implementation of the Strategy for Gender Equality (Kazakhstan) Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 146 Module 6 \ufffd National Plan to Promote Gender Equality in Society (Moldova) \ufffd Action Plan for Integrating Women into Development (Morocco) \ufffd Action Plan to Combat Violence against Women (Norway) \ufffd Plan for Equality of Opportunities between Women and Men (Spain) \ufffd A national plan of action to improve the situation of women and enhance their role in society (Ukraine) F. Reports by States Parties Once a country becomes a State Party to CEDAW, the ICESCR, CRC or any other convention related to human rights, the State commits itself to legally binding obligations.180 Each State Party also accepts to take part in a periodic review process, also commonly known as the reporting procedure. The importance of the reporting procedure is that it enables the CEDAW Committee and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR), for example, to oversee and monitor how well rights are being respected, protected and fulfilled. Regarding ESC rights, reporting permits the assessment of progressive realization of the rights at the national level. For example, General Comment No. 28 of the Human Rights Committee for the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) provides for women\u2019s equality and women\u2019s rights, and contains particular provisions regarding the obligations of States to monitor these rights. 3. [\u2026] The State party must not only adopt measures of protection, but also positive measures in all areas so as to achieve the effective and equal empowerment of women. States parties must provide information regarding the actual role of women in society so that the Committee may ascertain what measures, in addition to legislative provisions, have been or should be taken to give effect to these obligations, what progress has been made, what difficulties are encountered and what steps are being taken to overcome them. Through the preparation of State Party reports, Governments are encouraged to include data and details on the steps taken, in laws, policies and programs to ensure the realization of women\u2019s ESC rights at the national level. States Parties are also encouraged to \u201cindicate factors and difficulties affecting the degree of fulfilment of obligations\u201d under each treaty.181 In the most general sense, the reports submitted by States to the expert Treaty bodies are meant to describe how well the State has done in implementing the treaty in question. (See the UN Manual on Human Rights Reporting for a more complete description of the reports required under these above-mentioned treaties, as well as their contents, and the form and responsibilities of the Treaty bodies.)182 The reports will, among other things, describe the mechanisms the State has put into place to promote the implementation of treaty rights and to redress problems that occur. As we have seen, NHRIs are one such mechanism and therefore reports will Module 6: The Promotion Mandate \u2013 Advice, Advocacy and Education Equitas 147 Module 6 describe the institution, its roles and responsibilities and its major accomplishments for the period in question. NHRIs Involvement in State Reports At a minimum, therefore, a national institution will usually be involved in either drafting or reviewing and commenting on the report insofar as it refers to the institution itself. Increasingly, reports of States Parties to the various committees are going beyond merely reporting on the institution and its work by including information on the activities of national institutions as these relate to the specific area covered. For example, a report under the Committee on the Rights of the Child may include results of an institution\u2019s examination of the degree to which the girl\u2019s right to education is being respected. A national institution will want to ensure that its work is being properly presented. It will therefore, at a minimum, review State reports to ensure that representations made concerning the institution\u2019s work or findings are accurately portrayed. Some institutions may go beyond this and contribute to State reports. This will vary according to a number of factors, including the functions of the institution and the willingness of the Government to seek its assistance. In many cases, a national institution will be able to: \ufffd Offer information, data or statistics directly to the Government department charged with preparing the report \ufffd Review draft reports in order to ensure their accuracy and completeness \ufffd Act as a coordinating point through which information from various ministries, departments and organizations is channelled. In this latter case, a national institution itself may be entrusted with the responsibility of compiling a draft report, which would then be", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee7b1c26-4dcd-42d2-84c8-09644f6af600": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee7b1c26-4dcd-42d2-84c8-09644f6af600", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e7aec0ee922b1e337b21545b87b9cd0bcd4e78fa11394950c49cad9009b1970f"}}, "hash": "e7aec0ee922b1e337b21545b87b9cd0bcd4e78fa11394950c49cad9009b1970f", "text": "submitted to the relevant authorities for review A national institution should take care if it is asked to perform this function since the obligation of reporting is a State responsibility and the report that is presented to the Expert Committee is a State report. Treaty bodies have long sought to include, when examining country reports submitted by any country, the views expressed by others active in the human rights areas. Typically this has been accomplished through the review of existing materials that national and international NGOs may have developed with reference to the human rights condition in that country, or by receiving direct submissions from those sources at the time a country report is being considered. More and more, however, Treaty bodies are looking to national institutions as an additional independent source of information to use in their assessment and analysis. Annual and Special Reports prepared by institutions, research studies, the results of public inquiries all can be reviewed by Treaty bodies. As these sources of information are increasingly available publicly, this is being done as a matter of course. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 148 Module 6 In addition, however, an institution could submit a report directly to the Treaty body in question. It might choose to do so, for example, if the country report contains, in the view of the institution, an inaccurate or misleading statement about the current situation and other efforts to have the report changed have failed. Treaty bodies will make comments on a State\u2019s performance based on their review and assessment of the national situation and will propose actions for the State to take. These comments and suggestions are meant to assist the State in meeting its international or regional obligations. An institution should carefully review these comments and recommendations and may wish to provide advice to the Government on what can be done to respond positively to them. An institution may also consider the comments when it is designing and implementing its program activities. For example, a comment by a Treaty body noting a certain deficiency and proposing corrective action may result in the NHRI deciding to monitor that particular issue within its overall monitoring program. Inter-Agency Cooperation As NHRIs build up expertise, Governments and others could be encouraged to view their NHRI as a place where they would seek specialist advice and assistance. While this has to be balanced with the capacity limitations, NHRIs do participate in inter- agency deliberations and discussions relating to the coordination of the preparation of the Government reports to the Human Rights Council, the CEDAW Committee, and the ESC rights and CRC committees, among others. Due to their independence, NHRIs should not be primarily responsible for coordinating State reports, but their expertise and input adds value to discussions throughout the process of drafting the Government report and may offer alternative perspectives. In this regard, NHRIs should: \ufffd Make recommendations to ensure that the information on women\u2019s ESC rights is reliable, realistically presented and also, considered as an integral part of the human rights situation of the country \ufffd Encourage consultations and open dialogue with civil society, especially as regards women\u2019s groups, in the process of preparing the report \ufffd Provide technical assistance to Government bodies preparing the report to ensure a better understanding of women\u2019s ESC rights \ufffd Share and supplement data and information that should be included in the Government report Since these reports are the primary responsibility of Governments, NHRIs should exercise caution. They should, at all times, stress their independence while continuing to cooperate with other public institutions to the extent possible. If NHRIs do not participate in working groups and/or workshops conducted by Government bodies responsible for drafting the State Party reports, they should be afforded the opportunity to comment on draft reports of Government. In this Module 6: The Promotion Mandate \u2013 Advice, Advocacy and Education Equitas 149 Module 6 regard, national institutions can work to strengthen the gender analysis in the reports, by ensuring that such reports reflect issues and questions relating to women. In this process, NHRIs should involve NGOs, women\u2019s research institutions, and other relevant members of civil society. NHRI Submissions as Part of the State Party Reports Since NHRIs are independent Government bodies, when the information submitted by NHRIs is included in Government reports, their independence should be stressed. In some cases, submissions by NHRIs are included as a separate chapter of the Government report. In other cases, NHRIs submit reports that are annexed to the State Party report and considered as \u201cstand alone\u201d information.

Representation of NHRIs at the Review Sessions NHRIs may be invited to be part of Government delegations to the CEDAW Committee and the Committee on ESC rights. While it is beneficial to engage in the constructive dialogue that occurs during the reporting process, it is important for NHRIs to act as independent bodies with expertise. For example, the practice in the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is not to be part of the Government delegation but to be designated as adviser to the delegation, respecting the independence of the Commission. In this approach, it is important that Committee members know of the presence of the national institution representative so that they can address questions to that representative directly if they so wish. The benefit of being part of the Government delegation is that the national institution may have several opportunities to officially engage with the Committee. However, it is inappropriate for the institution to answer questions or apologize on behalf of the Government. NHRIs should try to contribute information directly related to their areas of competence. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 150 Module 6 Example: Hong Kong Equal Opportunities Commission Attends 2006 CEDAW Session183 In 2006, members of the Hong Kong Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) attended the meeting of the CEDAW 36th Session, 7-25 August 2006, at the United Nations Headquarters in New York (EOC Paper No. 18/2006). Both the members themselves and observers considered the intervention to be a success. 25. Members noted the report on the CEDAW hearing contained in EOC Paper No. 18/2006 at which representatives of the EOC Office attended in August 2006. In addition to submitting an NGO report on the progress of women in Hong Kong prior to the meeting, Members noted that C/EOC also spoke at the NGO session and highlighted further on EOC\u2019s report as well as the concluding comments from CEDAW on Hong Kong following the session. G. Alternative/Parallel/Shadow Reports by NHRIs Some NHRIs choose to stress their independence from both the Government and NGOs. They submit reports directly to the CEDAW Committee or to the Committee on ESC rights, other bodies regarding women\u2019s ESC rights. Both Committees generally welcome the input sent by NHRIs and will review the information submitted. The information contained in the independent report should also be shared at the national level with the Government and civil society. Submitting alternative reports, also referred to as parallel or shadow reports, under a particular treaty assists the Treaty body in its task of assessing Government progress in implementing treaty rights and understanding the underlying conditions causing violations of women\u2019s ESC rights. For example, shadow reports frequently provide useful independent information and data on State failures to protect and promote women\u2019s ESC rights. Shadow reports should include data disaggregated by sex, information on temporary special measures, law reforms, measures to address stereotypical attitudes, etc. Shadow reports should also propose recommendations that the Committee can be urged to make in its Concluding Observations. They can also suggest issues and questions that the Committee might raise with the Government delegation. In other cases, NHRIs attend the review process independently, and are not part of the Government delegation. Here, the best way to address the Treaty body is through statements, made before or after the NGOs on the first day of the session.

Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 152 Module 6 H. Universal Periodic Review186 The Universal Periodical Review (UPR) mechanism of the UN Human Rights Council is a fundamental tool to measure the extent to which each State has fulfilled its human rights obligations and commitments. The Council aims to build efficient, logical, and clear human rights objectives, to develop supervising procedures and to provide reflections on a State\u2019s capacity building requirements. The UPR must look at best practices but also at challenges and obstacles that a State might face. Section 2 Human Rights Education International treaties oblige States to undertake human rights education. The ICESCR (Article 13), the CRC (Article 29) and CEDAW (Articles 7 and 10) all provide that human rights education is a State obligation, as do the Declarations and Programmes of Actions from the world conferences held in Vienna, Austria, in 1993. Since NHRIs also have a responsibility to ensure that international obligations are met, they too should ensure that the education provisions of these international treaties and international declarations and programs of action are put into effect. In its General Comment No. 10 on the role of NHRIs and ESC rights, the Committee on ESC rights states that NHRIs could conduct promotional, educational and information programs designed to enhance awareness and understanding of ESC rights, both within the general public and among particular groups. NHRIs can promote public awareness of the issues around the realization of women\u2019s ESC rights by: \ufffd Developing and disseminating public campaigns using the media (radio, television, print, internet, etc.) \ufffd Issuing public statements on issues related to women\u2019s ESC rights \ufffd Publishing research studies on these issues \ufffd Conducting national workshops and hearings on issues relating to women\u2019s ESC rights \ufffd Developing a comprehensive and current web site that can serve as a clearing house for NHRI information and initiatives The Philippines Commission for Human Rights, for example, has a wide-ranging program in the area of human rights education, which shared the 1994 UNESCO prize for human rights education.

One serious question about education and awareness raising campaigns is that they are often general in nature and \u201csoft\u201d in approach and as a result have little effect. The most effective human rights education, and therefore the most effective public awareness raising campaigns, will focus on specific violations and their particular impact on people and families, on what needs to be done. Example: Ontario Human Rights Commission, Canada Ontario\u2019s Human Rights Commission in Canada received complaints and public expressions of concern regarding women who had been refused service or asked to leave public areas while breastfeeding children. In one case, a woman was ordered to leave a restaurant premises. The Commission sent the case to a tribunal, where it was settled in favour of the complainant. Realizing that this was a broader social problem linked to lack of understanding and awareness of women\u2019s and mothers\u2019 rights, the Commission launched a province-wide campaign in partnership with the Infant Feeding Action Coalition Canada and the Toronto Public Health Unit to mark World Breastfeeding Week. The campaign extended over several months, and featured advertisements and posters placed on municipal transit vehicles across the province as well as posters in workplaces and public institutions. The advertising campaign was also linked to the Commission\u2019s work to protect women from discrimination in services and employment during pregnancy and breastfeeding. It affirmed the work of other international organizations, such as UNICEF and the World Health Organization that have repeatedly promoted the health and social benefits of breastfeeding to both the mother and the child. Practically speaking, women should not only have the right to breastfeed their children in public, but should also be given rights at the workplace to take appropriate breaks to feed breastfeeding children. This issue speaks directly to maternal health, infant health and the employment of women, and is directly pertinent to ESC rights. By placing the children front and centre in the campaign, much of the public division over the topic was defused. The Commission revised its own Policy on Discrimination Because of Pregnancy to include the right to breastfeed in public and in the work environment, added a plain language guide, and stated that an employer has an obligation to accommodate women who choose to breastfeed. Public education sessions with employers, unions and the general public complemented the campaign. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 154 Module 6 B. Workshops, Training and Conferences NHRIs can develop and conduct training sessions, national workshops and conferences on women\u2019s ESC rights for specific target groups. These should include sensitization on CEDAW and the ICESCR and the centrality of women\u2019s rights to the promotion and protection of ESC rights. Training can also include issues around: general gender sensitivity; State obligations under the ICESCR and CEDAW; and the development of national level action plans and other strategies which aim to protect and promote women\u2019s ESC rights. Many of these issues are already being undertaken by NGOs, and successful collaboration between NGOs and NHRIs can lead to much richer and more productive sessions that also build community trust and support from civil society. Target groups for training and sensitization sessions (at local, provincial/district and national levels) may include: \ufffd Government officials \ufffd NGOs and civil society organizations \ufffd Police and law enforcement officials \ufffd Community leaders \ufffd Teachers \ufffd Media \ufffd Judges and lawyers \ufffd Prison officials Training should be participatory in nature and sensitive to local and national issues affecting women and ESC rights. \u201cScaling up\u201d a successful local event or strategy to a national level is a strategy that is often used at the programmatic level and is especially useful for training sessions. For example, a local or pilot project at the community level on domestic violence, if successful, can be their expanded to be used country-wide. C. Publications and Media NHRIs can use the media and publications to promote women\u2019s ESC rights. Many institutions use radio and television programming. In some cases, state-controlled media may be willing to offer free or subsidized airtime. Radio in particular is an easy and relatively cost-effective way of reaching a large audience, especially when the audience may have limited literacy. In addition, NHRIs can obtain free media space (print, radio and TV) simply by producing good stories and having media savvy people to be interviewed.

Module 6: The Promotion Mandate \u2013 Advice, Advocacy and Education Equitas 155 Module 6 Popular programming is an effective way to view culture as an asset, rather than viewing it as a difficulty, in communicating the importance of change and education. Phone-in radio and/or television programs are quite popular in some countries and can be used both as a way of gauging public opinion on topical issues and presenting a human rights analysis of them. Television is a popular medium and some institutions are able to produce short advertising clips for use on television. This is usually quite expensive, however, and may be only realistic where the station airs free or subsidized public service announcements or where donors or partners will cover the cost. In the print media, newspaper inserts are useful and cost-effective. In countries where literacy rates are low, inserts may be effective in reaching elites. On the other hand, in countries where literacy levels are high and where newsprint enjoys wide circulation, they reach a much wider audience. Often, such inserts address a common theme or commemorate an international day. For example, an institution might develop an insert on International Women\u2019s Day in collaboration with UN agencies in the country, interested ministries and women\u2019s NGOs. It may also choose to develop a series of inserts on selected issues. Guest editorials or opinion pieces to be published in newspapers can be an effective way to present a reasoned position on a current controversial issue, or women\u2019s ESC rights, that may not otherwise get publicity because few other public figures may be addressing these issues. Finally, NHRIs should invest in and develop policy and legal documents, as well as plain language guides on issues involving women\u2019s ESC rights. These might be launched around commemorative days, for example, during national or international days commemorating women, or when the institution is releasing its Annual Report. Typically, publications programs also involve the following key elements: \ufffd Developing and distributing specialized human rights publications, such as the rights of migrant women workers, the rights of women related to pregnancy and employment, violence against women, and publications on vulnerable women in racial, ethnic or other minority communities \ufffd Developing and maintaining a mechanism to become a depository of human rights information and making that information available to the public, ensuring that document classifications include gender issues \ufffd Public outreach efforts to women\u2019s NGOs and other groups Core Human Rights Material NHRIs typically develop a variety of human rights material, including: \ufffd Brochures or other easily accessible material describing the role and responsibilities of the institution in relation to women\u2019s ESC rights \ufffd Simple booklets explaining key women\u2019s rights principles and how the institution is charged with promoting and protecting them Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 156 Module 6 \ufffd Specialized publications on specific rights issues which should be issued separately and targeted to specialized audiences \ufffd Newsletters in print and/or electronic form publicizing the NHRI activities and issues Annual Report Annual Reports from NHRIs are used to enhance the institution\u2019s accountability by informing audiences of the institution\u2019s work and its use of resources. Many institutions use annual reports to go beyond administrative reporting, using the reports as education and advocacy tools. This can be done, for example, by including substantive comments on the human rights situation in the country, including women\u2019s ESC rights; the results of complaints or inquiries involving women\u2019s issues; and publishing sex-disaggregated data. D. Community-Based Initiatives Community-based initiatives are promotional activities that directly involve the local community or smaller sub-sectors. They assist the community to develop a better general awareness of human rights principles through popular means. Examples of community-based initiatives that are especially effective for women include: \ufffd Song, dance, theatre or drawing competitions on women\u2019s rights. They are a particularly attractive way to promote awareness among younger individuals when more formal education or training initiatives might not be effective or appropriate \ufffd Exhibitions and special events to mark anniversaries such as Human Rights Day (10 December), International Women\u2019s Day (March 8), International AIDS Day (1 December) \ufffd Rights awards for women or women\u2019s groups within the community who have made a significant contribution to the realization of ESC rights \ufffd Sports events and exchanges \ufffd Micro-loan initiatives at the community level \ufffd Support and service groups for women \ufffd Informal education for girl children \ufffd Local health campaigns on issues related to sexual and reproductive health \ufffd Mobile \u201chuman rights clinics\u201d by NHRI officials who move", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5104642e-a7b5-4a47-8a2d-14eb70e9ed1d": {"__data__": {"id_": "5104642e-a7b5-4a47-8a2d-14eb70e9ed1d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e2bc2a0a7bb8e701d04061797db338c9404a39466a61a11f32b14381a269d2e3"}}, "hash": "e2bc2a0a7bb8e701d04061797db338c9404a39466a61a11f32b14381a269d2e3", "text": "from community to community on a scheduled basis \ufffd Education sessions with community NGOs Module 6: The Promotion Mandate \u2013 Advice, Advocacy and Education Equitas 157 Module 6 E. NHRIs as Clearing Houses for Human Rights Information NHRIs are responsible for acting as clearing houses for human rights materials in the country, at least regarding their own human rights documents, and for collecting and making available a wide variety of human rights material produced regularly by the UN and other international, regional and national organizations. Many of these are produced in multiple languages and have been popularized to make them more accessible to the general population. They include: \ufffd International human rights instruments and standards relating to women\u2019s ESC rights (including information on ratifications and reservations by the State in question) \ufffd Copies of reports of the State to Treaty bodies and concluding observations made by Treaty bodies on those reports that are relevant to women\u2019s issues \ufffd Informational and training materials developed on women\u2019s rights internationally, regionally and nationally \ufffd National laws on women\u2019s rights and ESC rights, including relevant administrative and judicial decisions which have interpreted or applied that legislation \ufffd Information on domestic mechanisms for protection of human rights and women\u2019s rights (including other national institutions, parliamentary commissions, ministerial committees and NGOs) \ufffd Information on the structure and functioning of implementation mechanisms which exist at the international level \ufffd Studies and reports on human rights carried out by the institution as well as by Government ministries, NGOs and international organizations Much of this information can be obtained from the UN, Government departments and NGOs. A number of NHRIs have created research or documentation centres to ensure that human rights materials are maintained and made available to staff, clients and researchers. However, the fastest-growing strategy to become a clearing house of information is through the creation of an NHRI web site, which is an increasingly accessible way to collect, classify and disseminate information, preferably in the country\u2019s principal languages. F. NHRI Engagement in Public School Curricula Education starts with children and since attitudes about women\u2019s roles in society are formed and shaped in early years, the ability to influence curriculum for the next generation in a way that supports women\u2019s equality is crucial. NHRIs can have a fundamental role in this work. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 158 Module 6 The World Programme for Human Rights Education was proclaimed by the General Assembly in 2004. The first phase of the World Programme focuses on primary and secondary school systems. The Plan of Action for this first phase was adopted by all UN Member States in July 2005.188 The updated description of the first phase is set out below. Example: A Plan of Action for Human Rights Education in the Primary and Secondary School Systems 2005-2009189 Unlike the limited time frame of the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education (1995-2004), the World Programme is structured around an ongoing series of phases, the first of which covers the period 2005-2009 and focuses on the primary and secondary school systems. Developed by a broad group of education and human rights practitioners from all continents, the Plan of Action for the first phases proposes a concrete strategy and practical ideas for implementing human rights education nationally. Its key elements are highlighted below. - A rights-based approach - Child-centred and participatory - Inclusive and non-discriminatory The Plan of Action underscores that human rights education in the school system should promote a rights-based approach to education by ensuring that all the components and processes of education\u2014including curricula, materials, methods and training \u2013 are conducive to learning about human rights. It also ensures that the human rights of all members of the school community are respected. Conclusion In the context of women\u2019s ESC rights, human rights promotion helps to develop and enhance a culture of human rights so that women are valued as human beings with dignity and equality, where every individual in a society shares these values as reflected in the international and national human rights legal framework. A successful human rights promotion program, therefore, is one that moves individuals beyond knowledge to a cultural shift in human rights, required for women\u2019s equality.

(WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, The World Bank: 2007) 36 The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has indicated that the right to social security includes the right to maternity benefits. The more general right to work (ICESCR, art. 6) can be said to require States to develop employment policies and benefits \u2013 like maternity benefits \u2013 that safeguard to right to work. Finally the obligation to establish \u201cjust and favourable conditions of work\u201d (art. 7) is open-ended and intended as an illustration.

Underlined words indicate terms defined in the glossary. A Accession The act whereby a state accepts the offer or the opportunity to become a party to a treaty already negotiated and signed by other states. It has the same legal effect as ratification. Accession usually occurs after the treaty has entered into force. Adoption The formal act by which the form and content of a proposed treaty text are established. As a general rule, the adoption of the text of a treaty takes place through the expression of the consent of the States participating in the treaty-making process. Treaties that are negotiated within an international organization will usually be adopted by a resolution of a representative organ of the organization whose membership more or less corresponds to the potential participation in the treaty in question. A treaty can also be adopted by an international conference which has specifically been convened for setting up the treaty, by a vote of two thirds of the States present and voting, unless, by the same majority, they have decided to apply a different rule. Advocacy The effort to change public perceptions and influence policy decisions and funding priorities. Advocates educate about an issue and suggest a specific solution. Advocacy involves making a case in favour of a particular issue, using skillful persuasion and strategic action. Simply put, advocacy means actively supporting a cause and trying to get others to support it as well. Affirmative action Action taken by a government or private institution to increase the representation of women and minorities in areas of education, work, or promotion on the basis of age, disability, ethnic origin, familial status, gender, language, marital status, political or other opinion, race, religion or belief, sex or sexual orientation; permitted for some conditions under the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and other international and regional documents. Affirmative action is also sometimes referred to as affirmative discrimination. Alternative report Report prepared by a non-state actor, usually a non-governmental organization (NGO) or a national human rights institution (NHRI), to a committee. Such a report is termed an alternative report where no government report is available. If the NGO or NHRI submits its report where a government report exists, it is called a shadow report. Alternative dispute resolution A generic term referring to strategies for settling disputes outside the courts, such as mediation, arbitration and conciliation.

The term itself has an emotive content that goes back to the Magna Carta of 1215. Well-known recent examples are the Charter of the United Nations of 1945 and the Charter of the Organization of American States of 1952. Charter of the United Nations The United Nations Charter is the treaty that forms and establishes the international organization called the United Nations. This document is a constituent agreement between states signed at the United Nations Conference on International Organization in San Francisco in 1945. Charter-based body A body that derives its mandate from a charter. Similar to a Treaty body (a treaty-based body), which derives its mandate from a treaty. A charter-based body within the United Nations derives its mandate directly from the UN Charter. The Human Rights Council is an example of a charter-based body within the UN system, but there are also charter-based bodies outside the UN, e.g. the Inter- American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR). Civil and political rights The rights of all human beings to liberty and equality; sometimes referred to as first generation rights. Civil rights include freedom to worship, to think and express oneself, to vote, to take part in political life, and to have access to information. Civil and political rights are defended in a number of international instruments including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Civil society Civil society refers to all groups outside government such as community groups, non-governmental organizations, labour unions, indigenous peoples\u2019 organizations, charitable organizations, faith-based organizations, professional associations and foundations. Civil society expresses the interests of social groups and raises awareness of key issues in order to influence policy and decision-making. In recent decades, such organizations have been successful in shaping global policy through advocacy campaigns and mobilization of people and resources. Claim Allegation made by an individual or State pursuing a remedy for an injury caused by an offender (usually but not always the State). Appendices Equitas 177 Appendices Claimant One who brings a claim. Codes of ethics Normative statements of rules of conduct and principles. Codification of international law Process of reducing customary international law to written form. Collective rights The rights of groups to protect their interests and identities. Commission on Human Rights Former subsidiary body of the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) of the United Nations to deal with human rights; one of the first and most important international human rights bodies. Replaced by the Human Rights Council in 2006. Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) The Commission on the Status of Women was established by the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in 1946 to prepare recommendations and reports on promoting women\u2019s rights in political, economic, civil, social and educational fields. The CSW is a global policy-making body dedicated to gender equality and advancement of women. The CSW also monitors implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action. Committee See charter-based body and Treaty body. Committee on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW Committee) The treaty monitoring body created by the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women to monitor State compliance with that convention. Communication Term for complaint or claim in the UN human rights system. Community service organization (CSO) Non-profit organization or association which provides or coordinates the delivery of services in the public interest. Complaints committee A common strategy for gender mainstreaming in the area of women\u2019s ESC rights that most NHRIs have established. They do not facilitate the resolution of cases per se, but are mandated to track the progress of cases, ensure that priority cases are brought to the attention of senior staff, and ensure that women\u2019s ESC cases are properly identified, flagged and resourced. Complaint A complaint or claim sets out the formal basis of an allegation of human rights violations to an authorized body such as an NHRI, a tribunal or a court. A complaint may be in writing or verbal. It sets out a brief summary of what happened and argues why relief should be granted. In a human rights case, the complaint (also called a petition, or communication) alleges that a respondent or Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 178 Appendices defendant (usually the government, but can also extend to an individual or institution) violated the claimant\u2019s human rights.

Context/Contextualizing women\u2019s rights Women\u2019s experiences show that inequality is deeply rooted in history, tradition and religion. These forces combine to create a context of social beliefs, legal regimes, and economic structures that subordinate women to men in many countries, cultures and communities around the world. Women\u2019s equality therefore must be understood within the context in which women live. Convention The general meaning of \u201cconvention\u201d is an international agreement. \u201cConventional law\u201d, is a term used to distinguish it from the other sources of international law, such as customary law or the general principles of international law. The generic term \u201cconvention\u201d thus is synonymous with the generic term \u201ctreaty\u201d. Unlike declarations, Conventions are legally binding for governments that have signed them. When the UN General Assembly adopts a convention, it creates international norms and standards. Once a convention is adopted by the UN General Assembly, Member States can then ratify the convention, promising to uphold it. Governments that violate the standards set forth in a convention can then be censured by the UN. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) CEDAW is sometimes called the \u201cinternational bill of rights for women.\u201d Adopted in 1979, consisting of a preamble and 30 articles, it defines what constitutes discrimination against women and sets up an agenda for national action to end such discrimination. The Optional Protocol to CEDAW, adopted in 1999, created a mechanism for access to justice for women at the international level by giving them the right to present their claims for review by the CEDAW Committee. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) CERD forbids any \u201cdistinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin, which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise on an equal footing of human rights and fundamental freedoms in political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.\u201d It was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1965. Appendices Equitas 179 Appendices Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) Also known as the Children\u2019s Convention, the CRC sets forth a full spectrum of civil, cultural, economic, social, and political rights for children. It was adopted in 1989. Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities (CRPD) Convention adopted in 2006 which determines what discrimination on the basis of disability constitutes, and recognizes the importance of multiple effects of discrimination for women with disabilities (Article 6(1)).

For example, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights became binding because States and individuals treated it as binding. Now, in the conscience of most States, it is regarded as a binding instrument, even though such declarations are not usually binding. D Declaration The term applies to various international instruments, including binding or non-binding international or universal aspirations made by parties to the declaration. Some declarations may have maintained provisions that were not binding when first adopted, but with the passage of time, developed into customary international law, and thereby eventually became binding in character. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights offers such an example. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 180 Appendices Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Declaration adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in December 2007, stating that that indigenous peoples and individuals are free and equal to all other peoples and that indigenous peoples have the right to freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development. Denunciation or Withdrawal from a treaty When a State declares that it is no longer bound by a treaty it has previously ratified. A state may denounce a treaty or withdraw from it after giving the appropriate body notice of its intention to do so, according to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969). An evolving view is that human rights treaties (including ICCPR, ICESCR and CEDAW) do not allow denunciation if they \u201cdo not contain clauses expressly permitting denunciation\u201d, according to Craig Scott\u2019s article \u201cToward the Institutional Integration of the Core Human Rights Treaties\u201d in I. Merali and V. Oosterveld, Giving Meaning to Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001), pp. 7-38. Discrimination Unfair treatment of a person or group on the basis of prejudice. See racial discrimination, discrimination against women, gender discrimination. Discrimination against women Defined in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) as \u201cany distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on the basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field\u201d (article 1). Domestic violence Violence among members of a family or household; in these cases, one person gains power through use of physical, sexual, psychological, and economic coercion. Any person in a household could be the target of domestic violence but it is most frequently experienced by women. E Early intervention/warning system Practices used by NHRIs and Ombudsman offices to encourage parties to a potential dispute to consider their position or to resolve the matter at an early stage. Examples include information sessions and counselling for all parties. These early services help NHRIs identify human rights issues and trends as they emerge, and to highlight discriminatory practices. Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) ECOSOC was established under the UN Charter as the principal organ to coordinate economic, social, and related work of the 14 UN specialized agencies, functional commissions and five regional commissions. It is responsible for promoting higher standards of living, full employment, and economic and social progress; identifying solutions to international economic, social and health problems; facilitating international cultural and educational cooperation; and encouraging universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Appendices Equitas 181 Appendices Economic, social and cultural rights Economic, social and cultural rights (ESC rights) are the fundamental human rights that support and enhance human existence and dignity by assuring equality and preventing discrimination. ESC rights concern the necessities of life, including the right to enjoy one\u2019s cultural identity and the benefits of development. Examples include the right to work; the right to an adequate standard of living, including food, clothing, and housing; the right to physical and mental health; the right to social security; the right to a healthy environment; and the right to education. These rights are deeply intertwined with civil and political rights. For example, the right to speak freely means little without a basic education. Similarly, the right to work is diminished if you are not allowed to meet and assemble with co-workers to discuss work conditions.

Environmental rights These rights recognize that people have the right to live in a safe and healthy environment. Together with the right to development, they are sometimes referred to as third generation rights. They draw on the first- and second-generation rights, but they are not specifically enshrined in any international human rights Treaty body. Equality The notion that all human beings are entitled to the same human rights without distinction. The equality principle is embodied in article 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Equality does not necessarily mean treating people the same but rather taking whatever steps are necessary to promote a more just society for all. A distinction is often drawn between the interconnected concepts of formal and substantive equality. Formal equality assumes that equality is obtained if a law or a policy treats everyone, e.g. men and women, in the same way, or in a neutral manner. Substantive equality is concerned with the effects of laws and policies and with ensuring that they alleviate, rather than propagate, the inherent disadvantage experienced by traditionally discriminated groups, such as women. See also Montreal Principles. Exhaustion of domestic remedies Exhaustion of domestic remedies requires use of all available procedures to seek protection from future human rights violations and to obtain justice for past abuses. Local remedies can range from making a case in court to lodging a complaint with local police. A complaint to an international body should include proof that domestic remedies have been exhausted, including information about any legal proceedings that took place in the country. There are limited exceptions to the requirement that domestic remedies be exhausted. International law recognizes that domestic remedies may be unavailable, ineffective (i.e. a sham proceeding) or unreasonably delayed. In these cases, it is not necessary to first address the national mechanisms if it can be convincingly demonstrated that there are, in effect, no local remedies available.

Feminization of poverty The term \u201cfeminization of poverty\u201d originated in the US in the late 1970s; female-headed households account for a growing proportion of those below the poverty line. A large majority of these women are divorced or never-married mothers. The burden of supporting a family is difficult for single mothers because of low salaries relating to the lack of previous work experience and low educational attainment and is often exacerbated by meagre or unavailable child support. See Valentine M. Moghadam\u2019s article \u201cThe \u2018Feminization of Poverty\u201d and Women\u2019s Human Rights\u201d at http://portal.unesco.org/shs/en/files/8282/11313736811Feminization_of_Poverty.pdf/Feminizatio n+of+Poverty.pdf. Flexibility clause While United Nations treaties allow reservations to be made by signing parties, International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions do not allow reservations. Instead, ILO Conventions contain clauses which take into account the particular economic and social systems, and levels of development of the ILO member states. These clauses are referred to as flexibility clauses because they allow for a certain degree of flexibility in the labour standards adopted. States are said to invoke flexibility clauses by making declarations specifying the standards that will apply to them. Focal point The term \u201cfocal point\u201d is not universally accepted, but many organizations and NHRIs use it simply to indicate a point of responsibility within the organization or a liaison for an external initiative. It can refer both to an official in a NHRI who is given formal responsibility for a specific issue in order to create an internal and visible authority structure for the work, but also to special departments, units and cross-departmental committees. Formal equality See equality. G Gender The culturally specific set of characteristics that identify the social behaviour, roles and status of women and men and the relationship between them. Gender, therefore, refers not simply to women or men but to the relationship between them and to the way it is socially constructed. Because it is a relational term, gender must include women and men. Like the concepts of class, race and ethnicity, gender is an analytical tool for understanding social processes.

Gender mainstreaming Gender mainstreaming involves ensuring that gender perspectives and attention to the goal of gender equality are central to all activities \u2013 policy development, research, advocacy/dialogue, legislation, resource allocation, as well as planning, implementation and monitoring of programs and projects. However, the experience at both the international and national levels is that, unless there is a dedicated focus on women\u2019s issues, mainstreaming initiatives will be minimized or ignored. Gender neutral Assessment of a problem without the insertion of a gender-sensitive analysis. The myth of gender neutrality in human rights eliminates recognition that treating people identically despite unequal situations perpetuates rather than eradicates injustices.

Good governance A general ideal of the State\u2019s decision-making process and how public affairs are conducted and public resources managed. It is generally agreed that good governance has eight major characteristics. It is participatory, consensus oriented, accountable, transparent, responsive, effective and efficient, equitable and inclusive, and it follows the rule of law. In practice, good governance assures that corruption is minimized, the views of minorities are taken into account and that the voices of the most vulnerable in society are heard in decision-making. It is also responsive to the present and future needs of society. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 184 Appendices H Harmful traditional practices Refer to traditional cultural practices that are detrimental to women\u2019s well-being. They include: female genital mutilation; physical mutilation (e.g. foot-binding); forced feeding of women; early marriage; the various taboos or practices which prevent women from controlling their own fertility; nutritional taboos and traditional birth practices; preference for sons and its implications for the status of girl children; female infanticide; early pregnancy; and dowry price. Despite their harmful nature and their violation of international human rights laws, such practices persist because they are not questioned and take on an aura of morality in the eyes of those practising them.

Hostile work environment/Sexual harassment Unwelcome conduct that is so severe or pervasive as to change the conditions of the claimant\u2019s employment and create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. Hostile work environment harassment does not require an impact on an economic benefit. It may involve co- workers or third parties, not just supervisors. This type of sexual harassment is not limited to sexual advances; it can include hostile or offensive behaviour based on the person\u2019s gender. Human rights Human rights are the fundamental rights and freedoms which, it is generally agreed, everybody has from the moment of birth, simply because they are human beings. They are not privileges which need to be won and they apply equally to everybody, regardless of age, sex, race, ethnicity, wealth or social standing. Because they are rights, they cannot be taken away from anyone by the government (although they can be limited and sometimes suspended during states of emergency). These rights are based on a number of human rights principles. Human rights become enforceable as they become codified as conventions, covenants or treaties, or as they become recognized as customary international law.

Human rights of women See women\u2019s human rights. Human rights principles Human rights are related to one\u2019s human dignity; they are universal, inalienable (cannot be taken away under any circumstances), indivisible (none of the rights are more important than others), interdependent and interconnected (denial of one human right has an impact on one\u2019s ability to exercise other human rights); governments are obligated to enforce such rights in a manner that promotes equality and non-discrimination. Human rights systems The various groupings of human rights laws, courts, investigatory bodies and other organizations at the national, regional and international levels, which may provide appropriate enforcement mechanisms, such as court-like complaint procedures and audit-like reporting procedures. Human rights Treaty bodies They are seven committees of independent experts that observe implementation of the core international human rights treaties (Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women; Convention against Torture; Convention on the Rights of the Child; Convention on the Protection of the Rights of Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families). They are articulated in accordance with the provisions of the treaty that they monitor. Human security for women An issue introduced by women\u2019s advocacy groups as a right through the recognition of full citizenship rights for women, including the right to life and security. The groups pushed to extend citizenship \u2013 and therefore human rights protection \u2013 into the \u201cprivate\u201d realm in order to get at pervasive violence against women in its many forms. I Implementation For a Party to an international agreement, process of adopting all relevant policies, laws and regulations, and undertaking all necessary actions to meet its obligations under the agreement. Indicator A quantitative or qualitative variable that provides a simple and reliable means to measure achievement, to reflect the changes connected to an intervention, or to help assess the performance of a development actor. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 186 Appendices Individual complaint mechanism This mechanism allows the individual to issue a complaint without the need to use the State as an intermediate. Thus, it covers isolated instances of alleged human rights violations. It is available under the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, Convention against Torture and the Migrant Workers Convention to individuals or groups of individuals who believe that their human rights or fundamental freedoms have been violated. Instruments A general term for formal legal documents. In the International Labour Organization, this term includes conventions, recommendations and Protocols. Intergovernmental organization This term refers to those organizations that operate across two or more States and whose members are themselves States.

Responding to the world\u2019s main development challenges and to the calls of civil society, the MDGs promote poverty reduction, education, maternal health, gender equality, and aim at combating child mortality, AIDS and other diseases. Set for the year 2015, the MDGs are an agreed set of goals that can be achieved if all actors work together and do their part. Mini-report A mini-report contains information on specific human rights problems that deserve scrutiny. Mini- reports are usually prepared when the committee has asked the state for information on particular issues and a non-governmental organization (NGO) wishes to provide alternative information on those issues or when an NGO does not have the resources for a full shadow report. Minimum core obligations The duty, under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), of ratifying States to ensure the very minimum essential levels of rights recognized therein.

The Montreal Principles were adopted in December 2002 by a civil society expert group in Montreal, Canada. Multiple grounds of discrimination See intersectionality. N National human rights institution (NHRI) A government body established under the Constitution or by law, whose functions are specifically designed to promote and protect human rights. The Paris Principles broadly group NHRIs into three categories: human rights commissions, ombudsmen, and specialized national institutions designed to protect the rights of a particular vulnerable group (such as ethnic minorities, indigenous populations, refugees, women or children). In particular, the Paris Principles emphasize that NHRIs should be Appendices Equitas 189 Appendices given \u201cas broad a mandate as possible\u201d and that they should be independent from the executive branch. Non-binding When a document is non-binding, it carries no formal legal obligations, e.g. a declaration. It may, however, carry moral obligations or attain the force of law as international customary law. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) Organizations formed by and of people outside of Government. Non-profit, human rights, humanitarian aid and grassroots organizations can all be NGOs. NGOs monitor the proceedings of human rights bodies such as the Human Rights Council and are the \u201cwatchdogs of the human rights that fall within their mandate. Some are large and international (e.g. the Red Cross, Amnesty International, the Girl Scouts); others may be small and local (e.g. an organization to advocate for people with disabilities in a particular city; a coalition to promote women\u2019s rights in one refugee camp). NGOs play a major role in influencing United Nations policy, and many of them have official consultative status at the UN. Non-retrogression, Principle of See retrogressive measures. Non-State actors Actors excluding Government and public authorities. They include non-governmental organizations, multi-nationals, financial institutions, private and publicly held companies, religious institutions, private employers, private or corporate landlords, individuals and private service providers. Non-treaty based mechanisms Provisions for the enforcement of human rights that are not directly derived from a specific human rights treaty, convention or covenant. For example, the specialized agencies of the United Nations often provide forms of complaint and/or monitoring procedures. O Objection Within the UN human rights system, States Parties are entitled to make objections to reservations made by other States Parties to a treaty, e.g. if they think the reservation is incompatible with the overall purpose of the treaty. Obligations to respect, protect and fulfill The three levels of obligations imposed on States Parties by the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and its subsequent General Comment No. 16. They are to be viewed together and as a whole, and they are not independent and sequential, i.e. it is not the case that once you have respected rights; the next step is to protect them and then finally to fulfill them. Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights (OHCHR) A department of the United Nations Secretariat, mandated to promote and protect the enjoyment and full realization, by all people, of all rights established in the Charter of the United Nations and in international human rights laws and treaties. It is led by the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Its mandate includes preventing human rights violations, securing respect for all human rights, Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 190 Appendices promoting international cooperation to protect human rights, coordinating related activities throughout the United Nations, and strengthening and streamlining the United Nations system in the field of human rights.

Paris Principles The Principles relating to the Status of National Institutions provide international minimum standards on the status and roles of NHRIs. In 1991, the UN Commission on Human Rights held an international workshop of human rights institutions, UN member states and specialized agencies, and non- governmental organizations (NGOs). The purpose was to review the cooperation between national and international institutions, and to explore ways to increase their effectiveness. The resulting \u201cParis Principles\u201d were subsequently endorsed by the UN General Assembly in December 1993. Petition See complaint. Policy instrument mixes \u201cMixes\u201d of different parts of the governance structures in order to achieve policy goals. They include not only laws but also administrative arrangements, guidelines and rules, public education policies and programs. Principles Guidelines that play a role of legal interpretation, even though they are not legally binding in the same way as a law. Nonetheless, they help in explaining what rights mean, and how they have evolved over the years. For example, the Limburg Principles have assisted in the development and application of economic, social and cultural rights. Procedural requirements Technical requirements that must be met to bring forward a claim. Appendices Equitas 191 Appendices Progressive realization Progressive realization recognizes that States cannot realize all economic, social and cultural (ESC) rights in a short period of time. States may therefore work towards ESC rights over time, to the extent permitted by their economies. At the same time, States Parties should move as expeditiously as possible towards the realization of rights (Limburg Principles, 21). Protocol See optional protocol. Public inquiry A mechanism which enables an NHRI to examine systemic or general human rights issues in depth and from all perspectives. Typically, public inquiries involve the establishment of a panel with defined terms of reference, and a mandate to hold hearings to which witnesses can be summoned to testify. Q Quasi-jurisdictional institutions Institutions that are not usually real courts, although their structure and their investigatory and decision-making powers make them similar, if not equal. Their main duty is to receive complaints and render final decisions that are binding upon the parties. In this way, they resolve cases of discrimination, generally relating to individuals but sometimes involving more than one person. Most NHRIs are quasi-jurisdictional institutions. This term is used almost exclusively in the international context, and primarily in UN bodies. R Racial discrimination Any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin, which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life. Rapporteurs See Special Rapporteurs. Ratification The act by which a State formally agrees to be legally bound by a treaty\u2019s provisions. It usually requires the approval of the State\u2019s legislative body (or bodies, in the case of federal States). A State that ratifies a treaty is called a \u201cState Party\u201d to that treaty. An agreement that is ratified is applicable and legally binding on the State Party. Some treaties do not enter into force until they have been ratified by a certain number of the States that have signed it. The number of ratifications required is specified in the text of the treaty. Remedy In legal terms, the means by which a right is enforced or the violation of a right is prevented, redressed or compensated. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 192 Appendices Reporting procedure This mechanism is available under the Human Rights Committee, Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, Commission on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, Commission Against Torture, Commission on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on Migrant Workers. A state that has ratified or acceded to one of these treaties is required to submit a report on its fulfillment of its obligations under the treaty. The aim of the reporting mechanism is to make States Parties accountable in the area of human rights and monitor their progress.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "23ab3ee7-a5ad-404a-8819-16b851513810": {"__data__": {"id_": "23ab3ee7-a5ad-404a-8819-16b851513810", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "94da2466703ddadebb581222d170c3f5ae78be581c57dd585b0b2ee6751b4c55"}, "3": {"node_id": "da92bd76-9f61-401c-9fea-f04b94bb3bd7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "07360824546a6ae38fe53edcd6c34cdb22e0237e97b5b5c1fdcaf372bc2d6c31"}}, "hash": "076a568d1bf5bddb090655f2047ebd51d010c9090b08e00b89648e4b06bd4e39", "text": "In general, reports are submitted to the Secretary General of the UN, who transmits them to the relevant treaty body. Reservation A reservation is a declaration made by a State by which it purports to exclude or alter the legal effect of certain provisions of the treaty in their application to that State. A reservation enables a State to accept a multilateral treaty as a whole by giving it the possibility not to apply certain provisions with which it does not want to comply. Reservations can be made when the treaty is signed, ratified, accepted, approved or acceded to. Reservations must not be incompatible with the object and the purpose of the treaty. Furthermore, a treaty might prohibit reservations or only allow for certain reservations to be made. Resolution Within the United Nations system, a resolution (or UN resolution) is a formal text adopted by a United Nations body. Although any UN body can issue resolutions, in practice most resolutions are issued by the Security Council or the General Assembly. Responsibility to respect, protect and fulfill See obligations to respect, protect and fulfill. Retrogressive measure An act that leads, directly or indirectly, to backward steps being taken with respect to the rights recognized in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Done deliberately, the acting State Party is in violation of article 23 of the Covenant. Right to development Right recognizing that people are entitled to cultural, political and economic development. Sometimes referred to as third-generation rights together with environmental rights. See also rights- based approach. Rights-based approach (to development) A rights-based approach to development is a conceptual framework for human development that \u201cintegrates the norms, standards and principles of the international human rights system into the plans, policies and processes of development\u201d (according to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, http://www.unhchr.ch/development/approaches.html). Appendices Equitas 193 Appendices S Sex Sex refers to the biological differences between men and women.

Sex discrimination See gender discrimination; see also discrimination against women. Sexual harassment Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favours, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitutes sexual harassment when submission to or rejection of this conduct explicitly or implicitly affects an individual\u2019s employment, unreasonably interferes with an individual\u2019s work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment. Shadow report A comprehensive critique of the State report submitted under the reporting mechanism. Shadow reports are usually prepared by non-governmental organizations and NHRIs who have not had an opportunity to participate in the state reporting process. See also mini-report and alternative report. Signatory States States that have signed a particular treaty, convention or covenant. Signature The signature of an international instrument is the first step toward a State toward becoming a Party to an international instrument. The next step is ratification. After signing an international instrument, States are given a period of time before becoming fully bound by the text of the document. According to article 18 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, signatories to international treaties commit themselves to refrain from acts which would defeat the object and purpose of the signed document. Sources of international law Primary sources listed in article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice are (1) treaty; (2) customary international law; (3) general principles of law; (4) judicial decisions. Special Rapporteurs Experts who are assigned to particular thematic issues or country situations. Their functions vary according to their particular mandate. In general, they collect information on alleged violations of human rights and formulate policy recommendations. In some cases, they visit individual countries. Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women Official appointed by the General Assembly in 1994 to investigate and make reports on cases of violence against women worldwide.

Strategic planning The identification of which priority areas an organization is to select and direct its resources, given the external situation and its internal capacities. Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs) Policies of international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund that place tight restrictions on the country\u2019s economy with the goal of increasing exports and decreasing deficits and encourage governments to adopt stabilization or austerity measures which entail cutting government spending on \u201cnon-essential\u201d services; often have an adverse impact on women. Substantive equality See equality. T Temporary special measures Measures taken to advance women\u2019s integration into education, the economy, politics and employment, such as affirmative action, preferential treatment and quota systems. Such a program can be used to remedy effects of past discrimination against women. Another reason is the obligation under International Covenant on the Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to work for substantive equality for women. Trafficking Involves the recruitment and transportation of persons, using deception, coercion and threats in order to place and keep them in a situation of forced labour, slavery or servitude. Persons are trafficked into a variety of sectors of the informal economy, including prostitution, domestic work, agriculture, the garment industry or street begging. Transformation A legal concept referring to the manner in which a ratified international declaration, covenant or convention becomes part of domestic law. Appendices Equitas 195 Appendices Treaty Formal agreement between States that defines and modifies their mutual duties and obligations; used synonymously with convention and covenant. When conventions are adopted by the United Nations General Assembly, they create legally binding international obligations for the Member States who have signed the treaty. When a national government ratifies a treaty, the content of that treaty should be incorporated into its domestic legal order, subject to transformation. Treaty-based mechanisms UN treaties dealing with human rights have established three mechanisms for dealing with violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms: the individual complaint mechanism, the State-to-State complaint mechanism and the reporting mechanism (reporting procedure). Treaty body A group of experts set up according to the terms of a treaty to monitor each State Party\u2019s progress in fulfilling its obligations under that treaty. Also called a committee, a treaty-based body or a treaty- monitoring body. U United Nations Conference on Human Rights World Conference on human rights held in Vienna in 1993; produced the Vienna Declaration and Platform for Action. Women\u2019s human rights advocates used the conference to push for recognition of women\u2019s human rights. United Nations Conference on Women UN Conference with the platform for action that includes empowering women worldwide, and \u201cadvancing the goals of equality, development and peace for all women everywhere in the interest of all humanity.\u201d The first United Nations World Conference on Women took place in Mexico in 1975; subsequently, the UN proclaimed 1975-1985 the Decade for Women and conferences on women took place in Copenhagen in 1980 and Nairobi in 1985; the latest conference was in Beijing in 1995, producing the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. United Nations Division for the Advancement of Women (DAW) UN body responsible for assisting the Commission on the Status of Women, the main policy-making body for women, and the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Grounded in the vision of equality of the United Nations Charter, the Division for the Advancement of Women (DAW) advocates the improvement of the status of women around the world and the achievement of their equality with men. Aiming to ensure the participation of women as equal partners with men in all aspects of human endeavour, DAW promotes women as equal participants and beneficiaries of sustainable development, peace and security, governance and human rights. As part of its mandate, it strives to stimulate the mainstreaming of gender perspectives both within and outside the United Nations system.

Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism The Universal Periodical Review (UPR) mechanism of the Human Rights Council is a fundamental tool to measure the extent to which each State has fulfilled its human rights obligations and commitments. The UPR is to look at best practices but also at challenges and obstacles that a State might face, based on information provided by the State concerned; reports of Treaty bodies, special procedures, and other United Nations documents deemed relevant by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights; and information from other relevant stakeholders, including non- governmental organizations and NHRIs. V Vienna Declaration and Platform for Action Consensus document arising from the 1993 United Nations Conference on Human Rights in Vienna; states that human rights are universal, indivisible, interconnected and interrelated; affirms that the human rights of women are an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of universal human rights; recognizes violence against women as a human rights violation. It also underlined the need for assisting States in the task of building and strengthening national institutions and legal systems in the field of human rights. Violence against women Any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or private life. Violence against women includes, but is not be limited to, the following: a) Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family, including battering, sexual abuse of female children in the household, dowry-related violence, marital rape, female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women, and non- spousal violence related to exploitation; b) Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring within the general community, including rape, sexual abuse, sexual harassment and intimidation at work, in educational institutions and elsewhere, trafficking in women and forced prostitution; c) Physical, sexual and psychological violence perpetrated or condoned by the State, wherever it occurs. W Women\u2019s \u201cBill of Rights\u201d or Convention See Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Women\u2019s Human Rights Political strategy to underscore that women\u2019s rights are human rights, i.e. rights to which women are entitled simply for being human. This strategy adds both a focus on women into the human rights movement and an emphasis on human rights principles into the women\u2019s rights movement; the main international document stating women\u2019s human rights is the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.

Women\u2019s rights are conceptualized as human rights and a \u201cnon- discrimination\u201d model is adopted, so that women\u2019s rights are seen to be violated if women are denied the same rights as men. The Convention was adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 18 December 1979. It entered into force on 3 September 1981. As of February 15, 2008, 185 States have become parties to the Convention. The Convention has one Optional Protocol. As of November 27, 2007, 90 States are signatories to the Optional Protocol. The preamble recalls that the elimination of discrimination against women and the promotion of equality between women and men are central principles of the United Nations Charter and constitute binding obligation under it. It further states that discrimination against women violates the principles of equality and obstructs women\u2019s participation, on equal terms with men, in the political, social, economic and cultural life of their countries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e0eceb7a-d198-4f34-888f-ef81de60f54e": {"__data__": {"id_": "e0eceb7a-d198-4f34-888f-ef81de60f54e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0dcabc69a7b61c78aecc1245463b259dee0ea895ab4e6e5f9444e6f76407ee9f"}, "2": {"node_id": "4aea9100-5598-45f5-a333-0c9b70ad213d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d7d6eb9e1f7b35bacb20984764ceaec5f251dcbd758c9f57e56b3d6a64744170"}}, "hash": "d8082fa701a567f5ce269544ffbebfb2dbedd2209ec9c4aca668490623827df1", "text": "Monitoring Mechanism Article 17 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women establishes the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to oversee the implementation of its provisions.

These reports are for consideration by the Committee. The Committee has developed two sets of general guidelines for reporting in an effort to provide practical technical assistance to States parties. Provisions The provisions of the Convention are divided in to six parts. The first four deal with substantive rights. Part I Articles 1- 6 include the definition of discrimination against women. In addition, they also include legal, administrative and other measures that should be taken by State parties under the Convention. Part II Articles 7 - 9 contain obligations of States regarding the protection of women\u2019s rights in political and public life. Appendices Equitas 211 Appendices Part III Articles 10 -14 contain provisions regarding elimination of discrimination against women in the field of education, employment, health, and economic, social and cultural life. This part also includes obligation of States regarding special problems of rural women. Part IV Articles 15 -16 contains provisions regarding affording equality of women with men before the law, in the exercise of their legal rights, and in marriage and family law. Part V Articles 17 - 22 deals with the establishment of a Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to monitor the progress of the implementation of the Convention by State parties. Part VI Articles 23 - 30 deals with other procedural issues including provision for making reservation while ratifying or acceding to the Convention. ARTICLE 1: Definition of Discrimination against Women Article 1 defines what constitutes \u201cdiscrimination against women\u201d. The Convention defines discrimination against women broadly. Under the Convention any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of hampering the enjoyment by women of their human rights. The rights enshrined in the Convention applies to all women, irrespective of their marital status. It prohibits discrimination in \u201cpolitical, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other\u201d fields. More important, it covers discrimination in public and private (\u201cor any other\u201d) actions. The Convention prohibits intentional and unintentional discrimination. ARTICLE 2: Obligations of State Parties to the Convention This article requires that State parties take appropriate constitutional, legal and administrative measures to guarantee equality. They also have an obligation to provide remedies and sanctions for public and private acts of discrimination and to repeal discriminatory laws. The States parties must take measures to eliminate practices that either risks threatening or actually threatens the enjoyments of the rights contained in the Convention. ARTICLE 3: Obligation to Take Measures for Ensuring Equality between Men and Women Article 3 provides for equality between men and women which is a precondition for women\u2019s full enjoyment of human rights. The obligations of States parties include development of appropriate programmes and measures to advance the status of women so that they can enjoy human rights on a basis of equality with men. ARTICLE 4: Obligation to Take Positive Measures Article 4 recognizes that State parties besides removing discriminatory practices should also take positive action to promote equality. Thus, it acknowledges that to ensure de facto equality, it may be necessary to take measures that discriminate in a positive way. The article also specifies that the adoption of special measures aiming at the protection of maternity shall not be considered discriminatory. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 212 Appendices The Committee in its General Recommendation No.5 stated that States parties make more use of temporary special measures such as \u201cpositive action, preferential treatment or quota systems to advance women\u2019s integration into education, economy, politics and employment.\u201d ARTICLE 5: Obligation to Take Measures for Elimination of Prejudices and Stereotyping of Sex Roles The purpose of article 5 is to ensure that States parties take steps to modify social and cultural patterns of conduct elimination of prejudices based on the inferiority or superiority of either of the sexes and stereotyping of sex roles. Article 5(b) recognizes that maternity has a social function. It states that men and women have a common responsibility in the upbringing of their children. The interest of the child should be fundamental in all actions taken by parents. The Committee in its General Recommendation No. 3 stated that \u201cThe Committee based on the reports submitted by State parties has stated that the reports show existence of varying degrees of stereotyped conceptions of women.\u201d The Committee has urged \u201call States parties effectively to adopt education and public information programmes, which will help eliminate prejudices and current practices that hinder", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ea992b03-3467-4018-b422-3b4af3cd8ac5": {"__data__": {"id_": "ea992b03-3467-4018-b422-3b4af3cd8ac5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9dbadc63ede0410d82eff601ab4fc50331f7f496ff65bd69c7ee7febf15b1f7b"}}, "hash": "9dbadc63ede0410d82eff601ab4fc50331f7f496ff65bd69c7ee7febf15b1f7b", "text": "the full operation of principle of the social equality of women.\u201d ARTICLE 6: Suppression of All Forms of Trafficking and Exploitation of Women This article obligates State parties to take measures to suppress all forms of trafficking in women. It also calls action against those who profit from the exploitation of women, including the exploitation of girls. The Committee in its General Recommendation No. 19 dealing with violence against women has stated that poverty and unemployment increase opportunities for trafficking in women. The Committee has also stated that, \u201cin addition to established forms of trafficking there are new forms of sexual exploitation, such as sex tourism, the recruitment of domestic labour from developing countries to work in developed countries, and organized marriages between women from developing countries and foreign nationals. These practices are incompatible with the equal enjoyment of rights by women and with respect for their rights and dignity.\u201d Optional Protocol Under the Optional Protocol to the Convention, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women is authorized to receive complaints from individuals claiming to be victims of violations of rights contained in the Convention. The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women includes the following communication and inquiry procedures. The Communications Procedure Gives individuals and groups of women the right to complain to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women about violations of the Convention. This procedure is known as \u201cthe communications procedure.\u201d United Nations communications procedures provide the right to petition or the right to complain about violations of rights. Under all procedures, the complaint must be in writing. Appendices Equitas 213 Appendices The Inquiry Procedure It enables the Committee to conduct inquiries into grave or systematic abuse of women\u2019s human rights in countries that have become party to the Optional Protocol. Known as an inquiry procedure, this capacity is found in article 8 of the Optional Protocol. The optional protocol includes an inquiry procedure, as well as a complaints procedure. An inquiry procedure enables the Committee to conduct inquiries into serious and systematic abuses of women\u2019s human rights in countries that become States parties to the Optional Protocol. It is modelled on an existing human rights inquiry procedure, article 20 of the International Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.

Appendices Equitas 229 Appendices Appendix 4.4 Summary of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights Overview The Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) was adopted by UN General Assembly on December 16, 1966 and entered into force on January 3, 1976. As of April 18, 2008, 158 States have become parties to the Covenant (5 States are remaining signatories). Unlike civil and political rights, economic, social and cultural rights are often viewed with \u201csuspicion, caution and skepticism,\u201d and at times even \u201ctreated with an air of triviality.\u201d In the human rights field, economic, social and cultural rights are most often accorded secondary status by governments and NGOs. However, the economic, social and cultural rights are an indivisible part of human rights. First, ESC rights have intrinsic value. They create the condition for enhancing a person\u2019s capability by eradicating deprivation. They expand the freedom to lead a life that we value. The potentialities of the human person may be expressed through civil and political rights but the unfolding of these potentialities requires adequate social and economic circumstances. The concept of human dignity is the foundation for civil and political and economic, social and cultural rights. These rights can neither be given nor taken away. Human dignity is denied when civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights are not guaranteed. Two common elements mediate both sets of rights - security and equality. Security of the person includes socio- economic security and equality before law encompasses equality of opportunities. The development of international human rights law has shown the indivisibility of the civil, political and economic, social and cultural rights. For example, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discriminations against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child incorporate protection of both sets of rights. Violations of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights The notion of violation applied vigorously to civil and political rights is normally not used regarding economic, social and cultural rights. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has developed the concept of \u201cminimum core obligations.\u201d The Committee developed this concept mainly to refute the argument that lack of resources hinders fulfillment of obligations. The Committee has stated that every State has a minimum core obligation to satisfy minimum essential levels of each of the right of the Covenant. The Committee has clarified that a State party \u201cin which any significant number of individuals is deprived of essential foodstuffs, of essential primary health care, of basic shelter and housing, or of the most basic forms of education is prima facie, failing to discharge its obligations under the Covenant.\u201d Thus, it can be construed that failure to fulfill minimum core obligations will be a violation of the rights enshrined in the Covenant. However, the notion of violation of economic, social and cultural rights needs to be further developed. A group of distinguished experts in international law have developed principles known as the Limburg Principles. These principles provide some basic framework to develop the notion of violation of economic, social and cultural rights. According to the Limburg Principles, \u201cA failure by a State party to comply with an obligation contained in the Covenant is, under international law, a violation of the Covenant.\u201d Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 230 Appendices In determining what amounts to a failure to comply, it must be borne in mind that the Covenant affords to a State party a margin of discretion in selecting the means for carrying out its objects, and that factors beyond its reasonable control may adversely affect its capacity to implement particular rights. A State party will be in violation of the Covenant, inter alia, if: \ufffd It fails to take a step which it is required to take by the Covenant \ufffd It fails to remove promptly obstacles which it is under a duty to remove to permit the immediate fulfillment of a right \ufffd It fails to implement without delay a right", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2df7abbe-f05b-447a-be0e-ffaa6937dae1": {"__data__": {"id_": "2df7abbe-f05b-447a-be0e-ffaa6937dae1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3d66e7480c38b3734e824339af7a09421574179abbebbfb2c55d890a03017b9f"}}, "hash": "3d66e7480c38b3734e824339af7a09421574179abbebbfb2c55d890a03017b9f", "text": "which it is required by the Covenant to provide immediately \ufffd It wilfully fails to meet a generally accepted international minimum standard of achievement, which is within its powers to meet \ufffd It applies a limitation to a right recognized in the Covenant other than in accordance with the Covenant \ufffd It deliberately retards or halts the progressive realization of a right, unless it is acting within a limitation permitted by the Covenant or it does so due to a lack of available resources or force majeur \ufffd It fails to submit reports as required under the Covenant Monitoring Mechanism The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights was established in 1985 and is comprised of 18 members who are independent and serve in their personal capacity, not as representatives of Governments. The primary function of the Committee is to monitor the implementation of the Covenant by States parties. Under articles 16 and 17 of the Covenant, States parties undertake to submit periodic reports to the Committee-within two years of the entry into force of the Covenant for a particular State party, and thereafter once every five years-outlining the legislative, judicial, policy and other measures which they have taken to ensure the enjoyment of the rights contained in the Covenant. States parties are also requested to provide detailed data on the degree to which the rights are implemented and areas where particular difficulties have been faced in this respect. The Committee has assisted the reporting process by providing States parties with a detailed 22-page set of reporting guidelines specifying the types of information the Committee requires in order to monitor compliance with the Covenant effectively (available at the UN\u2019s web site: www.unhchr.ch). The Committee can also assist Governments in fulfilling their obligations under the Covenant by issuing specific legislative, policy and other suggestions and recommendations such that economic, social and cultural rights are more effectively secured. The Committee decided in 1988 to prepare \u201cGeneral Comments\u201d on the rights and provisions contained in the Covenant with a view to assisting States parties in fulfilling their reporting obligations and to provide greater interpretative clarity as to the intent, meaning and content of the Covenant. The General Comments can be found on the UN\u2019s web site (www.unhchr.ch). Appendices Equitas 231 Appendices The Committee was the first treaty body to provide NGOs with the opportunity to submit written statements and make oral submissions dealing with issues relating to the enjoyment or non- enjoyment of the rights contained in the ICESCR in specific countries. Provisions Articles 2(2) and 3: Non-discrimination Article 2 (2) and Article 3 deal with the non-discrimination aspect. Article 2 (2) is similar to other instruments in stating that the rights should be enjoyed without discrimination on the grounds of \u201crace, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.\u201d Article 3, on the other hand is more specific. It provides for the \u201cequal right of men and women to the enjoyment of rights\u2026set forth in the Covenant.\u201d The concept of 'progressive realization' is not applicable to the non-discrimination clause and the obligation to ensure equal rights of men and women. The obligation is to ensure it immediately and not progressively. The obligation to ensure the equal rights of men and women includes affirmative action to eliminate conditions that contribute to discrimination. The Committee has followed the practice that discrimination is not restricted to those grounds identified under the Covenant and includes discrimination based on age, health status, or disability. The non-discriminatory clause of the Covenant covers discriminatory acts of both public authorities and private individuals. Article 4: Limitations Article 4, of the Covenant deals with the limitation clause. The ICESCR does not recognize any particular right to be non-derogable in the manner it is done under the ICCPR. However, Article 4, states that limitations imposed on the enjoyment of rights should be \u201cdetermined by law\u201d and should be done solely for the purpose of \u201cpromoting the general welfare in a democratic society.\u201d Article 2 (1): Obligation of States Article 2 (1) of the Covenant deals with the obligation of States parties under the Covenant. According to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, \u201cArticle 2 is of particular importance to a full understanding of the Covenant and must be seen as having a dynamic relationship with all of the other provisions of the Covenant. It describes the nature of the general legal obligations undertaken by States parties to the Covenant.\u201d Article 2 (1) of the Covenant states that, \u201cEach State party to the present Covenant undertakes to take steps, individually", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "307e8d3a-f000-4885-a2f8-8a29a7215975": {"__data__": {"id_": "307e8d3a-f000-4885-a2f8-8a29a7215975", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "42bac023c180f6672033023ba888ffbc209543e98c23a38cf9f7e8f5cdf7b7c1"}, "3": {"node_id": "4e3402c0-3a41-47d4-8148-4885b5240258", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fe63cbe0bfc41482af4f6c5b0dc3267d59ddcc2d5bd4bd29a536c7ed8e4ffa09"}}, "hash": "b13c2872512705dc7d4553cef1d5ba4b9840bd50af61a024c86431140e9158d8", "text": "and through international assistance and co - operation, especially economic and technical, to the maximum of available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights recognized in the present Covenant by all appropriate means, including particularly the adoption of legislative measures.\u201d Thus, obligations of States parties are expressed through the use of terms \u201cundertakes to take steps,\u201d \u201cto the maximum available resources,\u201d \u201c achieving progressively the full realization,\u201d and \u201cby all appropriate means including particularly the adoption of legislative measures.\u201d Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 232 Appendices In contrast, these terms are not used in the civil and political rights Covenant. The Article 2 (1) of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states that, \u201cEach State Party to the present Covenant undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals\u2026 the rights recognized in the present Covenant\u2026.\u201d It is normally argued that the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights does not belong to the same genre as that of the civil and political rights. Hence, it is important to understand the meaning of terms used in Article 2(1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) to comprehend the obligations under the Covenant. Obligation of Conduct and Obligation of Result The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has made it clear that the obligations of States parties include both obligation of conduct and obligation of result. The International Law Commission has formulated these two categories and the Committee has referred to it to elaborate on the obligations of States parties under the Covenant. Obligation of conduct means that, a State has to undertake a specific step. For example, prohibiting forced labour is an act of conduct. Obligation of result means attaining a particular outcome through active implementation of policies and programs. However, conduct and result cannot be separated. The concept of obligation of conduct and result provides an effective tool for monitoring the implementation of economic, social and cultural rights. It also shows that realization of economic, social and cultural rights is a dynamic process involving both immediate and long-term intervention. Meaning of \u201cUndertakes to Take Steps\u201d The use of the term \u201cEach State Party . . . undertakes to take steps,\u201d in Article 2 (1) of the ICESCR is normally construed as implying progressive implementation of the Covenant. However, it should be noted that a similar term is used in Article 2 (2) of the ICCPR and in Article 2 (1) of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Thus, the term cannot be construed to imply progressive implementation. In fact, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has clarified that, \u201cwhile the full realization of the relevant rights may be achieved progressively, steps towards that goal must be taken within a reasonably short time after the Covenant\u2019s entry into force for the States concerned. Such steps should be deliberate, concrete and targeted as clearly as possible towards meeting the obligations recognized in the Covenant.\u201d Meaning of \u201cBy All Appropriate Means, Including Particularly the Adoption of Legislative Measures\u201d The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has recognized that States must decide the appropriate means and it may depend on the right that is being implemented. However, the Committee has stated that, \u201cStates parties reports should indicate not only the measures that have been taken but also the basis on which they are considered to be the most \u2018appropriate\u2019 under the circumstances.\u201d It is clear from the interpretation given by the Committee that the term \u201call appropriate means\u201d is linked to both conduct and result. A State party cannot avoid its obligations by merely saying that its policies are aimed at economic development and poverty or illiteracy will be eradicated eventually. As for the term \u201cadoption of legislative measures,\u201d the Committee has stated that it by no means exhausts the obligation of State parties.

On the other hand, the Committee has stated that, \u201cThe fact that realization over time, or in other words progressively, is foreseen under the Covenant should not be misinterpreted as depriving the obligation of all meaningful content. It is on the one hand a necessary flexibility device, reflecting the realities of the real world and the difficulties involved for any country in ensuring full realization of economic, social and cultural rights. On the other hand, the phrase must be read in the light of the overall objective, indeed the raison d\u2019\u00eatre, of the Covenant that is to establish clear obligations for States parties in respect of the full realization of the rights in question. It thus imposes an obligation to move as expeditiously and effectively as possible towards that goal.\u201d The Committee has made it clear that \u201cprogressive realization\u201d is not an escape clause. Such an interpretation provides activists an important conceptual perspective against the notion of \u201cgradualism\u201d in economic policies. It means that ensuring social welfare is a gradual long - term process where the growth of the economy will percolate to everyone However, most often growth becomes an end in itself whether it is socially desirable or not. The position of the Committee seems to be that the process of economic growth should be combined with the realization of human rights. The Committee has also concluded that \u201cprogressive realization\u201d includes not only continuous improvement but also the obligation to ensure that there are no regressive developments. The Committee has stated that, \u201cany deliberately retrogressive measures . . . would require the most careful consideration and would need to be fully justified b, reference to the totality of the rights provided for in the Covenant and in the context of the full use of the maximum of available resources.\u201d Meaning of \u201cTo the Maximum of Its Available Resources\u201d The notion that economic resources are essential for the implementation of economic, social and cultural rights has been the major justification for considering it secondary to civil and political rights. The Committee has acknowledged the importance of resources in fulfilling the rights but does not consider that resource availability as an escape clause. For example, it has stated that \u201cin cases where significant numbers of people live in poverty and hunger, it is for the State to show that its failure to provide for the persons concerned was beyond its control.\u201d The Committee developed the idea of \u201cminimum core obligations\u201d to refute the argument that lack of resources hinders fulfillment of obligations. The Committee has observed that every State has a minimum core obligation to satisfy minimum essential levels of each of the right of the Covenant. It has clarified that a State party \u201cin which a significant number of individuals is deprived of essential foodstuffs, of essential primary health care, of basic shelter and housing, or of the most basic forms of education is prima facie, failing to discharge its obligations under the Covenant.... In order for a Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 234 Appendices State party to be able to attribute its failure to meet at least its minimum core obligations to a lack of available resources it must demonstrate that every effort has been made to use all resources that are at its disposition in an effort to satisfy, as a matter of priority, those minimum obligations.\u201d The Committee has made it clear that, \u201ceven where the available resources are demonstrably inadequate, the obligations remain for a State party to ensure the widest possible enjoyment of the relevant rights under the prevailing circumstances.\u201d In addition, the Committee has also stated that, \u201ceven in times of severe resource constraints . . . vulnerable members of society can and indeed must be protected by the adoption of relatively low-cost targeted programs.\u201d Optional Protocol The Optional Protocol to the ICESCR was approved by the United Nations Human Rights Council on June 18, 2008 .

In recent years there has been a proliferation of these institutions and the trend has been strongly encouraged by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has established a major programme to assist and encourage States in relation to national institutions. 2. These institutions range from national human rights commissions through Ombudsman offices, public interest or other human rights \u201cadvocates\u201d, to defenseurs du peuple and defensores del pueblo. In many cases, the institution has been established by the Government, enjoys an important degree of autonomy from the executive and the legislature, takes full account of international human rights standards which are applicable to the country concerned, and is mandated to perform various activities designed to promote and protect human rights. Such institutions have been established in States with widely differing legal cultures and regardless of their economic situation. 3. The Committee notes that national institutions have a potentially crucial role to play in promoting and ensuring the indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights. Unfortunately, this role has too often either not been accorded to the institution or has been neglected or given a low priority by it. It is therefore essential that full attention be given to economic, social and cultural rights in all of the relevant activities of these institutions. The following list is indicative of the types of activities that can be, and in some instances already have been, undertaken by national institutions in relation to these rights: (a) The promotion of educational and information programmes designed to enhance awareness and understanding of economic, social and cultural rights, both within the population at large and among particular groups such as the public service, the judiciary, the private sector and the labour movement; (b) The scrutinizing of existing laws and administrative acts, as well as draft bills and other proposals, to ensure that they are consistent with the requirements of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; (c) Providing technical advice, or undertaking surveys in relation to economic, social and cultural rights, including at the request of the public authorities or other appropriate agencies; (d) The identification of national level benchmarks against which the realization of Covenant obligations can be measured; (e) Conducting research and inquiries designed to ascertain the extent to which particular economic, social and cultural rights are being realized, either within the State as a whole or in areas or in relation to communities of particular vulnerability; (f) Monitoring compliance with specific rights recognized under the Covenant and providing reports thereon to the public authorities and civil society; and Appendices Equitas 245 Appendices (g) Examining complaints alleging infringements of applicable economic, social and cultural rights standards within the State. 4. The Committee calls upon States parties to ensure that the mandates accorded to all national human rights institutions include appropriate attention to economic, social and cultural rights and requests States parties to include details of both the mandates and the principal relevant activities of such institutions in their reports submitted to the Committee. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 246 Appendices Appendix 4.7 General Comment No. 16 (2005) \u2013 The Equal Right of Men and Women to the Enjoyment of All Economic, Social and Cultural Rights Introduction 1. The equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of all human rights is one of the fundamental principles recognized under international law and enshrined in the main international human rights instruments. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) protects human rights that are fundamental to the dignity of every person. In particular, article 3 of this Covenant provides for the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of the rights it articulates. This provision is founded on Article 1, paragraph 3, of the United Nations Charter and article 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Except for the reference to ICESCR, it is identical to article 3 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which was drafted at the same time. 2. The travaux pr\u00e9paratoires state that article 3 was included in the Covenant, as well as in ICCPR, to indicate that beyond a prohibition of discrimination, \u201cthe same rights should be expressly recognized for men and women on an equal footing and suitable measures should be taken to ensure that", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3c197d2b-2596-4596-b7a7-c765d465b7b3": {"__data__": {"id_": "3c197d2b-2596-4596-b7a7-c765d465b7b3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "affea904e0898523a48fa9c0cd933a6e9c54a7a67c013672e2ff412c4a7cb0f7"}}, "hash": "affea904e0898523a48fa9c0cd933a6e9c54a7a67c013672e2ff412c4a7cb0f7", "text": "women had the opportunity to exercise their rights \u2026. Moreover, even if article 3 overlapped with article 2, paragraph 2, it was still necessary to reaffirm the equality rights between men and women. That fundamental principle, which was enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, must be constantly emphasized, especially as there were still many prejudices preventing its full application\u201d.1 Unlike article 26 of ICCPR, articles 3 and 2, paragraph 2, of ICESCR are not stand-alone provisions, but should be read in conjunction with each specific right guaranteed under part III of the Covenant. 3. Article 2, paragraph 2, of ICESCR provides for a guarantee of non-discrimination on the basis of sex among other grounds. This provision, and the guarantee of equal enjoyment of rights by men and women in article 3, are integrally related and mutually reinforcing. Moreover, the elimination of discrimination is fundamental to the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights on a basis of equality. 4. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) has taken particular note of factors negatively affecting the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights in many of its general comments, including those on the right to adequate housing,2 the right to adequate food,3 the right to education,4 the right to the highest attainable standard of health,5 and the right to water.6 The Committee also routinely requests information on the equal enjoyment by men and women of the rights guaranteed under the Covenant in its list of issues in relation to States parties\u2019 reports and during its dialogue with States parties. 5. Women are often denied equal enjoyment of their human rights, in particular by virtue of the lesser status ascribed to them by tradition and custom, or as a result of overt or covert discrimination. Many women experience distinct forms of discrimination due to the intersection of sex with such factors as race, colour, language, religion, political and other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, or other status, such as age, ethnicity, disability, marital, refugee or migrant status, resulting in compounded disadvantage.7 Appendices Equitas 247 Appendices I. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK A. Equality 6. The essence of article 3 of ICESCR is that the rights set forth in the Covenant are to be enjoyed by men and women on a basis of equality, a concept that carries substantive meaning. While expressions of formal equality may be found in constitutional provisions, legislation and policies of Governments, article 3 also mandates the equal enjoyment of the rights in the Covenant for men and women in practice. 7. The enjoyment of human rights on the basis of equality between men and women must be understood comprehensively. Guarantees of non-discrimination and equality in international human rights treaties mandate both de facto and de jure equality. De jure (or formal) equality and de facto (or substantive) equality are different but interconnected concepts. Formal equality assumes that equality is achieved if a law or policy treats men and women in a neutral manner. Substantive equality is concerned, in addition, with the effects of laws, policies and practices and with ensuring that they do not maintain, but rather alleviate, the inherent disadvantage that particular groups experience. 8. Substantive equality for men and women will not be achieved simply through the enactment of laws or the adoption of policies that are, prima facie, gender-neutral. In implementing article 3, States parties should take into account that such laws, policies and practice can fail to address or even perpetuate inequality between men and women because they do not take account of existing economic, social and cultural inequalities, particularly those experienced by women. 9. According to article 3, States parties must respect the principle of equality in and before the law. The principle of equality in the law must be respected by the legislature when adopting laws, by ensuring that those laws further equal enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights by men and women. The principle of equality before the law must be respected by administrative agencies, and courts and tribunals, and implies that those authorities must apply the law equally to men and women. B. Non-discrimination 10. The principle of non-discrimination is the corollary of the principle of equality. Subject to what is stated in paragraph 15 below on temporary special measures, it prohibits differential treatment of a person or group of persons based on his/her or their particular status or situation, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political and other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, or other status, such as age, ethnicity, disability, marital,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "94b89bcb-bada-4d23-b8ff-85cfc048e333": {"__data__": {"id_": "94b89bcb-bada-4d23-b8ff-85cfc048e333", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0749e524c74d8b23f5ee8b4d42ea899e9c76fcdefa9c348323fbe4df58e16b99"}}, "hash": "0749e524c74d8b23f5ee8b4d42ea899e9c76fcdefa9c348323fbe4df58e16b99", "text": "refugee or migrant status. 11. Discrimination against women is \u201cany distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field.\u201d8 Discrimination on the basis of sex may be based on the differential treatment of women because of their biology, such as refusal to hire women because they could become pregnant; or stereotypical assumptions, such as tracking women into low-level jobs on the assumption that they are unwilling to commit as much time to their work as men. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 248 Appendices 12. Direct discrimination occurs when a difference in treatment relies directly and explicitly on distinctions based exclusively on sex and characteristics of men or of women, which cannot be justified objectively. 13. Indirect discrimination occurs when a law, policy or programme does not appear to be discriminatory, but has a discriminatory effect when implemented. This can occur, for example, when women are disadvantaged compared to men with respect to the enjoyment of a particular opportunity or benefit due to pre-existing inequalities. Applying a gender-neutral law may leave the existing inequality in place, or exacerbate it. 14. Gender affects the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of their rights. Gender refers to cultural expectations and assumptions about the behaviour, attitudes, personality traits, and physical and intellectual capacities of men and women, based solely on their identity as men or women. Gender-based assumptions and expectations generally place women at a disadvantage with respect to substantive enjoyment of rights, such as freedom to act and to be recognized as autonomous, fully capable adults, to participate fully in economic, social and political development, and to make decisions concerning their circumstances and conditions. Gender-based assumptions about economic, social and cultural roles preclude the sharing of responsibility between men and women in all spheres that is necessary to equality. C. Temporary special measures 15. The principles of equality and non-discrimination, by themselves, are not always sufficient to guarantee true equality. Temporary special measures may sometimes be needed in order to bring disadvantaged or marginalized persons or groups of persons to the same substantive level as others. Temporary special measures aim at realizing not only de jure or formal equality, but also de facto or substantive equality for men and women. However, the application of the principle of equality will sometimes require that States parties take measures in favour of women in order to attenuate or suppress conditions that perpetuate discrimination. As long as these measures are necessary to redress de facto discrimination and are terminated when de facto equality is achieved, such differentiation is legitimate.9 II. STATES PARTIES\u2019 OBLIGATIONS A. General legal obligations 16. The equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights is a mandatory and immediate obligation of States parties.10 17. The equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights, like all human rights, imposes three levels of obligations on States parties - the obligation to respect, to protect and to fulfill. The obligation to fulfill further contains duties to provide, promote and facilitate.11 Article 3 sets a non-derogable standard for compliance with the obligations of States parties as set out in articles 6 through 15 of ICESCR. B. Specific legal obligations 1. Obligation to respect 18. The obligation to respect requires States parties to refrain from discriminatory actions that directly or indirectly result in the denial of the equal right of men and women to their enjoyment of Appendices Equitas 249 Appendices economic, social and cultural rights. Respecting the right obliges States parties not to adopt, and to repeal laws and rescind, policies, administrative measures and programmes that do not conform with the right protected by article 3. In particular, it is incumbent upon States parties to take into account the effect of apparently gender-neutral laws, policies and programs and to consider whether they could result in a negative impact on the ability of men and women to enjoy their human rights on a basis of equality. 2. Obligation to protect 19.

States parties\u2019 obligation to protect under article 3 of ICESCR includes, inter alia, the respect and adoption of constitutional and legislative provisions on the equal right of men and women to enjoy all human rights and the prohibition of discrimination of any kind; the adoption of legislation to eliminate discrimination and to prevent third parties from interfering directly or indirectly with the enjoyment of this right; the adoption of administrative measures and programs, as well as the establishment of public institutions, agencies and programs to protect women against discrimination. 20. States parties have an obligation to monitor and regulate the conduct of non-State actors to ensure that they do not violate the equal right of men and women to enjoy economic, social and cultural rights. This obligation applies, for example, in cases where public services have been partially or fully privatized. 3. Obligation to fulfill 21. The obligation to fulfill requires States parties to take steps to ensure that in practice, men and women enjoy their economic, social and cultural rights on a basis of equality. Such steps should include: \ufffd To make available and accessible appropriate remedies, such as compensation, reparation, restitution, rehabilitation, guarantees of non-repetition, declarations, public apologies, educational programmes and prevention programmes \ufffd To establish appropriate venues for redress such as courts and tribunals or administrative mechanisms that are accessible to all on the basis of equality, including the poorest and most disadvantaged and marginalized men and women \ufffd To develop monitoring mechanisms to ensure that the implementation of laws and policies aimed at promoting the equal enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights by men and women do not have unintended adverse effects on disadvantaged or marginalized individuals or groups, particularly women and girls \ufffd To design and implement policies and programmes to give long-term effect to the economic, social and cultural rights of both men and women on the basis of equality. These may include the adoption of temporary special measures to accelerate women\u2019s equal enjoyment of their rights, gender audits, and gender-specific allocation of resources \ufffd To conduct human rights education and training programmes for judges and public officials Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 250 Appendices \ufffd To conduct awareness-raising and training programmes on equality for workers involved in the realization of economic, social and cultural rights at the grass-roots level \ufffd To integrate, in formal and non-formal education, the principle of the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights, and to promote equal participation of men and women, boys and girls, in schools and other education programmes \ufffd To promote equal representation of men and women in public office and decision-making bodies \ufffd To promote equal participation of men and women in development planning, decision- making and in the benefits of development and all programmes related to the realization of economic, social and cultural rights C. Specific examples of States parties\u2019 obligations 22. Article 3 is a cross-cutting obligation and applies to all the rights contained in articles 6 to 15 of the Covenant. It requires addressing gender-based social and cultural prejudices, providing for equality in the allocation of resources, and promoting the sharing of responsibilities in the family, community and public life. The examples provided in the following paragraphs may be taken as guidance on the ways in which article 3 applies to other rights in the Covenant, but are not intended to be exhaustive. 23. Article 6, paragraph 1, of the Covenant requires States parties to safeguard the right of everyone to the opportunity to gain a living by work which is freely chosen or accepted and to take the necessary steps to achieve the full realization of this right. Implementing article 3, in relation to article 6, requires inter alia, that in law and in practice, men and women have equal access to jobs at all levels and all occupations and that vocational training and guidance programmes, in both the public and private sectors, provide men and women with the skills, information and knowledge necessary for them to benefit equally from the right to work. 24. Article 7 (a) of the Covenant requires States parties to recognize the right of everyone to enjoy just and favourable conditions of work and to ensure, among other things, fair wages and equal pay for work of equal value. Article 3, in relation to article 7 requires, inter alia, that the State party identify and eliminate the underlying causes of pay differentials, such as gender-biased job evaluation or the perception that productivity differences between", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "06ff1e68-db00-42c3-8807-613fb9fc2daa": {"__data__": {"id_": "06ff1e68-db00-42c3-8807-613fb9fc2daa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "69cb9fa9b5ee3cea9334304364d6f9c24b914a5764e0991220d5d6408da2cbca"}}, "hash": "69cb9fa9b5ee3cea9334304364d6f9c24b914a5764e0991220d5d6408da2cbca", "text": "men and women exist. Furthermore, the State party should monitor compliance by the private sector with national legislation on working conditions through an effectively functioning labour inspectorate. The State party should adopt legislation that prescribes equal consideration in promotion, non-wage compensation and equal opportunity and support for vocational or professional development in the workplace. Finally, the State party should reduce the constraints faced by men and women in reconciling professional and family responsibilities by promoting adequate policies for childcare and care of dependent family members. 25. Article 8, paragraph 1 (a), of the Covenant requires States parties to ensure the right of everyone to form and join trade unions of his or her choice. Article 3, in relation to article 8, requires allowing men and women to organize and join workers\u2019 associations that address their specific concerns. In this regard, particular attention should be given to domestic workers, rural women, women working in female-dominated industries and women working at home, who are often deprived of this right. Appendices Equitas 251 Appendices 26. Article 9 of the Covenant requires that States parties recognize the right of everyone to social security, including social insurance, and to equal access to social services. Implementing article 3, in relation to article 9, requires, inter alia, equalizing the compulsory retirement age for both men and women; ensuring that women receive the equal benefit of public and private pension schemes; and guaranteeing adequate maternity leave for women, paternity leave for men, and parental leave for both men and women. 27. Article 10, paragraph 1, of the Covenant requires that States parties recognize that the widest possible protection and assistance should be accorded to the family, and that marriage must be entered into with the free consent of the intending spouses. Implementing article 3, in relation to article 10, requires States parties, inter alia, to provide victims of domestic violence, who are primarily female, with access to safe housing, remedies and redress for physical, mental and emotional damage; to ensure that men and women have an equal right to choose if, whom and when to marry - in particular, the legal age of marriage for men and women should be the same, and boys and girls should be protected equally from practices that promote child marriage, marriage by proxy, or coercion; and to ensure that women have equal rights to marital property and inheritance upon their husband\u2019s death. Gender-based violence is a form of discrimination that inhibits the ability to enjoy rights and freedoms, including economic, social and cultural rights, on a basis of equality. States parties must take appropriate measures to eliminate violence against men and women and act with due diligence to prevent, investigate, mediate, punish and redress acts of violence against them by private actors. 28. Article 11 of the Covenant requires States parties to recognize the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living for him/herself and his/her family, including adequate housing (para. 1) and adequate food (para. 2). Implementing article 3, in relation to article 11, paragraph 1, requires that women have a right to own, use or otherwise control housing, land and property on an equal basis with men, and to access necessary resources to do so. Implementing article 3, in relation to article 11, paragraph 2, also requires States parties, inter alia, to ensure that women have access to or control over means of food production, and actively to address customary practices under which women are not allowed to eat until the men are fully fed, or are only allowed less nutritious food.12 29. Article 12 of the Covenant requires States parties to undertake steps towards the full realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. The implementation of article 3, in relation to article 12, requires at a minimum the removal of legal and other obstacles that prevent men and women from accessing and benefiting from health care on a basis of equality. This includes, inter alia, addressing the ways in which gender roles affect access to determinants of health, such as water and food; the removal of legal restrictions on reproductive health provisions; the prohibition of female genital mutilation; and the provision of adequate training for health-care workers to deal with women\u2019s health issues.13 30. Article 13, paragraph 1, of the Covenant requires States parties to recognize the right of everyone to education and in paragraph 2 (a) stipulates that primary education shall be compulsory and available free to all.

States parties should ensure, in particular through information and awareness-raising campaigns, that families desist from giving preferential treatment to boys when sending their children to school, and that curricula promote equality and non-discrimination. States parties must create favourable conditions to ensure the safety of children, in particular girls, on their way to and from school. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 252 Appendices 31. Article 15, paragraph 1 (a) and (b), of the Covenant require States parties to recognize the right of everyone to take part in cultural life and to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress. Implementing article 3, in relation to article 15, paragraph 1 (a) and (b), requires, inter alia, overcoming institutional barriers and other obstacles, such as those based on cultural and religious traditions, which prevent women from fully participating in cultural life, science education and scientific research, and directing resources to scientific research relating to the health and economic needs of women on an equal basis with those of men. III. IMPLEMENTATION AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL A. Policies and strategies 32. The most appropriate ways and means of implementing the right under article 3 of the Covenant will vary from one State party to another. Every State party has a margin of discretion in adopting appropriate measures in complying with its primary and immediate obligation to ensure the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of all their economic, social and cultural rights. Among other things, States parties must, integrate into national plans of action for human rights appropriate strategies to ensure the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. 33. These strategies should be based on the systematic identification of policies, programmes and activities relevant to the situation and context within the State, as derived from the normative content of article 3 of the Covenant and spelled out in relation to the levels and nature of States parties\u2019 obligations referred to in paragraphs 16 to 21 above. The strategies should give particular attention to the elimination of discrimination in the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. 34. States parties should periodically review existing legislation, policies, strategies and programmes in relation to economic, social and cultural rights, and adopt any necessary changes to ensure that they are consonant with their obligations under article 3 of the Covenant. 35. The adoption of temporary special measures may be necessary to accelerate the equal enjoyment by women of all economic, social and cultural rights and to improve the de facto position of women.14 Temporary special measures should be distinguished from permanent policies and strategies undertaken to achieve equality of men and women. 36. States parties are encouraged to adopt temporary special measures to accelerate the achievement of equality between men and women in the enjoyment of the rights under the Covenant. Such measures are not to be considered discriminatory in themselves as they are grounded in the State\u2019s obligation to eliminate disadvantage caused by past and current discriminatory laws, traditions and practices. The nature, duration and application of such measures should be designed with reference to the specific issue and context, and should be adjusted as circumstances require. The results of such measures should be monitored with a view to being discontinued when the objectives for which they are undertaken have been achieved. 37. The right of individuals and groups of individuals to participate in decision-making processes that may affect their development must be an integral component of any policy, programme or activity developed to discharge governmental obligations under article 3 of the Covenant. Appendices Equitas 253 Appendices B. Remedies and accountability 38. National policies and strategies should provide for the establishment of effective mechanisms and institutions where they do not exist, including administrative authorities, ombudsmen and other national human rights institutions, courts and tribunals. These institutions should investigate and address alleged violations relating to article 3 and provide remedies for such violations. States parties, for their part, should ensure that such remedies are effectively implemented. C. Indicators and benchmarks 39. National policies and strategies should identify appropriate indicators and benchmarks on the right to equal enjoyment by men and women of economic, social and cultural rights in order to effectively monitor the implementation by the State party of its obligations under the Covenant in this regard. Disaggregated statistics, provided within specific time frames, are necessary to measure the progressive realization of economic, social and cultural rights by men and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "931bae7b-0a75-4b44-b5ea-c7cfff0c21ad": {"__data__": {"id_": "931bae7b-0a75-4b44-b5ea-c7cfff0c21ad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7ff0368e36edde8d5f5859c16055a9889a1cbed17eb6836217e88239cc14f5f3"}, "3": {"node_id": "01bac447-743a-4218-9d60-2edca4713b28", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "95285738f9259f3edc12d8852a65d56e0d1cd50c706fb3fe28ba2095058dda49"}}, "hash": "215732498d4fbd830a337e38d69b28d77b1569ac7ddd8b6fbf6d2dded9ae7ee7", "text": "women, where appropriate. IV. VIOLATIONS 40. States parties must fulfill their immediate and primary obligation to ensure the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. 41. The principle of equality between men and women is fundamental to the enjoyment of each of the specific rights enumerated in the Covenant. Failure to ensure formal and substantive equality in the enjoyment of any of these rights constitutes a violation of that right. Elimination of de jure as well as de facto discrimination is required for the equal enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. Failure to adopt, implement and monitor effects of laws, policies and programmes to eliminate de jure and de facto discrimination with respect to each of the rights enumerated in articles 6 to 15 of the Covenant constitutes a violation of those rights. 42. Violations of the rights contained in the Covenant can occur through the direct action of, failure to act or omission by States parties, or through their institutions or agencies at the national and local levels. The adoption and undertaking of any retrogressive measures that affect the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of the all the rights set forth in the Covenant constitutes a violation of article 3.

This is a requirement of the principle of proportionality. 10 CESCR, General Comment No. 3 (1990): The nature of States parties obligations (art. 2, para. 2). 11 According to CESCR General Comment Nos. 12 and 13, the obligation to fulfill incorporates an obligation to facilitate and an obligation to provide. In the present General Comment, the obligation to fulfill also incorporates an obligation to promote the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women. 12 Other examples of obligations and possible violations of article 3 in relation to article 11 (1) and (2) are further discussed in CESCR General Comment No. 12, para. 26. 13 CESCR General Comment No. 14. paras. 18-21. 14 Reference is made in this regard to General Recommendation No. 25 on article 4, paragraph 1, of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women adopted by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), CESCR General Comment No. 13 and the Limburg Principles on the Implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.

The APTII, striving to build on its previous work and achievements in this third and current phase of its work programme (2008-2011), aspires to make a significant contribution to policy dialogues by fostering regional trade and investment regimes that are consistent with human development goals in the region. A central challenge facing policy-makers is to facilitate patterns of inclusive regional integration that enable them to address specific development priorities and goals, particularly with reference to the development needs of least developed countries (LDCs), landlocked de- veloping countries (LLDCs), and small island developing states (SIDS). The focus of APTII\u2019s current work programme, therefore, is on: 1) enhancing trade competitiveness and capacity development to formulate employment-responsive and gender-responsive trade policies; and 2) strengthening the capacity to implement pro-poor regional integration strategies, including through key regional processes and/or mechanisms. In line with this focus, APTII will publish a series of studies and discussion papers highlighting the policy implications of the multifaceted dimensions of current trade trends and patterns, as well as their human development impact in the Asia Pacific region. vi Acknowledgements This paper was prepared as part of the contribution of the Third World Network to the United Nations Development Programme\u2019s (UNDP) Asia Pacific Trade and Investment Initiative (APTII).

With the increasing global integration of developing countries into the global trading system and participation in international production networks, exchange rate man- agement has taken on an added importance. The need for stable and competitive exchange rates is further enhanced by loss of space in trade and industrial policies as a result of the multilateral commitments in the WTO. In reality, the ability of developing countries to achieve exchange rate stability has been significantly hampered by their deeper integration into international financial markets and increased openness to unstable capital flows. As the study notes, most damaging swings in capital flows have been a result of global factors beyond the control of developing countries notably by macroeconomic and financial conditions in major industrial countries. There exist no effective multilateral arrangements to discipline either policies in countries with disproportionately large impact on global financial conditions or financial markets. Developing countries have thus become increasingly vulnerable to external trade and financial shocks as a result of their greater openness. The study argues that periods of severe economic shocks and disruptions have often led to significant changes in policy and institutions such as the creation of the Bretton Woods system, initiation of a process of monetary integration in Europe and even the triggering of Asian monetary cooperation post the 1997 crisis. In a similar vein, the conditions leading up to the current financial crisis and calls and initiatives for tighter regulation of international financial markets provide an impetus strengthening the case of deeper monetary integration in East Asia including a common currency regime and eventually, a monetary union. Based on similar experiences elsewhere, the author emphasizes the rationale and the case for establishing common currency arrangements with supporting institutions and mechanisms including rules for policy coordination and adjustment, guidelines for capital account policies and regional funds and lender of last resort facilities. He has argued that the main benefit of a regional monetary integration in Asia would come from greater currency, payments and financial stability depending of course on the design of integration itself including of supporting institutions and mechanisms. It is our hope that this policy paper will prove useful to governments, UNDP country offices, research institu- tions, civil society organizations and other stakeholders in the Asia Pacific region in addressing and crafting effective responses at both national and regional levels on the critical issue of exchange rate management.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template":

reasons. First, with increased emphasis on export-led growth and the dismantling of tariff and non-tariff barriers, the role of the exchange rate in growth and development has gained added importance. Second, with rapid liberalization of the capital account in developing countries and the growing size and speed of international capital flows, the impact of exchange rate swings on economic activity has undergone a funda- mental transformation. Currency movements no longer affect economic activity simply by leading to expenditure switching between domestic and foreign goods, as as- sumed in the traditional analysis. Instead, their impact on the economy operates mainly through private balance sheets because of growing dollarization of assets and liabilities, and exchange-rate swings tend to generate windfall losses or gains, thereby exerting significant influ- ence on spending decisions and viability of firms and financial institutions. These developments have made the management of the exchange rate all the more important \u2013 and all the more difficult to control. Exchange rates are no longer de- termined as a by-product of international flow of goods and services, or trade balances, but in asset markets where expectations of future changes and risk assessments play a central role. For this reason, it has now become increas- ingly evident that the management of exchange rates would call for action to influence the demand for and supply of foreign exchange as an asset, including currency market interventions as well as market-based and direct (administrative) regulations and control over capital flows and the extent of dollarization. These measures are needed not only to stabilize the exchange rate but also to reduce the vulnerability of domestic asset markets to external financial shocks, such as those transmitted from the current global financial turmoil. This paper examines the link between the exchange rate and economic growth in developing countries. Since this operates mainly through trade, the analysis starts with a discussion of the effects of exports on capital accumulation and technical progress, followed by an analysis of the short and long-term impact of the real exchange rate on economic activity, jobs, and capi- tal accumulation. Limits to what the exchange rate can achieve on its own are discussed; and it is argued that, im- portant as it may be, exchange rate policy is no substitute for trade and industrial policy. Thus, the first section of the paper concludes that stable and competitively valued real exchange rates may be necessary, but not sufficient, for directing resources to traded-goods sectors and reap- ing the dynamic benefits associated with manufacturing exports. However, a weak currency is not always prefer- able to a strong currency because of a weaker currency\u2019s ramifications for intracountry and intercountry distribu- tion of income. These imply that, in practice, considerable judgment and discretion are required for a judicious management of the exchange rate. Maintaining stable and competitive exchange rates in most developing countries depends, inter alia, on how boom-bust cycles in capital flows are managed. An effective management should start in good times, since options are quite limited under sudden stops and reversals. Failure to prevent surges in capital inflows and unsustainable currency appreciations do not simply lead to instability in exchange rates and balance-of-payments but also to virulent financial and economic crises with durable and severe consequences for jobs, incomes, and investment. However, the task has become particularly daunting since the most damaging swings in capital flows are caused by global factors beyond the control of devel- oping countries, notably by macroeconomic and financial conditions in major industrial countries, and there are no", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ea8b686-3467-4075-afbb-a6a18bb0a718": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ea8b686-3467-4075-afbb-a6a18bb0a718", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Exchange Rate Management, Growth and Stability: National and Regional Policy Options in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f72cc6fa56fcaa3a82f29619833d262316ed6578334076063c65c26d4da27e2e"}}, "hash": "f72cc6fa56fcaa3a82f29619833d262316ed6578334076063c65c26d4da27e2e", "text": "effective multilateral arrangements to discipline either policies in countries with disproportionately large impact on global financial conditions or financial markets. Monetary policy on its own is often quite power- less in influencing capital flows so as to stabilize the exchange rate even when all available instruments are used, particularly at times of sudden shifts in market sentiments. Currency market interventions designed to absorb a surge in capital inflows to avoid appreciations and to build self-defence against sudden stops and rever- sals by accumulating reserves are second-best policies because they are costly and their impact on domestic liquidity cannot always be fully neutralized. Nor can they prevent asset market bubbles and currency and maturity mismatches in private balance sheets. Under most circumstances regulation and control over capital flows would be necessary to prevent build- up of fragility. Standard prudential rules regarding capital charges, loan-loss provisions, and reserve and liquidity requirements can be extended and applied more rigor- x ously and in a counter-cyclical fashion to foreign currency positions and transactions in the financial system with a view to reducing maturity and currency mismatches and exchange-rate related credit risks. While useful and necessary, in most developing countries such measures would not be sufficient to prevent build-up of external fragility since not all foreign investment and borrowing are intermediated by financial institutions. Rather, direct tools may need to be applied to prevent currency and maturity mismatches in private sector balance sheets. For most developing countries intermediate ex- change rate regimes provide the most viable option for combining a relatively high degree of stability with the flexibility needed for occasional adjustments in order to maintain competitive exchange rates. A successful pur- suit of such a regime calls for a judicious combination of monetary policy adjustments, currency market interven- tions, and control over capital flows. In the absence of effective global arrangements to secure international monetary stability and given the difficulties in finding unilateral solutions, regional mechanisms present themselves as viable alternatives. This is particularly true for countries with close trade and investment links as in East Asia. Despite large stocks of international reserves and strong payments positions, in- traregional and extraregional exchange rates have been highly unstable in the region. This carries not only the risk of contagion but also the seeds of conflicts, particularly when global markets are shrinking. There is a strong eco- nomic case for establishing common currency arrange- ments with supporting institutions and mechanisms, including rules for policy coordination and adjustment, guidelines for capital account policies, and regional funds and lender-of-last-resort facilities. 1 The exchange rate has become a growing focus of atten- tion in the recent policy debate in developing countries. This is due mainly to two reasons. First, with increased emphasis on export-led growth and the dismantling of tariff and non-tariff barriers, the role of the exchange rate in growth and development has gained added impor- tance. Drawing on the experience of late-industrializers in East Asia, competitive and stable exchange rates have come to be seen as a key ingredient of successful indus- trialization. Second, with rapid liberalization of the capital account in developing countries and the growing size and speed of international capital flows, the impact of ex- change rate swings on economic activity has undergone a fundamental transformation. Currency movements no longer affect economic activity simply by leading to expenditure switching between domestic and foreign goods, as assumed in the traditional analysis. Their im- pact on the economy operates mainly through private balance sheets because of growing dollarization of assets and liabilities.1 Since dollarization is almost always associ- ated with widespread currency and maturity mismatches, exchange-rate swings tend to generate windfall losses or gains, thereby exerting significant influence on spending decisions and viability of firms and financial institutions. For this reason, swings in exchange rates now tend to generate much greater variations in economic activity than in the past, when the dollarization of private balance sheets was limited. While these developments have made the man- agement of the exchange rate all the more important, they have also made its control more difficult. This is because exchange rates are no longer determined as a by-product of international flow of goods and services, or trade balances, but in asset markets where expectations of future changes and risk assessments play a central role. For this reason, it has now become increasingly evident that the management of exchange rates would call for action to influence the demand for and supply of foreign exchange as an asset, including currency market interven- tions as well as market-based and direct (administrative) regulations and control over capital flows and the extent of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7649e37c-4657-40ab-9a9b-b7f6c28d2f6f": {"__data__": {"id_": "7649e37c-4657-40ab-9a9b-b7f6c28d2f6f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Exchange Rate Management, Growth and Stability: National and Regional Policy Options in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4eb7102d88911e7890aebcf8abb7e47ab0c57e512ae1406b9d1835e4f16d218c"}}, "hash": "4eb7102d88911e7890aebcf8abb7e47ab0c57e512ae1406b9d1835e4f16d218c", "text": "dollarization. These measures are needed not only to stabilize the exchange rate but also to reduce the vulner- ability of domestic asset markets to external financial 1. Introduction shocks, such as those transmitted from the current global financial turmoil, triggered by widespread speculative lending and investment in major international financial centres. These are the issues to be taken up in this paper. The following section examines the link between the exchange rate and economic growth in developing countries. Since this operates mainly through trade, the analysis will start with a discussion of the effects of exports on capital accumulation and technical progress, followed by an analysis of the short and long-term impact of the real exchange rate on economic activity, jobs, and capital accumulation. Limits to what the exchange rate can achieve on its own are discussed, and it is argued that, important as it may be, exchange rate policy is no substitute for trade and industrial policy. Past historical experience and more recent cross-country evidence on the link between the exchange rate and economic growth are reviewed. The main conclusion of this section is that stable and competitively valued real exchange rates may be necessary, but not sufficient, for directing resources to traded-goods sectors and reaping the dynamic benefits associated with manufacturing exports. However, a weak currency is not always preferable to a strong currency be- cause of a weaker currency\u2019s ramifications for intracoun- try and intercountry distribution of income. These imply that, in practice, considerable judgment and discretion are required for a judicious management of the exchange rate. Section 3 examines the links among international capital flows, exchange rates, and the real economy. It is argued that the boom-bust cycles in capital flows due to global factors have come to dominate exchange rate movements of most developing countries, capable of generating gyrations independent of their underlying fundamentals and macroeconomic conditions. Sharp devaluations caused by sudden stops and reversals of capital flows are severely contractionary\u2014not because of supply rigidities emphasized by the structuralists in the 1970s and 1980s, but because of their impact on credit conditions and balance sheets. More importantly, these cycles tend to produce durable adverse effects on jobs and investment. Not only can losses of jobs and wages during crises exceed the gains that may have been reaped during boom periods, but recoveries from finance-driven 1 Here dollarization is used to express denomination of assets and liabilities in foreign currencies generally, not just in dollars. 2 recessions are often jobless and without a strong upturn in investment. This is followed in section 4 by an analysis of national policy options in managing exchange rates. It is argued that free floating is not a viable choice for developing countries. But under an open capital account regime, currency stability cannot be guaranteed even if monetary policy is fully assigned to this task. Monetary policy is often powerless in checking massive outflows triggered by sudden and widespread loss of confidence. At times of strong inflows currency market interventions and reserve accumulation could be reasonably effective in preventing unsustainable appreciations and current account positions, but they can also lead to credit, asset, and investment bubbles. Nor can they prevent currency and maturity mismatches in private balance sheets. Re- serves accumulated from capital flows \u2212 borrowed reserves \u2212 are highly costly because they are invested in low-yielding foreign assets. For these reasons regulation and control over capital inflows need to be an integral part of exchange rate management. Section 5 examines the post-1997 crisis experience of Asian countries in the light of the above considerations. It is shown that the region\u2019s response to the surge in capital inflows after the early years of the current decade has been to relax restrictions over resident outflows and to absorb excess supply of foreign exchange by interven- tion and reserve accumulation. While this approach has enabled countries in the region to avoid unsustainable currency appreciations and payments positions, it has not prevented rapid credit expansion or asset and investment bubbles which now render these countries vulnerable to shocks and contagion from the current global financial turmoil.

The concluding section gives a summary of the main propositions, including national and regional policy recommendations for managing exchange rates and international capital flows. 3 2.1 The export-investment nexus The role of the exchange rate in the process of economic growth derives mainly from its impact on trade, aggre- gate demand, capital accumulation, and productivity growth. However, this issue is barely addressed in the mainstream trade theory based on Ricardian comparative advantages, whereby cost differences that govern trade, specialization, and resource allocation are determined solely by differences in resource endowments or technol- ogy, and the impact of the exchange rate on trade and production is ignored.2 On the other hand, the theory of comparative advantages focuses on the allocation of existing resources and the resulting one-off static gains, leaving aside dynamic interactions among trade, ac- cumulation, and productivity growth that determine the evolution of comparative advantages over time. 3 Nor is trade properly integrated into mainstream growth theories. Both neoclassical and Keynesian growth theories are designed primarily for closed economies, without paying attention to possible impact of trade on key parameters determining the long-term growth path \u2212 that is, savings, investment and technological progress. Although there is a host of ad hoc models de- signed to show the benefits of trade for growth, there is no accepted theory where growth is rigorously linked to international trade. 4 There are supply-side and demand-side linkages between trade and growth. Neoclassical thinking em- phasizes the former. On this view, free trade improves ef- ficiency not only because of better allocation of resources based on comparative advantages (allocative efficiency) but also better use of resources (cost or X-efficiency) re- sulting from increased competitive pressures (Bhagwati 1994). However, for such one-off increases in efficiency and income to lift the growth path, they would need to translate into a permanently higher rate of investment. 2. Exchange rate, trade, and growth A more dynamic supply-side impact of trade emphasizes technical progress and productivity growth. This depends not so much on import liberalization as expansion in foreign markets. Since Adam Smith\u2019s dictum that the division of labour is limited by the extent of the market, it has been recognized that exports can provide dynamic productivity gains by reducing the dependence of production on domestic market and helping achieve economies of scale.5 These gains assume particular importance for industrialization and growth not only in small economies where the population size cannot ac- commodate optimum scale in most lines of industry but also for larger developing countries where income levels are not high enough for certain industries to become vi- able without exports. In its most rudimentary form, exports provide a vent for surplus for countries with large amounts of underutilised land and labour, allowing them to increase production of primary products for foreign markets. Fur- ther progress depends crucially on industrialization, ex- cept for very small economies that could attain a relatively high level of income by specializing in off-shore financial services and tourism or by providing trade-related ser- vices to a vast industrial hinterland, such as Hong Kong.6 This is true also for most resource-rich economies.7 There is ample evidence that rapid expansion of manufacturing production and exports is a common feature of rapidly growing developing countries (UNCTAD TDR 2003; chap. 5). With progress in industrialization, expansion in markets abroad helps firms to overcome high entry costs and to benefit from specialization and exploitation of scale economies, which can, in turn, accelerate learning- by-doing and productivity growth. These can also gener- ate a range of externalities at the industry level and posi- tive productivity-enhancing spillovers for the economy as a whole, including non-export sectors.

This is the main reason why empirical evidence on the link between exports and productivity growth and positive spillovers from exporting is not conclusive.8 While recognizing that expansion to markets abroad could provide dynamic gains, the Keynesian and Structuralist schools emphasize the demand-side linkages between exports and growth, and focus on the balance-of-payments constraint \u2212 issues that have been underplayed in the orthodox theory by virtue of its as- sumptions of balanced trade and sustained full employ- ment.9 Not only are exports a component of aggregate demand but sustained export growth is essential for growth of components of domestic demand, since most developing countries are heavily dependent on imported intermediate inputs, capital goods, energy, and food for investment, production, and consumption. In particular, the imports of capital goods and technology needed to overcome the constraint that domestic production capa- bilities places on accumulation, growth, and industrializa- tion requires generation of adequate foreign exchange through exports. The dependence on imported capital goods and technologies embodied therein is generally greater during the initial stages of development, when such industries are lacking. Indeed, in the absence of foreign borrowing, an economy without a significant capital goods industry cannot really save and invest without exporting. It would need to put aside (save) part of its current production of consumables for exports in order to be able to expand its existing production capacity or invest in new lines of production by importing the capital equipment needed.10 Despite the hype about the benefits of remov- ing barriers to imports in the mainstream literature, the trade-growth linkages are often discussed around the so- called export-led growth \u2212 a concept that is not always rigorously defined. Since sustained growth \u2212 as opposed to one-off increases in the degree of utilization of exist- ing capacity \u2212 depends on capital accumulation and productivity growth, the concept of export-led growth should imply that growth of exports, rather than domes- tic demand, is the principal driving force behind invest- ment and technological progress. However, the empirical literature on the link between growth and exports often relies on demand-side-growth-accounting based on ex- post national income identities.11 This not only ignores the supply-side effects, but also the linkages between external and domestic components of demand, notably manufactured exports and investment. This linkage can be particularly strong in economies where an important part of manufactured value-added finds outlet in foreign markets, as in most East Asian countries. It also implies that an adverse export shock could impinge on income not only by reducing the foreign component of aggregate demand but through its direct impact on investment in traded-goods sectors.12 A virtuous interaction and cumulative causation between manufactured exports and investment in the growth and industrialization process involves, in effect, both supply-side and demand-side linkages.13 Exports broaden the size of the market and thus allow scale economies to be exploited. They encourage investment over and above what can be done on the basis of domes- tic demand, and provide the foreign exchange needed for capital good imports and investment. Investment, in turn, improves export potential by adding to productive capacity and raising industrial competitiveness through productivity growth. As demonstrated by successful late industrializa- tion in East Asia, such a process of growth and industri- alization is typically characterised by rising investment, exports, and manufacturing value-added, both absolutely and as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP). In the early stages of East Asian industrialization, imports generally exceeded exports, and domestic savings fell short of investment, necessitating external financing. But over time both foreign exchange and savings gaps were closed as exports and domestic savings began to grow faster than investment. Growing profits supported by exports and investment have been the main factor be- hind rapid growth of savings. Thus, the export-investment nexus is complemented by an investment-profit nexus \u2212 a process of dynamic interaction between profits and in- vestment wherein profits are simultaneously an incentive for investment, a source of investment, and an outcome of investment (Aky\u00fcz and Gore 1996).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "756465c3-7827-424c-900c-ed96c0ef42e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "756465c3-7827-424c-900c-ed96c0ef42e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Exchange Rate Management, Growth and Stability: National and Regional Policy Options in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8f0424069bfc4deb5e510b93d93f8ee2beb825a67982e758cb92d822a71e703e"}, "2": {"node_id": "2668be94-948a-47ca-bd74-77d626e8ea8d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d13cd8fc2537f2d170314656c0ad214a13ab3ecdc6b5125fbc64c83b25f04918"}}, "hash": "7c5bc8667379b5dc75cacda545aa8cf42ef8671428b312353aed069c717498a0", "text": "By contrast, most other developing countries in Latin America and Africa have been unable to sustain a virtuous interaction among 8 See various country studies in Helleiner (1994) and the discussion in Eichengreen (2008: 17-19). 9 For a lucid analysis, see", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "19b89b9d-de84-4192-a9eb-f51cafa30e2e": {"__data__": {"id_": "19b89b9d-de84-4192-a9eb-f51cafa30e2e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Exchange Rate Management, Growth and Stability: National and Regional Policy Options in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "59e320ac4810d1e637eba840b9bbac015bdca530738320ed20aebecd6ad63528"}}, "hash": "59e320ac4810d1e637eba840b9bbac015bdca530738320ed20aebecd6ad63528", "text": "Thirlwall (2003a), who emphasizes payments constraints and develops a model combining supply and demand linkages be- tween exports and growth.

For an emphasis on the role of exports and the exchange rate as a driver of aggregate demand, see Frenkel (2008). 10 If such an economy does not export, it can save only by storing consumables, which does not add to its production capacity. This also means that in such an economy investment cannot precede savings (exports). 11 Growth is said to be led by exports if exports (or net exports) are growing faster than domestic demand, including public and private consumption and investment. For a recent attempt to quantify the contribution of exports to growth in some Asian countries, see ADB (2005). 12 On this link in China, see Aky\u00fcz (2008a). 13 The notion of a virtuous circle linked to export of manufactures is closely associated with the work of Kaldor (1989). 5 exports, investment, and savings. Although they experi- enced occasional investment booms supported by strong commodity export earnings and/or capital inflows, these could not be translated into a solid manufacturing export base and rising savings rates, with the result that these investment booms often came to an end when global trading and financial conditions deteriorated. 14 2.2 Exchange rate, employment and investment What is the role of the exchange rate in animating and sustaining a virtuous investment-export nexus and stimulating growth? Since the real exchange rate is the relative price between non-tradeable and tradeable goods, changes in the real exchange rate exert a strong influence on the distribution of resources between these two sectors.15 However, from the point of view of dynamic linkages between exports and economic growth, what matters is not the effect of the real exchange rate on the use and allocation of existing resources, but on invest- ment decisions, accumulation, and structural change. The role of the real exchange rate in the growth process runs through its effects on the relative profitability of invest- ment in sectors with significant potential for increasing returns and productivity growth. In many developing countries there are often limits to what currency changes can achieve in the short term in reallocating resources from non-traded goods towards traded goods sectors, including both exports and domes- tic substitutes for imports. In the conventional analysis these limits are formulated in terms of demand for traded goods or, more specifically, the impact of exchange rate changes on the distribution of aggregate spending be- tween domestic and foreign goods \u2212 that is, expenditure switching. According to this analysis, a devaluation of the exchange rate reduces the prices of exports for foreign buyers and increases the prices of imports in domestic markets, and these changes raise the volume of exports and lower the volume of imports, respectively. The overall effect depends on price elasticities of demand: Accord- ing to the Marshall-Lerner condition, if the sum of the elasticities of demand for exports and imports is greater than unity, the trade balance will improve. It is, however, recognized that there can be a J-curve effect; that is, the immediate impact of a devaluation on the trade balance can be adverse, because it takes time for expenditure patterns to adjust to changed relative prices. Thus, ini- tially, quantity response tends to be sluggish. Over time, however, as export volumes increase and import volumes decline, the trade balance will improve and economic activity and employment will expand. This analysis makes no reference to supply condi- tions, either for exportables or for domestic substitutes for imports. It assumes, in effect, that supply is fully flex- ible. However, supply rigidities are an inherent feature of many developing countries, as constantly pointed out by the structuralists during the 1970s and 1980s in the debate over the impact of devaluations on income and employment. The structuralist theory of contractionary devaluations was founded on the inelasticity of supply in economies where exports and the consumption basket of wage earners were supplied by the primary sector.16 On this analysis, the reduction in real wages brought about by a devaluation would reduce the demand for domestic manufactures, but increased domestic prices of exportables would fail to raise output and employ- ment in the primary sector because of supply rigidities. The increase in exports would also be limited because of low-price elasticity of domestic demand for food while imports would fall alongside declining employment in industry.17 On the other hand, higher prices of imports would not stimulate production of domestic substitutes because of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "65a7db42-669a-4292-947f-8bbe4f92c4d9": {"__data__": {"id_": "65a7db42-669a-4292-947f-8bbe4f92c4d9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Exchange Rate Management, Growth and Stability: National and Regional Policy Options in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1d639aedcb2f210d910a9ac8a169f5926538d9866986e796892942cd72308500"}, "3": {"node_id": "4ee77351-ac66-4748-8762-97576bba6783", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5816068f5d598a7c56fa49ec605dcba75ff886e33122723a15911310c2212fb1"}}, "hash": "3d3d1e06723af968f5be537dc4d236d722327c358ec172c96be7086dd6a58a2a", "text": "complementarity of imports with domestic manufactures \u2212 an outcome often attributed by the mainstream to import-substitution industrialization. In other words, devaluation would fail to switch resources from non-tradeables to tradeables and raise production for exports and import substitution. It would reduce the trade gap primarily through a contraction in economic activity. There can be little doubt that supply rigidities can arise even in more diversified exporters of manufactures. Where exports are specific to foreign markets and con- sumed little at home (such as Barbie dolls or golf clubs), there would be a limited scope for switching goods from domestic absorption to exports. This is the case for many developing country exporters of manufactured consumer goods closely linked to international production networks. 14 On a comparison of phases of investment transition, exports, and savings between sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia, see Aky\u00fcz and Gore (2001); on the weakness of the links among investment, manufacturing value-added, and exports in Latin America, see UNCTAD TDR (2003; chap. V); on weak savings from profits and the high propensity to consume of property-owning classes in Latin America, see Aky\u00fcz (2006). 15 For a succinct account of the impact of the real exchange rate on resource allocation and employment, see Frenkel and Taylor (2006). It should be noted that this theoretical notion of the real exchange rate does not have a single empirical counterpart. For alternative definitions and measurement, see Edwards (1989) and Harberger (2004). 16 For a detailed analysis of the structuralist contractionary devaluation hypothesis, see Edwards (1989; chap. 8); for a more recent account, see Keifman (2007). 17 It should be noted that exportables are not always wage goods in all commodity-dependent economies; for instance \u201cbasic food staples behave essentially as non-tradeables in much of sub-Saharan Africa\u201d (Delgado 1995: 231), while most exported primary commodities have limited domestic markets. In such a case, too, devaluations would not lead to a significant expenditure switching and release goods for exports. 6 There are also limits to reallocation of resources so as to increase the supply of exportables. Unlike in the neo-clas- sical theory of production where \u201cfactors of production\u201d can be shifted freely among different lines of production, in reality skills, capital equipment, and organizational structures are often industry-specific and even product- specific, and cannot easily be reshuffled and deployed from one sector to another as the incentive structure is altered by changes in the exchange rate. Under these conditions the immediate impact of devaluations on ex- ports and import substitution would depend largely on spare capacity in these sectors. Resources released from non-traded sectors may remain unemployed, skills may be eroded, and equipment may become obsolete until the production capacity is restructured and expanded through investment in skills and equipment according to changed incentives. Indeed, one can even talk about the supply-side J-curve effect of devaluations, whereby quantity response is delayed because existing resources cannot be rapidly redeployed to traded-goods sectors. That such supply-side rigidities can create \u201cad- justment costs\u201d in the case of changes in the incentive structure due to import liberalization is recognized in the mainstream literature even though they are almost never explicitly quantified and incorporated in estimated ben- efits from trade liberalization (Aky\u00fcz 2009). Like big-bang trade liberalization, such costs tend to be much higher and persistent when exchange rates changes are sharp and unexpected. Whether or not devaluations are contractionary in the short-term, the main conduit of a shift in relative prices to resource allocation is investment. But for real exchange rates to have a significant influence on invest- ment, they need to remain relatively stable and predict- able over time. Uncertainties created by large and un- expected swings in exchange rates and the consequent fluctuations in demand increase the risks of investment in traded goods sectors.

In no area of development policy can success be explained by the behaviour of a single variable, and this is certainly the case for the role of the exchange rate in growth and industrialization. While it is usually very diffi- cult to maintain rapid growth for an extended period un- der overvalued and unstable real exchange rates, a weak and stable currency alone is not sufficient for sustained growth. Its impact on resource allocation, investment, and productivity growth depends very much on how it is combined with a host of other factors, including trade- related industrial policy measures, notably import tariffs and export subsidies. Like the exchange rate, tariffs and subsidies can no doubt be used to shift resources to tradeable goods sectors. It has long been established that if exports are subsidized to the same extent as imports are taxed, the price ratio between exportables and importables would not be affected, but their prices will rise relative to non- tradeables, having the same effect as real devaluations.18 As industrial policy tools, however, tariffs and subsidies are useful only when they differentiate among different categories of imports and exports, respectively, and this is how they were used by successful late-industrializers in East Asia. While the exchange rate could be used to protect import-competing and export industries, it would do so uniformly.19 However, in the course of industrialization the effective use of tariffs for infant industry protection would require the coexistence of low and high tariffs. 18 See Edwards (1989: 81-82). According to orthodox view, when tariffs and subsidies differentiate among sectors they are \u201cdistortionary\u201d and harm- ful. When they are \u201cnon-distortionary\u201d they would not be needed since one can dispense with them and use the exchange rate to shift resources to tradeables; this would also have the advantage of avoiding rent-seeking behaviour associated with such interventions. 19 For exchange rate protection, see Corden (1985). 7 Since at any point in time different industries would need different degrees of infant industry protection, an effective system of tariffs tends to be highly dispersed rather than uniform. Furthermore, over time tariffs need to be raised on some products but lowered on others, and dispersion may be rising or falling according to the stage of industrial development reached (Aky\u00fcz 2009). Much the same is true for subsidies; a country should not need to subsidize exports of products in which it has static comparative advantages, but would need to do so for industries that are yet to achieve maturity and benefit from scale economies. These considerations suggest that, important as it may be in the allocation of resources between traded and non-traded goods industries and in reaping the dynamic benefits of exporting, the exchange rate policy is no substitute for trade and industrial policy interventions. However, since these instruments are no longer available to most developing countries because of their commit- ments in the World Trade Organisation (WTO), it is now absolutely essential to sustain stable and competitive real exchange rates in order to avoid payments crises and interruption to growth and development. 20 The concept of equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) is the standard reference in judging whether a currency is misaligned vis-\u00e0-vis underlying fundamen- tals. It is the rate that simultaneously secures internal and external equilibrium. Internal equilibrium refers to full employment or the attainment of potential output. External equilibrium is used synonymously with external sustainability and refers to the satisfaction of intertempo- ral budget constraint for the economy.21 Defined in this way, ERER depends on a host of factors, both external and internal, including technology and productivity, tariffs and subsidies, capital account regimes, interest rates, and world prices for traded goods. There are several and repeated attempts in the literature to operationalize this theoretical concept and to measure the extent to which currencies are misaligned. However, since there are con- siderable uncertainties over how the key determinants of the ERER would move over time, such measures are not always a reliable guide to policy-making. It has been argued that neutrality of incentives between traded and non-traded goods sectors, as advo- cated in the mainstream literature, would not be sufficient to secure their balanced growth because traded-goods sectors suffer disproportionately from institutional and market failures that pervade poor countries (Rodrik 2008). On this view, the costs entailed by these failures need to be compensated by sustained real exchange rate depre- ciations to increase the relative profitability of investment in traded-goods sectors.22 However, since in principle", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "43e60b70-0a61-4833-ac91-f44269fba4ed": {"__data__": {"id_": "43e60b70-0a61-4833-ac91-f44269fba4ed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Exchange Rate Management, Growth and Stability: National and Regional Policy Options in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "75ada21dcf84628b5e8ccdf576880e9497ba8803743bb4904bce6a982d020689"}, "3": {"node_id": "a5f4cd7b-67d3-4b5b-9ab6-db53458d7fba", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fc7a1df16de3b7031a9b76e15589404f2c12dcabe9ae8013f10135665f8040ac"}}, "hash": "6fea9717fbeaa1dc8d2cc14223bdab790423fd6656822e9fe302f5393cda4612", "text": "the ERER should allow for any distortions that impinge on productivity and costs in traded and non-traded goods sectors, this argument boils down to the proposition that the impact of institutional and market failures on costs in the traded-goods sectors is not properly accounted for in measured/estimated ERERs.23 While overvaluation is generally considered as undesirable on grounds of its negative consequences for trade, industrialization, and growth, there is much less emphasis on the problems that could be posed by a policy of weak currency. Two types of difficulties are often men- tioned, one internal, another external, and these will be discussed in some detail in the subsequent sections. On the internal side, currency interventions needed at times of large current account surpluses and/or capital inflows to prevent appreciations entail costs because reserves are invested in low-yielding foreign assets. Moreover, since it is not always possible to achieve full sterilization (that is, to offset the impact of the currency intervention on the monetary base), such a policy could also lead to domestic credit expansion, creating inflationary pressures in asset and/or products markets.24 Externally, a policy of cheap currency could create frictions with trading partners and trigger competitive devaluations or hostile trade actions. Perhaps more important from the viewpoint of social welfare is the impact of an aggressive export push through an undervalued currency on income distribution within and across countries. This raises the old issues of fallacy of composition and immiserizing growth, which have been largely sidelined in the more recent discus- sion of the link between growth and the real exchange rate. Given labour productivity, real devaluations imply 20 In Korea in the early 1980s \u201cproper management of the exchange rate was considered all the more important \u2026 since the government began to expand trade liberalization, phasing out various exports subsidies and import protection measures\u201d (Nam and Kim 1999: 235). But the very same country faced, 15 years later, the most serious balance of payments crisis and recession in its history because of its failure to manage capital flows and its currency. 21 For the external debt-income ratio not to explode, today\u2019s external liabilities should be matched by the present value of future current account sur- pluses; for a discussion, see Aky\u00fcz (2007). 22 Frenkel and Rapetti (2008) rightly ask why these failures should affect tradeable activities more than non-tradeable goods sectors. 23 Most empirical measures of misalignments are based not on the ERER, as defined above; but on purchasing power parity (PPP) deviations, often ad- justed for the Balassa-Samuelson effect, allowing for appreciations as a result of increases in productivity or per capita income. For alternative measures, see Aguirre and Calder\u00f3n (2005) and Gala (2007). As noted by Aguirre and Calder\u00f3n (2005: 3-4), a shortcoming of using PPP-based measures is that \u201cPPP only accounts for monetary sources of exchange rate fluctuations and does not capture exchange rate fluctuations attributed to real factors,\u201d of which distortions due to institutional or market failures are a part. 24 Corden (2008) focuses on reserve costs while Eichengreen (2008) emphasizes that a policy of weak currency sustained by interventions runs the risk that the currency adjustment may eventually come through a costly and financially disruptive inflation. 8 declines in real wages. To put it differently, for a nominal depreciation to produce a decline in the real exchange rate, nominal wages should lag behind traded-goods prices. If dollar prices of exports remain unchanged, profit margins in export sectors will increase \u2212 that is, real devaluations would redistribute income from wages to profits (Diaz-Alejandro 1963). Of course, if productivity increases over time, a weaker currency can be associated with rising real wages, as often happened in East Asia. But to the extent that real devaluations result in lower export prices in dollars, part of the productivity gains would be captured by consumers abroad at the expense of wages. With dollar prices of imports remaining unchanged, this would also be reflected in a decline in net barter terms of trade. This outcome depends crucially on whether or not developing country exporters are \u201cprice takers\u201d in world markets for manufactures. It is generally recog- nized that a small economy may be able to increase its exports of manufactures without putting any significant downward pressure on world (dollar) prices, but this would not be true for developing countries as a whole or for large economies such as China.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5f4cd7b-67d3-4b5b-9ab6-db53458d7fba": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5f4cd7b-67d3-4b5b-9ab6-db53458d7fba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Exchange Rate Management, Growth and Stability: National and Regional Policy Options in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "75ada21dcf84628b5e8ccdf576880e9497ba8803743bb4904bce6a982d020689"}, "2": {"node_id": "43e60b70-0a61-4833-ac91-f44269fba4ed", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6fea9717fbeaa1dc8d2cc14223bdab790423fd6656822e9fe302f5393cda4612"}}, "hash": "fc7a1df16de3b7031a9b76e15589404f2c12dcabe9ae8013f10135665f8040ac", "text": "However, even a small economy may need to lower the dollar prices of its exports if it supplies non-standard, differentiated products \u2212 which is more often the case in manufactures than in commodity exports.

Even when rising quantities more than offset the impact of the decline in prices on export earnings, and the purchasing power of exports (income terms-of-trade) improves, falling export prices and net barter terms of trade can still entail resource losses. Evidence suggests that the purchasing power of manufacturing exports of developing countries have been rising rapidly, but prices of their manufactured exports have been weakening vis-\u00e0-vis those exported by advanced industrialized countries.25 This is also true for China, the most prominent developing economy pursuing an aggressive export-led growth policy based on cheap labour and cheap cur- rency.26 An important part of the benefits of productivity growth in China is shared between profit earners, includ- ing transnational companies, and Western consumers, even though absolute living conditions of workers have been improving rapidly. Since the early years of the de- cade labour productivity in manufacturing industry has grown by some 20 percent per annum, while nominal wage increases have been under 15 percent and real wage increases even lower. The share of labour cost in total gross output in mining, manufacturing, and utilities fell from 11.5 percent in 2002 to 7.1 percent in 2006; for the economy as a whole, the share of wages in GDP fell to about 40 percent after fluctuating between 50 and 55 percent in the 1990s. While average labour productivity in China is just under 20 percent of that in the United States, Chinese manufacturing hourly wage rate is about 3 percent of that in the United States. At the same level of average industrial productivity and income, Japanese and Korean wages in dollar terms were much higher than those in China today.27 The extent to which Chinese productivity growth has been passed onto Western consumers in the form of lower export prices rather than to workers in the form of higher wages is not very clear and further research is needed. However, there is no doubt that the United States consumers are one of the main beneficiaries of productivity growth in Asian exporters of manufactures. For instance, prices of products imported from the first tier NIEs (Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong) fell by 2.4 percent per year from 1993 to 2006, compared with a 0.3 percent rise in average prices of total non-oil imports into the United States (Amiti and Stiroh 2007). Available statistics for more recent years show a similar trend for prices of imports from China, which registered a decline of 3 percent between 2003 and 2006. There was some increase in prices of products imported from China after 2006; but much of this was due, in the case of industrial supplies, to increases of prices that China paid for commodity inputs and, in the case of consumer and capital goods, to the sharp appreciation of the renminbi against the dollar, rather than domestic wage pressures (Amiti and Davis 2009). The decline in the share of wages in China is mir- rored by the decline in the share of consumption in GDP. During 2002-2007, the average growth rate of consumer spending was around 8 percent per annum, while gross fixed capital formation grew at a rate of 15 percent and exports 25 percent. Consequently, the share of consump- tion fell below 40 percent of GDP \u2212 almost half of the figure in the United States, and considerably less than the share of investment. The imbalance between the two key components of domestic demand has meant increased dependence of Chinese industry on foreign markets (Aky\u00fcz 2008a). 25 For a discussion, see UNCTAD TDR (2002: chap. IV) and Mayer (2003). 26 See Zeng and Yumin (2002) for the earlier trend in China\u2019s terms of trade, and Yu (2007) for the more recent period. 27 For productivity, wages, and profits, see Aky\u00fcz (2008a). Labour productivity figures refer to the whole economy and are taken from ILO (2007; Labour productivity and unit labour costs indicator, KILM 18). For hourly compensation in manufacturing in China in relation to those in the United States and other developing countries, see Banister (2005) and Roach (2007). 9 This experience stands in sharp contrast with that of late-industrializers in Asia, particularly Japan and Korea, where wages and household consumption grew in tandem with productivity and underpinned the expan- sion of capacity by providing a growing internal market.

This is indeed one of the conclusions reached by the Commission on Growth and Development: As with other forms of export promotion, exchange rate policies can outlive their usefulness. If the currency is suppressed by too much or for too long, it will distort the evolution of the economy by removing the natural market pressure for change. The cheap currency will tend to lock activity into labor-intensive export sectors, reduce the return to upgrading skills, and eventu- ally harm productivity as a result. Like other industrial policies, a keenly priced currency is supposed to solve a specific, transitory problem. Eventually, as an economy grows more prosperous, domestic demand should and usually does play an increasingly im- portant role in generating and sustaining growth. Exchange rate policy should not stand in the way of this natural evolution (CGD: 51). Late-industrializers in East Asia did not rely on cheap currency for industrial development. By contrast, they occasionally tolerated moderate appreciations which, in some instances, provided incentives for up- grading and productivity growth. In Taiwan, for instance, the real exchange rate was allowed to appreciate almost continuously after the late 1960s. This, together with the rise in real wages, put considerable pressure on business to remain competitive in international markets, forcing them to achieve productivity gains that made it possible for the economy to continue to be one of the fastest growing in the world (Jenkins and Kuo 1997). Finally, a rigid, immovable exchange rate can be as damaging as a highly volatile currency. Recurrent currency and balance of payments crises in emerging markets since the mid-1990s show that, under capital account liberalization, efforts to maintain a fixed nominal exchange rate can be disastrous even where monetary and fiscal disciplines are secured \u2212 often a recipe for boom-bust cycles in capital flows and exchange rates with serious repercussions for the real economy. There is now a growing consensus that a reasonable degree of flexibility is needed in order to prevent such gyrations. This consensus also extends to the real exchange rate in view of increased susceptibility of developing countries to external trade and financial shocks as a result of their greater openness. Clearly a permanent shift in the variables affecting the ERER, including terms of trade and international interest rates, would call for an adjustment in the real exchange rate in order to avoid unsustainable current account positions. Similarly, temporary trade and financial shocks may call for changes in the real exchange rate in order to prevent the burden of adjustment from falling on domestic absorption, economic activity, and employment. 2.4 Cross-country evidence Historically, real exchange rates have been more com- petitive and stable in late-industrializers in East Asia than in most other developing countries, including those in South Asia, Africa, and Latin America. This is an important, though not the only, reason why Asian NIEs were more successful in agricultural transformation in their initial stages of development and, subsequently, in building dynamic and competitive manufacturing industries. In Africa, where real exchange rates were relatively stable (Table 1), persistent overvaluation appears to have been a deliberate policy for extracting resources from agricul- ture, whereas in Latin America the extreme degree of instability is a reflection of the inability of countries to maintain competitive rates despite occasional devalua- tions in response to recurrent payments crises. In most developing countries in the early stages of industrialization the evolution of exports and capital accumulation depends crucially on the performance of the agricultural sector. A major difficulty facing policy- makers at this stage is how to sustain agricultural growth while extracting a surplus from agriculture for industrial development. In this respect the contrast between East Asian and sub-Saharan Africa is quite striking. Evidence shows that in both regions agriculture was taxed in the early stages of industrialization through pricing policies. Comparative analysis of the ratio of producer prices to border prices show that the implicit rate of taxation was not always higher in Africa, but the overall rate of taxation was much higher because exchange rate po- lices were not favourable to export crops. Rather, they were designed primarily for providing cheap imports to heavily protected industries (UNCTAD TDR 1998: Part Two, chap. 3; and Boratav 2001). However, the Asian suc- cess in agricultural development depended not only on favourable exchange rates for agricultural producers but also on complementary policies, including investment in agricultural infrastructure and provision of various productivity-enhancing services (Karshenas 2001).

Real devaluations follow- ing nominal adjustments could not be sustained because inflation often continued unabated and even accelerated after currency adjustments. Many of these adjustments were stepwise, but even where devaluations were fol- lowed by crawling pegs, whereby the peg was shifted over time, subsequent nominal adjustments were not sufficient to maintain real exchange rates at levels favour- able to traded-goods sectors. In other words, devalua- tions were not effective in bringing about real exchange rate adjustments needed to reduce structural external deficits and avoid recurrent payments crises.28 While nominal pegs were also used in some Asian countries such as Korea \u2212 which maintained a regime of de facto dollar peg until the end of the 1970s \u2212 in such cases not only were real appreciations generally more moderate but devaluations were not followed by rapid erosion of the real exchange rate.29 Most Asian countries avoided gyrations in nominal and real exchange rates \u2212 until they liberalized the capital account in the 1990s and left their currencies to the whims of international capital flows.30 Large devaluations, such as that in 1980 in Korea, was a response to external trade shocks, notably a sharp deterioration in the terms of trade, rather than to the erosion of the real exchange rate through rapid infla- tion. They were followed by a regime of crawling pegs, preventing appreciation of the real exchange rate. The Asian countries, too, no doubt experienced occasional misalignments and appreciations, but various other measures, including industry policy instruments, were used to maintain export momentum and avoid recurrent payments crises. Recent studies on cross-country regressions to ac- count for growth differences have increasingly included the level and volatility of the real exchange rate among the explanatory variables.31 Evidence based on such regressions for Latin America suggests that overvalua- tions tend to slow growth of industrial employment and output. According to a cross-country study of 18 Latin American and Caribbean countries for 1970-1996, trade liberalizations had a small negative effect on employ- ment growth, but the impact was greatly amplified by the appreciation of the real exchange rate, underlying the importance of proper exchange rate management at times of trade reforms (Marquez and Pag\u00e9s 1998). As already noted, most studies trying to estimate the impact of exchange rate misalignments on growth use purchasing power parity (PPP) measures, often adjusted for the Balassa-Samuelson effect. Studies by Cavallo, Cottani, and Kahn (1990) and by Dollar (1992) on developing countries report inverse correlations between real exchange rate overvaluations and economic growth. Similar results are found by Gala (2007) for 58 develop- ing countries for the period 1960-1999. Razin and Collins (1999) lump together a large number of developing and developed countries and find that overvaluations harm growth, but this is not the case for undervaluation. Haus- man, Pritchett, and Rodrik (2004) and Rodrik (2008) find that growth accelerations are usually associated with real depreciations.32 By contrast, a study of 60 countries over the pe- riod 1965-2003 finds that both real overvaluations and undervaluations hinder growth, although in the former case the effect is stronger (Aguirre and Calder\u00f3n 2005). Moreover, the effect is non-linear: growth declines are larger, the larger the size of the misalignments. Thus, while small to moderate undervaluations enhance growth, large undervaluations hurt growth. Furthermore, in this study the impact of a movement of the real exchange rate would depend on the underlying circumstances. An increase in the real exchange rate at a time of significant and sustained improvements in terms of trade implies, in effect, a movement towards the ERER. The study shows that exchange rate changes in response to shifts in key determinants of the ERER help promote growth.

It should be kept in mind that cross-country growth regressions suffer from several methodological problems, including the failure to identify whether or not the explanatory variables are truly exogenous. The founder of the neoclassical growth theory, Solow (2001), criticises cross-country growth accounting exercises on grounds that the same specification applies to countries with different institutional histories so that differences in growth rates can only be explained by differences across countries in the values of the regressors used. Srinivasan and Bhagwati (1999) also criticise cross-country regressions, at least insofar as the benefits of trade openness are concerned, because of their weak theoretical foundations, poor quality of their data base, and their inappropriate econometric methodology; see also Rodrik (2005). 32 The explanation given by Rodrik (2008) is already discussed above. A country making a rapid switch from an import-substitution strategy to an ag- gressive export push would need substantial incentive for producers in traded-goods industries since there are important entry costs to foreign markets. In such cases sharp depreciations and other export incentives can lead to a surge in exports and accelerate growth by easing the payments constraint. This happened in Turkey during the 1980s, as shown by several papers in Aricanli and Rodrik (1990). However, not all growth accelerations are associated with shifts in trade strategy. 11 33 For a recent survey of these studies, see Eichengreen (2008), which also provides empirical, cross-country evidence on the link between volatility and growth. 34 For the development of hedge markets in emerging-market economies in recent years, see Saxena and Villar (2008). In Asia, over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives for foreign exchange barely exist outside Hong Kong and Singapore, which together account for over 50 percent of total turnover in foreign exchange spot markets in all emerging markets and 70 percent in OTC derivatives markets. 35 Several Bank for international Settlements (BIS) studies find that the presence of foreigners helps in the development of derivatives markets in foreign exchange, and the demand for hedging is driven mainly by international investors in emerging market bonds and equities. The banking sector is the biggest user of OTC forex derivatives and keeps the largest open position in most emerging markets; see Saxena and Villar (2008) and Turner (2008) and the studies cited therein. 36 See CEPR (2000), summary of a talk by Bernard Dumas based on Dumas (1994). 37 On the evidence that these markets develop faster where the currency is allowed to fluctuate freely, see Eichengreen (2008: 3), who cautions that \u201cthere are limits to this argument that price variability is conducive to the development of hedging markets and instruments; high levels of volatility will be subversive to financial development \u2026 insofar as it induces capital flights and leads the authorities to resort to policies of financial repression.\u201d on employment, investment, and growth focus on the observed behaviour of the real exchange rate without considering whether its movements are warranted by shifts in the underlying fundamentals.33 Results are mixed, varying according to country samples, measures of volatility, and the specifications used. It is sometimes argued that, while provoking in- stability, financial and currency markets also provide the means to hedge against instability so as to minimize its impact on the real economy. According to the findings of a cross-country study of 83 countries over the period 1960- 2000, in countries with relatively low levels of financial development exchange rate volatility generally reduces growth, whereas in financially advanced countries there is no significant effect (Aghion et al 2006). It is true that in developing countries the absence or underdevelopment of relevant derivatives markets limits the ability of individual agents to hedge against instability.34 But it is not evident that in a country with liability dollarization it would be possible for the agents to hedge collectively, since this would require, in effect, pushing the currency risk abroad.35 Moreover, quite apart from transaction costs, there are limits to hedging: \u201cwhile forward contracts and currency options have proved to be effective means of reducing risk in managing financial portfolios, they cannot cushion companies engaged in international trade against the risk of exchange rate fluc- tuations\u201d and \u201ceven the most sophisticated hedges are no substitute for stable exchange rates.\u201d36 There is evidence that forwards, swaps, and options markets often develop faster when the currency is allowed to fluctuate.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "28cbd1c3-6027-49ed-b86b-608e7df6545a": {"__data__": {"id_": "28cbd1c3-6027-49ed-b86b-608e7df6545a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Exchange Rate Management, Growth and Stability: National and Regional Policy Options in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c61d23edd63fda04d9f3d11522db6b11873b641fb21b0483518db93b0cbb80df"}, "2": {"node_id": "b63161b9-1172-48b1-b8ab-eec5a2373540", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6dcc8dfb2ad60e7f0634c49c7977a57b39b2330370dda9cd205e313c508409ce"}}, "hash": "33bde2ebb9dcf93b0b0e58c4d3e7b9f9706400a2a00ce9cf6312d89946ed6679", "text": "However, this is not only because these markets provide hedges against volatility, but also because currency volatility cre- ates profit opportunities.

First, there is no single and sure way of determining whether a currency is properly aligned with the underly- ing economic fundamentals, that is, to what extent it is overvalued or undervalued. This is largely because what constitutes the equilibrium exchange rates depends, inter alia, on long-term, sustained capital inflows, and passing a judgement on the latter has become almost an impos- sible undertaking. Second, while it may be very difficult to sustain rapid growth under sustained appreciations, whether or not depreciations would accelerate growth depends on a host of other factors. Finally, an economy is unlikely to maintain rapid growth for an extended period under highly unstable real exchange rates, but a stable currency may not necessarily promote growth; it may even hinder it when shifts in underlying fundamentals call for currency adjustments. These considerations suggest that in practice a ju- dicious management of the exchange rate would call for considerable judgement and discretion. Attention would need to be paid not only to the trade and growth perfor- mance of the economy and the evolution of its current account position but also to financial vulnerabilities that may result from capital flows and currency movements \u2212 an issue to be taken up presently. 12 3.1 Boom-bust cycles in capital flows and exchange rate gyrations A common feature of the cross-country studies on the link between the exchange rate and economic growth is that they do not specify the forces driving the currency and the nature and causes of instability. Many of them lump together earlier episodes of appreciation and instability caused by domestic policy inconsistencies with those arising from boom-bust cycles in capital flows driven by global forces in the more recent periods. These episodes differ not only with respect to the causes of appreciations and instability but also their impact on employment, investment, and growth and, hence, the appropriate policy response. Indeed, the failure of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to diagnose the nature of these crises and distinguish them from traditional currency ap- preciations and payments difficulties caused by domestic demand expansion and inflation led to serious errors in policy response, notably in East Asia where pro-cyclical monetary and fiscal tightening adopted in response to the 1997 crisis served to deepen the economic contrac- tion caused by the reversal of capital flows. Exchange rate misalignments and instability caused by boom-bust cycles in private capital flows is not a recent phenomenon. Perhaps the first most significant post-war episode was the experience of the Southern Cone countries in Latin America, notably Chile, during the late 1970s and early 1980s. The combination of financial liberalization, tight monetary policy, and fixed nominal exchange rates attracted large amounts of foreign capital to the region, leading to debt accumulation by the pri- vate sector and a consumption boom. Massive inflows of capital allowed the currencies to appreciate in real terms despite mounting trade deficits. The experiment ended with a currency and financial crisis, bringing down many banks and causing a sharp contraction in economic activ- ity (Diaz-Alejandro 1985). With rapid liberalization of the capital account in the 1990s, international private capital flows have become the driving force behind business cycles and exchange rates in many developing countries, capable of producing unsustainable economic expansions and 3. Capital flows, exchange rates, and the real economy currency appreciations followed by financial crises and recessions. While country-specific (pull) and global (push) factors both play important roles in determining the di- rection, size, and nature of capital flows, evidence shows that the most damaging episodes of such crises are those associated with boom-bust cycles in capital flows driven by global factors beyond the control of the recipient countries.38 Indeed, since the early 1990s currency and balance of payments crises have occurred under varying mac- roeconomic and financial conditions in Latin America, East Asia, and elsewhere (UNCTAD TDR 1995; chap. 2, 1997; chap. 3, 1999; chap. 3, and 2003; chap. 4). They were seen not only in countries with large and widening current account deficits (e.g., Mexico and Thailand), but also where deficits were relatively small and presumed sustainable (Indonesia and Russia). A significant currency appreciation is often a feature of countries experiencing currency turmoil (Brazil, Mexico,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "85e90e83-2fd6-4ce9-b8ac-bc02e30afea0": {"__data__": {"id_": "85e90e83-2fd6-4ce9-b8ac-bc02e30afea0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Exchange Rate Management, Growth and Stability: National and Regional Policy Options in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1c38cd81ef5033100ea8974eb250477ffb39ff478b6f5684e0d477cc2854e922"}, "3": {"node_id": "c31ad401-7ec3-44e8-8d4b-b385021ef83a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "076e4c867e93d22e1bbe531136cbbc7ba066a5a132319f60d596aa009f8c295a"}}, "hash": "80ef08532e409bace585eddf5d50320d5c27ce97ce1b43a409f776012ec59bcc", "text": "Russia, and Turkey), but this has not always been the case; appreciations in most East Asian countries hit by the 1997 crisis were moderate or negligible. In some cases crises were associated with large budget deficits, as in Brazil, Russia, and Turkey, but in others (Mexico and East Asia) the budget was either balanced or in surplus. Crises occurred not only where capital flows supported a boom in private consumption, as in Latin America, but also in private investment, as in East Asia. Again, in some episodes of crises external liabili- ties were largely public (Brazil and Russia) while in others they were private (East Asia). Finally, most countries hit by balance of payments and financial crises are said to have been lacking effective regulation and supervision of the financial system, but Argentina could not avoid a currency and payments crisis and default despite having one of the best systems of prudential regulations in the developing world and a financial system dominated by foreign banks. Recurrent currency and financial crises under varying macroeconomic conditions have raised serious questions about the mainstream thinking that currency and balance-of-payments crises result primarily from macroeconomic policy inconsistencies, notably lack of fiscal and monetary discipline, and that price stability is 38 This is also recognized by the World Bank (2003: 26): \u201cdynamics of net capital inflows and the changes of official reserves over the cycle do indeed indicate that the push factor is more important for middle-income countries, while the pull factor dominates in high-income countries.\u201d On post-war cycles in capital flows, see UNCTAD TDR (2003: chap. 2); for more recent episodes, see IMF WEO (October 2007: chap. 3). 13 both necessary and sufficient for financial and exchange rate stability. In reality, in most countries financial boom- bust cycles, asset-price and exchange rate gyrations, and credit surges and crunches have all occurred under conditions of low and stable inflation \u2212 the most recent example being the global financial crisis triggered by the sub-prime debacle.39 In the more extreme cases, as in Latin America, where price instability has traditionally been regarded as structural and chronic, single digit and stable inflation rates have been attained at the expense of increased financial fragility and instability through exchange-rate-based stabilization programmes relying on short-term, unstable capital inflows. The pattern of exchange rate movements over the boom-bust cycles in capital flows is well known. If the currency is allowed to float freely, both nominal and real exchange rates would appreciate when capital inflows exceed the current account deficit; but the deficit itself would be widened by real exchange rate appreciations, requiring growing amounts of inflows to finance it. Under a nominal peg currency, market interventions would be necessary when inflows exceed the current account defi- cit. Still, the real exchange rate could appreciate depend- ing on the rate of inflation. Here, too, real appreciations could widen the current account deficit so that increased amounts of capital inflows would be needed to support a nominal peg. This was the case in exchange-rate based stabilization programmes implemented in Latin America and Europe in the 1990s. In East Asia, too, in the run-up to the 1997 crisis nominal exchange rates were broadly stable, but this had nothing to do with disinflation; rather, it reflected the long-standing emphasis on stable ex- change rates in export-led industrialization and growth. Moreover, central banks in Asian countries hit by the 1997 crisis had occasionally intervened in order to prevent ap- preciation.40 With a sharp reversal of capital flows, nominal rates tend to collapse, overshooting their longer-term levels. Thus, over the boom-bust cycle, nominal rates first appreciate or remain relatively stable during the surge in capital flows depending on the regime adopted, result- ing in moderate-to-sharp real appreciations. The rapid exit of capital then leads to a collapse in the nominal rate. Even though this often leads to an increase in inflation, currency-cum-financial crises generally result in large real devaluations.41 This is often followed by a recovery in the nominal exchange rate \u2212 a correction to downward overshooting seen at times of capital flight \u2212 but real exchange rates remain below the levels attained during the surge in capital flows. This pattern is observed even where the sudden stop or reversal of capital flows do not trigger a balance of payments crisis, as was the case in Singapore and Taiwan during the 1997 crisis and, as dis- cussed below, in the current episode of sharp declines in capital flows triggered by the sub-prime crisis.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c31ad401-7ec3-44e8-8d4b-b385021ef83a": {"__data__": {"id_": "c31ad401-7ec3-44e8-8d4b-b385021ef83a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Exchange Rate Management, Growth and Stability: National and Regional Policy Options in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1c38cd81ef5033100ea8974eb250477ffb39ff478b6f5684e0d477cc2854e922"}, "2": {"node_id": "85e90e83-2fd6-4ce9-b8ac-bc02e30afea0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "80ef08532e409bace585eddf5d50320d5c27ce97ce1b43a409f776012ec59bcc"}}, "hash": "076e4c867e93d22e1bbe531136cbbc7ba066a5a132319f60d596aa009f8c295a", "text": "3.2 Wages, employment, and investment over the cycle In almost all emerging market economies that experi- enced boom-bust cycles in capital flows in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "65377dee-8825-47c0-bd7e-5461bd488fa0": {"__data__": {"id_": "65377dee-8825-47c0-bd7e-5461bd488fa0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Exchange Rate Management, Growth and Stability: National and Regional Policy Options in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/exchange-rate-management-growth-and-stability-national-and-regional-policy-options-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7bf2cd894d59764d154cc392db1974c552f955794dbe022c6b0600217c7a66ed"}}, "hash": "7bf2cd894d59764d154cc392db1974c552f955794dbe022c6b0600217c7a66ed", "text": "the 1990s, real wages rose rapidly at times of surges in capital inflows, but employment behaved differently in different countries.42 Where the boom was driven by investment, unemployment fell during the expansion phase. This was the case in all the countries hit by the 1997 Asian crisis except Indonesia. By contrast, in Latin America, where booms were driven by consumption, unemployment was either stable or higher despite expansion of employment in services sectors, because of loss of competitiveness and jobs in industry. During a surge in capital inflows, high real wages and cheap imports of capital goods, together with easy access to credit, tend to encourage investment and lead to capital deepening in an effort to restructure industry and raise productivity to meet foreign competition. This hap- pened even in Latin America, where booms were driven primarily by private consumption. Investment growth was much stronger in East Asia, where firms augmented investment in the hope of increasing productivity and market shares, and expanded into new areas of produc- tion in response to rapidly falling prices of many of the electronic products exported, notably semiconductors. Again, most episodes of strong capital inflows produce booms in property markets and increased investment in residential and commercial construction. Currency and maturity mismatches in balance sheets create serious problems for firms and financial institutions at times of rapid exit of capital and the col- lapse of the currency. These set off a process of debt de- flation whereby attempts to escape from the squeeze on balance sheets of rising domestic cash needs to service 39 See Borio and Lowe (2002) on the emergence of exchange rate and financial instability in a low inflation environment. 40 For instance, in the run-up to the 1995 Mexican crisis the peso remained pegged to the dollar while in Korea the won fell against the dollar from 1996 until the contagion from the Thai crisis in 1997. For the exchange rate regimes in Asia before the 1997 crisis, see UNCTAD TDR (1998: chap. 3, box 2). 41 It should be noted that several countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Russia, and Turkey, have succeeded in overcoming their chronic price instability and avoiding a return of rapid inflation despite the collapse of their currencies and the external adjustment necessitated by the crisis. 42 For the evidence cited in this section on the evolution of wages, employment, and investment in boom-bust-recovery cycles in emerging markets, see UNCTAD TDR (2000; chap. 4, TDR 2003; chap 4), ILO (2004), Van der Hoeven and L\u00fcbker (2005), and World Bank (2003: 23-26). In the more recent boom-bust cycle after 2002, the boom phase was not associated with faster wage growth in several Asian countries, notably India and China. On the Indian experience, see Chandrasekhar (2008). 14 foreign debt simply increase their financial difficulties by driving down exchange rates and asset values even further. Credit is cut as collateral values fall and banks try to consolidate their balance sheets (UNCTAD TDR 1998; chapter 3; and Krugman (1999). Credit conditions are often aggravated by monetary tightening and interest rate hikes aiming to check capital flight, producing sharp declines in employment and real wages alongside a deep contraction in output. The decline in real wages was particularly steep in Indonesia, Mexico, and Turkey at times of crises \u2212 between 11 and 25 percent per annum. In East Asia unemploy- ment went up rapidly, particularly in Korea and Indonesia (table 2). In Latin America, where booms failed to produce a significant growth in jobs, the subsequent crises took unemployment to exceptionally high levels: in Mexico open unemployment doubled within a year; in Argentina, where the currency board and the fixed exchange rate were maintained despite worsening external conditions, unemployment shot up in the wake of the Mexican crisis, reaching almost 20 percent in 1995; in Brazil open unem- ployment rose from 6 percent in the mid-1990s to almost 10 percent in 1999. A similar increase was registered in Turkey during the 2001 crisis. Almost all episodes of crisis-induced currency declines in emerging markets produced sharp declines in output, reviving the debate over if and why devaluations are contractionary. Even in countries with highly diversi- fied production and exports such as Korea, real deprecia- tions were not immediately translated into larger export volumes. One possible reason given is contagion: that is, if currencies of all countries competing in the same export markets fall, none of them would gain competitive advan- tage.43 However, this is not very plausible since most Asian countries hit by the crisis achieved rapid export growth subsequently.

Indeed, in Asia currency declines appear to have inflicted less damage on firms than cut-backs in domestic credit lines and rise in interest rates because many firms with large foreign debt were export-oriented. During crises not only do exports fail to rise quickly in response to the decline in the currency but domestic demand shrinks because of the impact of the collapse of the currency on private balance sheets. Indeed, there is now a growing agreement that the balance sheet impact of currency declines, rather than supply-side rigidities or demand inelasticities, are the main reason why crisis- induced devaluations in emerging markets are contrac- tionary (Krugman 1999; Frankel 2005). There is also some support from empirical studies, including a study of nine Latin American countries by Galindo, Izquierdo, and Montero (2006), that finds that real exchange rate depreciations can have a positive impact on employment growth, but this effect is reversed as liability dollarization increases. 44 In expansion-recession-recovery cycles in emerg- ing markets governed by international capital flows, loss- es of real wages, employment, and investment incurred at times of downturn are not fully recovered when the economy regains its pre-crisis level of GDP. In Asia during the recovery phase, real wages regained their pre-crisis levels only in Korea while they remained depressed else- where in the region. In Latin America, real wages were all lower than the peaks reached before the crises. More im- portantly, everywhere employment lagged considerably behind output growth, giving rise to the phenomenon of jobless recovery. Post-crisis open unemployment rates were higher than pre-crisis rates by 1.0 percentage point in Brazil and Mexico, 5.5 points in Argentina, and 4 points in Korea and Indonesia. In Turkey growth averaging over 7 percent for four years after the 2001 crisis did not make any dent in unemployment, and real wages barely recovered. The deterioration in the conditions of labour, particularly among the unskilled, is a major reason why poverty levels in most of these countries stayed high de- spite economic recovery. In all four Asian countries hit by the 1997 crisis, unemployment levels in 2007 stood above those observed before the crisis, particularly in Indonesia. Much the same is true for investment: investment rates in all Asian countries hit by the 1997 crisis are still below their pre-crisis levels (table 3). Recoveries from economic downturns caused by the bursting of financial bubbles have also been weak in job creation and investment in some advanced countries. This was the case in the United States\u2019 recovery from the recession caused by the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2001. Several explanations have been offered for this phenomenon (Aky\u00fcz 2008b: 184-86), but there is a grow- ing consensus that the damage inflicted by financial crises on industry tends to be much deeper and longer lasting than difficulties resulting from economic cont
