GENERAL CONTEXT A Review of Domestic Data Sources for Climate Finance Flows in Recipient Countries Other instruments related to adaptation established under the UNFCCC are the National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs). Established at COP 7 (Marrakesh, 2001) the NAPA was designed for Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and aimed to support the identifcation of priority activities that respond to their urgent needs to adapt to climate change. From the sample countries, Nepal and Zambia as LDCs developed their NAPAs in 2010 and 2007, respectively. Both NAPAs identifed projects that should be funded to solve their needs on adaptation. Zambia\u2019s NAPA (MTENR 2007) includes information on climate baselines and projections, identifes key adaptation needs and it defnes a list of recommended projects and programs to be implemented, each of which includes an estimation of the fnancial resources. There are 38 adaptation measures identifed for 4 diferent sectors. However, Van Rooij et al. (2013) reports that from the 10 projects/programs identifed in the NAPA, by the year 2013 only one had been implemented. In Nepal, the NAPA identifed and prioritised nine profle projects whose costs were estimated at USD 350 million. The NAPA implementation framework also mentions that 80% of climate fnance will be spent at the local level. The NAPA is broken down into the Local Adaptation Plans for Action (LAPA) which provide a planning framework designed to undertake climate adaptation plans at the local level in a participatory and integrated manner. It is a fexible planning tool to address the needs of the climate vulnerable community. There are other specifc policies which have been created in some of the countries and that are worth mentioning. For example, the \u201cInstitutional Strategy for the Articulation of Policies and Actions on Climate Change\u201d (2011) and the creation of the \u201cNational System on Climate Change\u201d (2016) in Colombia, both instruments aim to coordinate the work of the diferent institutions related to climate change in the country. The Philippines also created specifc regulations to improve the coordination between the diferent governmental institutions through the Executive Order No. 43, which created the Cabinet Cluster on Climate Adaptation and Mitigation. Also, the Climate Change Act of 2009 established the Climate Change Commission, which nowadays, for example, is responsible for the preparation of the National Communications to the UNFCCC. Kenya has a National Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP), a National Climate Change Framework Policy and a Climate Change Act approved in 2016. Zambia, created the Interim Inter-Ministerial Climate Change Secretariat (IIMCCS), which functions as the hub of information related to climate fnance. 3.2 Climate fnance in selected countries Climate fnance, as a whole, involves several factors including: \u2022 The e\ufffdistence of specific policies and financial institutions dedicated to resourcing the climate change response; \u2022 The \ufffdow of, and access, to international financial resources dedicated to financing prioriti\ufffded mitigation and adaptation actions; \u2022 The analysis and allocation of public e\ufffdpenditures to address the problem domestically - recently climate fnance has been also raising new debates in the context of fscal policies; \u2022 Instruments to trigger domestic and international private sector finance. 25 IV. GENERAL CONTEXT At the international level, there are studies that have been trying to understand the diferent dimensions of climate fnance. On one hand trying to understand the cost of the impacts of climate change (e.g. The Cost of Adaptation studies done by the World Bank, UNDP and others), while on the other, trying to identify the amount of fnancial fows received from international sources (e.g. the Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) Climate Finance Landscape studies). In recent years, there have also been attempts to identify the amount of money allocated through national public expenditures (e.g.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "15a7d773-7411-421e-be31-fef547eace1f": {"__data__": {"id_": "15a7d773-7411-421e-be31-fef547eace1f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-domestic-data-sources-climate-finance-flows-recipient-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Review of Domestic Data Sources for Climate Finance Flows in Recipient Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-domestic-data-sources-climate-finance-flows-recipient-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "31aac4c6833f42200932b5c5d2504075bce90ab4a96a11f254d6988184338160"}, "2": {"node_id": "2b645f91-990a-4a24-87ff-0da3041c9048", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-domestic-data-sources-climate-finance-flows-recipient-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aad48f7ac84f7ab1d9ba962df9eb9a4521e7357a2c7805a9374fb41b325a8443"}}, "hash": "c74b56b9687c3d74fa87807db80a94ed7fa0444193081de45f7f4dcd4d300a26", "text": "through Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR) reports.

In recent years, this has begun to shift as the involvement of the ministries of fnance or the planning entities becomes more prominent. This trend is as a result of country responses to diferent factors such as the cost that climate change is already creating in the countries which need to be addressed using domestic public and private fnance and the necessity to prepare to access global fnancial mechanisms such as the Green Climate Fund and others. In Colombia for instance, due to the impacts of \u201cLa Ni\u00f1a\u201d in 2011 where the country lost 11,2 billion Colombian pesos (around, USD 3.7 million8) there were economic and social costs that motivated the creation of climate policies and accompanying budgets. In response to that crisis, Colombia has created SISCLIMA, which is the space for the multi-sectorial dialogue about climate change in the country. It is within this system that the committee for the fnancial management (Comit\u00e9 de Gesti\u00f3n Financiera) that is coordinated by the National Department of Planning (Departamento Nacional de Planeaci\u00f3n, DNP), was created. For Colombia the debates around climate fnance are getting highly relevant, however in the rest of the countries, climate fnance and fnance for adaptation in particular, are new topics and they are in diferent stages of development. In Colombia also, a carbon tax that will be connected to a fund that will fnance climate activities was recently approved. In the case of Guatemala, the Ministries of Finance and Environment, advised by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (CEPAL) and other international organizations, are currently designing a Green Fiscal Policy that includes the reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases. Despite these advances (mostly in Latin America), for many diferent stakeholders and particularly government ofcials, there remain many challenges in relation to understanding and managing climate fnance, starting from the lack of defnition about what climate fnance means in practice through to the lack of capacity to design and implement comprehensive national architectures (systems and processes) to deploy and manage climate fnance. 26 IV. GENERAL CONTEXT A Review of Domestic Data Sources for Climate Finance Flows in Recipient Countries 3.2.1 The cost of climate change Arriving at a reasonable cost estimate for climate change actions (both mitigation and adaptation) is a difcult exercise and most countries in the study have only rough estimates. In particular, for adaptation, there is little in the policies and NDCs that indicate an assessment of the costs of adaptation actions. Table 5 below shows estimates of the losses due to the impacts of climate change, as well as the costs of the actions to deal with it. In the case of losses, most of the estimates are related to losses of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the countries produced by extreme weather events (foods, droughts, etc.).

Several exercises have been taken in this regard. Table 6 shows the information related to international climate fnance fows received in the selected countries, based on the Rio Markers of the OECD information and the Climate Fund Update. 27 IV.

GENERAL CONTEXT A Review of Domestic Data Sources for Climate Finance Flows in Recipient Countries Although there is not a universal methodology to classify climate fnance, exercises done by the OECD have provided elements to discuss what in the point of view of donor countries are climate change associated activities. The data presented in table 6 is based on the classifcation system used by the OECD, however it is noted that there is often a discrepancy between the \u2018donors\u2019 and the recipient perspectives. The main discussion regarding OECD data is the level to which it accurately refects climate fnance as new and additional money in relation to the Ofcial Development Assistance. Another challenge with the OECD data taken in table 6 is that the reports often present information aggregated by region, which makes it difcult to show information by country. The Climate Fund Update is another exercise done by the Overseas Development Institute and the Heinrich Boll Foundation that aims to report the amount of fnancial resources transferred through climate funds within and outside the UNFCCC. These two databases are diferent ways to present the same information since the climate funds receives resources from the same bilateral donors that are members of the OECD. There are other estimations done by country regarding international fows. For instance, in the case of Kenya the estimate of USD 2.29 billion for 127 active climate-relevant projects that received international support from 2005 until 2015 (CDKN, 2012). According to a 2013 Trans- parency International Kenya report, both loans and grants-entering Kenya between 2009- 2012 from external sources totaled USD 2.5 billion. In the case of Colombia, the Biennial Updated Report submitted to the UNFCCC in 2015, point out that the fnancial support received in the country from 2010-2014 was around USD 300,000,000. In order to complete this analysis, the National Planning Department is elaborating a new estimation of the fnancial support from 2010-2016 with the fnancial support of the French Cooperation and the technical work of GFLAC and Econometria, the same will be launched in 2017. 29 IV. GENERAL CONTEXT 30 3.2.3 Public expenditure allocated to climate change activities In recent years, there has been an interest in analyzing the contributions that developing countries are making in terms of the allocation of public expenditure to deal with climate change. Table 7 identifes numbers related to the allocation of public expenditure. The previous table also shows how diferent information about climate expenditures is presented for the selected countries. The challenges related to the pubic expenditure are the levels of disaggregation of information and the existence of actual labels or criteria to identify climate change activities. However, many of the studied countries have been progressing in this regard, such as the case of Nepal. While Colombia created an actual methodology to identify the information. Based in that methodology and thanks to the CPEIR support, Colombia identifed that the country allocates approximately 480 millions of USD per year to climate change related activities. The fgures for Philippines, which in the last years have developed a tracking system for climate fnance, are considerably higher than for the other countries. This could be explained by the fact the Philippines has experience of the negative impacts of climate change, and the government has been increasing its awareness and its work on this regard.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d4218851-64b8-4189-8d50-8c316803f598": {"__data__": {"id_": "d4218851-64b8-4189-8d50-8c316803f598", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-domestic-data-sources-climate-finance-flows-recipient-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Review of Domestic Data Sources for Climate Finance Flows in Recipient Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-domestic-data-sources-climate-finance-flows-recipient-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7b56c09778f7cd57916ad16a9e03dbe9ae57ddf31896426901334f4b835c4a8e"}, "2": {"node_id": "dadd9617-0d83-4057-96cd-79e1ce7d4643", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-domestic-data-sources-climate-finance-flows-recipient-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e52a9bb974f37ac68bc9202e265e02fcc37f595562fa9f0cc9806c28b186dc93"}}, "hash": "c2a9a437a5a88f0201ebc879791da4cdc98ba8a0ef49a34fddf68240d65c6180", "text": "Nevertheless, this could also respond to the lack of information in other countries.

GENERAL CONTEXT A Review of Domestic Data Sources for Climate Finance Flows in Recipient Countries 31 32% (UNDP, 2017)9. The report points out that the total amount allocated for adaptation and mitigation activities represent around 0.18% of the GDP in 2017 and 0.09% in 2016 (UNDP, 2017) It is acknowledge that public expenditure could be also infuenced by the levels of income and the levels of leverage that can has with other resources. In many countries there is also the goal to build measuring systems to track climate private fnance. However, the challenges remain high due the lack of public information related. 3.3 Climate fnance defnition The defnition of what constitutes climate fnance remains unclear globally and difers from country to country. For most of the information presented in the case study countries, it is not clear which methodologies the authors used to produce the numbers. This means that the information is a useful reference but comparison between the diferent data sets is not possible. The study showed that countries use varying defnitions for climate fnance and diferentiate between fnance allocated for mitigation and adaptation. An example of this is the Philippines, which has a general defnition of climate fnance (established in the People\u2019s Survival Fund), and four diferent categories are used: adaptation, mitigation, adaptation and mitigation combined and disaster risk reduction (DRR) (which is included as part of adaptation fnance. In the case of Colombia there has been a long debate about the defnition of climate fnance. In recent years the country has developed a process to integrate a methodology to classify and measure climate fnance. The methodology uses the operational defnition created by the Standing Committee \u201cClimate Finance aims at reducing emissions, and enhancing sinks of GHG and aims at reducing vulnerability of, and maintaining and increasing the resilience of, human and ecological systems to negative climate change impacts\u201d (SCF, 2016:16). However, an important step that Colombia took was the integration of a top down approach that also follows the international defnition from the Rio Markers of the OECD. The methodology also uses a bottom up approach, using the actual defnition of activities that were included in the national policies to create a match between these two perspectives. Nepal does not have a strict defnition of what counts as climate fnance. This has been a huge bottleneck in accounting climate fnance in the country. Often, the confusion leads to huge overlap between climate fnance and regular development assistance. It is clear that the defnition of climate fnance remains crucial for countries to be able to track fnancial fows.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6321f4e4-3597-494c-b503-c9d5fbefd609": {"__data__": {"id_": "6321f4e4-3597-494c-b503-c9d5fbefd609", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-domestic-data-sources-climate-finance-flows-recipient-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Review of Domestic Data Sources for Climate Finance Flows in Recipient Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-domestic-data-sources-climate-finance-flows-recipient-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "66e217ba4647e57b343834cad5cd6e3465bbcdeec6e27509739f4e987e1871b7"}, "2": {"node_id": "5ee37c5b-577e-4982-8aa9-7867f82e00c4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-domestic-data-sources-climate-finance-flows-recipient-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cd228abb91903dc4607d3fc50be06f2567faef8da3617016a6475089b7276b54"}}, "hash": "e9e555a656475cf272bdc8e4614e8dfbd2b9e6e418e3348629d0bd711f35b8eb", "text": "However, each country has made an attempt to develop an operational defnition relevant to their country context.

Current reporting frameworks under the UNFCCC Existing transparency requirements under the UNFCCC difer for developed and developing countries. All parties to the Convention must submit National Communications (NatComms) on their mitigation and adaptation actions every four years, though the required content difers for developed and developing countries10. To enhance reporting on national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories and eforts to implement the requirements of the Convention, agreements reached in 2010 at Cancun established two parallel processes: one for developed countries, and a less stringent one for developing countries. Under International Assessment and Review (IAR), developed country parties enhance the reporting in their NatComms through the submission of biennial reports (BRs), which outline their progress in achieving emission reductions and the provision of fnancial, technological, and capacity-building support to developing country parties. Developed countries undergo a technical review of their national reports, in which technical experts review the annual GHG inventories, examine the technical information on emissions and removals, and verify the methodologies used to provide those measurements. The technical review is followed by a \u201cmultilateral assessment,\u201d which is essentially a Q&A between the party being assessed and other parties on the basis of all submitted national reports. To date, all developed countries have gone through one full round of IAR. Regarding climate fnance, the 18th Conference of the Parties (COP18) concluded Decision 2/CP.17 and Decision 19/CP.1 on a Common Tabular Format (CTF) for reporting on fnancial support and capacity building support. The CTF is a common format of reporting for all developed countries. Based on the frst submission of Biennial Reports (BRs), revised guidelines were adopted by COP20 in 2014, as part of decision 2/CP.17. 10 The UNFCCC art. 12, May 9, 1992, S. Treaty Doc No. 102-38, 1771 U.N.T.S. 107 (entered into force Mar. 21, 1994). A Review of Domestic Data Sources for Climate Finance Flows in Recipient Countries 33 On the other hand, under International Consultation and Analysis (ICA), developing country parties enhance the information in their NatComms through the submission of Biennial Update Reports (BURs), which include a national inventory report and information on their mitigation actions, needs, and support received. Unlike developed countries, developing countries are not required to report the progress made in implementing and achieving emission reductions. The BUR then undergoes a technical analysis by a team of technical experts under a less rigorous standard of review than for IAR, resulting in a summary report that includes the capacity- building needs to facilitate reporting in subsequent BURs. The technical analysis is followed by a \u201cfacilitative sharing of views,\u201d which is another peer review forum where parties are free to ask questions of a party on its BUR. Although the current ICA process for developing countries is only halfway through its frst round, both the UNFCCC secretariat and parties have learned some important lessons. There has been signifcant improvement of the technical basis for reporting, such as greater consistency in the use of reporting methodologies and an increase in the requests for technical review of NatComms. There is more coherency and coordination at the institutional level, domestically and internationally, although room for improvement remains. In the case of climate fnance there are not guidelines for reporting of information for developing countries, and there is not an explicit mandate or reference to use the CTF as a potential guidance for these countries. For developed and developing countries alike, simply going through the process and engaging with the secretariat improved the quality of reporting and increased familiarity with the process. So far 34 developing countries have submitted their BURs, and by December 2015, about 13 developing countries (including Brazil, South Africa, Singapore and the Republic of Korea) had completed their verifcation cycle through what is called a \u201cfacilitative sharing of views\u201d (FSV). The facilitative sharing of views takes the form of a workshop consisting of one- to three-hour sessions for each country or group of countries presenting their reports (BURs) followed by questions and answers by other parties to the UNFCCC.

The historic climate summit in Paris (COP21, December 2015) included an agreement, which requires countries to be more transparent about their climate actions than ever before, and has new provisions to hold them accountable. Countries are universally required to report their progress on reducing greenhouse gas emissions (mitigation), building climate resilience (adaptation), and better tracking the support they provide or receive in terms of fnance, capacity building and technology transfer. V. CURRENT REPORTING FRAMEWORKS UNDER THE UNFCCC A Review of Domestic Data Sources for Climate Finance Flows in Recipient Countries 34 Reporting on climate fnance is particularly useful in assessing the deployment of climate fnance and in assessing the distribution of public and private fnancial support and climate fnancing priorities for countries in the context of the international targets and the national needs. As part of Article 13 of the Paris Agreement, a transparency framework was established with the aim of shedding light on the received and provided support by individual Parties and to inform on the aggregate fnancial support provided. This established a process to verify the data and information on both climate actions and ways countries provide support for a transition to a low greenhouse gases and climate-resilient development. A key condition for successful implementation of the Paris Agreement\u2019s transparency requirements is the provision requiring adequate and sustainable fnancial support and capacity building. This will enable developing countries to signifcantly strengthen or scale up their eforts to build robust domestic and international measurement, tracking, reporting and verifcation systems, as well as more robust domestic and regulatory processes. Parties to the UNFCCC, as part of the Paris Agreement also launched the Capacity Building Initiative for Transparency (CBIT), to be funded through contributions by developed countries, to help developing countries to create or enhance the domestic tools and institutions they need to meet these obligations. The commitment of CBIT is to strengthen institutional and technical capacities of developing countries. It identifes the need to capacity building on climate reporting, transparency process and modalities. The Paris Committee on Capacity Building was also set up to oversee a four-year work program to boost the capacity building activities needed to implement the Paris Agreement. The work program will, for instance, identify and provide recommendations on addressing capacity gaps and needs, promote the dissemination of tools and methodologies for capacity building, and explore how developing countries can take ownership of building and maintaining capacity over time. Although the provisions included in the Paris Agreement (Article 9 and 13) refer to the work of developed countries, there is an explicit invitation to \u201cother parties\u201d to do so and collaborate in the improvement of the transparency framework. In this sense, for the frst time, all parties will report regularly on their emissions and implementation eforts, and undergo international review. These transparency mechanisms will provide information necessary to track parties\u2019 progress in implementing their nationally determined contributions to the new treaty, and will help strengthen parties\u2019 capacities to measure and understand their own eforts. The Article 9 points out that: a) \u201cDeveloped country Parties shall biennially communicate indicative qualitative and quantitative information... including, as available projected levels of public fnancial resources to be provided to developing country Parties. Other Parties providing resources are encouraged to communicate biennially such information on a voluntary basis\u201d, and b) \u201cDeveloped country Parties shall provide transparent and consistent information on support for developing country Parties provided and mobilize through public interventions biennially in accordance with the modalities, procedures and guidelines to be adopted by the Conference of the Parties...\u201d (UNFCCC, 2015: 14). V. CURRENT REPORTING FRAMEWORKS UNDER THE UNFCCC A Review of Domestic Data Sources for Climate Finance Flows in Recipient Countries 35 On the other hand, Article 13 established that \u201cdeveloping country Parties should provide information on fnancial technology transfer and capacity building support needed and received under the Articles 9, 10 and 11\u201d (UNFCCC, 2015: 17-18). The transparency processes will feed into a global stocktake, which will assess collective progress towards meeting the Paris Agreement\u2019s long-term goals. The UNFCCC Standing Committee on Finance (SCF) already conducts biennial assessments of climate fnance fows and will be tasked with overseeing the global stocktaking exercise. The reporting of climate fnance information is therefore an important part of the transparency framework where the provision of information will be the base for building trust among parties. In that sense, it becomes signifcant that the information comes not only from developed countries but also from developing countries, since this is the only way to obtain a full picture about the fnancial fows related", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "db715765-4189-480b-adc8-5526e33374a4": {"__data__": {"id_": "db715765-4189-480b-adc8-5526e33374a4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-domestic-data-sources-climate-finance-flows-recipient-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Review of Domestic Data Sources for Climate Finance Flows in Recipient Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-domestic-data-sources-climate-finance-flows-recipient-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d96eb557927ea6c20fc16184d59038918a9c490c10f17b52a2e8f313cf460cbd"}, "3": {"node_id": "7bfbc67a-dc5a-4fc2-a992-7f1575713136", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-domestic-data-sources-climate-finance-flows-recipient-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4408526367fd11688606478ba27da0abb2a8a87f70983e8b52392265c429bdba"}}, "hash": "bbf22fe6e128a725ded360ed4b7fa69adad4651993d65b7f7b6afbc6a9eff98f", "text": "to climate fnance.

This report provides a timely scan of the status of reporting and sources of data within developing countries in order to identify entry points for capacity building support for developing countries to strengthen their contribution to the Paris Agreement\u2019s transparency initiative. 4.2 Reporting status in selected countries In the case study countries, it is clear that full compliance with the UNFCCC\u2019s reporting system has been evolving and adapted to the capabilities of the parties, table 8 shows the status of reporting in the selected countries, which demonstrates that the countries have been progressing in the same direction but at diferent levels, speeds and periods.

CURRENT REPORTING FRAMEWORKS UNDER THE UNFCCC The frst reporting tool is the National Communication (NatComms). The NatComms were established to present, in a comprehensive way, the status of the countries\u2019 eforts to address climate change. They usually include a summary of the national greenhouse gases (GHG) inventory, the analysis of the vulnerabilities of the countries, the impacts of climate change, but also the actions that the country have taken to face climate change. As the Table above shows, all selected countries have presented their Initial and Second NatComms to the UNFCCC. In most of the cases, more than 10 years were needed between the Initial and the Second Nat Comm. Most countries have sited the lack of technical and fnancial resources needed to prepare the reports. At present, most of the selected countries are in the initial phase of the preparation of their Third NatComm. Colombia, has had the most progress, having prepared a draft that will be submitted in July of 2017. Guatemala, Philippines and Zambia are preparing the proposals for the formulation process to get funding (mainly through GEF, supported by UNDP). Of the six countries, only Colombia has presented a Biennial Update Report (BUR). In the case of the Philippines and Zambia, for example, when asked why the countries had not presented any BUR, they cited a lack of fnancial and technical capacity to prepare the report. They indicated that they have focused their eforts on the presentation of the second NatComm and on improving internal technical capacities. 36 V. CURRENT REPORTING FRAMEWORKS UNDER THE UNFCCC A Review of Domestic Data Sources for Climate Finance Flows in Recipient Countries VI. Reporting of climate fnance in selected countries 5.1 Defnition of climate fnance in reporting tools Climate fnance and particularly climate fnance for adaptation are new areas of analysis among most developing countries including those covered by this study, not only within governments but also within non-governmental actors. The lack of a clear defnition about what counts as climate fnance was mentioned as the major challenge in this topic. Normally, the diference between climate fnance and fnance for traditional development aid is not clear, as well as it is not clear to what extend climate fnance must be diferentiated from business as usual activates and additional activities.

In the second communication, all six countries referred somehow to climate fnance.

In the case of the NDC, all six countries mentioned the need of fnancial resources for the implementation of the diferent proposed actions, but only Zambia included fgures related to the needed investment of its NDC (USD 50 billion, being USD 30 billion for mitigation and USD 20 billion for adaptation).

In the case of Kenya, there are sectors and actions identifed and each action includes a budget as well as the institutions related to its implementation. Developing countries usually stress their needs on adaptation fnance, but fnding clear ofcial information about it is not so easy, since the defnition of what is climate fnance for adaptation is a major challenge. Table 11 identifes if countries have reported or referred specifcally to adaptation fnance in the reporting tools. Regarding fnancial needs, as mentioned before, Zambia identifed the resource needs to be able to implement the adaptation component of its NDC. According to interviews, the USD20 billio fgure was identifed through a participatory process, which included government and non-governmental stakeholders. It was estimated considering the past and current losses that the country has sufered. This normally is the way countries calculate their needs, as they don\u2019t often have reliable information about climate scenarios and projections tailored to their national circumstances.

REPORTING OF CLIMATE FINANCE IN SELECTED COUNTRIES A Review of Domestic Data Sources for Climate Finance Flows in Recipient Countries 41 5.3 Identifcation of sources for reporting on climate fnance and fnance for adaptation At the national level, all the case study countries have information systems that were created to track the public expenditure of the countries, as well as international cooperation. However, the quality, desegregation and transparency of the systems vary considerably among the countries. Some have very accessible systems and datasets since they are part of the fnance ministry\u2019s website -which is public-, however in general the disaggregation of information is not always adequate for precise tracking of climate activities and their fnancial fows. Additionally, the information presented refers mainly to the national level or central government, excluding subnational levels, which makes it difcult to track the allocation of resources down to the local level. The exception is Nepal which has made some attempt to focus its climate expenditures at the local level. 5.3.1 National sources At the national level, important sources of information related to climate fnance channeled through the budget and public fnancial management systems are the Finance Ministries and National Banks. Table 12 shows sources of information where it is possible to look for data about climate fnance (budget and expenditures). It is important to mention that in these systems there is not necessarily a budget code or tag which systematically identifes climate change related expenditures, but there has been an attempt to quantify these expenditures at some point. Some of the countries are now already working on reforms to the budget tracking systems to put in a specifc tag or code to track climate change activities and expenditures. VI.

The main International sources of information are represented by data sets of multilateral and regional banks, and international organizations. Table 14 below presents some of these datasets, which have been used or have good potential to be used for the countries. VI. REPORTING OF CLIMATE FINANCE IN SELECTED COUNTRIES 46 Although most of the countries are aware about reporting systems such as the one created by the OECD related to fnance for development and climate fnance, the countries are not familiar with the defnition of climate fnance and the methodologies used to identify climate relevant portion of ODA nor are they clear about its applicability to the national context. The study also identifed that countries don\u2019t want to rely only on approaches created by donor countries but they would like to have a way to adapt the guidance to the national context. In that the case study countries, Colombia is the only country that has a methodology to classify and measure climate fnance that uses both national and international approaches. On one hand the methodology uses the OECD Rio Markers and the Multilateral Development Banks approach to identify climate change related activates, but it also uses a national approach to identify what at the policy level has been defned as climate change. This hybrid approach has given to the country a tool to track all sort of fnancial sources to be reported in their MRV system for climate fnance. 5.4 Identifcation of complementary data set Climate fnance tracking is an activity that has been done not only in the context of the governmental activities, but also by other non-governmental and international actors that aims to identity the climate fnance gaps. Complementary information about climate fnance and fnance for adaptation has been developed using a number of data bases to create initial baselines about the status of the climate fnance fows.

In most of the non-governmental exercises the information used to complete the reports are public available data, however some organizations have managed to established agreements to access to information under protection clauses, which helps to increase the data analyzed. The aim in the future is to achieve high levels of transparency in the climate fnance data that need to be accessible to a general public. 5.4.1 Public climate fnance report at the national level: CPEIR and GFLAC experiences Negotiations at the CoP have emphasized the growing need for climate fnance which in turn demanded a better understanding of the climate related fnancial fows transferred to developing countries, not only from a donor perspective but also and more importantly from the recipient country perspective. In this regard, there are two initiatives that have been working in the support of countries to create their climate fnance maps in order to understand the fnancial gaps and opportunities. UNDP has developed a methodology to analyze public expenditure and the institutional framework of developing countries related to climate change called the Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Reviews (adapted from World Bank public expenditure reviews). The methodology which uses a nationally developed defnition of classifying climate fnance has now been applied in over 30 countries These exercises have been taking place within governments with the technical support of the UNDP and in some cases jointly with World Bank and ODI. 5.4.2 CPEIR studies in selected countries Negotiations at the CoP have emphasized the growing need for climate fnance which in turn demanded a better understanding of the climate related fnancial fows transferred to On the other hand, GFLAC is a non-governmental initiative that has as a goal to support the creation of MRV systems for climate fnance as well as to support countries to build strong fnancial architectures based in national strategies on climate fnance. The GFLAC has developed a methodology to track climate fnance since 2008. The methodology of GFLAC was created independently but it provided a hybrid approach, taking as a based the Rio Markers and the work done by the MDBs join report, but bringing the national perspective regarding climate change, having a top down and a bottom up approach. GFLAC\u2019s methodology has been applied in 8 countries in Latin America and it was the based for the construction of the methodology of the MRV in Colombia. Although GFLAC was created to support the work of non-governmental entities related to climate fnance, it has been increasing the amount of work done in collaboration with governments in the region.

VI. REPORTING OF CLIMATE FINANCE IN SELECTED COUNTRIES 48 Both approaches, CPEIR and GFLAC\u2019s approach, have been working together in cases such as Colombia to build a dataset for national climate fnance fows. In general CPEIR and GFLAC have found that there are three major challenges in the climate fnance exercises: 1. There is a need of guidance to identify what is climate fnance and how to apply this in practice; 2. There are major gaps in terms of capacities to work in climate fnance tracking, as a result only public fnance is currently being tracked (both domestic and international); 3. Recently attempts to track private fnance have been underway (GFLAC and UNDP\u2019s LECB programme) but this has been extremely difcult to track due to the lack of information; 4 There is a major necessity to create periodic and systematic eforts to do this type of monitoring exercises, because the information gets old/obsolete very quickly and in order to create analysis and assessment that measure changes over time, it is necessary to do these reports in a period basis. Some countries such as Nepal who have instituted a climate budget tag can now begin to generate annual public expenditure data from their budget information management system.

Colombia is also currently the only country that is developing the \u201cmap of investments\u201d, which is the public site where all the information about fnancial fows from public investments will be reported.

It is more developed for mitigation, but currently they are expanding it to cover adaptation actions, including means of implementation (CCC, interview). 5.6 Overall Assessment of climate fnance in reporting tools As it was identifed in previous sections, the reporting on climate fnance and particularly fnance for adaptation is very recent for all case study countries. In the National Communications, climate fnance in general, was not included in the frst ones. Only in recent versions of the NatComms is climate fnance referred to, but the information is not clear enough in terms of the actual costs due to loss and damage, future fnancing needs, and/or VI.

Where the reference to climate fnance was included, the reports mainly identify the fnancing needs for the implementation of mitigation actions. Information on fnance for adaptation is much less developed. In the second communications, two countries (Colombia and Nepal) clearly mentioned the need of fnance for adaptation, but without including fgures. The others, included adaptation actions to be implemented, but did not mention the specifc need for fnance. The NAPAs of Zambia and Nepal included the amount of resources needed to implement the proposed projects/programs. In the NDCs, only Zambia defned a fgure for fnancing the adaptation component. In country interviews identifed the lack of information on climate projections and scenarios at the national level as a barrier to identifying the fnancing needs for adaptation. If the future impacts of climate change at the country and sub-national level are unknown, is difcult to estimate the costs of potential damages due to climate change and the needs for adaptation. Nevertheless in the interviews ofcers indicated a willingness to include climate fnance information in future NatComm and other reporting systems and suggested that methodologies to guide such eforts is needed.

Common lessons and challenges VII. COMMON LESSONS AND CHALLENGES 51 The analysis shows that there are common challenges across the six countries regarding reporting on climate fnance and climate fnance for adaptation, in particular. These challenges are at the national (domestic) level and at the international level. This section outlines the most relevant common challenges identifed across the countries. 6.1 National level According to most of the interviews the major challenge with reporting climate fnance fows at the national level is related to lack of both international and national guidance to identify which information should be reported and how. For example, developed countries under the UNFCCC reporting guidelines have the common tabular format (CTF), which has greatly improved consistency and comparability of reports from Annex 1 countries. Developing countries do not have such a format to follow and guidance on NatComms and BURs remains too broad for consistent application across all countries. Other challenges related to the analysis and use of information related to the public expenditure was also identifed. Some of the most common challenges are: \u2022 Limited or weak institutional arrangements and internal capacities to track climate fnance: Technical and institutional capacity barriers, such as limited skills, expertise and institutional capacity for climate fnance reporting and verifcation are prevalent even though most of the countries consider climate fnance as a priority element to achieve climate action. Only in recent years the topic has begun to be integrated into national debate and there is limited progress on creating institutions, policies and legal frameworks related to climate fnance in the selected countries. Only a few countries have established institutions that coordinate climate fnance issues, while others are still in the earliest stages of defning the construction of a fnancial architecture to deal with the topic, which would also allow better coordination of information coming from diferent ministries and governmental and non- governmental entities. With the advent of the GCF the NDA could begin to take on some of this function in relation to accessing global climate fnance but other institutions are still required to track domestic fnance from public and private sources. In Colombia, the National Department of Planning leads the Committee of Financial Management (Comit\u00e9 de Gesti\u00f3n Financiera) to promote synergies around climate fnance matters among several public and private institutions. The Climate Change Commission of the Philippines mentioned that they have focused on building internal capacities to be able to report on climate change and climate fnance.

Colombia is working in an integral MRV system for climate fnance that refects public expenditure, international public fnance and private fnance. In the case study countries it was clear that there remains a lack of funding, technical expertise, and data to comply with existing reporting requirements. Fulflling enhanced requirements would require extensive capacity building. An example of the above is refected in the fact that only 34 developing countries had submitted biennial update reports (BURs) to the COP by December 2015 and few even have experience with ICA. In most of the interviews it was pointed out that governments hire external consultants for the preparation of the COP reporting tools. This added to staf turnover leading to poor institutional memory and erosion of any internal capacity building eforts. \u2022 Lack of defnition on climate fnance: there is a lack of guidance, methodology or defnition about what type of activities can count as climate change action to which a budget can be attributed in the public expenditure records. Tagging activities sometimes depend on the subjectivity of the technician in charge. Only Philippines has made good progress in regards to the defnition of adaptation fnance and Climate Budget Tagging (CBT). Guatemala and Zambia are in the early stages of developing budget codes to be included in the fnancial information system, while Colombia is the only country that has articulated a methodology to classify and measure climate fnance. \u2022 Lack of unifed and systematized information on climate fnance: there are no databases to integrate all the information about climate change programs and investments and the related fnancial fows. The information tends to be dispersed among various entities involved in managing public expenditure and international projects \u2013 often ministries of planning, external relations departments in ministries of foreign afairs etc. and that does not include data on private fnance. There are databases for public expenditure, but those do not have specifc labels of climate change or ways to identify specifc actions related to the problem. VII. COMMON LESSONS AND CHALLENGES 52 A Review of Domestic Data Sources for Climate Finance Flows in Recipient Countries Philippines has started to use the CCET at the sub-national level, but challenges on double counting and lack of technical expertise on identifying climate fnance, for example, have been found. \u2022 Limited access to information on present and future climate risks: Financial information is not always accessible or public, and the information that is public is not disaggregated enough to do a detailed analysis on where climate fnance is actually going. In sample countries, it is clear that reports from subnational expenditure add further complexity to the issue. Also, for non-governmental organizations, access to climate fnance information is not easy. Usually, as there are no platforms which facilitate the access and analysis of the information, even in countries where Access to Public information laws are in place (e.g. Guatemala). In the case of Zambia for example, access to part of the information has to be paid (Yellow Book). Other aspects of access to information include the limited access to national climate scenarios and projections, which usually are presented at the regional scale and there is limited capacity in countries to downscale these regional projections. Not having that information available makes the quantifcation of climate fnance, especially for adaptation, very difcult. In practice, governments base their calculations on past and current events which is not sufcient when considering that climate impacts are likely to change in the future and modeling tools are required to consider a range of probabilities. In some cases, the integration of short-medium term projections have also been used. \u2022 Aggregated information: the public systems to report public expenditure are highly aggregated at the national level and it is not possible to know accurately what programs and plans are related with climate change and this results in both over and under estimations of climate fnance fows. This lack of granularity is exacerbated by the limited technical capacity to assess, understand and address the emerging risks brought by climate change and its impact at a technical level frst. Countries are faced with limited institutional capacity at sector ministry level to develop actions, programs and investment options that adequately address climate change and then refect this accurately in sector budgets. The efects of these shortfalls in institutional and technical capacity lead to the absence of climate change reporting mechanisms at a national level. \u2022 Lack of data on efectiveness of the use of climate fnance: The study identifed that even where there are better", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "597fd165-c07f-465a-be5a-30c1a65d606a": {"__data__": {"id_": "597fd165-c07f-465a-be5a-30c1a65d606a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-domestic-data-sources-climate-finance-flows-recipient-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Review of Domestic Data Sources for Climate Finance Flows in Recipient Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-domestic-data-sources-climate-finance-flows-recipient-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "467660e95a0fe8780c8d0f5a759c6cda3c738eb3b0e814cf9575e78335af106f"}}, "hash": "467660e95a0fe8780c8d0f5a759c6cda3c738eb3b0e814cf9575e78335af106f", "text": "systems to track public expenditure, these systems failed in their function to track the extent to which climate fnance is being deployed in compliance with public policy or national climate policy or strategies. The introduction of results based budgeting is an area in progress that is not yet commonly applied in the feld of climate change and is not evidently in action in any of the case study countries. VII. COMMON LESSONS AND CHALLENGES 53 The Philippines has revised the typologies used in the CCET system in order to align it to the outcome-based budgeting of the Department of Budget and Management, as well as to the result-based monitoring and evaluation systems established for the National Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP). \u2022 Misunderstandings about the scope of adaptation fnance: there is a constant problem to defne the climate change defcit in what could be characterize as an adaptation activity. This is particularly the case in the context of the natural disaster risk and development agendas, since these have a relationship to climate change adaptation but cannot be counted fully as climate fnance. This is even more difcult to identify in public expenditures since these tend to be huge programs and if they are counted as climate fnance, the estimations related to climate fnance could increase signifcantly. 6.2 International level There are challenges in regards to the understanding and systematization of information related to climate fnance, received from international cooperation and other global mechanisms for climate fnance. \u2022 Lack of common understanding or definitions of climate finance: most interviewees mentioned that the lack of global common understanding, defnitions or guidance of what can be accounted as climate fnance represents a challenge when working on climate fnance generally and particularly for adaptation. This leads to misunderstandings between donors and recipients. There are international reporting methodologies such as the Rio Markers, but donors use them according to their own judgment, creating confusion about the activities that should be counted as climate fnance or not. These same donors use the CTF, but there is not a mandate to use it in developing (recipient) countries in order to verify receipt of funds. The CIT also presents information with a limited level of disaggregation. Any future modalities for accounting for climate fnance under the UNFCCC should consider the lessons learned from these international exercises. \u2022 Articulating and meeting adaptation fnance gaps: adaptation to climate change remains the top priority to reduce vulnerability and enhance resilience of the social and bio-physical systems, especially of vulnerable communities and groups, however the climate fnance identifed has mainly supported mitigation actions. Global tracking of climate fnance fows has been useful to identify this discrepancy. Further fnancial support could be allocated to support countries to better articulate the adaptation fnance gap, responding to the priorities (measures, sectors, areas) identifed by the countries. \u2022 Incomplete data: for many projects in donors reports, there is no fnancial information available, rather just a title, and sector. On the other hand, existing databases mainly account public, bilateral or multilateral fnance, which is managed through the governmental structures, but omits information about climate funding received by non-governmental entities. At the same time information is not clear enough about the inclusion of transaction costs or currency exchange gains or losses that result during transfer from one country to another which could afect the fnal amount of fnance received. Additionally, the information presented is not always clear about the status of VII. COMMON LESSONS AND CHALLENGES 54 A Review of Domestic Data Sources for Climate Finance Flows in Recipient Countries the fnance, if it was committed or actually disbursed. This means that the information on the fow of climate fnance in the countries is not always complete. \u2022 Information not detailed enough at country or project level: data bases of some bilateral and multilateral donors do not include information at the country or project level, which makes it difcult to track fnancial resources in detail. Some donors or fnance sources present the information by region, which is not useful when trying to identify resources allocated to one specifc country. \u2022 Limited indicators of efectiveness of climate related expenditures: It remains necessary to work on indicators that can measure the efective use of the fnancial resources, to make sure that the support is helping to reduce emissions, increase resilience and to build capacities. These indicators can be used to better identify the gaps and the fnancial opportunities, connecting them with actual necessities. VII. COMMON LESSONS AND CHALLENGES 55 VII. RECOMMENDATIONS 56 VIII.

In the frst instance it is necessary to improve national fnancial monitoring systems to capture data systematically and to increase its comparability and accuracy. Some specifc recommendations for the national level (particularly to the Finance, Environment and Planning ministries) and international level (in the context of the UNFCCC) are outlined below. 7.1 National level These recommendations are addressed to Climate Change councils, high-level decision making bodies as well as Ministries of Finance, Environment and Planning \u2022 Establish Institutional Frameworks to address the wider climate change information barriers: Climate fnance data must be based on good climate information and it is important to frst address limited climate observation data and assessment capabilities that support climate reporting and transparency at all levels. In all sample countries, there is a need for institutionalizing climate data collection processes in a manner that will lead to: i. The regular collection of climate information at national, sectoral and sub-national levels; ii. Use of this information in national climate strategies and plans (including NDCs), particularly to defne the fnancing frameworks that will turn policies into fnanced actions iii. The use of good comprehensive data for informing climate reporting mechanisms; and iv.The sharing of information across sectors and with non-governmental organizations and academia, where relevant. A Review of Domestic Data Sources for Climate Finance Flows in Recipient Countries VII. RECOMMENDATIONS 57 \u2022 Adapt and develop nationally owned and harmonized guidance to measure and classify climate fnance: There is a clear necessity to defne an international methodology to track climate fnance but this exercise will also have to adapt to national circumstances. This could be done through national consultation with key sectors to defne what activities within each sector could contribute to deal with climate change from the mitigation and adaptation perspective. \u2022 Develop an Integrated approach for planning and budgeting: The study shows that managing climate fnance needs to be done with a whole of government approach for planning and budgeting. Using instruments such as National Adaptation plans, NAMAs, NDCs and other national strategies for coherent planning and costing over the medium term and linking these to national budget processes is essential for ensuring a robust response to climate change in the medium to long term. National goals and targets in climate change strategies and NDCs need to be refected in the performance and fnancial monitoring systems of the country. \u2022 Establish climate change (adaptation and mitigation) code in the budget: the identifcation of markers or codes to characterize climate change activities in the public expenditure is a necessity. This will allow countries to systematically produce climate expenditure reports as a matter of course in the national budgets. Countries such as the Philippines, Nepal, Kenya, Zambia and Colombia have been progressing towards the inclusion of a climate sensitive expenditure within the national budget. This budget code should translate to annual reporting on climate fnance or climate related expenditures that will support global reporting at the UNFCCC especially for the non-conditional targets in countries\u2019 NDCs. The annual reports will also go a long way in providing information to analyse trends in climate investments over time. This is important for national planning purposes and tracking their own progress on adaptation. \u2022 Develop climate fnance Frameworks and fnancing strategies: Findings from the study underscore the need to create climate fnance strategies that include prioritization of actions to deal with climate change at the national level, and connect this with private and international fnancial resources to increase the efectiveness of national actions in addressing climate change. A climate fnance framework or strategy allows a country to clearly articulate the fnancing needs in a country and provides fnancing strategies and instruments to guide how a country will go about meeting its fnancing needs. The case of Colombia is considered as a successful experience that can guide countries towards a better understanding of climate fnance at the national level. Their methodology is based in international standards such as the Rio Markers but also considers the national policy circumstances to connect better funds with necessities. Guidance of the IPCC work in this manner, since the guidance support the work but these are applied according to the national circumstances. The Philippines has also established Climate Change Expenditure Tagging (CCET) within the national budget system. The operational defnitions that the system uses were established under the People\u2019s Survival Fund Act and revised by Joint Memorandum Circular from the DB and CCC (2013 and 2015).

Further support for development of climate fnancing frameworks can be found at https://www.climatefnance-developmentefectiveness.org/topic/climate-change- fnancing- frameworks-ccf In 2016, Colombia started the development of the MRV system on climate fnance (which is part of the comprehensive MRV system that includes the GHG inventory and the reduction measures) that allows the analysis of the fnancial fows that comes from diferent sources (public, private, national and international) that are allocated to deal with climate change. The MRV is a tool that helps the systematization, centralization and visualization of the information related to climate fnance. The construction of the system required several steps: 1) Defnition of a methodology for measuring climate fnance; 2) Application of the methodology; 3) Creation of a digital platform to report the information; 4) appropriation of the system and 5) verifcation. \u2022 Establish clear institutional arrangements for monitoring and tracking means of implementation. Establishing an MRV system on climate fnance nationally should be a priority for all countries. Creating measuring, reporting and verifying systems that can provide an information matrix and platform for national dialogue on climate fnance is benefcial for both international and domestic reporting and transparency. This can include data on climate projections, estimates of national losses and damages due to climate risks, costs of adaptation and mitigation actions as well as all the information about fnancial fows (national, international, public and private), which is reported in the same level of detail to make information comparable over the time. This information system should be public and accessible to all. The information should include details such as the source of funding, title of the funding, title of the project (including in original language), amount pledge, timeframe of disbursement, department, ministry or entity to implement the project, and sector among other general information. Colombia and the Philippines were the only countries in the sample which were in the middle of the development of an MRV for climate fnance. In the case of the Philippines, they are trying to improve the MRV developed for mitigation, integrating adaptation. It is important that MRV systems for climate fnance are aligned with systems to track other means of implementation such as capacity building and technology transfer. MRV systems for GHG inventories and M&E of adaptation should also be factored into the national MRC systems. The study showed that the countries that have dedicated institutions or entities to deal with climate fnance matters are more successful in developing fnancing strategies. It is recommended that the entities dedicated to planning or fnance aspects take the lead in this regard. This entity can be the one coordinating the dialogue among other parties including the private sector. A Review of Domestic Data Sources for Climate Finance Flows in Recipient Countries VII. RECOMMENDATIONS 59 \u2022 Invest in tailored capacity building support and develop incentives to retain staff with good technical capacity: All stakeholders interviewed in the sample countries emphasized the need to have both periodic and sustained (on-the job) capacity building support processes related to climate fnance tracking and policy monitoring. This could be done through periodical courses within and outside the government, particularly within the fnance ministries, but in general in the fnance or budget units of all the sector ministries that are related to climate change. Exchange programs and south-south cooperation were also identifed as a means to increase capacities between and within countries. The most urgent need identifed, however, was for hands on coaching and on-the-job training for the key institutions responsible for reporting on climate fnance and MRV of support to the COP. This recommendation is addressed to national institutions which deal with climate fnance issues, such as the Finance, Planning and Environmental Ministries, with support of international institutions. 7.2 International level \u2022 Develop clear guidelines for reporting on climate fnance (MRV of support) for countries to use: This includes providing terms of reference for the creation of measuring, reporting and verifcation systems on climate fnance that are applicable to all the parties based in the common but diferentiated responsibilities and capacities principle.

This would reduce the dependency on external consultants when reporting on climate fnance. As there are countries, such as the Philippines or Colombia, which have good progress on reporting on climate fnance and MRV, south-south cooperation programs could be a way to enhance the capacity of developing countries. The CBIT could provide a good opportunity to build capacities across national governmental and non-governmental actors, but it is necessary to include follow up processes to ensure that the capacities built are sustained. A second avenue for this support is to include the development of MRV systems for fnance and other means of implementation into GCF readiness and NAP readiness programmes. Any climate fnance readiness support should result in the establishment of national and sub-national institutions, systems and processes for improved reporting on climate fnance fows. Within the Ministry of Finance, Zambia has established the Interim Inter-Ministerial Climate Change Secretariat, which functions as the hub of information related to climate fnance. VII. RECOMMENDATIONS 60 \u2022 Continue to improve transparency of donors\u2019 information: Donors should make available all details related to climate funding and how it is expended in the national and local level. Information on resources allocated through non-governmental agents should be also made available (including transactional costs). This will help create a better overview of all climate fnance going to developing countries. The information should be available in a global platform (maybe facilitated by the UNFCCC such as the planned global stock take), but also included in national platforms on climate fnance. Some examples of information to be provided are: \u203a Identifcation of type of action (mitigation, adaptation, both) \u203a Identifcation of type of adaptation actions (infrastructure, capacity building, etc.) \u203a Identifcation of sources of fnancing \u203a Identifcation of fnancial instruments used \u203a Identifcation of sectors supported \u203a Identifcation of type of recipient (government, CSOs, private sector) \u203a Identifcation of specifc amount related to climate change (weighting) Development partners can further enhance transparency and accountability under the Paris Agreement by pursuing ways to: \u203a Empower citizens and wider stakeholders to participate in the design of global and national reporting processes and the international verifcation process; \u203a Provide better access to information to enable informed engagement and efective evidence-based decisions; \u203a Highlight the co-benefts for countries\u2019 sustainable development eforts. \u2022 Continue to address the balance between mitigation and adaptation finance: All countries noted that the balance of fnancial allocations for mitigation and adaptation has to be addressed and is being addressed in the GCF for example which has a 50:50 split. However, allocation of sources of fnance for capacity building programs and technology transfers that have impacts on both adaptation and mitigation activities need to also be balanced. In some countries, for example Zambia, it was identifed that most of the resources are allocated to mitigation. Also, more investment of resources (including technical) are needed for a better identifcation of the options for and costs of adaptation measures, which can help countries to mobilized more resources for adaptation. 7.3 Recommendations for work to be done under the UNFCCC 7.3.1 Subsidiary Body of Technology and Scientifc Advisory (SBSTA): \u2022 Develop modalities for accounting climate finance: Currently the SBSTA is leading a process to create modalities for accounting climate fnance. This work has to be complete in 2018. The modalities aim to guide the work of developed countries. However, since the Paris Agreement calls for the voluntary participation of developing countries in the provision of information on climate fnance, it is recommended that developing countries also be in a position use these modalities as guidance to complete their fnancial information for the preparation of reporting schemes under the UNFCCC. It is A Review of Domestic Data Sources for Climate Finance Flows in Recipient Countries VII. RECOMMENDATIONS 61 recommended that the Convention establish these modalities as general guidance for all parties reporting on climate fnance and should be applied according to the capacities of the countries. The basic information that the modalities should include based on the analysis done in this research are: 1. Guidance about the sectors and activities that count as climate fnance.

However, this study shows that it is important to recognized that the type of instruments also have implications on accountability. For instance, countries getting loans retain responsibility to pay later and therefore they should be counted as the source of the fnance fows. 3. Guidance in the type of climate fnance fows counted. The reporting and accountability of climate fnance should be strengthened regarding the climate fnance actually disbursed (and spent) and not just about the commitments, since the last could misguide the tracking analysis. 4. Guidance about the type of receptor. An important amount of climate fnance has been allocated to governmental entities, however there is a growing amount of fnancial support going towards civil society organizations as well as private sector and others. Therefore, accountability should include all stakeholders to capture the full picture of climate fnance fows. Actors besides governments should be encouraged to be part of the accountability process at both national and international levels. For example, each country can have a mechanism to track non-governmental spending on climate change actions which can be separately included in the NatComms. This information, together with information related to governmental expenditures, will give a better overview of resources received by the country. 5. Guidance applicable to private sector: The private sector plays a major role in climate fnancing and any type of modalities should be applicable to these actors in other to establish the basis for a comprehensive MRV at the global level. 7.3.2 StandingCommitteeonFinance(SCF): The Standing Committee on Finance was created \u201cto assist the Conference of the Parties in exercising its functions with respect to the fnancial mechanism of the Convention in terms of improving coherence and coordination in the delivery of climate change fnancing, rationalization of the fnancial mechanism, mobilization of fnancial resources and measurement, reporting and verifcation of support provided to developing country Parties;\u201d (Article IV, Cancun Agreement, 2010: 16). The SCF has been progressing in the analysis of climate fnance fows mainly through the publishing of the BA 2014 and 2016. In recent years, there has been a push to better articulate the global MRV system beyond the biannual report. VII. RECOMMENDATIONS 62 Taking into consideration the climate fnance information gaps of the last version of the Biennial Report presented in 2016, four major activities to be done in the context of the SCF were identifed. 1. Coordination of the debate about modalities of accountability for climate fnance: The SCF has been discussing technical aspects for the assessment of climate fnance fows and, based on the results, the SCF should lead the co-ordination of discussion on the modalities on accountability of climate fnance learning from the gaps and lessons learned of the BA 2014 and 2016. 2. Design of a global MRV for both GHG emissions and MRV of Support (fnance, technology and capacity building): The SCF in collaboration with the Secretariat of the UNFCCC should design a MRV system that works globally where all the information from the diferent sources in which fows of climate fnance should be reported under the same guidance. The information should come from public, private, national and international sources. The UNFCCC has created a climate fnance portal that contains information provided for the parties, which could be a good starting point, however it needs signifcant changes to ensure the provision of accurate, transparent and comparable data. For instance, it would be important to ensure the provision of information from all parties and other entities interested in climate fnance, such as multilateral development banks, private investors and other actors. Information should be provided under the same modalities to ensure the comparability of the data. This system could also transition towards an accountability tool to support the transparency initiative where people can access information by project to assess their progress. 3. Design of climate fnance reporting formats: the Common Tabular Format (CTF) is an exercise that has been guiding the work of developed countries in the provision of information, however they have not been used in the same way across donors. There is a need to strengthen the formats to provide detailed information at the project level, these formats can also be integrated as accountability tools for the preparation of the Nat Coms and BURs, as well as other reporting schemes that exist under the UNFCCC that can be used by developing countries.

In the case of developing countries they should also use this format to report both how much fnance was received from international cooperation and how much countries allocate through their own public expenditures at the national level. 4. Creation of debates under the UNFCCC: The SCF has been creating spaces to debate technical inputs related to climate fnance. This initiative is well recognized and appreciated. The organization of debates in the context of the SCF could be a way to defne the needs and the tools to be developed in coming years. Two major topics to be discussed in their forums are: \u203a Climate fnance and NDCs: the importance of the creation of national fnancing strategies for the national climate response and to meet agreed targets. \u203a Public expenditure and climate fnance: the role of fnance ministries. In general, the work of the SCF could guide the discussion of the climate fnance defnitions and members can transition towards substantive and technical discussions to contribute to the achievements of the Paris Agreement.

Based on the findings of the UN Multi-Country Study on Men and Violence in Asia and the Pacific1 (2013), P4P promotes and supports violence prevention initiatives and policies. Combining the strengths of four UN agencies \u2013 UN Development Programme, UN Population Fund, UN Women and UN Volunteers (UNV) \u2013 with governments, civil society and support from the Australian government, P4P programmes aim to transform problematic social norms and practices to prevent violence before it occurs.2 P4P\u2019s work supports the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goal to achieve gender equality and empowerment of all women and girls by 2030. Evidence and experiences from P4P contributed toward increased understanding and strengthening of volunteerism within the context of primary prevention of violence against women and girls and promoting safe and vibrant relationships, homes and communities. Partnering with the United Nations Volunteers programme meant incorporating goals to mobilize volunteers and promote volunteerism to support VAWG primary prevention interventions in the P4P programme. Volunteerism is social behaviour or activities undertaken of free will for the general public good and where monetary reward is not the principal motivating factor. Volunteering is also recognized to bring significant benefit to the volunteer as well as individuals and communities or organizations linked to the volunteerism activity.3 It encompasses both formal and informal activities, and local and international volunteers, and covers a broad range of issues. Most volunteers work within their own countries and contribute significantly to local communities by: \u25a0 Being able to access remote areas \u25a0 Building relationships of mutual trust that organizations are often unable to foster \u25a0 Empowering, supporting and developing a stable grassroots base for people to improve their lives \u25a0 Working with local authorities to hold those in power accountable and to represent voices that are often ignored \u2013 such as women and girls. 1 Fulu, E., Warner, X., Miedema, S., Jewkes, R., Roselli, T. & Lang, J. 2013.

In this project, volunteerism almost dominated all aspects of the project\u2026 because of [the volunteers\u2019] passion and desire to devote themselves.\u201d \u2013 An, National UN Volunteer, Viet Nam Description of the P4P II Projects P4P II integrated research findings from Phase I with local knowledge and evidence, as well as international promising practices, into the design of primary prevention programmes at the community level that engage men, boys, women and girls. In Bangladesh, P4P provided capacity- building support for UN volunteers and for national stakeholders. In Cambodia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Viet Nam, pilot interventions were designed with a focus on VAWG primary prevention and the transformation of harmful masculinities through participatory methods and the capacity- building of local and regional organizations to sustain the results of the programme. Bangladesh Two projects were conducted in Bangladesh. UN Women in partnership with Hedda Produktion, Bangladesh National Women Lawyer\u2019s Association, Bangladesh Gender Equality Advocates, and the University Grants Commission implemented a university-based intervention. This intervention included raising awareness, mobilization, engagement of youth groups, and promoting universities\u2019 institutional capacity to address sexual harassment, reaching 28,000 students and 2,900 staff. UNFPA in partnership with UN Women, the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs, Ministry of Education, Plan International Bangladesh, Concerned Women for Family Development, and BBC Media Action adapted Generation Breakthrough. This intervention engaged with adolescents, parents, teachers, sports instructors and community leaders at schools, madrasas and community clubs for adolescents. The intervention address VAWG, and sexual and reproductive health issues. 7 \u00a9 Partners for Prevention 8 Cambodia In Cambodia, the \u2018Building our future: supporting healthy and happy relationships\u2019 intervention was a joint effort of UNFPA Cambodia, UN Women, UNV and the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs (MoWA), with technical support from P4P. The pilot was implemented in five communes in Kampong Cham province in Cambodia and addresses key risk factors for VAWG working with 352 adolescents (ages 12\u201314) and 346 caregivers (e.g. parents, guardians, teachers and youth service providers). The intervention employs a participatory method to transform social norms and harmful masculinities, decrease harsh punishment and increase supportive parenting. Indonesia \u2018Reimay (Reaching Papuan Prosperity)\u2019 is a programme initiated by UNFPA, UN Women, UNV and the International Planned Parenthood Federation of Papua (PKBI), with technical support from P4P, in Papua Province, Indonesia. The pilot intervention engaged 260 adolescent boys and girls (ages 12\u201316) and 60 parents, religious leaders and other influential community members in participatory group sessions, to equip adolescents with gender-equitable attitudes and improve their relationship with their caregivers. The project builds on the existing \u2018Violence Free Villages\u2019 programme which has raised awareness of VAWG in communities and built the capacity of local authorities and civil society to respond to VAWG. Papua New Guinea The Planim Save, Kamap Strongpela (Plant Knowledge, Grow Strong) intervention in South Bougainville, Papua New Guinea, was designed and implemented by UN Women, UNICEF and the Nazareth Centre for Rehabilitation, with technical support from P4P. The project focuses on preventing VAWG and transforming negative gender norms, community peace-building and trauma-healing activities. The project uses a community conversation model that aims to increase awareness, information and conversation on VAWG, trauma and healing, peace-building, and positive relationship skills, working with 716 men and 814 women and reaching currently 2,800 people. Viet Nam In Viet Nam, the \u2018Male Advocate Programme\u2019 was a project of UN Women, UNV, Da Nang\u2019s Women\u2019s Union and UNFPA, with technical support from P4P. The intervention is a year-long programme with 120 youths and older men to transform harmful masculinities and engage men to become male advocates in their communities for VAWG prevention through a volunteerism component.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c22a0bdb-1806-4357-86f9-b58e1c50de7c": {"__data__": {"id_": "c22a0bdb-1806-4357-86f9-b58e1c50de7c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lessons-learned-about-volunteerism-prevention-violence-against-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Lessons Learned about Volunteerism in Prevention of Violence against Women and Girls", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lessons-learned-about-volunteerism-prevention-violence-against-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e8a4f346d3a8829ea8e856258bf61473750ce1a7d717e058fab2e0d7c17e6ac7"}, "2": {"node_id": "77202f37-28a4-4b48-ad4f-6d3466187c29", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lessons-learned-about-volunteerism-prevention-violence-against-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ecbe1fa539ae72928c0a2541757c6334f40eeb7916d357191cef347df7d6ce75"}}, "hash": "9a0bf9f88b774e7ef5ea48b58954a13e951208f193998ab57831f14753bf267d", "text": "It aims to build gender-equitable attitudes, challenge harmful masculinities, build healthy relationship skills, develop an awareness of VAWG issues, and empower young men and older adult men to volunteer in their communities, to lead and engage in violence prevention. 8 9 WHAT DOES VOLUNTEERISM IN THE CONTEXT OF PRIMARY PREVENTION OF VAWG LOOK LIKE? Volunteerism was harnessed in P4P interventions in various ways: \u2022 International and national UN Volunteers were assigned to projects and often stationed in the field to liaise between implementing partners, UN agency country offices and P4P to support the VAWG prevention intervention implementation in various ways. \u2022 Facilitators were often volunteers from the communities where VAWG prevention interventions were piloted. \u2022 Several interventions promoted participants to engage in volunteering activities through formal, structured opportunities or by encouraging participants to define their own volunteerism projects for", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fccd2522-b2f8-4335-8c5a-b0435aa1c390": {"__data__": {"id_": "fccd2522-b2f8-4335-8c5a-b0435aa1c390", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lessons-learned-about-volunteerism-prevention-violence-against-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Lessons Learned about Volunteerism in Prevention of Violence against Women and Girls", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lessons-learned-about-volunteerism-prevention-violence-against-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "30ee76767bb522145b7921dc72d4aabfaed233a8e290d400a71c24069ed07bdd"}}, "hash": "30ee76767bb522145b7921dc72d4aabfaed233a8e290d400a71c24069ed07bdd", "text": "their own communities (described below). \u2022 Several volunteerism efforts grew out of participants\u2019 experiences in VAWG prevention interventions such as helping elderly community members with their food gardens (Bougainville, Papua New Guinea) and sharing skills and ideas from the intervention with family and/or community members (Cambodia, Indonesia and Viet Nam). \u2022 UN Online Volunteers provided technical assistance to P4P such as analysing survey data, developing a communications strategy and developing communication materials (newsletter, stories of success and promotional materials). \u2022 Professional colleagues participated in informal volunteering activities, such as by providing thoughtful peer reviews of P4P knowledge products. It is clear that volunteerism and volunteers played a key role at every level to drive the work of P4P forward. In particular, UN Volunteers played a key role in project coordination and operational or field management that allowed for closer, direct liaison between national and regional partners, as well as stakeholders on the ground. Both UN Volunteers and community facilitators were very motivated and became VAWG prevention and gender equality champions in communities, which greatly benefited the projects they were contributing to because of their deep commitment and positive role modeling in the community. Their commitment and contributions were invaluable. Volunteerism activities in primary prevention interventions Volunteerism activities were implemented within interventions for four main reasons: \u2022 To sustain and expand the results and lessons learned from the intervention \u2022 To raise awareness of VAWG prevention \u2022 To promote a sense of ownership of transformation and VAWG prevention among participants \u2022 To empower and inspire community members to take action in building safe, equitable and happy families and communities. 10 In this picture, Sara Kaigere describes how parents and children in the household should treat each other: parents shouldn\u2019t yell at each other when they are angry and shouldn\u2019t be violent towards their children if there is something they do not want their child to do. It is important to spend time with family and to be willing to listen to each other. Interventions in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia and Viet Nam all provided opportunities for participants to plan and implement a volunteerism project. Bangladesh volunteerism projects incorporated a play, Seven, which presents vignettes of VAWG and gender equality to generate discussion among students and communities, and student-led awareness- raising campaigns on university campuses including seminars, talk shows, cultural events, film festivals and debates. In addition, P4P provided capacity-building and seed funding to UN Volunteers associated with the Generation Breakthrough intervention to lead activities in their communities that raised awareness of and promoted participation in adolescent clubs. In Cambodia, volunteerism included drawing pictures, writing song lyrics, and a writing competition and these finished pieces were then shared with the community. \u201cI was amazed at the spirit of volunteerism of these facilitators. They invested their time and thought to make sure they gave their best as facilitators for the communities in addition to their main duties.\u201d \u2013 Grace, national UN Volunteer, Indonesia \u00a9 Partners for Prevention 11 In Indonesia, activities included youth radio shows, a VAWG awareness booth at an annual cultural festival, soccer tournaments and film showings. In Vietnam, community-based events included quizzes, role-play dramas, and discussions of video clips relevant to VAWG prevention themes. WHY DO PEOPLE ENGAGE IN VOLUNTEERISM? Throughout the project we engaged with various community and UN volunteers to understand their motivations for being involved in various forms of volunteerism linked to the P4P interventions. Many people said they were volunteers because they see the importance of their involvement in contributing to positive transformation and change \u2013 in this case, preventing VAWG and promoting safe, equitable and happy relationships, families and communities. \u201cThe programme emphasized primary prevention \u2026 I just wanted to be a normal volunteer like others and contribute my efforts, ability and time for the good of my community and society. Such contributions are naturally related to my passions, interests, abilities and experiences.\u201d \u2013 An, national UN Volunteer, Vietnam \u201cI came back to volunteerism because I see the importance in volunteerism itself\u2026 Through volunteerism, people can contribute to sustainable development because a volunteer\u2019s work is driven by a strong commitment to make change, not money.\u201d \u2013 Mana, national UN Volunteer, Cambodia \u00a9 Partners for Prevention 11 \u00a9 Partners for Prevention 12 Personal experiences and a desire to help others in similar situations was a reason for some to get involved.

Through the P4P experiences and feedback from community and UN volunteers, it became clear that volunteerism impacted not only on communities but also personally on volunteers in positive ways. Here we share some insights into these impacts. Personal growth and development Volunteerism led to increased growth and development at the individual level. Through ongoing capacity building (e.g. training and refresher workshops and mentoring), local volunteer facilitators demonstrated improved abilities to lead participatory community sessions with creativity, honesty, confidence, patience, understanding and good public speaking skills. Volunteers used innovative \u201cUniversity is a different world. I encountered unpleasant experiences both on and off my campus just because I am a woman. When these events happened, nobody around came forward to help us. I am devoting my time and passion to this programme because I want to see my campus safe.

Luckily, I was one of those kids raised in a democratic, loving and caring family. My childhood experience turned out to be my best strength to work with the communities.\u201d \u2013 Grace, national UN Volunteer, Indonesia 13 measures, such as utilizing local resources and contributions, to produce events and ensure the sustainability of the intervention with a limited budget. UN Volunteers and volunteer facilitators became role models in their communities and realized they needed to embrace the new skills and ideas themselves as part of effecting change in their communities. Volunteers showed increased self-confidence, self-efficacy and a deeper understanding of gender equality and preventing VAWG within their community. Many found their involvement in volunteerism to be personally meaningful and fulfilling in that they could use the skills within their own lives and families and they were proud of making a positive contribution to their communities. Some UN Volunteers described how their own relationships had improved after their involvement in P4P projects because they could apply what they had learned from the project. Through continuous feedback collected from community and UN volunteers, it was evident that volunteerism fostered skills development, was personally valuable, and resulted in general enthusiasm among the volunteers to make a long-term commitment to volunteerism in the community. \u201cI trained myself before I trained others. Through this experience I can whisper to others that my life was meaningful.\u201d \u2013 Facilitator, Indonesia \u201c[T]he programme also made me contemplate my own daily interactions with people and how sociocultural norms shape our way of thinking. It gives me a deeper understanding of violence against women and girls, gender equality, and positive parenting skills which I can apply at home and share with other people around me.\u201d \u2013 Mana, national UN Volunteer, Cambodia \u201cMy assignment allowed me to develop my capacity in managing and advocating [for] the project. I was also able to understand more on the UN system and was given the opportunity to undertake online courses that improved my skills. I was trusted to take part in making decisions for the project, bridging the message and sharing experiences with the implementing partners, and learned from them. The assignment has given me the opportunity to develop professionally. It has been an amazing journey.\u201d \u2013 Grace, national UN Volunteer, Indonesia 13 \u00a9 Partners for Prevention 14 Community development Volunteerism promoted a sense of ownership at the individual and community level of social norm transformation and VAWG prevention for three primary reasons. First, facilitators were volunteers from the community; second, intervention participants themselves designed and implemented community volunteerism projects; and, third, they also shared what they learned more informally within their families and peer groups. Thus, the volunteerism was rooted in the community itself because individuals and communities embraced, led and integrated VAWG prevention and social norm change into their daily lives rather than relegating these concepts, skills, and discussions on these topics to workshops lead by external facilitators. Because community members received extensive capacity-building in evidence-based VAWG prevention and social norm transformation strategies, they are able to continue to use their skills to sustain VAWG prevention and equality-building initiatives in the community. Thus, the community can continue to benefit from and build on the achievements of the pilot intervention projects. The experience in the P4P projects has inspired some volunteers to further their existing volunteerism contributions to their community, particularly in promoting awareness on VAWG.

In Viet Nam, key stakeholders at different levels planned to expand the Male Advocate Clubs to other project communes or integrate the content into existing clubs using the facilitator manual and lessons learned from the intervention. The other critical factor in this programme is that all the intervention participants were also volunteers and included members from the same community. This helped establish a reciprocal approach which benefited both facilitators and participants and encouraged an organic process of continued volunteerism. Through their participation in the intervention and its activities, they inspired others in the community who then became volunteers themselves. The result was a strengthened collective community of action able to address social issues such as VAWG. WHAT ARE THE LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR VOLUNTEERISM IN VAWG PREVENTION PROGRAMMING? In this section the key lessons learned are shared and recommendations are made based on P4P experiences of working with different kinds of volunteers and volunteerism efforts in VAWG prevention in countries in the Asia and the Pacific region.4 Invest in volunteerism and volunteers While volunteerism may be seen as a cost-saving mechanism or volunteers may be seen as temporary team members, it is essential to invest in them in order to reap the benefits that volunteers and volunteerism can bring to a project. In the P4P projects, we found volunteers often needed capacity development and training in key areas such as technical understanding of primary prevention of VAWG and gender equality programming; participatory workshop facilitation skills; and monitoring, evaluation and reporting skills for VAWG prevention programming. When P4P provided opportunities 4 Lessons learned reports are available from: Cambodia, Indonesia, and Vietnam, http://partners4prevention.org/resource/viet- nam-lessons-learned-report-english; \u201cI want to completely eliminate violence against women in my village,\u201d \u2013 Sophea, facilitator, Cambodia 16 for training, mentoring or coaching to develop the volunteers\u2019 capacities, projects were rewarded with more commitment and very valuable inputs from various volunteers. In addition, it was noted that volunteerism efforts need investment in terms of encouraging and coaching communities to develop and implement their ideas and, in some cases, seed funding for community volunteerism activities. By making this investment in volunteerism, it generated a reciprocal investment by volunteers in the work and projects they were part of. Promote a sense of belonging with volunteers Volunteerism is by definition a social behaviour and thus will not thrive in isolation. Volunteers should be considered part of the project team and included in team meetings, mailing lists and team-building activities. Ensuring volunteers have an adequate space to work and the necessary equipment or materials to fulfill their roles is essential. One particularly successful way P4P promoted a sense of belonging and inclusive way of working was to engage volunteers to provide input on documents and reports, invite senior volunteers to write reports, lead processes to revise manuals at the end of the intervention, and provide input to operations or implementation strategy. In addition, P4P gave volunteers the platform to lead initiatives they identified, such as capacity-development activities with facilitators or additional volunteerism activities in communities. Giving volunteers opportunities to contribute to decision-making and project products made them feel part of the team, increased their investment in the project, and further built their capacities. For UN Volunteers, it was important that host agencies acknowledge, respect and engage with them as part of the team. To promote a sense of belonging, P4P facilitated networking between volunteers and especially UN Volunteers based in the different", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6dfc6505-2a67-469f-bf83-b88dfbc630ad": {"__data__": {"id_": "6dfc6505-2a67-469f-bf83-b88dfbc630ad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lessons-learned-about-volunteerism-prevention-violence-against-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Lessons Learned about Volunteerism in Prevention of Violence against Women and Girls", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lessons-learned-about-volunteerism-prevention-violence-against-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1f5e755cb0a9351e96f68434aaca7d4665f2970f97d113b1919f77d5fb17c105"}, "3": {"node_id": "d34e1009-d8c4-4637-b7d8-8d40880f0f0b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/lessons-learned-about-volunteerism-prevention-violence-against-women-and-girls", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a196ee37df0786b8a17776b09666c98e7a22654eafd94c1783484b2644ad2b66"}}, "hash": "06800cd7aa9deaf1bf9e19b5a3013247745d4fbee3613727a35bc8a6330b027f", "text": "countries. This proved to be a successful feature of the P4P programme. This allowed UN Volunteers to have a special network just for people in similar roles with many opportunities to share innovations and learning from each project. This contributed to their ongoing capacity development through sharing lessons learned across countries and also provided them with a supportive, empathic network. Such South\u2013South exchanges are valuable in sustaining and growing evidence-based VAWG prevention programming within this regional context; they have been successful and promoted in other regions.5 Provide regular support, ensure safety and maintain a reasonable workload for volunteers The demands of working on VAWG issues have been well-documented with vicarious trauma being a significant concern.6 It is important to continuously monitor volunteers\u2019 welfare and safety throughout the project with regular supportive supervision and \u2018check ins\u2019. In addition to the topic of VAWG being particularly sensitive and emotionally demanding, the conditions in the work environment can also be stressful. For example, some project locations had particularly difficult transport conditions with poor roads and long distances between sites, significant safety concerns particularly after dark, and unreliable power supply or communication networks, resulting in poor phone, cellphone, or internet connectivity. These challenges cannot always be avoided because they are the conditions of the 5 Dartnall, E., & Gevers, A. 2017.

The network of volunteers involved in the projects proved to be an important source of support and problem-solving for the volunteers when faced with problems or when they needed additional support. Many volunteers demonstrated high levels of commitment and dedication to the projects. This made them vulnerable to being overworked or becoming burnt out. To keep expectations clear for all involved and to minimize the risk of assigning too much work to volunteers, P4P found it useful to have very clear terms of references (TORs) with the UN Volunteers. Some projects applied these to the volunteer facilitators too. It was helpful to foster close working relationships and teams so volunteers felt they could ask for help or to negotiate realistic timeframes for their work. These TORs also introduced a clear accountability mechanism, communicating to volunteers the importance of their role and their position on the team, and also informed capacity-development planning. Recognize and celebrate contributions and achievements of volunteers and volunteerism A key to keeping volunteers motivated and to inspire continued volunteerism is to acknowledge and celebrate all contributions and achievements they have made. These acknowledgements and celebrations should not only be at the end of a project or project phase, but throughout the project to reinforce and show appreciation of the value that volunteers and volunteerism add to VAWG prevention programmes. Recognition can be made in formal and informal ways ranging from government to agency awards or certificates during a ceremony, highlighting their work in project or agency newsletters and in social media stories7 to showing appreciation of them during staff meetings or training sessions. The importance of acknowledgement and celebration of volunteers\u2019 contributions was highlighted during workshops and feedback sessions where UN Volunteers and volunteer facilitators noted how this positive reinforcement and public acknowledgement was very motivating. It helped them know they were making a difference and also that their efforts were greatly appreciated. In January 2017, the Government of Da Nang City formally recognized Phan An, a UN Volunteer based in Viet Nam, for his participation and volunteerism in the P4P programme. Develop a mutually beneficial programme for volunteers It is important to ensure volunteers are benefiting from their experience, just as their contributions are benefiting the project. If there is no reciprocity between the project and the volunteers, their role is unlikely to be fulfilling or valuable.

WHAT\u2019S NEXT FOR VOLUNTEERISM IN VAWG PREVENTION? It is clear that volunteerism and volunteers can make valuable contributions to sustainable VAWG prevention in communities. However, in order to reap these benefits, it is important to manage and actively support volunteers throughout the project and acknowledge the important role that they play. It would be valuable to conduct formal research on the role of volunteerism in the context of VAWG to further understand and quantify the specific contributions to achieving VAWG prevention programming goals and, most importantly, sustaining them. Long-term follow-up studies would be particularly useful to see the extended impact. Integrating volunteerism in VAWG prevention interventions was a relatively new area during the P4P projects. Given the promise that it has shown, it would be strategic to continue to innovate ways to build volunteerism and integrate it into VAWG prevention, especially in ways that would become self-sustaining. Project implementers and communities should be encouraged to document the various forms of volunteerism that are formally promoted and those which organically grow out of community engagement in VAWG prevention. Volunteerism deserves more attention and direct development during the design, planning and implementation of VAWG prevention work.

They continue to be important centres of economic growth and social and cultural melting pots, but many have become very large, polluted, and showing increasing incidence and intensity of multi- dimensional poverty. Cities are also significant consumers of energy and contribute to about 70 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions and waste. Many cities are at high risk of facing natural disasters due to climate change. Addressing these challenges facing cities\u2015especially in the Asia Pacific Region will require the development of innovative solutions that support sustainable development. Towards this end, cities need strong enabling environments that allow their local governments to function more efficiently, competitively and flexibly and to define a development pathway that contributes to achieving The United Nations sustainable development goals agenda. The City Enabling Environment (CEE) Assessment is an attempt at understanding which \u201cenablers\u201d and \u201cactors\u201d underpin the transformation of 21st-century cities and thereby attenuate, drive or simply shape the human, social and environmental challenges playing out in our cities today. The \u2018enablers\u2019 that the assessment examines are \u2018core enablers\u2019-that is, policies, law, institutions and systems of governance, fiscal autonomy, and levels of public engagement that hamper or unleash the potential that urbanisation has for the sustainable development. This CEE assessment in the Asia and Pacific region builds upon similar assessment in Africa in 2013 and 2015 by UCLG Africa. It has been a collaborative effort, led by UCLG ASPAC with the Cities Alliance, conducted through the network of local government associations and professionals. The assessment is an institutional introspection and has provided an opportunity for local government associations in the region to assess the legal and institutional frameworks for cities and to review the policy agenda for services delivery. The peer review process for the CEE assessment was supported by UNDP Bangkok Regional Hub in most countries.

However, more must be done to ensure that the municipal governments have the capacity and autonomy to set their development policies and programmes. In addition, transparency and accountability of municipal governments, and ensuring public engagement in decision-making process still requires attention. Addressing these gaps is crucial to creating more collaborative spaces and enabling environments within the cities for greater citizen engagement and develop solutions for sustainable development. The reports\u2019 findings have been used to outline some policy directions on how to address the gaps identified in the enabling environments at the country level. We hope the knowledge gained can be used to further the conversation on municipal governance systems in the region and aid improvement to urban policies and practices towards the achievement of more sustainable development in cities in the region.

This question provides the focus of this report on City Enabling Environment Rating: Assessment of Countries in Asia and the Pacific, prepared by UCLG ASPAC, and supported by Cities Alliance and UNDP. Preparation of the report has involved a significant collective effort by a large team of authors and peer reviewers. It was conducted through the network of local government associations and professionals throughout the Asia-Pacific region. The City Enabling Environment (CEE) Assessment looks primarily at the legislative frameworks of the enabling environment of cities in 28 Asia and Pacific countries. It also examines other elements related to finance and the environment. The assessment builds upon previous work conducted in Africa by UCLG in 2012 and 2015.

The need to improve enabling environments will be crucial to addressing some of the issues related to the improved functioning and management of cities if the targets of the UN Sustainable Development Goals related to cities are to be met. The findings of this report point to many opportunities for governments at all levels to strengthen enabling environments for Cities in Asia-Pacific countries. The principle challenges as well as areas of opportunity from the study are summarised below: Devolution and Subsidiarity Roles and Responsibilities of Governments Many urban local bodies do not have a strong level of administrative authority, policy and fiscal autonomy, adequate skills, resources, technologies or capacity to play a more direct role in city planning, management and development. Urban local bodies must have a more direct role and responsibility for developing and managing their cities, and be given the responsibility and resources through better vertical fiscal and institutional arrangements. This calls for a fundamental rewrite of governance arrangements between levels of government in many Asia and Pacific countries. Countries such as Bhutan and New Zealand are leading the way in reconceptualising urban local bodies. Integrated Multi-Level Enabling Environments The enabling environment for urban local bodies operates at multiple levels of government. Streamlining administrative, technical and operational services between levels of governments is crucial to avoiding duplication, overlap and conflict between governments and to enable concentration of public resources where they will benefit local economic and social development and improve in productivity and reduce transaction costs. Initiatives such as the creation of a council of national governments and committees, integrated management information systems between levels of governments, and adoption and standardization of operation manuals for line agency officials at differing levels of government are ways in which the integration of multi-level enabling environments in support of sustainable development can be improved. Collaborative Governance Collaborative governance involves government, community and private sectors communicating and working together on policies, planning, programme activities and the like to achieve more than the entities could achieve on their own. The focus of collaborative governance should be on the development of open governance systems, local government resource sharing, open platform databases and shared information systems, research and development, marketing and local economic development, and innovation and technology transfer. Fiscal Decentralisation Local governments in the Asia and Pacific region must be given greater fiscal autonomy to generate revenue and raise capital to develop infrastructure and deliver services that strengthen the capacity and competitiveness of cities. They must also take more responsibility for the management Enabling Environment for Cities and Local Government in Asia Pacific 11 of public finances. Local governments can do this by supporting: participatory budgeting and reporting; powers to raise capital through the issue of stocks, bonds and sub-sovereign loans; public-private partnerships, especially for the provision of community infrastructure; the introduction of credit rating systems for cities to establish creditworthiness; and, annual and 5-year financial plans. Developing and Strengthening e-Enabling Environments The introduction of e-based systems and services has potential to reduce transaction costs and to bring value-add to local economies. It is crucial that local governments develop and strengthen systems that will support the rapid introduction of e-governance, business, libraries, information services, and local government performance reporting. Nations such as South Korea or India are leading the way in key \u201cSmart\u201d platforms to fluidify and facilitate improvements to key elements within the enabling environment. Legislative and Policy Reform Many local government laws, especially those related to finance, public sector management, planning and provision of urban services are outdated and are often in conflict with other laws and regulations. The failure of the regulatory environment is a significant impediment to the efficient operation of urban local bodies and cities. Governments could significantly strengthen the legal framework by undertaking reform of local government laws and regulations, greater use of policies and by-laws to provide flexibility and plain language policy documents. Urban Management and the Enabling Environment Urban management is a term covering the management of a large set of functions that affect the planning, development, efficient operation and maintenance that comprise the urban systems of cities. The core function of the urban local bodies is to provide inhabitants with a liveable environment which addresses a range of factors including the need for shelter, livelihood, entertainment, food and other goods required for healthy living. Urban management should also ensure that the transport, logistics, information and energy systems that run cities are operated", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9d38c7d4-4890-4636-b15c-7c100c14ced1": {"__data__": {"id_": "9d38c7d4-4890-4636-b15c-7c100c14ced1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/city-enabling-environment-rating", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "City Enabling Environment Rating", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/city-enabling-environment-rating", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d65b4dda78e88597437d2b130f07f92c0e023fd936820504d8c2b058c0d8a418"}}, "hash": "d65b4dda78e88597437d2b130f07f92c0e023fd936820504d8c2b058c0d8a418", "text": "and maintained efficiently and effectively. Good urban management elements include: audits and valuations of all public assets and faculties; integrated development planning and development approval systems; operations maintenance of public assets and facilities; and enforcement of planning, building and environment policies and plans. Localising SDGs The localisation of the SDGs at the city and municipal government levels is crucial for achieving the sustainable development agenda. Developing localised sets of SDGs indicators is a necessary step in identifying what needs to be done at the local level. It is also critical for strengthening and monitoring the performance of policies and development programmes. In addition, localising SDGs indicators and collecting data at the local level can help countries to provide accurate aggregated reporting on the 169 targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This can help governments to monitor performance towards achieving the SDGs. National sets of indicators and a template can be developed to measure the enabling environment of cities, to complement the SDGs indicators. Cities can then apply these for collecting information to monitor the performance of the SDGs at the local level. An Agenda for Strengthening City Enabling Environments A multilevel agenda with efforts by all levels of government is required to move forward on implementing reforms and strengthening the legislative and institutional framework for cities in Asia and Pacific countries. An action agenda is necessary at regional, country and local levels. This should not be a new agenda, but one that builds on the existing structures created by the 2030 Agenda, New Urban Agenda, as well as under regional organisations such as APEC, ASEAN and South Asia Free Trade Area (SAFTA), and national plans, policies and urban strategies. This report sets out the agenda for three levels of action to support the development of stronger enabling environment frameworks for city and local governments in the Asia and Pacific region. In adopting an agenda, both horizontal and vertical integration of agenda actions, and the efforts of continued monitoring of the enabling environments provide a useful function to governments in implementing policies in support of sustainable development and achievement of the SDGs. Regional Agenda Global and regional multilateral and bilateral organisations should build on their engagements with countries in the region to advocate for the 12 reforms of policy, legal and political agendas and for recognition of the importance of developing strong local enabling environments that support the core functions and sustainable development of cities. The focus may also be oriented towards policy discourse on greater interconnectedness of the enabling environment of cities to support trade, investment, knowledge and information flow between cities. Country Agenda Global and regional development actors should partner with national organisations, including national, local government associations, for advocacy with urban champions, influencers and policymakers including parliamentarians on the importance of strengthening policy, legal and institutional frameworks. In parallel, local governments (including through the national association of local governments), civil society organisations, development actors should work with central government to develop an agreed set of reporting criteria for urban local body enabling environments. This could help cities and national governments to understand where gaps exist in achieving the SDGs. These criteria should complement the SDGs indicators. Global and regional organisations should also build an inventory of effective policy, legal and institutional frameworks, drawing from the CEE Asia Pacific database, as tools for effective decentralisation. These tools will also enable cities in accessing new opportunities for trade, investment, cooperation, collaboration and information sharing between cities to help overcome economies of scale in accessing new markets for business and trade. City Agenda Urban local bodies in Asia and Pacific countries should monitor the city enabling environment, in addition to the SDGs indicators, in order to achieve the goal of sustainable, inclusive, safe and resilient city. Way Forward of CEE Rating This report on city enabling environment rating has provided a tool to measure country performance based on 11 CEE criteria. It has identified key areas for reform in each country from the scoring against the criteria. The result of the rating may be used in advocacy for strengthened cities and local authorities in the Asia and Pacific region. Furthermore, a regional alliance may be formed for periodic assessment by measuring, every two years, the progress of each country in improving their legal instruments of enabling environment for cities and local authorities.

Assessing the enabling environment for cities in the Asian Pacific Region Cities, globally, are experiencing a period of unprecedented transformational social, economic, governmental as well as, technological and spatial change. More than half the world\u2019s population (4.2 billion people) live in cities and urban areas, of which 2.1 billion live in Asia and Pacific countries.1 By 2050, this is predicted to reach 3.3 billion. Between now and then, advances in technology, knowledge, change in the nature of work, production, governance, practices, communications, climate and social changes are set to bring about significant and unpredictable transformation to the function and development of cities and the way people live in cities in the region. Many local governments are unprepared to manage these transformations and changes. They will need new and continuously adaptable ways to manage cities\u2015especially their enabling environments. This report benchmarks the state of legal, policy and institutional frameworks of cities in Asia and Pacific countries against 11 selected criteria to understand the overall enabling environment that currently exists. The term enabling environment is the \u201cpolitical, economic, policy, social, legal and regulatory systems within which organisations and individuals operate\u201d.2 In other words, it is the broader system within which individuals and organizations function and one that facilitates or hampers their existence and performance. The enabling environment for cities, thus, refers to a range of actors and systems (including administrative systems, institutional arrangements, legal and policy frameworks) that facilitate cities functions, shape policy and decision making, and contribute to the achievement of sustainable development. The actors range from businesses to civil society organisations to private interest groups. They are engaged at various levels (from local to national, and sometimes international) in many different systems (political, economic, social, legal) and where each system is unique yet interconnected with other systems at many levels. This makes strengthening enabling environments for cities a complex and difficult endeavour. In addition, a range of cross-cutting elements also shape the performance and need for improved transparency and inclusiveness within these systems; these include: gender equity, human and political rights, anti-discrimination, accessibility and accountability. Values and culture have a significant bearing on these factors. 1 United Nations, World Urbanisation Prospects The 2015 Revision. 2015, United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division: New York. 2 UNDP(2011), \u2018Practitioner\u2019s Guide: Capacity Development for Environmental Sustainability\u2019, The causes and consequences of weak enabling environments can be explained using problem tree analysis. Figure 1.1 shows a problem tree analysis of the enabling environment problem including the causes and consequences. The core problem is that the enabling environment systems supporting the development and operations of cities in the region are inefficient, ineffective or not well-integrated and are thus not capable of responding to the current and changing demands and needs of business, governments and communities who depend on them. This is caused by a range of factors, some of which are illustrated in the figure. The consequences of cities not investing in improvements to enabling environment systems is a deterioration of conditions in many of those cities, coupled with rising transaction costs, falling productivity and living standards, and failure to protect human rights\u2015especially for the urban poor and disadvantaged. For cities to realise their development potential, there is a need to create enabling environments that promote inclusiveness, create conducive investment environments, support innovation and creativity, uphold the rule of law and practices of good governance, are open to change, are open and transparent, and invest in human capital development and technologies that bring benefits and improve the well-being of all, rather than an elite few. The importance of robust, but adaptive, enabling environments that also imbue the above equalities is crucial to the success of cities achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and the New Urban Agenda. It will also address issues related to equity, inclusiveness, risk mitigation, creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship and opportunity. The enabling environment of cities are shaped by many things. Geographic, historic, social, governance, cultural and economic factors, influence, the scope and scale of development opportunities, competitiveness and potential for development, governance arrangements and investment risks. At the municipal level, better laws and policies are required to ensure enabling environment are", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "045b699c-fe3f-4c56-bdb0-90ac9d5a39e1": {"__data__": {"id_": "045b699c-fe3f-4c56-bdb0-90ac9d5a39e1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/city-enabling-environment-rating", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "City Enabling Environment Rating", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/city-enabling-environment-rating", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dbe9b9ef2483a9e60610cfeab99e8883d207f7a666022770dd3d67ac95e124f2"}}, "hash": "dbe9b9ef2483a9e60610cfeab99e8883d207f7a666022770dd3d67ac95e124f2", "text": "more efficient and effective, especially for urban local bodies to produce and deliver services to all. Cities need to have stronger yet agile municipal governance systems, participatory decision-making processes, improved administrative capacities, and significantly improved control of resources. These aspects of enabling environment give municipalities greater autonomy and responsibility for local decision-making. Thus, the arrangements for the overall policy, legal and, institutional enabling environment is vital to ensure that cities have a more significant role and responsibility in implementing the SDGs and other agenda which support more sustainable urban development and management. Enabling Environment for Cities and Local Government in Asia Pacific 17 For this, effective multi-level and multi-stakeholder governance arrangements, incorporating public and private interests and exchange, is vital. All institutional and legal frameworks need to be guided by the principles of subsidiarity and devolution, which define the roles, responsibilities and resources.3 The importance of dynamic enabling environments to support the operation, management and development of cities was recognised by the Habitat I agenda in 1976. Several international development organisations and agencies have developed indicators for measuring the enabling environment at national and local levels. There is, however, no commonly agreed set of indicators used to measure the effectiveness of enabling environments. This is partly because factors that define enabling environments can vary significantly between countries and are affected by the scope, scale and level of urbanisation, and economic development. Nevertheless, the 3 GTF, 2016, \u2018Local and Regional governments - Shaping the New Urban Agenda\u2019 measurement of enabling environment factors is important in providing insights into what governments at various levels need to do to ensure conditions support competitive, equitable, inclusive and sustainable development outcomes for cities. City Enabling Environment Assessment Cities Alliance, in collaboration with UCLG Africa (UCLGA), developed an assessment methodology for a criteria-based rating of the national framework of urban policies, laws and institutions for evaluating the efficiency of City Enabling Environments (CEE). UCLGA adopted the methodology for rating African enabling environments, based on 10 criteria, in 2013 and 2015. The CEE methodology used for Africa was adapted by UCLG ASPAC for assessment in 28 countries in the Asia-Pacific region (See Figure 1.2). 11 criteria including the 10 criteria used for assessment in Africa are used in the Asia and the Pacific. UCLG ASPAC conducted the CEE assessment through its affiliate local government associations and independent experts.

The challenges to adopting common criteria for country assessment in the region include definitional flexibility to account for variations in constitutional, legal and governance systems across countries. There are also the issues around the reliability of the data and information collected and used for the assessment. The definitional issues are addressed by adopting criteria for CEE assessment which were earlier rolled out in Africa and take in to account the variations in institutional settings across countries. The study team has made every attempt to verify the results with reliable public sources of information and through an in-country peer review process. The results provide a useful snapshot of the state of enabling environment for cities in countries of the Asia Pacific region and are a starting point for building a more systematic approach to understanding how and through which methods cities operate.

Structure of the Report and Chapter Outlines The report is presented in two parts. Part A presents the overall findings. Part B presents the findings per country. This report is structured in the following way: Chapter1, the Introduction chapter sets the background and context for the report, and describes the scope, structure and content of the following four chapters, which are briefly described below. Chapter 2, Challenges of the Global Development Agenda contextualises the significant role of the enabling environment of cities in addressing the challenges of sustainable development. It highlights how Agenda 2030 and the New Urban Agenda promote the role of cities in reducing greenhouse gas emission, climate change and other sustainable development issues. The chapter presents a general overview of cities in the Asia Pacific region and the challenges they face with rapid urbanisation and ageing populations. The chapter highlights the need for legal and institutional support for cities and local government to respond to the emerging challenges of urbanisation. Chapter 3, Principles and Methodology provides the background for conducting the CEE assessment in the Asia Pacific and highlights the objective of the assessment. The methodology applied follows the framework and methodology used in the African CEE report. To capture the diversity of issues and unique challenges of the Asia Pacific region, and additional criteria on the environment were included in the assessment. Detailed information on the scoring system for a criterion is outlined. Chapter 4, Asia-Pacific CEE Country Ratings provides an analysis of the scoring of criteria for the region. It aggregates country performance on the enabling environment assessment at sub-regional level, to identify which criteria need improvement. Furthermore, different colours are used to differentiate the levels achieved by the respective countries from the highest to the lowest. The chapter proposes reforms to improve the performance of enabling environments in cities. Chapter 5, Key findings and Conclusion summarises the important findings and lessons gained from the CEE assessment of the 28 Asia Pacific countries. The lessons learned, along with key challenges to be overcome to strengthen and adapt the enabling environments for cities in the future are outlined. An advocacy plan to support continued CEE reporting in the future is outlined. Part B includes an analysis of the city enabling environment for the 28 countries included in the study. Assessment for each country includes a set of facts to set the context for the assessment of the 11 indicators. For each country, an explanation is provided of the ratings, a comment on proposed reforms for strengthening the legal and other frameworks for city enabling environments. Target audience The report will assist regional agencies, national and sub-national governments to use the CEE framework to identify gaps in enabling framework and to monitor changes in the enabling environment in their efforts to achieve the SDG goals. The report will be useful to local government and its associations in identifying reforms required to strengthen city enabling environments, and advocacy with higher tier(s) of government for changes in legal, institutional and policy framework for promoting sustainable urban development through incentives and infrastructure to support local economic and social development and improve", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e26db6f-1dde-4abe-b1ce-c82315d02977": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e26db6f-1dde-4abe-b1ce-c82315d02977", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/city-enabling-environment-rating", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "City Enabling Environment Rating", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/city-enabling-environment-rating", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "afa57575b8c06846f1b5b2fa46607cb066e0e8155d2d77afa72237f8e6c92ccf"}, "3": {"node_id": "8962c673-a87d-49c3-b680-a945b6f0b4b8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/city-enabling-environment-rating", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b7219ec8d0037642a78d28fc5d411fb303ae4078e2ef2c0326e7938bb17e4d75"}}, "hash": "e9dd18344112ced40ccd04ef0b31bda177df0ad53b93fddbca9d3ef670a35bba", "text": "equity and access to local services. 22 1. Urbanisation in the Asia-Pacific Region The world\u2019s population reached 7.6 billion in mid-2017, 56 per cent of the people live in Asian countries. However, the region is one of the demographic contrasts. It is comprised of two demographic giants, China and India, and many small and isolated island states of the Pacific which have populations of less than 100,000 inhabitants. On average, the region is the most densely populated region in the world. Urban population densities exceed more than 15,000 per km2 in cities like Manila and Seoul, and over 30,000 per km2 in some inner-city areas. The annual population growth rate has reduced from 3.2 per cent in the second half of the 20th century, to 1.21 per cent between 2000 and 2015. Approximately 50 per cent of the region\u2019s population (2.1 billion people) lives in urban areas.1 The urban population is predicted to reach 3 billion people by 2050. The urban share of the population varies, ranging from 18 per cent in Sri Lanka to 100 per cent in Singapore. Migration from rural to urban areas is driven mainly by greater choice of employment opportunities offered in cities, and improved access to services such as healthcare and education. Migration because of disasters, either natural or human-made, and insecurity is also increasing. Some of the fastest growing cities in the world are in the Asia-Pacific region. Urban areas in the region range from small cities to secondary, intermediary cities (tier-2) and megacities. Between 2000 and 2016, the world\u2019s cities with 500,000 inhabitants or more grew at an average annual rate of 2.4 per cent. However, 47 of these grew more than twice as fast, with an average growth of more than 6 per cent per year; of these cities, 40 are in Asia (20 in China alone). The region has 45 per cent of all metropolises and 47 per cent of all intermediary cities (Figure 2.1). Twenty of world\u2019s megacities are in Asia. Figure 2.2 shows the global ranking by size of the region\u2019s cities. Cities in the Asia Pacific region are becoming very large, but the population density of some are falling as populations age and household, and family sizes fall. In parallel to the growth of metropolitan areas, there has been spill- over of population, jobs, and urbanisation and industrialisation of surrounding urban and peri- urban areas. This situation has led to inequitable 1 United Nations, World Urbanisation Prospects The 2015 Revision. 2015, United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division: New York. sharing of costs, revenue collection and availability of services\u2015especially in peri-urban areas. Urban population and density influence the cost of running cities in the region and the economic returns from public investment. Singapore generates over 514 million dollars of GDP per km2 compared to Sydney which generates 179 million dollars (2016 figures). Both cities have a population of around 5 million and similar national GDP. Sydney has an urban area of 1687 km2, three times that of Singapore. Busan, South Korea, has a population of around 3.5 million and a GDP per capita 60 per cent that of Sydney, but still manages to produce a GDP/km2, similar to Sydney. The implications of falling urban population density of some countries on the economic performance of their cities and return on capital investment by local governments in the region is an issue requiring special attention. Allowing cities in the region to continue to sprawl will have long-term implications on the cost of operating cities, especially in the recovery of infrastructure and servicing costs, business competitiveness and the capacity to use public funds to develop strong and efficient enabling environments. The economic growth of Asia-Pacific cities has shown a positive correlation with urbanisation in recent years. According to the Asian Development Bank (ADB)2 the region accounted for less than 30 per cent of world output in 2000, and by 2014 this contribution had risen to almost 40 per cent. Moreover, the region accounted for nearly two-thirds of global GDP growth in 2016. China, Singapore and Australia are examples of \u2018booming economic countries\u2019 with long-term continuous growth in the region.

Cities and Local Governments Since the 1990s, decentralisation policies and state reforms occurred in most Asian countries. Asia has been the most successful democratising region during the lifetime of the Democracy Index.4 The pattern of decentralisation and local democracy in the Asia Pacific differs widely from country to country. In the federal system of government such as Australia, India, Malaysia and Pakistan, 4 The Economist Intelligence Unit. Democracy Index 2015 Democracy in an age of anxiety, https://www.yabiladi.com/img/content/EIU-Democracy-Index-2015.pdf states are accorded with a greater or lesser degree of autonomy. Local government is generally a state or province matter in this federal system. Although some general provisions concerning local governments are available in the federal constitutions, the assigned scope and authority is left to the state or provincial government. Meanwhile, in the unitary states, local government is under the supervision of national governments, and the scope of local government is defined within the country\u2019s constitution. One of the most common phenomena related to local government and cities is with large metropolitan regions which have a multiplicity of layers of governments.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "03212cdd-9a3c-4109-93b9-e72852c79114": {"__data__": {"id_": "03212cdd-9a3c-4109-93b9-e72852c79114", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/city-enabling-environment-rating", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "City Enabling Environment Rating", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/city-enabling-environment-rating", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "310e8ebb1d3bbad4f427a81de33ac6e677235276c9e9f423b1c59f474e625318"}, "2": {"node_id": "9ef6ddbc-cb7d-4832-af6a-529480ab8db4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/city-enabling-environment-rating", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8116b10bccf534d9e7b451d9fe00f37fb66f9a16b9ca0ecc6c4e958c5f507cc6"}}, "hash": "63e96c0a74e79bdb08319cbc5ad8ecc9ef21908173660eb3097f8758ff50f23f", "text": "Metro cities like Jakarta, Manila, Bangkok, Colombo and Sydney are comprised of a multiplicity of local governments, often with differing political leanings.

Cities, such as Bangkok, Delhi, and Manila have imposed metropolitan development authority governance structures to address coordination and urban management issues. In Auckland, New Zealand, regional difficulties in coordination between five local governments led the central government to call an enquiry that resulted in the amalgamation of the five local governments into one large supra city authority.5 The complexity of multiple numbers and layers of local government, and the competition and rivalry for resources between them makes it extremely difficult to create a competitive enabling environment in large cities. Significant diseconomies can emerge in the delivery of government services in metropolitan areas, and transaction costs to business rise as the benefits of clusters and agglomeration are lost when spatial supply chains become more dispersed. Each city in such large metropolitan region seeks to develop competitive enabling environments independently, with a very strong reluctance to share information and collaborate. This raises the question, about the best models of urban governance that cities with a multiplicity of government statutes should adopt to build stronger and more competitive enabling environments for in the region.

Challenges of Urbanisation The rapid scale and intensity of urbanisation have created enormous development challenges in the region\u2019s cities that national and local governments are struggling to respond. These have been documented in many reports, most recently by the State of Asian Cities Report 2015.7 Over the next three decades, one-third of the region\u2019s urban population is projected to live without access to good housing, and basic services such as water, sanitation, healthcare and education. More than 500 million people currently live in slums and informal settlements.8 In these areas land-tenure and security are weak, and connectivity to basic services limited. Infants living in slums are less likely to survive their fifth birthdays than their age cohort in better quality urban areas.9 In other parts of the region, the population is ageing, and growth is slowing. Many cities in Japan, China, Thailand and Korea have ageing populations. By 2050, nearly one billion people in the region will be aged 65 years and above. This demographic shift is reducing the taxpayer to pension ratio, and the tax base of countries and cities across the regions. The governments, at all levels, will be hard-pressed to raise the capital needed to retrofit buildings and infrastructure in cities to accommodate the needs of the aged. Urbanisation levels, associated with higher disposable income and expenditure on cars and motorcycles are rising, especially in the developing cities of the region. Urban areas generate about 1.21 million tons of municipal solid waste daily, and by 2025 this is expected to double to 2.65 million tons daily. Many cities in the region also exceed a mean concentration of PM2.5 and PM1010 \u2013ranging from 5.8 and 9.6 micrograms in Australia to 101.2 and 281.8 micrograms per cubic meter in Pakistan.11 7 UN-Habitat.

Natural disasters are four times more likely to affect Asia- Pacific countries than African countries, and 25 times more likely than in Europe. The changes resulting from global climate change and surging population growth in low lying concentrated urban areas are a formidable challenge.12 By 2060, it is projected that 875 million people, 17.5 per cent of the population, will live in low lying flood prone or coastal inundation areas. Most of these will live in urban areas. Spatial development patterns of cities in the region are changing. The primate, secondary and smaller cities are merging into urban corridors, polycentric and cluster urban agglomerations and megalopolis are common.

These peri-urban residents are disenfranchised, many of whom have been forced out of inner city areas because of urban redevelopment and high rents. Conversely, core city municipalities, receive no tax revenues from areas outside the city limits, though people from outside the official city limits may commute to work within the city.14 The result is a fiscal imbalance between central and peri-urban municipalities. This is a significant issue for cities like Jakarta, Manila and Sydney. Developing more integrated infrastructure and services for the whole urban-rural continuum requires coordination with other local governments. However, mechanisms to support such coordination, like the Manila Metropolitan Development Authority have failed. Improved mechanisms for financing the development of infrastructure and maintaining cities in the region remains a major challenge. Cities are closely linked to a country\u2019s economic growth and wealth creation. They are also centres of arts and culture, capital markets, knowledge and social change. Many urban centres in the region have become large manufacturing and industrial hubs that attract skilled and unskilled labour. Cities are variously estimated to account for over 80 per cent of Global Gross Domestic Product (GDP).15 Some cities have larger economies than many countries in the region. For example: Mumbai accounts for 40 per cent of India\u2019s tax revenues and Tokyo for a third of Japan\u2019s GDP.16 14 UNDP 2014, \u201cTransparency and Accountability to Combat Corruption in Local Governance: Supporting Next Generation of Initiatives\u201d Guidance Note. 15 World Economic Forum, 2014, A report of the Global Agenda Council on Competitiveness \u2018The Competitiveness 16 Rockefeller Foundation, 2008, \u2018Century of the city \u2013 no time However, the development of cities is not evenly spread. Many small to medium size secondary cities have GDP per capita incomes two to three times less than the nation\u2019s largest cities. This is the case for secondary and small cities in Indonesia and Thailand compared to the metropolitan of Jakarta and Bangkok. Many of these cities are lagging behind larger cities and suffer from poor access to resources (human, financial and organisational), poor connectivity and governance. Their ability to participate in the global economy or tap into innovative growth models is therefore limited. Globally, secondary cities produce less than 40 per cent of world GDP but provide most of the resources needed to support the operation and development of the world\u2019s 600 largest cities. The large cities produce 60 per cent of the world GDP.17 Even large cities need to be continually innovative to deliver services and address existing and emerging challenges. Given the magnitude of challenges in the Asia- Pacific region, progress made in the region will contribute significantly to achieving the targets of the 17 SDGs. Local government capacities to play a lead role in achieving the Goals can be strengthened by proper institutional and legal frameworks that define their roles, responsibilities and resources based on the principles of subsidiarity.18 Hence, a facilitating environment is a requirement for local governments to work flexibly and efficiently to face various challenges in the region. to lose\u2019 17 Roberts, 2014, Managing Systems of Secondary Cities, Cities Alliance/UNOPS, Brussels 18 GTF, 2016, \u2018Local and Regional governments - Shaping the New Urban Agenda\u2019 Flooding Central Jakarta in 2013 28 A key aspect that the CEE assessment did not look at is the potentially disruptive impact of technology on jobs and economic growth. Many Asian cities that have become reliant on manufacturing are likely to see many labour-based jobs disappear as the result of reshoring of production to developed economies using new production technology (especially 3-D printing and artificial intelligence) and materials closer to home markets as a way of reducing operational and transaction costs. Advanced production technologies and artificial intelligence will replace many routine processing jobs in Asian and Pacific cities. Central and local governments will need to focus on endogenous growth opportunities and the building of new frameworks for enabling environments to support modern technology based jobs in service industries. A significant challenge facing cities in the region will be the impacts of the fourth Industrial revolution (4IR) as it emerges. How will local governments support the development of enabling environments that will enable a wide range of organisations, business and individuals to deliver the goods and services to support the growth and development of cities and enact rules and regulations responsive to rapid technological and social change?

Few local governments, especially in lesser developed countries, understand the potential impacts that 4IR will have on their local economies and employment, and how to support it. 4IR will create changes to the way cities function, the way people work, and employment skills. However, it will also create many opportunities, especially for secondary cities and towns; it calls for a significant transformation of local enabling environments. PWC suggests that this could create a sustainability revolution. In countries and cities, the laws that shape the operation of enabling environments are outdated and need reform. The skills and capacity of local governments, especially in smaller Pacific Island states are weak, adding to the difficulties of developing enabling environments to support new trade and investment opportunities in remote locations. For remote cities, the use of information technologies to create more virtual enabling environments that provide crucial access to support services will be the key way to create competitive advantage. The internet will play a pivotal role the application of e-governance,, finance, health, education and knowledge services. Developing an enabling environment to support the development of a better informed, inclusive and digital economy in the towns and cities of the region will become a significant challenge for national and local governments. The cost of gaining quality access to the internet in remoter cities is very high, and is likely to become a significant factor in aid and national grant schemes in the future. Countries like Rwanda demonstrate the way that cities in the lesser developed and remote parts of the African region will need to use the internet of things as a way of creating virtual strategic infrastructure, enabling environments and services to build stronger and more competitive economies. Virtual strategic infrastructure, involves the use of the internet to tap into higher level e-services, such as legal, science, technology, education and information services that, because of a city\u2019s size, means these are not locally available. Learning to live with and adapt to the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) and associated disruptive technologies and the changes it will bring, will be as challenging to city local governments, as learning to adapt to climate change, rapid urbanisation and ageing populations. Creating city local government legislative enabling environment frameworks responsive to the 4IR is perhaps the greatest challenge facing local governments today, as the structure of these frameworks is virtual, global and constantly changing. Economic Governance and Employment Enabling Environment for Cities and Local Government in Asia Pacific 29 With most of the world\u2019s population living in urban areas, poverty, inequality, climate change and environmental degradation have become \u2018urbanised\u2019. As economic and cultural hubs, cities are best-placed to develop solutions to address these challenges as, by 2030, there will be a net loss of jobs in rural and sub-regional areas in all but a few countries. Cities play a pivotal role in the global development discourse on sustainable development, as it is here that the human capital, skills, creativity, innovation and capital are mainly located to provide solutions to the challenges of meeting the SDGs and the New Urban Agenda. The decentralisation of responsibilities, capital and resources to cities to address the sustainable development problem call for an \u2018urban paradigm shift\u2019 in the development discourse and practice. a. Sustainable Development Goals The global development discourse has evolved from one focused merely on economic development to a more holistic human development approach. Learning from the lessons of the Millennium Development Goals, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development provides an ambitious, universal and comprehensive agenda towards political, economic, environmental, and social transformation of all countries (Figure 2.4). In a world with increasingly interlinked economic, social, environmental, political and cultural challenges \u2013 and opportunities, such transformation is essential for ensuring human dignity, respect and quality of life for all people; promoting inclusive and sustainable growth; protecting the environment, and fostering peaceful and inclusive societies, through the participation and engagement of all countries, stakeholders and people. At the UN Summit held in September 2015, the 193-member states adopted19 the 2030 Agenda. This agenda set 17 Sustainable development goals (SDGs) with 169 targets configuring and integrating the three dimensions of sustainable development\u2015economic, social and environmental\u2013on an equal footing. The agenda requires countries to improve governance for achieving the SDGs, including prioritisation of and 19 UN General Assembly Resolution \u201cTransforming Our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\u201d (A/RES/70/1). localisation of SDGs and integrating SDGs with national planning and budgeting processes, and better cohesion between all levels of government.

Recognising the link between sustainable urban development and a wide range of human development issues, ranging from poverty, inequality and social cohesion, to environmental footprint, resilience, public health, or rural- urban linkages and equitable growth, the 2030 Agenda includes SDG 11 to \u2018Make Cities and Human Settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.\u2019 The goal calls for action on housing, public services, transport, participatory planning and management, cultural and natural heritage, disaster management and resilience, environmental impact, air pollution, waste management, green and public space, rural- urban linkages and integrated policy-making (Box on Goal 11). Goal 11, however, does not fully address the measures that need to be taken to make cities more resilient and sustainable. Nor does it discuss the role of cities in achieving the sustainable development agenda. Given that the 17 goals are integrated and indivisible, the other 16 goals also provide the framework for how cities should be governed, structured, function, as well as their overall policy agenda. The targets under Goal 16 on building effective, effective, accountable and inclusive institutions, and on strengthening participatory processes are also applicable to cities. Further, local governments also have a significant role to play in ensuring that local populations have legal identify, have access to justice (including redressal mechanisms), and that their fundamental freedoms are protected. Though these are traditional within the purview of cities, with more people living in urban areas than before, cities will also have to ensure that legal identity is provided to the local population to ensure that they have access to basic services. This is particularly critical as currently, over 500 million people live in slums and informal settlements in the Asia Pacific region with little or no housing- tenure security and connectivity to basic services. 4. Cities and the Agenda 2030 30 Infants and children living in slums are less likely to survive their fifth birthdays than their urban peers. Over the next few decades, one third of the urban population projected to live without access to adequate housing, and basic services such as water, sanitation, healthcare and education. Goal 8 is important to local governments to consider when shaping the framework of enabling environments for urban development. Goal 8 seeks to promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all. Job creation and quality are particularly challenging issues for cities given that by 2030 rural populations and jobs will begin to decline. Goal 8.3 outlines the importance of governments \u2018promoting development-oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and encourage the formalisation and growth of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, including through access to financial services.\u2019 Achievement of this sub-goal will be very challenging, as local governments in many of the region\u2019s cities have traditionally not had responsibility for local economic development, and have little capacity to strengthen the enabling environment in support of local business and investment without being given a stronger remit and resources to do so. In addition, targets under other Goals (such as ending poverty, delivering education, water and sanitation, healthcare, promoting gender equality, decent work and economic growth, etc.) suggest the need for a scaled policy framework for cities (as well as for countries). The importance of cities and local governments to achieving the SDGs was acknowledged in the UN Secretary General\u2019s Synthesis Report on the Post-2015 Agenda - \u201cmany of the investments to achieve the sustainable development goals will take place at the subnational level and be led by local authorities.\u201d20 Of the 169 targets and 231 indicators, 65 per cent are relevant in the urban context. National and municipal governments will have to adapt or translate the development goals into objectives that are relevant, applicable and attainable at the local level\u2013in other words, localise SDGs. Towards this end, municipal governments should engage with local communities, the private sector, as well as with diverse levels of government vertically (national) and horizontally (inter-municipal) to define shared priorities and align with the SDGs. In addition, governments should also invest in building municipal governments\u2019 planning, implementation and fiduciary capacities. b. New Urban Agenda The Habitat conferences were instrumental in bringing the urban agenda into the overall development discourse. The rapid growth of cities owing to migration from rural areas has already started to create a scarcity of adequate housing and led to the establishment of slums and informal settlements. Habitat-I (in 1976) aimed to bring the issue of adequate housing\u2013specifically for poor and marginalised sections of the population\u2013to the forefront. 20 (A/69/700, para 94).

Given the critical roles of cities and local governments in realising the Agendas, UCLG ASPAC has developed a roadmap for local governments to localise SDGs. Localisation SDGs refers to the process of adapting, implementing and monitoring the SDGs at the local level, taking into account subnational contexts. This roadmap is a tool which cities and local governments can apply to internalise the indicators of SDGs and strengthen their roles as key contributors. Once a roadmap has been set up, cities and local governments will be able to implement these global targets and indicators consistently according to the local context. Source: UCLG ASPAC, 2016, Roadmap for localising SDGs for local governments Following the adoption of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, in October 2016 the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III) concluded with the adoption of the New Urban Agenda (NUA). Developed based on broad regional and thematic consultations and inputs from UN member states, civil society, the private sector, philanthropy, academia and local and regional authorities, the NUA reaffirms the global commitment to the sustainable development agenda in cities. It reiterates that sustainable urban development is \u2018a critical step\u2019 for achieving sustainable development in an integrated and coordinated manner at the global, regional, national, sub-national and local levels, with the participation of all relevant actors.21 Implementing the NUA contributes to the localisation of the SDGs in an integrated manner among all levels of government\u2013from the national to municipal level.22 More importantly, the NUA reinforces the vision of \u2018cities for all\u2019 (Right to City)\u2013referring to the equal use and enjoyment of urban areas by all, and where all persons can enjoy equal rights and opportunities. The NUA is guided by and grounded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and international human rights treaties, and is informed by the Declaration on the Right to Development. 21 Outcome Document of the third United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III) 22 ibid The NUA defines the implementation framework for cities to tackle development challenges: social exclusion, urban poverty, environmental degradation, disaster risks and climate change.

In addition, the NUA recognises that inclusive and sustainable economic growth, decent work for all, as well as environmental protection should be at the centre of efforts for sustainable urban development. The NUA also recognises the leading role that national governments play in defining and implementing inclusive and effective urban policies, and supporting sustainable urban development. It highlights the importance of an urban governance framework that fosters stronger coordination and cooperation between national and municipal governments as well as civil society and other relevant stakeholders to achieve the positive development outcomes of urbanisation. The NUA also prescribes a follow-up and review mechanisms to track progress and assess impacts to ensure effective implementation and accountability to citizens. Local Commitment Stakeholder Mapping Action Plan Syncronise With national Agenda Business Model Set up (Financial) MonEv Best Practice Promotion Local SDGs Task Force 34 4cs Approach \u2022 COHERENCE of policies across national sectoral policies. Across different themes and ministries, the ultimate goal for sustainable development should encompass coherent efforts, also keeping in mind the balance of the economic, environmental and social dimensions; \u2022 COHESION of national and subnational plans and strategies, paying the necessary attention to specific needs of subnational regions, particularly those that lag behind, in order to ensure more integrated and balanced regional growth and social cohesion; \u2022 COORDINATION between national and subnational level to align strategies and ensure the necessary support to action at the subnational level. Mechanisms for multi-level governance also need to be considered for coordination among sub- national and local governments; \u2022 COOPERATION among all levels of government and with all stakeholders will be key to the success of the 2030 Agenda. Establishing partnerships and involving civil-society, business, academia and local communities should be at the heart of the implementation efforts of subnational and local governments. 5. Supporting cities to achieve the sustainable development agenda Key issues need to be addressed to strengthen the national policy, legal and institutional framework to create the enabling environment for cities to harness the transformative force of urbanisation to achieve the objectives of the 2030 Agenda and the New Urban Agenda, and improve the capacities and capabilities of different levels of government that impact outcomes at municipal level, including fiduciary capacities. These are: a. Multi-level governance and multi- stakeholder partnership framework Both the NUA and the 2030 Agenda call for developing a multi-level governance framework with active engagement and input from all levels of government\u2013including local and municipal governments. This was elaborated further by the Global Taskforce of Local and Regional Governments. The 4Cs approach \u2013 Coherence, Cohesion, Coordination between national, subnational and local policies, plans and strategies, and Cooperation between all levels of governments and stakeholders is recommended.23 Budgeting processes should match efforts to bring Coherence, Cohesion, Coordination and Cooperation to all levels of government, and across sectors. Towards this end, better analysis of functions, roles and responsibilities of various levels of government, and capacity development of key institutions (including at sectoral level) need to be supported. Appropriate institutional mechanisms for coordination among all relevant stakeholders need to be established or strengthened. Furthermore, the principles of transparency and accountability will have to be promoted throughout the multi-level governance and partnerships framework. Such an approach of strengthening institutions at all levels can help in setting and implementing priorities across sectors, and various levels of governments (vertically and horizontally). b. Civic engagement, knowledge sharing and innovation The importance of participatory urban governance systems for localising SDGs and NUA is highlighted above. Existing participatory mechanisms should be strengthened to facilitate formal and informal multi-stakeholder engagement including civil society members, the private sector, academia, among others. Further, new platforms for participation and engagement can be supported using ICT services, including collecting community-driven data to inform planning and implementation. 23 The Global Taskforce of Local and Regional Governments, in collaboration with UNDP and UN-Habitat, have been working on the localisation of the SDGs Enabling Environment for Cities and Local Government in Asia Pacific 35 In addition, while the role of national governments in supporting the urban agenda is mentioned above, local and regional governments should also have opportunities to share their knowledge and experiences in developing and implementing appropriate policies as well as innovative measures for achieving sustainable development. There are diverse city-to-city networks that support cities to share their knowledge as well as offer capacity development support. These networks can also be sources for supporting research and collecting disaggregated data, including at sector level. c.

In addition to regular and reliable allocation from national governments to cities, cities will also need to be supported to access to different multilateral funds, including the Green Climate Fund, and the Climate Investment Fund. More importantly, mechanisms to ensure transparent and accountable management of financial resources, including through oversight mechanisms such as city-level financial and performance auditing, are needed. Agenda 2030 and the NUA also emphasise that for urban areas to play a more transformative role in achieving sustainable development they need be supported by strong but flexible legal, regulatory and institutional frameworks. This call for dynamic rather than rigid frameworks that constitute enabling environments, since all cities must address the impact that disruptive technology will have on a wide range of policy, laws and planning systems in the future. Adaptation and innovation will be vital to developing dynamic enabling environments capable of responding to rapidly changing demands and practices. Cities must also adopt formal and informal mechanisms that allow for participatory processes\u2013especially the use of social media in governance and policymaking. Thus, facilitating inclusion, and a collaborative approach is needed to develop solutions for varied challenges affecting sustainable development agenda. The CEE assessment precisely assesses the legal and institutional framework (including those related to fiscal space) that would enable cities and urban areas to contribute to the achievement of the SDGs. Dotonbori canal, a waterfront concept for a sustainable urban development Principles and Methodologies of City Enabling Environment Rating CHAPTER 3 38 Many studies have been undertaken to measure the performance of elements of the enabling environments for cities,1,2 There are, however, no universally applied indicators/criteria or methods used for the collection of data or analysis. The selection of criteria used in assessments, in many cases, are tailored for specific purposes depending on what aspects of enabling environments are being investigated. The CEE rating tool used by UCLG was first applied in Africa in 2013 and it was repeated in 2015. A set of recommendations, based on the assessment, were made for strengthening local governments in Africa. Given the positive outcomes of the assessment in Africa, UCLG ASPAC in collaboration with Cities Alliance and UNDP undertook the CEE assessment in countries of the Asia-Pacific region. This chapter explains the principles and methodologies used to conduct the CEE Rating for the Asia-Pacific Region. 1. Explanation of City Enabling Environment Rating The CEE rating is a toolkit designed to support local government capacity to collect and analyse data on the performance of factors contributing to the operation and impact of urban local bodies in 28 countries in the region. It allows national and sub-national governments to benchmark the selected enabling environment criteria against the minimum conditions required for cities to contribute significantly to effective management of urbanisation. An analysis of country perspective was applied to deliver a contextual review of the function of urban local bodies. Their performance depends largely on a country\u2019s legal and institutional context. The assessment uses 11 criteria to measure aspects of the state of the enabling environment applied across the 28 countries. These are described in detail later. The criteria cover a broad range of measures related to national policy, laws and institutional 1 Brinkerhoff, D. W. (2004).

With limited resources available for the study by the partners, only a selected range of criteria was selected. A more extensive set of criteria are desirable to improve knowledge about all encompassing city enabling environments. The 11 criteria used for the assessment, however, focus on the enabling environment for the urban local bodies in the countries in the region. Subsequent peer review of the data and analysis by experts and panels has enabled the initial findings to be checked and supporting additional information to be included in the country reports.

The assessment also seeks to provide a pathway to improve the effectiveness of local governments within the sphere of sustainable urban development. a. What are the objectives? The objective of the assessment is to assign a CEE Rating for countries in the Asia-Pacific based on the national policy, the institutional framework for the urban local bodies to achieve sustainable urban development. The rating may be used to compare countries in the region to identify which ones are currently better positioned to efficiently manage urbanisation and use demographic change to catalyse faster and more equitable national growth. More importantly, the assessment will enable cities to identify areas for institutional reforms, drawing lessons from the better-rated countries, to create a conducive environment for inclusive and sustainable urban development including inclusive and gender-responsive governance. Other objectives include: \u2022 Examine in selected countries of the Asia-Pacific, government initiatives to promote an enabling environment for local governments to contribute to achieving the SDGs/Post-2015 agenda. \u2022 Assess if the legal and institutional environment (including financing issues) is conducive to the \u201clocalisation\u201d of the SDG/ Post-2015 Agenda. \u2022 Identify areas where reforms to strengthen local government capacities and promote strategic participative approach for the implementation of the SDGs/Post-2015 Agenda are needed. \u2022 Strengthen and develop mechanisms to implement and monitor the SDGs, with the active participation of local governments. b. How does the scoring work? The CEE Assessment in the Asia-Pacific uses a qualitative approach and assessment linked to a set of legislative frameworks, enabling environment criteria and a scoring system using a scale of 1-4 Why CEE rating is important? \u2022 It seeks to catalyse policy debate on creating enabling environments for cities and local governments to promote productive, sustainable and inclusive development. \u2022 It helps cities and local governments to identify key urban reforms for advocacy with the higher tier of government(s) for increasing their efficiency and effectiveness in urban planning and management. Enabling Environment for Cities and Local Government in Asia Pacific 39 (1 being less effective to 4 most effective). The CEE Assessment for a country is the aggregated score for all the criteria \u2013 out of a maximum score of 44. The aggregated final scores are classified into four categories: To assess the relevance and accuracy of the information, the assessment process included two general steps. First was data collection, which was organised by local government associations, individual experts, and other partners. This phase included development of the methodology, and small group discussions with stakeholders to complete in-country assessments. Pilot testing of the CEE ratings was done in ten nations and this initial result was shared during the Habitat III Conference in Quito, Ecuador. The second step was quality assurance. This was done in three layers of validation which was a check against the publicly available index and indicators linked to the criteria produced at country and international and country and regional peer reviews. The country peer review involved key country actors such as national government officials, urban experts, local governments and others to produce a consolidated country rating. In addition, a regional validation workshop was held gathering together all country assessors to share their experience on working with the assessment as well as to discuss the scoring result. Lastly, the regional peer review was organised in collaboration with institutional partners such as Cities Alliance, UNDP, UN-Habitat, CDIA and UNESCAP to validate the whole of region rating. These levels of the implementation sought to ensure correct, up-to- date and verified information. Specifically, UCLG ASPAC provided overall guidance and quality assurance throughout the assessment process. 2. Criteria for Evaluating Countries Based on the National Enabling Environment for Cities and a Presentation of the Ratings The CEE Assessment in the Asia-Pacific is based on 11 criteria (10 criteria adopted from the assessment in Africa, complemented with one region-specific criterion on the environment.3 Initially, gender dimension was also assessed in the CEE rating yet the criterion was eventually excluded. The 11 criteria cover five areas \u2013 local governance, local capacity, financial autonomy, local efficiency and national institutional framework, which cover the essential elements of a city\u2019s institutional environment within the context of decentralisation and development.

CEE Score Range Performance Status and Actions These are countries whose legislative enabling environment is favourable to the action of cities, but where some improvements are needed. These are countries whose progress towards a legislative enabling environment for cities will require significant reform efforts. These are countries where the legislative enabling environments is generally unfavourable to the action of cities. 40 The following provides a more detailed description of the categories of assessment for each criterion. 1. Constitutional Framework The best guarantee for action by cities and local governments is a national constitution that recognises local government as an autonomous sphere of governance equipped with legal powers and financial autonomy, and with clearly defined roles and responsibilities. In this way, the decentralised communities and the nation-state both derive their legitimacy from the same founding document and fundamental law. Constitutional Framework The Constitution is neutral on the question of local governments. The Constitution makes explicit mention of local governments, but their responsibilities are defined by legislation. The Constitution contains provisions that implicitly or explicitly restrict the actions of cities and local governments. The Constitution makes explicit mention of local governments as spheres of governance, detailing their recognised roles and responsibilities. 3 2 1 4 2. Legislative Framework In many cases, constitutional provisions are complemented by constitutional laws and legal texts that clarify specific matters for which local governments play an individual role or share a position with the central government or other sub-national government levels. The law specifies, in principle, the roles and responsibilities of local governments in activities such as development, planning, management of local institutions and human resources, management of taxation and finance, provision of essential services, etc. The legislative framework that is the most favourable is one inspired by the principles of subsidiarity and complementarity between levels of governance, differentiation, solidarity and efficiency. Legislative Framework A number of legislative provisions are in conflict with the Constitution, or some provisions in the Constitution are not implemented. All responsibilities and powers are clearly defined in accordance with the Constitution, but some relevant statutory laws and regulations are missing. A number of legislative provisions are in conflict with the Constitution, or some provisions in the Constitution are not implemented. All responsibilities and powers are clearly defined in accordance with the Constitution, and the relevant statutory laws and regulations are in place. 3 2 1 4 Local democracy Local assemblies are elected, but executive bodies are appointed. Local assemblies and exec utive bodies are elected, but not necessarily throughout the country. Local assemblies and executive bodies are appointed. Local assemblies and executive bodies are elected throughout the country. 3 2 1 4 3. Local Democracy It is generally believed that the appointment of deliberative and executive local bodies through democratic elections is essential for the accountability of local government leaders vis-\u00e0-vis citizens. It results in better governance and better service delivery to the people. It helps improve trust between the people and local government institutions and, in so doing, fortifies the decentralisation process. Enabling Environment for Cities and Local Government in Asia Pacific 41 4. Financial Transfers from the Central Government to the Local Governments The autonomy of cities and local governments is affected by how they are financed. The financing of local governments is related to the devolution of functions and tasks assigned to them which are prescribed by national or provincial government laws. Some countries, like New Zealand, have a significant level of devolution. Three major types of tasks are generally carried out by local governments: those for which they act as agents of the state (i.e. vital records, police, economic development policy, territorial planning policy, employment policy, etc.); those for which they partially play the role of agent for the central government (i.e. national sectoral policies, equity and welfare policies, policies supporting young people, women, pensioners, the disabled, etc.); and those that concern just the local government (i.e. municipal services, administrative work, waste management, etc.). The first two types of tasks justify financial transfers from the central government to cities and local governments. These transfers", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5ea094ad-47d1-48f9-80ab-ad07f9f06ebf": {"__data__": {"id_": "5ea094ad-47d1-48f9-80ab-ad07f9f06ebf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/city-enabling-environment-rating", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "City Enabling Environment Rating", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/city-enabling-environment-rating", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "929949d1bb8ca2010681b94e78bab53a903a9cefd8615f9dbfaf11e64027410d"}}, "hash": "929949d1bb8ca2010681b94e78bab53a903a9cefd8615f9dbfaf11e64027410d", "text": "are meant to correct imbalances between the tasks assigned to local governments and their limited resources, correct disparities in revenue generating potential among local governments, and promote national goals in terms of equitable living conditions and development. The amount of the transfers may be a specific percentage of central government resources or defined ad hoc from one year to the next. Transfers must be adequate (they must cover the expenses transferred to the local governments), and be based as much as possible on transparent and predictable formulas. The use of transferred resources may be conditional or unconditional. Financial Transfers from the Central Government to the Local Governments The transfer of resources to local governments or their distribution among local governments is predictable according to a transparent formula. The transfer of resources to local governments and their distribution among local governments are clear and predictable, with utilisation determined at the national level (conditional transfers). Resources are not transferred, or are transferred erratically and irregularly. The transfer of resources to local governments and their distribution among local governments are clear and predictable, according to a transparent formula and without restrictions on how they may be utilised. 3 2 1 4 Local Governments\u2019 Own Revenues Local governments have some latitude to determine rates for existing taxes, but the central government is responsible for setting the tax base for existing taxes, creating new taxes, and accessing loans and financial markets. Local governments have some latitude to determine existing tax base and rates, but the central government is responsible for setting new taxes and accessing loans and financial markets. The central government defines and collects local government revenues. Local governments have total autonomy to determine tax base, rates and fees, and to collect the corresponding revenues; access to financial markets is allowed. 3 2 1 4 5. Local Governments\u2019 Own Revenues The actions of cities and local governments depend largely on their financial autonomy. This is largely determined by the revenues that local communities raise from local taxes, fees paid by local users for services rendered, revenue-generating activities initiated by local governments, and/or income from loans or bonds. Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) are another form of financing for capital investment that builds on local governments\u2019 own revenues. Local governments have some leeway in determining the nature and level of their fees and charges, because their base and rates are set within the framework of the law or are determined at the central government level. Their autonomy is effective depending on whether they collect local fees and taxes themselves or whether they must rely on the central government for their collection. Their latitude is extensive depending on whether the law allows them to borrow money and/or resort to financial markets to finance some of their actions. 42 Capacity Building of Local Government Administrations There is a na- tional frame- work of reference defining the qualifica- tions and responsibil- ities of local government staff, or a national strategy for training and promoting human resources in local governments; but they concern only a few lo- cal governments. There is a national frame- work of reference defining the qualifica- tions and responsibilities of local government staff, and a national strategy for training and promoting human resources in local governments; so far, this concerns only a few local governments.

There is a national framework of reference that applies to all local gov- ernments in the country defining the qualifications and responsibilities of local government staff, and a national strategy for training and promot- ing human resources in local govern- ments. 3 2 1 4 Transparency Only partial rules and legal provisions on transparency in the running of local governments exist and they are not systematically followed.

Capacity Building of Local Government Administrations Capacity building of local government administrations can be defined as \u2018the process through which local governments obtain, strengthen, and maintain the capabilities to set and achieve their goals in each environment.4 Four broad categories of capabilities must be distinguished: Institutional capacity, which refers to rules", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7ef101d1-245e-41ce-9499-f19d3ffd622d": {"__data__": {"id_": "7ef101d1-245e-41ce-9499-f19d3ffd622d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/city-enabling-environment-rating", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "City Enabling Environment Rating", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/city-enabling-environment-rating", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8fff3459ea6abaeba4df1aaa865832a91784c6d75c0fc54c5ac5be7172b9cc61"}}, "hash": "8fff3459ea6abaeba4df1aaa865832a91784c6d75c0fc54c5ac5be7172b9cc61", "text": "set by the central governments that are more or less favourable to local government action; organisational capacity, which refers to the policies, structures, process and procedures that allow local governments to operate and provide leadership in their jurisdiction; human capacity with respect to the experience, tools and knowledge mastered by the human resources of local governments (elected and staff), which enable them to identify, analyse and respond to people\u2019s needs with appropriate strategies, policies, programs and projects, ensure their implementation, and assess their impact; and finally, societal capacity, which refers to the empowerment of the community to hold local governments and administrations accountable for the services they offer and the good management of the community. The criteria of capacity building as considered here focuses on the second and third categories of capabilities mentioned above (local governments\u2019 organisational and human capacities), which can strengthen and empower local governments to take charge and fulfil their missions regardless of the environment in which they operate. For this rating, the existence or absence of a clear national strategy for capacity building was considered, including standards and procedures, training systems and human resource management planning, rules on integrity in hiring and the conduct of operations by local governments, etc 4 UNDP, Capacity Development: A UNDP Primer. 2009, United Nations Development Programme: New York. 7. Transparency Transparency is an essential element of good governance of public affairs. It is necessary for the effectiveness and efficiency of local government action and the accountability of local governments vis-\u00e0-vis the population. Transparency improves significantly when citizens have access to information about the operation and management of their local governments; when local governments follow a number of rules and legal procedures relating to the hiring and administration of staff, calls for tenders, procurement, and monitoring of contract execution; and when the law requires that local governments be subject to regular and independent financial and organisational audits according to a specific schedule and within a specific timeframe, and this law is applied.

There is no national legislation on citizen participation, and no locally organised space for dialogue and consultation. National legislation on citizen participation exists and is applied. 3 2 1 4 8. Citizen Participation To promote people\u2019s participation in the management of the affairs that affect them is one of the justifications given for decentralisation policy. It is estimated that, as the level of public governance closest to the people, local governments, consider the views and concerns of civil society outside election periods. Indeed, representative democracy is not sufficient to ensure that citizens\u2019 voices are considered in the management of local affairs, especially, when voter turnout in local elections often is low. This information on voter turnout must be supplemented by various forms of citizen participation assessment criteria, which include: various consultation processes whose mechanisms should be formalised to be effective; the possibility for citizens to submit petitions; the organisation of citizen-led referendums; the practice of participatory budgeting; expression of public opinion through satisfaction surveys on diverse topics that interest them, and so on. These forms of citizen participation must be prescribed and organised by laws and regulations, and their implementation must be monitored at central and local levels to be truly integrated into local government practices. 9. Local Government Performance Assessing the performance of local governments should be an integral part of the decentralisation policy of countries implemented by the actions of central government, which should design tools to measure the effectiveness of local governments in executing their mandates. Performance can be expressed in terms of: the level and quality of services provided to local people, particularly, the poorest; effectiveness and efficiency in the delivery of these services and the management of local government resources; and optimising the use of natural, human and financial resources. Monitoring mechanisms and indicators are generally needed to track progress in these various areas, and a comparative approach is often taken to benchmark local government performance against other local governments, and in comparison, to the national average. Countries differ according to whether they have legal and regulatory provisions for measuring local government performance, which is a major stimulus to improving the quality, effectiveness and efficiency of their actions. The analysis for the local government performance is guided by the World Bank\u2019s Local Governance Performance Index.5 using information gathered by country experts and supplemented by national local government performance reporting.

Urban Strategy Urbanisation, along with decentralisation and globalisation, is undoubtedly one of the three phenomena that have the most decisive influence on the fate of Asia-Pacific countries. How are central governments preparing to cope with the rapid urbanisation taking place in the Asia-Pacific? How would the role assigned to local government determine the effects of urbanisation on population dynamics and the development of the continent? In other words, countries that have developed a relevant urban strategy adopted by all stakeholders and availed themselves of institutional, technical and financial resources to implement this strategy offer the best enabling environment for cities and local governments in their contributions to the effective management of urbanisation. 11. Environmental and Climate Change Governance Environmental issues have become increasingly important for Agenda 2030, particularly for cities. This is reflected in the UNFCCC COP21 Paris Agreement, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, and the Convention on Biological Diversity/Aichi Biodiversity Targets. Local governments across Asia-Pacific continue to face difficulties in adequately addressing urban environmental challenges related to climate change, disaster risk and the overall promotion of the natural urban environment. Countries\u2019 international commitments and practical implementation support to cities in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, vulnerability to climate change, disaster related shocks and promoting biodiversity for the natural urban environment are key areas to be assessed. Urban Strategy National reflection on urbanisation is underway, but an urban strategy has not yet been defined. A clear national urban strategy exists, but the financial and technical arrangements and capacities necessary to implement it are lacking. No national urban strategy. A clear national urban strategy exists, along with the financial and technical arrangements and capacities necessary to implement it. 3 2 1 4 Environmental and climate change Governance Country\u2019s international commitments for environmental protection and promotion exist but does not recognise the importance of urban areas and positive role of LGUs in implementation. Country\u2019s international commitments for environmental protection and promotion recognises the importance of urban areas and positive role of LGUs in implementation. Country has not pledged or adopted international commitments for environmental protection and promotion. Countries where city level action for environmental protection and promotion, including climate change and disaster risk reduction, are integrated into countries\u2019 international commitments with funding and capacity support committed for cities to drive national implementation, and with codes and standards in place at city level for disaster risk management and climate risk mitigation. 3 2 1 4 Enabling Environment for Cities and Local Government in Asia Pacific 45 3. Limitations of the CEE methodology The CEE rating of countries is based exclusively on the assessment of the national policy, institutional and legal framework for city and local government. The assessment is not intended to rate all aspects about city and local government performance in the Asia-Pacific. The selected criteria only examine the national constitution, legislative and regulatory framework and institutional settings relevant to cities and local governments. Other performance aspects, such as service delivery, of cities and local governments are not included in the perspective the objective of the assessment. The assessment reviews the decentralisation processes and the latitude afforded to cities with regard to the devolution of responsibilities, cities\u2019 and local governments\u2019 financial resources, their human resource capacities, among others. Nonetheless, it was challenging to uniformly apply the criteria for assessment in countries with diverse political systems and decentralisation structure. In some of the countries with a federal system, urban development is within the purview of the provincial governments, which are responsible for formulating urban policies and legal statutes, and creating institutional frameworks for local governments. In such countries, there may not be a conducive national framework for local governments. These countries may, thus, be assigned a lower score since the CEE assessment covers the national policy, legal and institutional framework for local governments. Provincial frameworks are not considered in the assessment since these can vary significantly across provinces in a federal country. The assessment of CEE in some countries, especially Pacific Island states, has relied on inputs from experts with knowledge in the field.

The final peer review process was used to refine the final scores for the CEE assessment. UCLG ASPAC is satisfied that the results of the research are a fair reflection of the current performance of CEE criteria indications for the countries studied. At the same time, it is important to view the scores as a reflection of where local governments think major gaps exist, and where support is required. Policy and technical support should be provided by a range of actors to address these gaps. Further research and studies should also be conducted to understand the issues and provide targeted support. City circle tram, one of major public transportation in Melbourne 48 This chapter presents CEE rating for selected Asia-Pacific countries, using the 11 criteria to analyse the national policy, legal and institutional framework. The ratings presented here do not measure institutional progress made by various countries over time. Instead they are a snapshot of the city enabling environment, and whether it supports sustainable urban development. More importantly, the assessment looks at the frameworks established by the central government for urban development. It does not look at the urban related legal, policy and institutional framework that may exist at the sub-national level. In addition to the 11 criteria, a brief assessment of women\u2019s participation in local governance is explained although the criterion was finally dropped from the overall City Enabling Environment assessment. The assessment covers 28 countries in the Asia-Pacific region, further classified in sub-regions as South Asia (9 Countries), South East Asia (9 Countries), East Asia (4 Countries) and Pacific Island Countries (6 countries) in Figure 1.2 earlier. The country ratings based on the CEE assessment is an attempt to gauge the decentralisation processes and the latitude afforded by national governments to cities and covers issues such as the devolution of responsibilities, city and local government financial resources, their human resource capacities, among others. The country assessments were conducted by local government associations affiliated to UCLG ASPAC and by independent experts. The same authors developed the country reports presented in the section B of this report. The assessment and the country reports were peer reviewed and validated by different stakeholders. These included relevant government agencies, civil society organisations, and urban experts. The composition of the peer review group varied from country to country. Given this, there may be variations in how countries were scored, and the focus of the country profiles in section B. Nevertheless, the CEE assessment highlights the priorities as seen by actors working on urban issues in a particular country.1 1. Overall Enabling Environment Assessment The overall CEE rating rating (2017) for the 28 countries is shown in Figure 4.1. The scores are out of a maximum of 44.

Furthermore, as good governance is included as one of the important pillars of Gross National Happiness, the country has been making efforts to improve transparency, accountability, and public participation.6 Urbanisation management is a priority for the country and it is reflected well in its National Urban Strategy. 5 HELVETAS Swiss Inter-cooperation, 2016, \u2018Local Governance Assessment Study \u2013 Prepared for the National Council of Bhutan\u2019 retrieved from http://www.nationalcouncil.bt/assets/uploads/files/Local%20Government%20Assessment%20 Study%20Reduced.pdf 6 ibid b. High Performing Countries (scores of 28-33 points) Twelve countries, have CEE scores in the range of 27 to 33. In these countries, the legal frameworks and legislation of local government generally exist serving as the umbrella for delegation of powers in government. Decentralisation in these countries has been functioning well for some years, providing authority for cities and local governments to manage their territories. National governments also have established supporting legal instruments in transparency, accountability and public participation to support cities in performing their functions. Nonetheless, in these countries legislation relevant to local governments is often found conflicting and missing, which could hinder local authorities\u2019 capacities.7 Legal, policy and institutional reforms need to be undertaken to ensure that the cities have the fiscal spaces, and capacities to function and deliver on the sustainable development agenda. 7 UCLG ASPAC, 2017, Country rating: Timor Leste, Vietnam, New Zealand 50 c. Moderate Performing Countries (22-27 points) Two countries: Afghanistan and Bangladesh fall in the range of 22-27 CCE country scores. The countries in this range are progressing towards an enabling environment for cities and local authorities which will require major reform efforts when compared to the next group ranking. They have implemented decentralisation, yet some improvements are needed or in some cases, implementation of the reforms has been slow.8 Several areas of reform identified include legislation to define the role of local authorities, financial capacity for local taxation, financial transfer from central government, framework for performance assessment. The central government has not delegated effective functional authority to the states, and this leads to significant conflict between levels of government. d. Lesser Performing Countries (>22 points) The lowest scoring countries, with scores 22, is Pakistan. In Pakistan, many aspects of local government have become dysfunctional and reform has been slow. The central government has not delegated effective functional authority to the states, and this leads to significant conflict between levels of government. 2.

The results for individual countries are presented in Part B of the report. Areas where countries scored-less than satisfactorily are: local government democracy, financial transfers from central to local government, local government revenue recovery, and urban strategy.

There is a vertical fiscal imbalance between revenues collected by the central and local government that often results in complicated transfer arrangements. These transfers involve a mix of grants, transfers and tax sharing arrangements between central and local government for the delivery of public goods and services delivery derived from national resources, corporate, sales and other taxes to address vertical physical imbalances. Local government revenue collection in many Asia-Pacific countries is poor. This is partly due to the limited powers of many local governments to Figure 4.2 Average CEE Criterion Score Across All Countries Figure 4.2 Average CEE Criterion Score Across All Countries Constitutional Framework Legislative Framework Local Democracy Financial Transfers from Central to Local Local Government own revenue Capacity Building of local Government Transparency Citizen Participation Local Government Performance Urban Strategy Environmental and Climate Change Governance 0 10 20 30 40 3.1 3.3 3.3 3.2 2.8 2.6 2.8 3.0 2.9 3.5 2.4 Enabling Environment for Cities and Local Government in Asia Pacific 51 set local property tax rates, local levies and service charges. In many cases property tax maps and valuations are outdated and the cost of collecting local taxes exceeds revenue returns. The reform of local government taxation and revenue collection systems is particularly problematic where local government systems have become highly centralised in sourcing capital for recurrent and capital expenditure. Lack of a comprehensive urban strategy is linked to poor planning and management of cities, leading to subsequent sporadic and unplanned development. Lack of urban strategy has contributed to serious environmental problems, congestion and poor-quality building design and construction. It also leads to inefficient land of property markets, poor sequencing of development and forward planning of urban infrastructure and services, particularly to peri- urban areas of large metropolitan in secondary cities. To improve the enabling environment for cities in Asia-Pacific countries, reform agendas are necessary at both regional, national and local levels. Issues such as enabling environments for climate change, the localisation of SDG reporting and standardisation of enabling environment infrastructure technology and services are critical to enabling integration of systems that will help to build capacity towards supporting more sustainable forms of urban development. The need for a regional and national reform agenda for actions to strengthen the capacity of enabling environment legislator frameworks is discussed in the conclusion chapter of this report. 3. Sub-regional Performance At the sub-regional level, the challenges and issues for improving the overall enabling environment for cities vary significantly. While there is no consistency on how countries have ranked on the CEE criteria, some common challenges can be highlighted. The common challenge for the Pacific Islands sub-region is capacity building for municipal administration and local authorities. In the South Asia sub-region, urban strategy, revenue collection, and capacity development are problematic. For East Asian countries, revenue enhancement, and fiscal transfer are priority issues to be addressed. The situation for South- East Asia is similar but acuter than East Asia. Overall East Asia sub-region countries perform best, followed by the Pacific. A country like New Zealand performed well and is comparable to Japan and South Korea, but Pacific Island states have weaknesses, especially in local revenue and fiscal transfers. East Asia countries perform well in constitutional and legislative frameworks for local government, but the implementation of these is proving challenging due to issues around local democracy, and local revenue management (Mongolia), and weak performance management arrangements (Japan). South Asia sub-regional performance is weakest, indicating the need for significant reforms to local government, especially in establishing better clarity of the roles, administrative and fiscal responsibilities of various levels of government. 4. Scores by Criteria The following discusses the scoring of the 28 countries of the Asia-Pacific region against each of the 11 criteria. It seeks to explain some of the common factors that give rise to the results overall and in the sub-regions. The results provide insights that may help to improve each criterion at a region and sub-regional level. a. Criterion 1: Constitutional Framework A country\u2019s constitution sets out the basic principles and laws of a nation, state, or social group that determine the powers and duties of the government and establishes rights for and the relationship with citizens.

New Zealand\u2019s Constitution is comprised of all the laws of the country, which includes local government laws. In Australia local government is not recognised in the national Constitution, instead it is recognised in respective state Constitutions. Recognition of local government in a nation\u2019s constitution, along with a clear description of roles and responsibilities of local government, is considered evidence of a strong enabling framework for local government in most countries. Performance of Countries The Constitutional Framework: the CEE rating results for Criteria 1 are shown in the Figure 4.3. Twenty-five countries scored 3 or above, indicating that the role of local government is recognised strongly in their constitution, although the role and responsibilities of local governments tend to be elaborated or defined in separate legislation. Australia is an outlier in that local government is recognised in the state, rather than the national, constitutions. This is the reason for Australia being one of the five countries with a score of 2. While most countries obtained three points on the rating scale for constitutional recognition the autonomy, powers and responsibilities of local authorities vary significantly. Eight countries: Bhutan, China, Laos, Mongolia, Malaysia, Myanmar Nepal, and Philippines scored four points for having strong and clearly defined roles and responsibilities of local governments in their constitutions. Two countries Fiji and Kiribati do not have constitutional recognition for local government. Sri Lanka\u2019s constitution only recognises second-tier of government and the third tier of government are governed by the Provincial Council Act. All other countries have varying levels of recognition and powers of local government recognised in national or state constitutions. Performance of Sub-regions Overall, the Asia-Pacific region performs well in this criterion. Across the sub-regions, East Asia countries score better than Pacific Island countries. The main reason Pacific Island states and Sri Lanka, being former British colonies scored lower, is that local government was never provided for in the constitutions, but in separate legislation. Several countries, like Australia and New Zealand and some Pacific Island States are constitutional monarchies, some still tied to the United Kingdom. Their Constitutions is not a written document but a composite of all the laws of the country. The recognition of local government in the constitution does give stronger recognition to its importance, however, it does not necessarily mean that local government in the country is weak. b. Criterion 2: Legislative Framework Criterion 2 follows on from the constitutional framework analysis above. The chart for Criterion 2 (see Figure 4.4) shows a score by country to reflect the adequacy of the legislative framework in its support for local government. The legislative framework that is considered most favourable embeds strongly the principles of subsidiarity, especially the delegations of both administrative and fiscal powers and responsibilities to local government. In many countries, the administrative powers and responsibilities are strong, but the fiscal responsibilities are weak. This results in a significant fiscal vertical imbalance in the raising and flow of funds between central and local government. The effect of weak fiscal powers is that local governments tend to struggle with budgets and funding of capital works programmes. Performance of the Countries Eight countries in the region have strong local government legislation that derives from the national constitution. Australia has strong local government legislation at the state constitution level. Five Asia-Pacific countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Maldives, Nepal and Pakistan scored 2 points. In these countries either legislative provisions conflict with their constitution or some provisions in the constitution are not implemented. Overall, the legislative frameworks which form the enabling environment for the operation of local government across the region are good. Problems with the multiplicity of legislation that stem from central to local government are where challenges are created. In some countries, there are parallel structures and a confusing array of powers and responsibilities which are not clearly allocated to a respective layer of government. In Indonesia, when local government reforms were introduced in 2000, provincial and local governments were vested with similar powers. In Cambodia, provincial central line agencies exert authority over local government, leaving local government with strong legislation but weak authority. Performance of Sub-regions From the CEE Ratings of 2017, the overall performance of Asia-Pacific countries appears good, as 23 out of 28 countries scored 3 points and above. However, the overall results of South Asian countries indicate the need for strengthening of the legislative frameworks that support local governments.

Single party governments tend to score lowest on local democracy; however, this does not mean there are not opportunities for community residents to engage in government decision- making processes at a local level. The commune systems of Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam allow for representation at a local level, and there are a range of views considered through the single-party system process. It is important to recognise that democracy is a western system of representation, but that alternative systems of local government engagement operate just as effectively in countries of the region. Performance of Countries Australia, India, Iran, Indonesia, Japan, Maldives, Myanmar New Zealand, Philippines and South Korea score a rating of 4 for this criterion (See Figure 4.5). The constitutions and laws of these countries strongly advocate principles of democratically elected government. Countries like China, South Korea, and Thailand have scored 3 points on the rating scale, as local assemblies and executive bodies are elected, but not necessarily throughout the country. Sri Lanka still scored 3, though, local government in Sri Lanka is currently undergoing reform, and local governments are administered by centrally appointed chief ministers and secretaries. The system will change with the next local government\u2019s elections due in 2018. Eleven countries achieved 2 points on the rating scale. These include Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Kiribati, Laos, Mongolia, Pakistan, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Vietnam and Vanuatu. In some of these countries, local assemblies are elected, but executive bodies are appointed. In Malaysia and Thailand, there are mechanisms for engagement with wider communities in decision making, especially where this affects major urban development projects funded by international development agency loans and grant assistance. Malaysia, Nepal, and Fiji scored 1 point. Local assemblies and executive bodies in these countries are not elected, but are deployed by the central government. In the case of Nepal, the country is undergoing a phase of transition with a new constitution.

There is often a very high level of consultation amongst the community towards consensus building, which espouses strong democratic principles. Decision-making, however, can be slow. Performance of Sub-regions There is no overall pattern in the performance of democratic systems in the Asia-Pacific region. Only eight countries have directly elected local governments; others have mixed appointments systems. Some countries, like Sri Lanka are moving towards the re-establishment of elected local government. But at the same time, elections alone are not an indication of local democracy. If measures are not put in place to ensure political participation of marginalised sections of the population (including women), then there is a risk of elections reinforcing traditional power structures. Strengthening local democracy is a key area of reform for the Asia-Pacific region, but it needs to be considered carefully in the context of established political systems and practices. What is emerging is strong political party representation in local government, especially in developing democracies. A second phenomenon is the emergence of social media in local democratic elections and local governance. The impact of social media has created a new form of democratic governance, especially in South East and South Asia, where it has had a profound impact on political campaigning and local decision-making processes. d. Criterion 4: Financial Transfers from the Central Government to Local Governments Criterion 4 attempts to provide a performance measurement of financial transfers from central government to the local government, and their predictability.

In Australia, this occurs at a state level, and a commonwealth level for the territories. The countries that scored 3: Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, Indonesia, Japan, Kiribati, Malaysia, Mongolia, New Zealand, Philippines, Solomon Islands, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Vanuatu and Vietnam. In these countries, the transfer of resources to local governments and their distribution among local governments are transparent and predictable, with utilisation determined at the national level. Cambodia, Iran, Laos, Maldives, Malaysia, Myanmar and Nepal scored 2. The transfer of resources to local governments or their distribution among local governments is predictable using a transparent formula, but often delayed.

The unpredictability of the transfer systems in Pakistan has a trickle- down impact to other criteria and the county\u2019s overall CEE rating. The delay in transfer of funds is a common issue amongst local governments, with many unable to continue with capital investment programmes because agreed flows of funds between central and local government are erratic. Unpredictability in the timing of funds transfers makes difficult, not only the timely construction of physical infrastructure and services provided by enabling environments, but it also increases uncertainty, especially if local governments are seeking to engage in public-private partnerships. Poor vertical fiscal imbalances and transfers are a very significant constraint to effective local government throughout the region. Performance of Sub-region In terms of financial transfer from central to local governments, sub-region wise, reforms are needed in some countries in South Asia and Southeast Asia to improve reliance on the flow of funds under notional vertical fiscal resource sharing arrangements with local government to improve their performance in the delivery of essential legal and other local enabling environments services. e.

Seventeen countries scored two points or less. South Asia and South-East Asian countries are performing poorest. Improving the level of local tax and other revenue collection at local government level in these two regions is a high priority, given the increasing rates of urbanisation and the limited capital funds available at the central government level. The overall ratings for this criterion, indicate the need for reforms in strengthening local government revenue. f. Criterion 6: Capacity Building of Local Government Administrations Capacity building of local government administrations can be defined as \u2018the process through which local authorities obtain, strengthen, and maintain the capabilities to set and achieve their goals in a given environment\u2019.11 In this criterion, higher rated countries have clear national strategies for capacity building of local governments, including standards and procedures, training systems and human resource management planning, rules on integrity in hiring and the conduct of operations by local governments. Performance of Countries Eighteen countries are performing well in this criterion. These countries have a national framework of reference that applies to all local governments in the country defining the qualifications and responsibilities of local government staff, and a national strategy for training and promoting human resources in local governments. Afghanistan and Lao PDR have been given enormous international development assistance to strengthen and rebuild local government in the country, after years of civil conflict and war. This explains their score of 3. The lower lower rating for other countries is explained by increased cutbacks on staff training, the shift to greater use of technology for service delivery and outsourcing of many local government services. Philippines, India and Timor-Leste scored 2. The Philippines score is explained by the country\u2019s many levels of government, with inadequate resources to provide sufficient training. In India, capacity building intiatives are mostly for civil servants at national and state level, and limited opportunities exist for improving local government officials\u2019 capacity where such opportunities exist, 11 UNDP, Primer on Capacity Development, 2009. only a few local governments avail it. Timor-Leste was given substantial resources at independence, but the decline in international assistance to continue local government capacity building makes it difficult to deliver services to more remote urban areas. New Zealand has several provisions at the national level that focus on staff qualifications and capacity development but does not have a single national framework focusing on the capacity development of local staff. Kiribati, Solomon Islands, Pakistan, Fiji and Bangladesh scored 1 point. There is no national framework of reference defining the qualifications and responsibilities of local government staff. There are very limited national resources available for training and promoting human resources in local governments. Australia again is an outlier. State level strategies for improving human resources capacities are developed and implemented but there is no single national framework. Performance of Sub-regions Many Asia-Pacific countries are performing well in Capacity Building of Local Governments. Southeast and East Asian sub-regions performing best.

This is because local governments have responsibility for many business functions and are actively engaged with PPPs and joint ventures to reduce the costs, and stream the performance delivery of local public services. Many local government services such as solid waste collection, water supply, parks management etc., are outsourced. Targets are set for local government performance. Employment is no longer a job for life but is competency-based, using performance-based contract arrangements. Many local governments apply the user pay and value for money principle in deciding on the delivery of services. Modern local governments, require staff with good people management skills, competencies in the use of modern technology and critical thinking, negotiating and organisational management skills. Continuing education and training to update skills is compulsory for many local government staff to retain their jobs. Unfortunately, many training institutes (including in those countries that scored above 3) are inadequately supported in terms of staff, continuing professional capacity building, curricula development and technology for online delivery of training and support services. Local governments need to invest heavily in new and advancing technologies and equipment to remain efficient in delivering and maintaining an increasing range of services that are being devolved from central and state government, often with little additional resources to acquire these. The reform and modernisation of local government in South, Southeast and small island Pacific state countries is crucial. If local governments in these sub-regions cannot deliver the services and build the enabling environments to support operations and management of cities, the prospects for them to meet the SDGs and improve the welfare and living standards of people will be significantly diminished. Local government associations, and other organisations working with urban local bodies such UCLG ASPAC, Cities Alliance, and UNDP can play a leading advocacy role in persuading central governments to accelerate devolution and decentralisation of public services. g. Criterion 7: Transparency On average score for this criterion is the highest in comparison to other criteria. Central issues around transparency are concerned with budgets, approvals and expenditures as well as contracts and investments being publicly disclosed, and that the public has easy access to official information. Some countries, including Japan, New Zealand and Australia require local government annual accounts and annual reports to be published. Budget hearings must also be openly debated; committees to ensure appropriations of capital are thoroughly scrutinised. Most countries in the region require local governments to prepare budgets and development plans which are publicly available. However, actual data on how easily accessible such information is difficult to collect. In many countries, matters of public interest and reports are not available through the internet or other media, reducing both accessibility and transparency of many processes associated with strong and well-functioning enabling environment frameworks. When the scores related to transparency are compared with the criterion on public participation, significant discrepancies can be seen in some countries. Transparency is a factor contributing to effective public participation. Without access to public information, specifically related to budgets, plans, investments etc, engagement by public in decision-making processes would be ineffective. Therefore, it is recommended that the scores for this criterion be compared with other measurements such as the global Right to Afghanistan Bangladesh Bhutan India Iran Maldives Nepal Pakistan Sri Lanka Cambodia Indonesia Laos Malaysia Myanmar Philippines Thailand Timor Leste Vietnam China Japan Mongolia South Korea Australia Fiji Kiribati New Zealand Solomond Islands Vanuatu 0 1 2 3 4 Figure 4.9 Scores by Countries of Transperancy 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 58 Information (RTI) rating which looks at the overall legal and policy measures in support of access to information.12 The Global RTI index ranks India and Sri Lanka as one of the top 10 countries with strong right to information legislation. In addition, integrity measurements can also help to determine how well countries and their institutions are promoting transparency. Open Government Partnerships review of member countries in this area can also provide valuable data for comparison and analysis. Performance of Countries Almost all countries, except Pakistan scored high on this criterion. This could mean that necessary measures are in place to promote transparency and most countries do not view it is a problematic areas. Whether or not these measures are fully implemented requires further research.

Criterion 8: Citizen Participation Direct contact with political leaders and engagement by civil society has increased in all cities across the region. More people are joining public interest groups, civic associations, and other collective forms of action. Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms are providing even greater opportunities for citizen participation and engagement. This has given rise to new mechanisms for political action, such as political consumerism, new forms of continuous action and creative activism. As the International Social Survey Programme notes the internet enables new methods of peer-to-peer involvement among citizens, who share political views and want to be active. Many of these activities also offer greater policy content and policy focus than the simple act of voting.\u201d13 12 http://www.rti-rating.org 13 International Social Survey Programme, (2017) GESIS-Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, http://www.issp.org/menu- top/home/ Performance of Countries Most Asian Pacific countries were found to be performing well in this criterion, except for the Solomon Islands, which does do not have national legislation on citizen participation, nor locally organised space for dialogue and consultation. But Solomon Islands has more traditional forms of consultative policy processes. Australia, Afghanistan, Laos, Myanmar, Solomon Islands, and Sri Lanka do not have national legislation on citizen participation but have locally organised spaces for dialogue and consultation, including spaces initiated and supported by development partners in countries like Afghanistan and Laos. Fourteen countries scored four on this criterion. Indonesia scored high as the level of social media in the county and engagement in national and local political and community activities is high, and is enshrined in national and local government policy. Performance of Sub-regions East Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asian sub-regions are performing well in the citizen participation criterion while Pacific Island sub- regions is performing below average.

Criterion 9: Local Government Performance Assessing the performance of public administration at the local level helps to understand the gaps in implementing and delivering development plans. Measuring local governance performance provides useful feedback to help local government officials, political parties, civil society actors, the public and the international development community pinpoint specific geographical areas and substantive areas where policy reform and/or capacity development support is needed. Increasingly local communities are demanding more accountability on the use of tax payer resources in delivering quality and adequate services to local communities. Moreover, with greater decentralisation, central governments are demanding that local governments make the most efficient use of resources provided from central revenue sources. Thus, local governments\u2019 ability to perform and deliver on development plans is coming under increasing scrutiny. Performance of Countries Except for three countries, all other countries scored 3 and above on this criterion. This shows that most countries have systems in place for assessing and reporting the performance of local government. However, similar to the criterion on Transparency, this criterion needs to be further analysed and compared with other data on local governments performance. Many local governments in the Asia-Pacific region have low public expenditure rates which affects their ability to perform and deliver on development plans. Therefore, to get a better picture of the effectiveness and performance of local governments, this criterion should be compared with other indices such as the Local Governance Performance Index (LGPI) which provides an approach to the measurement, analysis and improvement of local governance.14 The high ranking of Timor-Leste is due to the significant international development assistance and support given to assist with local government functioning. The performance of local government in New Zealand has improved with the introduction of a collaborative network of cities, known as the core cities,15 which identifies ways in which resources can be shared, and leveraged to support common platform information, improve", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8f08e740-152d-48e4-b29a-c06c65051f57": {"__data__": {"id_": "8f08e740-152d-48e4-b29a-c06c65051f57", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/city-enabling-environment-rating", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "City Enabling Environment Rating", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/city-enabling-environment-rating", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aa264616bbd15815be71be2ef897a4dee992e84626fdc317a125be12c3cf9a7c"}}, "hash": "aa264616bbd15815be71be2ef897a4dee992e84626fdc317a125be12c3cf9a7c", "text": "policy formulation and joint marketing of New Zealand goods produced in different cities, thereby enabling the cities to perform well on economic indicators. Having appropritate systems in place for measuring the performance of local governments does not mean that the recommendations made to improve performance are fully implemented. For instance: a paper on performance evaluation of urban local governments for Indian cities highlights poor operations and financial management, competencies and labour inefficiencies.16 The same situation occurs in Sri Lanka where audit shows that many local governments collect less than 50 per cent of target tax revenues, and fail to spend their budgets. New models of local government based on corporate structures are needed, with performance targets applied for operations, especially budgeting and maintenance.

Without legislative and policy reform to local government enabling environments, cities in the region will lose competitive advantage, and bring rising transaction costs to business and communities. A healthy and prosperous business sector in cities across the region is only achievable if local governments can provide the services they need to compete and grow. Performance of Sub-regions Most Asia-Pacific countries are performing well in this criterion. It means that countries have systems in place to measure the performance of local governments. However, as mentioned above other aspects such as expenditure and delivery rates of local governments and urban local bodies need to be fully considered. In addition, whether or not local governments are supported in implementing the recommendations from performance assessments should also be looked at. Country-specific reforms are required to be initiated to improve the overall performance of local governments in this region. The focus of performance enhancement must be organisation and financial reform, to ensure revenue collection is substantially improved, and budget management is more accountable. j Criterion 10: Urban Strategy The factor which has the highest impact on the city enabling environment is the lack of an urban strategy. A comprehensive urban strategy can serve as an umbrella and guideline for cities to manage emerging challenges of urbanisation. Most countries have planning legislation to develop a range of policies and plans. Most cities have plans, but these have failed to live up to expectation. They were overly ambitious and/or did not have the resources to support their implementation. The results have been a disregard for plans, enforcement of planning laws, regulations and development approvals and spatial environments that are substandard and pending natural disaster zones flooding and coastal inundation. Performance of Countries In terms of national urban strategy, 12 countries have been rated 1 or 2, indicating the need for special attention to be given to address the systemic weakness in this area. Only four countries received a score of 4. China, Vietnam, Fiji and Japan have been able to embed urban planning as part of strategic urban development plans. Vietnam, for example, has a National Green Cities policy, whereas Japan has a national economic plan that focuses on cities as economic growth poles. Strong adherence to urban planning policy and approval, has a significant bearing on the certainty of investments, the stability of property markets and the ability to use land and property as collateral for private and business investment. Local governments have generally failed to uphold the rule of law on planning and urban strategy. The formulation of a national strategy to develop a managed system of cities, improve connectivity and competitiveness between cities and urban-rural linkages is important but it is at the metropolitan and district development plan level where the enabling environment legislative frameworks have failed the most. Local government must be prepared to engage in collaborative planning and governance at the interface of metropolitan and peri-urban municipalities.

Performance of Sub-regions As indicated, Asia-Pacific countries\u2019 performance for these criteria is low. Subregion wise, only East Asian countries have done well. Preparation of a country level urban strategy could, therefore, be a recommended action for most countries. k. Criterion 11: Environmental and Climate Change Governance Climate change has been quoted many times as one of the greatest threats to humankind. Cities in the Asia Pacific region are among the highest at-risk and vulnerable cities in the world to natural disasters and the effects of climate change. In some Pacific Island states, urban areas are potentially in danger of disappearing beneath the ocean before the end the next century. Asian cities have some of the highest mortality rates due to air pollution and are highly prone to disaster risks. Regulating for environmental risks and hazards has been slow, poorly enforced and disregarded in favour of development that will create jobs and add to GDP of countries and cities. If cities in the region continue to ignore or fail to regulate actions that contribute to environmental degradation (air and water pollution) and climate change, or put in place mitigation measures to address adverse effects of climate change such as increasing intensity of natural disasters then it may have far-reaching consequences in terms of loss of lives and livelihood. Failure to build robust environmental legal enabling environments will result in rising externality costs that will have an impact on all sectors of the region\u2019s urban economies. Performance of Countries Countries that are most affected by natural disaster and climate change are leaders in environmental legislation. Bhutan has staked its claim to the importance of the environment and happiness in its economic development. Myanmar, is one of the least urbanised countries in the region, has introduced national environmental conservation protection laws17 for management of sensitive and flood-prone urban areas. Most other countries in the region are taking steps to improve environmental management through regulations covering a broad range of areas from housing to air control. However, for many countries the ability to enforce environmental regulations or to combat the effects of climate change are patchy. Performance of Sub-region Most Asia-Pacific countries are performing well on the criteria of environmental and climate change governance, but local governments must do more. Pacific Island states have the most to lose from failure to develop rules and regulations at a national level in Asia, specifically to shore up climate change mitigation mechanisms that are iterated through cooperation with the local level. 17 The Environmental Conservation Law: The Pyidaungsu Hluttaw Law No. 9 / 2012, (2012).

Summary of Asia-Pacific Region Performance and Challenges Cities of the Asia-Pacific region face many challenges in developing legal, policy and institutional frameworks for enabling environments to support the sustainable development of cities.

The most pressing need across the region is to improve local government revenues. However, to do this requires much stronger enabling legislation\u2015particularly related to the autonomy of cities in the raising of their own revenue. For this, the legislative frameworks for vertical fiscal integration and the use of tax and other nationally collected revenues needs review. If local governments are not given greater powers, financial autonomy and freedom to decide on how best to use their resources to achieve more sustainable development outcomes at a local level, the prospects of achieving the SDGs at both national and global levels will diminish. The need to focus on improved urban strategy, particularly the willingness to uphold the rule of law and enforce provisions of planning and environmental regulation are critical issues identified in many Asia and Pacific countries. The greater focus must be given to creating legislation which encourages a collaborative approach involving metropolitan planning and management, citizen engagement in planning decision-making processes, and enforcement of regulations at a local level. This particularly applies to increased checks on the use of land that is set aside for environmental, infrastructure or community purposes. Finally, there is a need for reform of many laws related to local government\u2015at national, state and municipality levels. Many of the laws need to be amended in to rapid change that is occurring in the fields of technology, ageing populations and the circular economy. The sustainable development of cities in the region will require collaborative efforts and cooperation at country to country and city to city levels. Such collaborative efforts are essential for establishing development pathways, and creating solutions, especially around improving fiscal space and capacities of cities, and creation of innovative projects designed to address problems facing the development of cities in the region. UCLG Asia- Pacific, in collaboration with Cities Alliance, and UNDP, can play a role through its regional country membership networks to facilitate improved connectivity that will lead to more creative solutions in solving the many problems that face the development of the region.

Women\u2019s political participation is lower than the global average, and their economic representation lags behind men in most countries in the region. In 2013, only 21 per cent of councillors elected in government were women, compared to 79 per cent male; this was a decrease of three per cent.18 Since 2010, women\u2019s participation levels at subnational level have fallen, but risen at the national level (Figure 4.14). Religious laws, customs and other practices are barriers to the achievement of greater gender equality and women\u2019s political participation and epresentation at the local level.19 More sustained efforts are necessary by governments and political parties at all levels to ensure gender equality and greater opportunities for women\u2019s representation in political office. This severely affects the ability of the countries in the region to achieve equitable development for all. At the national and local level, women\u2019s equal participation is essential for promoting inclusive governance and ensuring equitable development. A gender-inclusive perspective would allow municipal governments to develop strategies to address specific challenges faced by women in cities. To address, the social, political and economic 18 UNDP (2014).

These measures also provide a strategic entry point for realising gender equality at the city level. With the aim to look at the country performance on women\u2019s participation in local governance, CEE rating initially included a criterion on women\u2019s political participation. Nonetheless, the criterion was eventually excluded due to the failure to capture accurate enough data. The indicator of temporary measures did not fit to several countries such as Australia, New Zealand and Bhutan hence it has affected to the country performance rating (see Figure 4.15).

Overview This report on CEE Rating in the Asia-Pacific region provides a baseline for current legal frameworks of cities. The findings from the assessment show that local governments must play a more direct and accountable role in the development of legislative frameworks that impact the local level if cities are to become more liveable, prosperous, dynamic and sustainable places for the 3 billion people that are predicted to live in cities of the Asia-Pacific by 2050. Furthermore, a generally more consultative and collaborative approach is needed for relations between national governments and institutions that are in charge of developing and maintaining enabling environment. The frameworks supporting these enabling environments are multi-level and multi- dimensional, but it is at the local level that institutions are weakest, and at which an agenda for change must be embraced. It is also at the local level that the agenda for change is most needed if the SDGs are to be met. 2. Summary of Findings Many cities in Asia-Pacific countries face an uphill task of funding infrastructure and services to meet the basic needs of growing urban population. Local financial management frequently suffers from lack of capacity to collect revenue for taxes and fees; something that is often restricted by inadequate regulatory frameworks. Lagging public-sector spending takes a toll on urban efficiency and local economic activity, creating a vicious cycle of budgetary shortfalls, choking urban conditions, and economic stagnation. Given these challenges, conducive enabling environments will result in better performance in service delivery. In the context of rapid urbanisation and climatic vulnerability of Asia and Pacific cities, urban local authorities are expected to play a key role towards adaptation and building the enabling frameworks for resilience after disasters and other shocks. Cities and local governments, many of which have significant vulnerabilities, are the key stakeholders for adaptive and resilience building actions. These challenges are compounded in the Asia-Pacific by rapid rates of urbanisation and concentrations of poverty. The strength of enabling environments is a crucial factor in the competitiveness, creativity, and resilience of cities. However, despite strong recognition for their role in various national constitutions, and backing by enabling legal systems, local governments remain weak in most Asia and Pacific countries.

While neither ageing populations nor trade and investment was part of the CEE assessment, they must be considered, as they can cause a significant shift in focus of development policies because of the way in which they influence resource generation and the overall financial systems at the local government level. Local governments facing this problems can face significant financial problems in how to extract revenue when the tax base shrinks and incomes fall. In addition, the Fourth Industrial Revolution will affect the more advanced economies of the region and its lesser-developed economies. The use of artificial intelligence, advanced technology manufacturing, 3D printing and autonomous vehicles is still some way off, but few cities are building enabling environments that will allow them to capture the many opportunities created by the revolution. Local government must begin to reform their enabling environments, especially local legislative reforms, if they are to fulfil the roles they were created for: to provide essential services to local communities to allow them to live safe, and prosperous lives. Key Findings: In summarising the finding of the 11 criteria used to conduct the assessment, most Asia-Pacific countries have enabling constitutional frameworks for local governments but the strengthening of supporting legislative frameworks, especially for fiscal devolution and inclusiveness, are required to develop stronger decentralised, autonomous and self-sufficient local governments. In many cases, there are parallel administrative structures and responsibilities for local government and provincial central agencies. Many countries do not have strong enabling frameworks or local governments that can generate their own local revenues. In Sri Lanka, Laos and many Pacific island states local governments are highly dependent on the state/ Enabling Environment for Cities and Local Government in Asia Pacific 67 province or national governments for funds to support the development of infrastructures and delivery of services. Financial transfers from the central to local governments are mostly predictable, but the inability or unwillingness to generate local revenue through taxes and charges and decide on budget expenditure is an area of concern and potential reform. Local government capacity is an area requiring immediate reform and improvement. Improvements in knowledge, skills and the usage of technology are needed in financial, infrastructure and organisations management. In \u2018Transparency\u2019 and \u2018Citizens Participation,\u2019 local governments appear to be doing well, but there is scope for further improvements in some countries, and the possibility of certain problems going underreported. In assessing the \u2018Local Government Performance\u2019 in Asia-Pacific countries, more focus should be on whether or not recommendations from performance measurement and audits are considered and implemented. The process is generally an internal administrative process. Many Asia-Pacific Countries do not perform well on the criteria of \u2018Urban Strategy.\u2019 There is significant room for improvement in this area, especially in the planning and management of urban development.

Actions to Strengthen City Enabling Environments The report has identified several areas where change is necessary by governments at all levels to strengthen the legal, policy and institutional framework of enabling environments for cities in Asia and Pacific countries. The findings and tailored recommendations for reforms in each of the 28 countries are presented in part B of the report. a. Devolution and Subsidiarity Roles and Responsibilities of Governments Urban governance is a major challenge to towns and cities in the region. Many storylines are common to various countries across the region including things as the management of urbanisation, the challenges of climate change and the effects of the disruptive economy. However, much of the onus of responsibility for implementing reform, change and the development of stronger enabling environments will occur at the city, rather than the national level. Unfortunately, many towns and cities do not have the authority, autonomy, resources, technologies or capacity to play a more direct role in the strengthening of local enabling environments. Local governments must have a more direct role in the development and management of enabling environments for cities and be given the responsibilities and resources to support them. This is the first key message of the report. b. Integrated Multi-Level Enabling Environment Frameworks The enabling environment affecting local governments operate at multiple levels. Streamlining administrative, technical and operational services between pertinent levels of government is crucial to avoiding duplication of services, the overlapping and conflict between government entities and the heterogeneous spread of public resources.

Creation of a Council/ national body consisting of different tiers of governments , to address reforms to different layers of the enabling environment is a useful mechanism to integrate and create a \u2018whole of government\u2019 reform to sector policy, legal, procedural frameworks to support more efficient enabling environments at the city and municipality level. The Council of Australian Governments is a good practice example of a mechanism to integrate policies across governments, but it needs to be expanded to represent the interest of state and local governments. ii. Integrated management information systems between levels of governments are crucial for matters related to financial management, operations and disaster and risk warning systems, especially in relation climate change adaption. 68 iii. Adopting integrated capacity development programmes and modules to address capacity gaps. c. Collaborative Governance Collaborative Governance involves the government, community and private sectors communicating with each other and working together on policies, planning, program activities and the like to achieve more than any one of the above could achieve on its own. Collaborative governance should focus on: i. Open governance systems which provide a high level of transparency and accountability reporting on the activities of local government. ii. Local Government resource sharing and leveraging, through the pooling of staff, equipment, and services, to utilise public resources to the fullest. iii. Development of collaborative networks, including: \u2022 Open source platforms, databases and shared information to build the knowledge base which underpins the development of strong local government enabling environments \u2022 Collaborative research and development to investigate common problems that are hampering the efficient functioning of enabling environments \u2022 Collaborative marketing with the private sector and local government to support local economic development \u2022 Support for the development of enabling environment that fosters the growth of industry clusters \u2022 Encourage the support for local innovation and technology transfer between the private sector and clusters of local government which make up metropolitan regions or surround secondary and intermediary cities. d. Fiscal Decentralisation Municipal governments in the Asia-Pacific region must be given greater fiscal autonomy to generate revenue and raise capital to develop infrastructure and deliver services that strengthen the capacity and competitiveness of local enabling environments. Local governments must also take on a more responsible role in the management of public finances. Ways central and local governments can support this include: i. Participatory based budgeting and reporting which engages key business and community group stakeholders in the formulation and prioritisation of annual and long-term budgets. ii. Balanced budgeting, which ensures the revenues match budgeted expenditure outgoings. iii. Giving local government the powers to raise capital through the issuing of stocks, bonds and sub-sovereign loans for capital investment to strengthen the capacity of local enabling environments to support sustainable growth and development of city economies. iv. Publication of accounts including profit and loss, balance and finance flows statements as a means of improving transparency and accountability of public expenditure. v. Enhancing local revenue collection systems through improving revenue collection systems, seeking opportunities for value capture and revising tax schedules and property valuations. vi. Public-private partnerships, especially to provide community infrastructure such as markets, water supply and sanitation, transport and logistics hubs (including dry ports), hospitals and community colleges. vii. A credit rating system for cities, to establish creditworthiness and to provide a demonstration of sound public sector financial management. viii. Preparation of annual and five year financial plans to improve financial flows, including from sources offering capital development finance. e. Developing and Strengthening E-Environments: E-governance and \u2018Smart City\u2019 Technologies. Advances in information and communication technology are changing the way people communicate, work, and live. It is also fundamentally changing the nature and the way governments go about their business. Local governments are being run increasingly like large corporations, with management practices that are increasingly reliant on \u2018Smart\u2019 technology- intensive approaches. The push towards smart cities in this region shows that national and local governments are keen on digital transformation of the public sector, and developing e-based public services. However, many of these smart initiatives are not fully integrated into the administrative systems. National and local governments will need to invest significantly to ensure interoperability between different systems to deliver public services quickly, efficiently and transparently. The introduction of systems and services has potential Enabling Environment for Cities and Local Government in Asia Pacific 69 to substantially reduce transaction costs and add value and employment to local economies. It is crucial for local government to develop and strengthen enabling environments that will support the rapid introduction of: i. Integrated e-platforms that offer all services related to governance (identity cards,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1ed60582-3e57-4da1-9d74-8d5b9b82d501": {"__data__": {"id_": "1ed60582-3e57-4da1-9d74-8d5b9b82d501", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/city-enabling-environment-rating", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "City Enabling Environment Rating", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/city-enabling-environment-rating", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9df9ab19b5243f2898147d781a44391ddc06c2a0d1cab6a2856b5abb101e6974"}}, "hash": "9df9ab19b5243f2898147d781a44391ddc06c2a0d1cab6a2856b5abb101e6974", "text": "registration, taxes and fee collections), businesses and economic development (including forms, online applications, permits etc), information services (on work, entertainment, and also emergency warning system). ii. Backend integrated systems to improve cooperation and collaboration between different agencies, ministries and departments. iii. E-Learning to support online training and education of local government and public, similar to Singapore, to increase the usage of e-services. iv. E-feedback mechanisms and performance monitoring systems (such as Lapor! In Indonesia). f. Legislative and policy reform to strengthen enabling environments Many local government laws, especially those related to finance, public sector management, planning and provision of urban services are outdated and can conflict with other laws and regulations. The failure of the regulatory environment is a significant impediment to the functioning of cities. Governments could significantly strengthen the legal framework by undertaking: i. Reform of Local Government laws and regulations to ensure they are compliant with international best practice, especially in areas of workplace and safety standards, planning and construction and penalties for infringements ii. Changing of Laws to bylaws to ensure these are compliant with ISO standards iii. Simplification of policies into language that is clear and unambiguous iv. Use of regulations, rather than laws to enable cities and local government to respond quickly to changes in practices, national policies, and recommendations from audit institutions. g. Urban Management and the Enabling Environment Urban Management is a term covering the management of a large set of functions that affect the planning, development, efficient operations and maintenance of cities. Urban management should also ensure that the transport, logistics, information and energy systems that run cities are run and maintained efficiently and effectively. Critical elements of urban management that cities in the Asia and Pacific region can focus on to underpin the development of stronger enabling environments are: i. Audits and valuations of all public assets and facilities to develop asset management and maintenance plans. ii. Integrated planning and development approval systems to ensure one stop or single window submission of building and development applications comparable to systems operating in Singapore, Australia and New Zealand iii. Operations maintenance of public assets and facilities. h. Localising SDGs Reporting on Enabling Environments The localisation of the SDGs at the city and municipal government levels is crucial for achieving the sustainable development agenda. Developing localised sets of SDGs indicators is a necessary step in identifying what needs to be done at the local level. It is also critical for strengthening and monitoring the performance of policies and development programmes. In addition, localising SDGs indicators and collecting data at the local level can help countries to provide accurate aggregated reporting on the 169 targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). i. Developing a national set of indicators to measure the enabling environment of cities using the SDGs and other development indicators. ii. Cities developing monitoring and evaluation systems for collecting information to measure localised SDGs indicators.at the local level. iii. Integrated online databases and platforms to support cities to collate and analyse different sets of data to achieve a comprehensive picture of gaps as well as identify areas where further action or support is required. UNDP is supporting the implementation of a Local and Urban Governance Dashboard in four countries in Asia-Pacific which can layer and analyse different data sets (for instance public expenditure data with multi-dimensional poverty data) to help local governments to identify major gaps in the implementation of policy. UCLG has also developed toolbox and training modules to support the monitoring process of SDGs localisation. 70 i. Other Lessons from the CEE Assessment The implementation of the CEE assessment in 28 countries in the Asia-Pacific region has generated several lessons. The following are reflections on the lessons gained from the approach to the assessment, and some gaps and areas for review and improvements, if repeated in the future. i. Lessons were learned during data collection and analysis. The assumption that central government laws and regulations result in stronger enabling environments than laws developed at a decentralised level, i.e. state level, does not necessarily hold true. In Australia, local government is not enshrined in the national constitution but in state constitutions. Australian local government is more highly decentralised in terms of functions and responsibilities, that counties where local government is enshrined in the constitution. Local governments in Japan and New Zealand can be considered as some of the most progressive, innovative, efficient and effective in the region. The importance of strong local government law and enabling mechanism is crucial, regardless of whether it is enshrined at national or state level. Overall, federal systems of government tend to result in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "63e364d7-3cd7-4538-9421-cbd87922675e": {"__data__": {"id_": "63e364d7-3cd7-4538-9421-cbd87922675e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/city-enabling-environment-rating", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "City Enabling Environment Rating", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/city-enabling-environment-rating", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6d06461521c3a23b172aec8446d1d943e907cc718d0efc3857c02071ac2363d3"}}, "hash": "6d06461521c3a23b172aec8446d1d943e907cc718d0efc3857c02071ac2363d3", "text": "stronger legislative frameworks for local governments, than those with more centralist forms of government. ii. There is need to revise the set of 11 indicators to ensure they are better aligned with SDG indicators, if the focus is to help countries and cities to understand their gaps and limitations in achieving the SDGs. Additional criteria should be added related to legal framework which would have provided a more extensive monitoring of the enabling environments for cities in the region. iii. It is important not to consider the scoring generated through the CEE assessment as a base index. There is such variation in local government legal and administrative arrangements that comparisons are challenging. The importance of linking enabling environment indicators to the SDGs is important, as these indicators are commonly agreed as the means of measuring sustainable development outcomes. iv. Furthermore, the scores assigned to each criterion by local government associations or individual experts should be compared with other indices that measure similar aspects. This would help to identify areas where significant discrepancies may exist and suggest area that could warrant further research. v. The assessment of Women\u2019s Participation in Local Governance, proved extremely difficult to assess with significant variations between countries. Women\u2019s representation in national parliaments are rising, but in local government, rates have remained stable or falling in all but a few countries. The reasons for this are not easily explained, and further research is necessary. It is crucial that the level of women\u2019s representation in local government improve, as woman views and inputs in policy and law which shape local enabling environments must be supported, along with marginalised groups and communities. vi. Though trade and investment aspects were not looked at through this assessment, there is also need for governments to recognise that the basis for trade and investment in the region is no longer between nations, but between cities. Trade agreements provide the basis for developing broader national economies, but the enabling environments supporting the economies of cities need to align more closely with national economic policy. It is the obstacles in the enabling environments of cities that are adding substantially to the transaction costs of trade and investment flows between cities. This is an area of exploration that will form a focus of an upcoming UCLG GOLD (Global Report on Local Democracy and Decentralisation) V report. vii. Finally, there is a need for further investigation into legislative frameworks of enabling environments that are creating impediments to value-adding systems and transaction costs of cities. This is an area that has not been studied extensively at a regional level, and is worthy of investigation as part of a UCLG ASPAC research and development activity. Way Forward of CEE rating This report on city enabling environment rating has provided a tool to measure country performance based on 11 CEE criteria. It has identified key areas for reform in each country from the scoring against the criteria. The result of the rating may be used in advocacy for strengthened cities and local authorities in the Asia and Pacific region. Furthermore, a regional alliance may be formed for periodic assessment by measuring, every two years, the progress of each country in improving their legal instruments of enabling environment for cities and local authorities.

With this growth, the urban population is estimated at approximately 8.3 to 10.1 million or about 22-25 per cent of the country\u2019s population. They are mostly concentrated in five city regions, ie. Kabul and Herat, Kandahar, Mazar-e-Sharif and Jalalabad. The country has a two-tier structure administration\u2015 central administration (capital, ministries) and local offices (provinces-districts). The Afghanistan Constitution provides for elected mayors. In practice, however, all mayors and governors are appointed by the Independent Directorate of Local Governance (IDLG) and the independent civil service reform commission, under direct supervision of the Administrative Affairs office of the President. Local level decisions on city development, planning and strategies are taken at the national level and implemented by the line ministry directorates at the provincial and district levels.1 Institutional capacity does not exist at the local level to determine tax rates or rates for municipal levies. Municipalities are responsible only for the collection of city level taxes; decision-making on tax rates is carried out by the central government. Municipalities are not legally permitted to obtain loans or enter into financial markets. Government taxes are defined by the Ministry of Finance 1 GoIRA. (2004). Afghanistan Constitution. Accessed at www.afghanembassy.com.pl/ afg/images/pliki/TheConstitution.pdf and collected through their provincial offices (Article 42 of the Constitution). However, there are exemptions for IDLG and Kabul Municipality which have proposed regulations to define the tax base, and it is approved by the Cabinet. Chapter 8, Articles 136 \u2013 141 of the Afghanistan Constitution defines the structure of local governments and their key roles as spheres of governance. The detailed responsibilities of local government are defined in relevant laws. Although appointed by central government, provincial and district administrations are responsible for management of the administration of local government. Provincial councils are elected, and function to monitor the performance of provincial administrations. As indicated above, at the municipality level there is an inconsistency between regulation and implementation. According to Article 141 of the Constitution, mayors and municipal council members should be elected. However, in practice, they are appointed by central government. Key legislation related to urban local governments are as follows: \u2022 Municipal Law: Based on Article 141 of the Constitution and the New Draft Municipal Law 2014 which is still being discussed in Cabinet, the law aims at improving urban governance and will regulate the work of all municipalities in Afghanistan, including the Kabul Municipality. \u2022 Civil Service Law: Also known as the Independent Administrative Reform and Civil Service Commission (IARCSC)\u2019s Law, aimed at establishing a sound system of public administration through implementing reforms, defines the duties of the civil service including the management, regulation and delivery A number of legislative provisions conflict with the Constitution or some provisions in the Constitution are not implemented. Local assemblies are elected, but executive bodies are appointed. Resources are not transferred, or are transferred erratically and irregularly. Local governments have some latitude to determine rates for existing taxes, but the central government is responsible for setting the tax base for existing taxes, creating new taxes, and accessing loans and financial markets. There is a national framework of reference defining the qualifications and responsibilities of local government staff, or a national strategy for training and promoting human resources in local governments; so far, this concerns only a few local governments. The Constitution makes explicit mention of local governments, but their responsibilities are defined by legislation. Rules and legal provisions on transparency in the running of local governments requiring regular, independent audits be conducted within specified timeframes exist but are not systematically followed. There is no national legislation on citizen participation, but there are locally organised spaces for dialogue and consultation. There is legislation on measuring local government performance, but performance is assessed by the authority responsible for supervising local governments. National reflection on urbanisation is underway, but an urban strategy has not yet been defined. Country\u2019s international commitments for environmental protection and promotion exist but does not recognise the importance of urban areas and positive role of LGUs in implementation.

It was settled by the British in 1788. The Commonwealth of Australia was proclaimed in 1901, bringing together six independent British colonies to form one country. It is a parliamentary democracy with Queen Elizabeth II of Australia as head of state, represented in Australia by the Governor-General.

Some Commonwealth government departments, however, do have strong connections (direct or indirect) to the local government such as the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of the Environment and Energy and the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistic (ABS), Local Government Areas (LGAs) are an ABS approximation of officially gazetted LGAs as defined by each State and Territory Local Government Department. The boundaries produced for LGAs are constructed from allocations of whole Mesh Blocks (MBs). The ABS reviews LGAs on an annual basis with changes implemented by inclusion or exclusion of whole MBs. As indicated, legislation on the establishment and role of local governments is provided for in State/Territory Constitutions. Each State/Territory has its own legislation that governs the activities and roles of local government, i.e. the Local Government Act 1999 in South Australia, the Local Government Act 1989 in Victoria, the Local Government Act 1993 in New South Wales, the Local Government Act 1995 in Western Australia, the Local Government Act 2009 in Queensland, the Local Government Act 1993 in Tasmania, and the Local Government Act 2016 in the Northern Territory. Specific function is provided to the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) which has responsibility both for the functions and services of a State government and a local government. Given the numerous State legislations, there are significant differences in the responsibilities of local governments in every State/Territory, as well as in the systems for overseeing them, including the services they deliver. In general, Australian local governments\u2019 responsibilities include environmental work, engineering, building inspection, licensing, certification and enforcement, administration services, planning and development approvals. In environmental protection, local government undertakes a broad suite of actions in response to requests or expectations of Commonwealth or State government law or regulation as well as local need. The broader authority of education, public housing, and policing lies with the States/Territories and Commonwealth.3 3 www.alga.asn.au Enabling Environment Rating for Cities and Local Authorities: 32 44 AUSTRALIA All responsibilities and powers are clearly defined in accordance with the Constitution, and the relevant statutory laws and regulations are in place. Local assemblies and executive bodies are elected throughout the country. The transfer of resources to local governments and their distribution among local governments are clear and predictable, with utilisation determined at the national level (conditional transfers). Local governments have some latitude to determine existing tax base and rates, but the central government is responsible for setting new taxes and accessing loans and financial markets. There is no national framework of reference defining the qualifications and responsibilities of local government staff and no national strategy for training and promoting human resources in local governments. The Constitution is neutral on the question of local governments. Rules and legal provisions on transparency in the running of local governments requiring regular, independent audits be conducted within specified timeframes exist and are applied. There is no national legislation on citizen participation, but there are locally organised spaces for dialogue and consultation. There is legislation on measuring local government performance, and performance is assessed by independent bodies. National reflection on urbanisation is underway, but an urban strategy has not yet been defined. Country\u2019s international commitments for environmental protection and promotion recognises the importance of urban areas and positive role of LGUs in implementation. Enabling Environment for Cities and Local Government in Asia Pacific 77 Despite the absence of formal recognition of local government in the Australian Constitution, the Commonwealth government recognises the need to improve the capacity of local governments. The Commonwealth Local Government Financial Assistance Act 1995, also called FAGs, provides financial assistance to local governments for ensuring better services delivery and performance at the local level. The FAGs are made up of a general-purpose grant and a grant to be directed towards local road infrastructure. Typically, the grants are increased year to year based on a formula that takes inflation and population growth into account. However, due to High Court decisions that show the Commonwealth has limited ability to provide direct payments to local Councils virtually all payments from the Commonwealth are channelled through State/ Territory government bodies and departments, including State Treasuries. On the other hand, local taxes are the primary revenue source for local governments in urban/ suburban areas. The only taxation revenue for local government is property rates, which are primarily based on the overall land values across an LGA.

Local governments in Australia generally are limited in their ability to set and collect taxes. However, in some States including Brisbane in Queensland; local governments, i.e. Brisbane City Council is permitted to raise funds through loans and various charges, and to invest in money markets as a way of increasing returns on capital. Seen as organs of the States and Territories, re- organisation of local governments are usually triggered by State/Territory governments. The capacity building of official local government staff is also a responsibility of the States/Territories not the Commonwealth. Instead, each State/ Territory determines the governing body for local governments. The terminology of the head of local governments also vary, but all are elected. All citizens over the age of 18 years are required to vote in Commonwealth, State/Territory and local government elections. Mayors and Councillors in local governments employ a Chief Executive Officers (CEO) on a contracted basis; the CEO is responsible for employing the local authority\u2019s staff. The requirements placed upon local government in relation to urban planning strategies are outlined in each State/Territory\u2019s local government legislation. Commonly, Councils will develop a set of overlapping plans that extend over different time frames. There is usually an annual plan that supports a three-year plan, with the plan being informed by a larger strategic five or ten-year plan. Furthermore, local government undertakes a broad range of consultation within its community. Women\u2019s participation in local governance In 1902, Australia was the first country in the world to give women both the right to vote in federal elections and the right to be elected to parliament on a national basis. However, Indigenous women were not permitted to vote until 1967. New Zealand granted all women the right to vote in 1893. South Australia was the first State to give women who were British subjects the right to vote. No special provision for women is mentioned in the Australian or State Constitutions, but other laws provide for gender equity and discrimination. Local government contains the highest level of active participation by women, exceeding both Commonwealth and State governments. There is strong advocacy for more women in Australian parliaments. Unfortunately, the number of women in Australian parliaments has fallen froorm a high point of 30.8 per cent in 2009, the proportion of women in Australian parliaments declined to 29 per cent in 2013.

The head of state is the President, who is indirectly elected by the members of the parliament for a maximum of two five-year terms. The 300 -members of parliament are directly elected by universal adult suffrage, and 50 seats are reserved for women. These are allocated from party lists in proportion to the seats won by each party. The President appoints the leader of the majority party as Prime Minister and head of government.

In some cases, municipalities must seek approval from the Ministry prior to proceeding with such investments, this can hinder and discourage them from accessing loans and financial markets.5 Citizen participation has been deemed mandatory in every tier of government in Bangladesh. Accordingly, some local governments have created a platform for dialogue and consultation with the community. However, the platform has not been optimised, as a result there are limitations in accommodating citizens\u2019 petitions, citizen- led referendums, and participatory budgeting processes. In addition, LGUs are often reluctant to handle social accountability mechanisms of public opinion which are normally obtained from the satisfaction surveys.

Twelve per cent of the population lives in poverty (2012), and life expectancy is 67 years. The urban population is comprised of 196,111 people, or almost 31 per cent of the populace. The country made a major transition from absolute monarchy to Constitutional Monarchy in 2008. The Constitution was also launched in 2008 and the country\u2019s first elections held. Bhutan has 3 tiers of government which are country/ national government, central-states/provinces/ regional government, and local government. The acts of local government enacted in 2007 were the Local Government Act and the Thromde Act. Additionally, there are also acts relevant to local governments which are Dzongkhag Yargay Tshogdu Chathrim in 2002 and Gewog Yargay Tshogchung Chathrim in 2002. According to the law, local governments are available in each of the twenty Dzongkhags and comprise of Dzongkhag Tshogdu, Gewog Tshogde, and Thromde Tshogde.6 6 The Constitutions of the Kingdom of Bhutan The Mayor is the head of local government; it is an elected position with a tenure of five years. The Council members are also directly elected by the people of Bhutan. The Deputy Mayor is elected by Council members. Bhutan\u2019s first local government elections were held in 2011, two years after adopting the Constitution. Specific election regulation committees are established to regulate the election procedures. According to the Constitution, elected local governments have the power to facilitate the direct participation of the people in the development and management of their own social, economic and environmental well-being. Furthermore, local governments are also entitled to receive adequate financial resources from central government in the form of annual grants, and are allocated a proportion of national revenue to ensure self- reliant and self-sustaining units of local self- government. They may prepare budget proposals to be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for central government funding assistance.

Assessments are done on a regular basis by independent financial and organisational audits according to a specific schedule and timeframe. In the environmental sector, Bhutan has set an ambitious target to reforest the Himalayan kingdom\u2019s forests in response to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. As shared by the Lyonpo Yeshey Dorji, Minister for Agriculture and Forests during the COP 21 in Paris, Bhutan has committed to be carbon neutral and preserve 60 per cent of the country under forest cover. Almost three quarters of Bhutan is covered by forests, and the country has pledged to increase this. The country also has created codes and standards for urban development at the city level to ensure ecological protection.

It covers an area of 181,035 km2, and is bordered by Thailand to the northwest, Laos to the northeast, Vietnam to the east, and the Gulf of Thailand to the southwest. Comprised of 26 municipalities, the population in Cambodia is approximately 15.76 (million) with 27 per cent residing in urban areas. The population growth rate is 1.7 per cent and rate of urbanisation is 4.6 per cent per year.8 Cambodia is a Constitutional Monarchy, whereby the Prime Minister is the head of government and a monarch is head of State. The Kingdom functions according to the nation\u2019s Constitution in a framework of a parliamentary representative democracy. Executive power is exercised by the Prime Minister. Legislative power is vested in the bicameral parliament, the National Assembly and Senate. The national assembly (Radhsaphea) has 124 members, elected for a five-year term by proportional representation. The senate (Protsaphea) has 61 members, elected for a six-year term.

The constitution of the Kingdom of Cambodia The provincial government comprises of 25 provincial and capital administrations. Furthermore, since 2002, commune- level governments (Commune Councils) were defined as local governments and are composed of members directly elected by commune residents every five years. There is also a Sangkat (sub- division) at the local level. The difference between a commune and Sangkat is defined at organic law. The laws on administrative management of the capital, provinces, municipalities, districts and Khans, and the laws on administrative management of the Sangkat and Commune, include local government and urban development, as well as administration reform (MOI, 2009; MOI, 2002). The Royal Government of Cambodia adopts organic laws and other legal instruments to implement the Constitution. Overall, taxes are managed by the central government. However, some municipalities levy local taxes such as parking fees, which are allocated to funding local basic services including waste management. Local authorities are also eligible to receive an annual budget allocation from the central government. The government established a sub-national investment fund (SNIF) which provides grant funding to communes/sangkat and district/ municipal councils. It is an extra fund for local development to be used with the formula of 2/3rds for development activities and 1/3rd for operational costs. This budget accounts for less than 5 per cent of the national budget, in particular for those administered by the Ministry of Interior (ie. the commune/sangkat fund), and meets only a small part of financial needs of municipalities, districts and communes.

A clear national urban strategy exists, but the financial and technical arrangements and capacities necessary to implement it are lacking. Country\u2019s international commitments for environmental protection and promotion recognises the importance of urban areas and positive role of LGUs in implementation. Enabling Environment for Cities and Local Government in Asia Pacific 83 Distribution of these grant funds to communes/ Sangkat and municipal/districts is based on three criteria: (i) equalisation; (ii) population; and (iii) the poverty index. Due to the limitations of this grant fund, the majority of infrastructure is still financed through national ministries (Ministry of Public Works and Transport, Ministry of Rural Development, Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology, etc). However, some national ministries are working to decentralise their budgets to the sub-national level. The Ministry of Environment, for example, has established a waste management fund which municipalities can access. However, specific guidelines/formula under which communes/districts can access these funds are less clear than the schemes under the Ministry of Interior. The city government is formed by central government based on the law (Decree or sub- decree) and depends on levels of urbanisation. District and municipal governments are responsible for preparing 5-year Municipal Development Plans and a three-year rolling plan of Municipal Investment Programs. Local councils are authorised to make decisions for city development, planning and strategies, annual budgeting and other legislation. They are elected through direct and indirect elections. Meanwhile, the executive bodies (Board of Governors) at provincial and district/municipal levels are appointed by the central government. The Ministry of Interior is responsible for monitoring local government performance, and it monitors local government more frequently than every five years.

Further strategies are needed to develop clearer national urban development strategies and local detailed spatial plans as well as to improve the capacity for implementing the plans. In Cambodia, citizen participation in urban areas is held in participatory forums organised during the budgeting and planning process. A participatory public forum is also available to accommodate community involvement as mandated by the organic law. According to the law, Cambodia has committed to environmental protection and climate change governance through the UN SDGs, NDC, National Green Growth Policy, National Green Growth Strategic Plan and National Climate Change Strategic Plan. The country is establishing its technical working group on sustainable cities, under the National Council for Sustainable Development (NCSD) as an inter-ministerial platform to support local government units to integrate environmental considerations into sub-national planning and financing. The Ministry of Interior and the NCSD are partnering with the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) to support secondary cities on green city development planning and investment prioritisation. The Ministry of Interior\u2019s National Committee for Sub-National Democratic Development (NCDD) is applying for accreditation with the Green Climate Fund (GCF), to enable priority green city development projects to access international financial support from the GCF. However, it should be noted that there are gaps in the financial resources and capacity to implement all policies.

Covering a land area of 9,562.9 km2 (thousands), China boasts over 18,000 km of continental coastline in the east and west, and possesses over 4,700,000 km2 of inland sea and marginal sea. Urban population growth was small and stagnant in the 1950-1970s as China\u2019s economic base was relatively weak. That rate of growth has been increasing since the 1990s due to the establishment of new policies from the government of China to reduce barriers for rural dwellers entering cities. As the result of this new policy, the urbanisation rate reached 30.5 per cent in 1996 and 57.35 per cent in 2016.10 The overall governance structure in China can be summarised as follows: \u2022 Under direct administration of the central government; there are provinces, autonomous regions and some municipalities. \u2022 Each province or autonomous region has autonomous prefectures, counties, autonomous counties, and cities under its direct administration. \u2022 A county or an autonomous county has towns or nationality towns under its direct administration. 10 rating for citizen participation does not cover the substantial public participation China New Type Urbanisation Development Report 2015. \u2022 A municipality under direct administration of the central government, or a relatively large city, has districts and counties under its direct administration. \u2022 An autonomous prefecture has counties, autonomous counties or cities under its direct administration. \u2022 Autonomous regions, autonomous prefectures and autonomous counties are all national autonomous areas.11 According Chinese law, local leaders are appointed.

Enabling Environment for Cities and Local Government in Asia Pacific 85 There are three key tax areas: central taxes, local taxes and joint taxes. Central tax is the financial revenue source for the central government; it is managed and administered by the national administration of taxation. Local taxes provide financial revenue for local governments at different levels. Local taxes are managed and administered by local administrations, and include the following taxes: Sales (excluding the sales taxes that railway departments, the headquarters of all banks and head offices of all insurance companies pay collectively), land value increment, stamp duty, city building and maintenance, urban land use, property, urban real estate, vehicle and vessel, deed and land occupation. Joint taxes provide joint revenue, shared by central and relevant local governments. Joint tax is administered by the National Administration of Taxation and includes value added taxes, business income taxes, personal income taxes, resource taxes and sales taxes. Central government provides financial assistance for local government in several forms, including financial transfer payments, special transfer payments, tax returns and subsidies. This financial support includes: general transfer payments, transfer payments to areas where minorities reside, reward and subsidy funds for county and town level departments, salary adjustment transfer payments, transfer payments for rural tax and fee reform, and financial resource targeted subsidies on year-end settlement. Mechanism for this financial transfer is issued by the State Council on regulation of Guo Fa No.71 Year 2014 and is managed by the Administration Regulations on Special Transfer Payment from the central government to local governments. Urban and rural planning in China includes town system planning, city planning, town planning and village planning. The development of plans should follow the specific Law of Urban and Rural Planning which frames the overall notion of planning, including building in urban and rural areas. China is also actively seeking to implement the new strategy for urbanisation as addressed in the National Urbanisation Plan (2014-2020).12 The strategy focuses on human oriented urbanisation emphasising efforts to facilitate urban dwellers to obtain better public services, and initiatives to enable migrants to be well integrated in cities as well as to enable current dwellers to enjoy better urban living. Some pilot programs under this new urbanisation strategy were organised in 2015 by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), and include 62 cities or towns as national new-type urbanisation pilot areas.13 In the environmental sector, China has ratified its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) and the Paris Agreement.

The government has established environmental policies and regulations for cities, including city level Emission Trading Schemes (ETS) to encourage cities to implement low carbon development. The country also runs a low-carbon cities pilot program under the NDRC to provide funding, and plans to deal with specific environmental issues such as the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Air Pollution Plan.

The latest census, undertaken in 2007, shows a population of 837,217 with an annual growth of 0.8 per cent.14 Fiji has two tiers of government\u2014central and local government. Central government is based in the capital Suva, the Parliament of which has 50 elected members and is responsible for developing and implementing legislation. Local government, which is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution as an autonomous level of public governance, has a unique structure, with four distinct systems including: (i) Government administration; (ii) The iTaukei Affairs Board; (iii) Municipal administration; and (iv) Rural local authorities.15 Although Fiji\u2019s Constitution is neutral on local government, it provides for the rights of individuals through the Bill of Rights.

Administratively, all by-laws made by a municipality under the provisions of the Local Government Act, or under the provisions of any other law by virtue of which the municipality is authorised to act, must be approved by the Minister. Under the Town Planning Act, the Minister approves all development during the interim period prior to final approval of a planning scheme, approval of provisional schemes, consideration of objections to provisional schemes and approval of final planning. Local governments raise revenue through user fees (rates, market fees, business licenses and parking meters) and property taxes. All other taxes are the responsibility of the Fiji Revenue and Customs Authority. The central government provides capital projects funding to all 13 councils and these are reflected in the Ministry of Local Government, Housing and Environment (MLGHE)\u2019s annual budget allocations.

Budgets provided by government to municipalities are specifically for capital projects aligned to national programs; these projects are monitored by government to ensure utilisation within budget, timeliness, quality assurance and good governance. The predictability of the process is based not on a formula but on a transparent process where local governments make submissions to central government through the MLGHE and consultations occur before budgetary allocations are confirmed. Local governments are given the autonomy to utilise the resources, but are monitored by the MLGHE. The \u2018Councils of Municipalities\u2019 are urban local bodies constituted under \u2018Section 8-Councils of Municipalities\u2019 of Local Government Act. Under Part II Councils: Sections 8-Councils of Municipalities and Section 9-Composition of Councils of the Local Government Act Cap 125, municipal councils are established through an election process.18 The MLGHE endorses the names of council members following a free and fair election. As a temporary measure, government has substituted special administrators (under section 9A of the Local Government Act Cap 125) for the duly constituted councils of municipalities and they are appointed by the Minister for Local Government, Housing and Environment. This is in place until the current Act is reviewed by the Local Government Advisory Committee. The council constituted under Part II of the Local Government Act has been absent since the appointment of the cities and towns Special Administrators. The Special Administrator provides key leadership in a municipality. For smaller municipalities the leadership is provided by the Chief Executive Officer who is appointed under the normal competitive recruitment process. The responsibilities and powers defined in the Fiji Local Government Act Cap 25 are in accordance with the Constitution, particularly the Bill of Rights. Through the MLGHE, municipalities are responsible for administration of the Act. The power of municipalities in Fiji falls between virtual autonomy to complete subordination to the State. Municipalities do not have the right to levy individuals and corporations with income tax, property tax, or corporate income tax; they receive substantial funding from the State. Government realises the importance of controlling the impact of environmental issues and has established key domestic policies of Fiji\u2019s Green Growth Framework 2014. The Framework is divided into 10 thematic areas, one of which requires city/town and district level action on waste management. To contribute to the realisation of the Framework, national government works to boost the capacity of municipal and rural local authorities to manage urban waste through targeted incentives. Local governments have been able to secure funding for environmental protection and promotion, including climate change and disaster risk reduction given the high commitment of the Fiji government environmental protection.

Local governments have some latitude to determine existing tax base and rates, but the central government is responsible for setting new taxes and accessing loans and financial markets. The Constitution makes explicit mention of local governments, but their responsibilities are defined by legislation. Only partial rules and legal provisions on transparency in the running of local governments exist and they are not systematically followed. There is a national framework of reference defining the qualifications and responsibilities of local government staff, or a national strategy for training and promoting human resources in local governments; but they concern only a few local governments. National legislation on citizen participation exists but is not applied. There is legislation on measuring local government performance, and performance is assessed by independent bodies. National reflection on urbanisation is underway, but an urban strategy has not yet been defined. Country\u2019s international commitments for environmental protection and promotion recognises the importance of urban areas and positive role of LGUs in implementation.

India has a federal structure, and local bodies, both rural and urban, are recognised as the third tier of government.19 The national and provincial governments have the executive, legislature and the judiciary for local government, with some overlapping areas of responsibility. The hierarchy of urban local bodies is as follows: 1. Municipal Corporation (Mahanagar Nigam) in metropolitan cities with populations of more than 1 million.

Under amended Article 280 of the Constitution, it is mandatory on the part of the Central Finance Commission, constituted by the National Government, to recommend devolution of resources to supplement State Consolidated Funds with a view to implementing the recommendations of the State Finance Commissions. The Constitution, even after the 74th Amendment Act, does not provide for an autonomous domain of tax or revenue raising powers to municipalities. These continue to be determined and regulated by the State Governments which specify the taxes that municipalities can levy, as a result the control of State Governments in determining the tax base and tax rates is quite significant.

There are significant variations between the states. However, the stipulation for mandatory State Finance Commissions (SFCs) under article 243Y to review the financial position of the Municipalities and make recommendations regarding distribution between the States and the Municipalities of the proceeds of the taxes, criteria for grants-in-aid, measures needed to improve the financial position of the Municipalities, etc. may be regarded as an innovative and significant feature of the Amendment. Articles 268 to 275 of the Constitution contain various provisions about the distribution of revenues between the Union and the States. Distinct categories such as duties levied by the Union (central government i.e., Government of India) but collected and appropriated by the State (Article 268), taxes levied and collected by the Union but assigned to the States (Article 269), taxes levied and collected by the Union and distributed between the Union and the States (Article 270), grants-in- aid in lieu of export duty (Article 273), etc. provide a comprehensive framework. No similar attempt was made to devise such an arrangement so far as the states and the municipalities are concerned. It was left to the State Finance Commissions to suggest such a divisible pool if the SFC was so inclined and if its terms of reference given by the State government allowed it. The Legislature of a State may, by law: (a) Authorise a Municipality to levy, collect and appropriate such taxes, duties, tolls and fees in accordance with such procedure and subject to such limits; (b) Assign to a Municipality such taxes, duties, tolls and fees levied and collected by the State Government for such purposes and subject to such conditions and limits; (c) Provide for making such grants-in-aid to the municipalities from the Consolidated Fund of the State; and (d) Provide for constitution of such Funds for crediting all moneys received, respectively, by or on behalf of the municipalities and also for the withdrawal of such moneys therefrom, as may be specified in the law. Tax proposals can be presented by a public representative, a committee formed for taxation, or civic body officials. Such proposals go through the approval process within the civic body and then the Standing Committee, and is presented as a resolution in the municipal council which votes on the said resolution. If passed it becomes a statutory document ready for implementation which is then notified through the official Gazette. India ratified the Paris Agreement on climate change on 2nd October 2016. One of the fundamental standpoints of India at the Paris climate talks was the principle of Common But Differentiated Responsibility (CBDR) that stresses the need for equity and fairness (as highlighted by the developing countries). The Government of India, in recent times, has launched a number of urban flagship missions for transformation and rejuvenation of urban areas including the Smart Cities Mission, the Swachh Bharat Mission (Clean India Mission), the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), and the National Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana (HRIDAY) with a commitment to develop sustainable and climate resilient urban centres.

The total area of Indonesia is 1,913,578.68 km2; the population in 2016 was 261.12 (million)., In 2015, Indonesia was 54 per cent urbanised while the urbanisation rate was at 3.4 per cent during the period 2000-2010. The political system in Indonesia comprises executive, legislative and judicial, as prescribed in the Constitution 1945.

Each province has a governor who serves as the central government\u2019s representative and a representative parliament; districts/regencies and cities have regents, mayors and cities have mayors. The provinces, districts/regencies and cities are sub-national governments and mayors, regent mayors, governors are directly elected.20 The decentralisation law was updated in 2014 (Law No. 23 Year 2014); it addresses the division of authority and role between central, provincial, regency and city governments.

A more technical regulation about division of authority is currently being discussed to replace Government Regulation No.38 of 2007 on autonomy division. Decentralisation in Indonesia gives autonomy to local government to determine only the size and structure of their budget expenditure. Taxing power remains with the central government, while local governments are given the right only to collect minor taxes such as taxes on land and building, motor vehicles, hotels, restaurants, entertainment, base metal and mineral extraction, and water. Local governments do not have the power to impose and collect customs and excise, corporate tax, personal income tax, and sales tax. Tax assessment and tax rates are uniform for the whole country, and local governments do not have control over the rate structure for their major sources of revenue. Specific regulations on taxes are prescribed in Law No. 23 of 2014, Law no 28 of 2009 and Law No. 16 of 2009. Grants from central to local governments have two components. The first is a minimum allocation known as the General Allocation Fund (Dana Alokasi Umum [DAU]). The DAU is a lump sum given to all local governments regardless of their fiscal gap and is intended primarily to cover the salaries of civil servants. The Equalisation Grant (Dana Bagi Hasil [DBH]) is the second transfer from central to subnational governments. The DBH is a revenue sharing or tax sharing from the general tax revenue and revenue from the exploitation of natural resources, including mining, oil, and gas. A third transfer is the Special Allocation Funds (Dana Alokasi Khusus [DAK]) which is provided to finance central government initiatives Rules and legal provisions on transparency in the running of local governments requiring regular, independent audits be conducted within specified timeframes exist and are applied. National reflection on urbanisation is underway, but an urban strategy has not yet been defined. National legislation on citizen participation exists and is applied. Country\u2019s international commitments for environmental protection and promotion exist but do not recognise the importance of urban areas and positive role of LGUs in implementation. There is legislation on measuring local government performance, and performance is assessed by independent bodies. The Constitution makes explicit mention of local governments, but their responsibilities are defined by legislation. The transfer of resources to local governments and their distribution among local governments are clear and predictable, with utilisation determined at the national level (conditional transfers). All responsibilities and powers are clearly defined in accordance with the Constitution, and the relevant statutory laws and regulations are in place.

This is a special purpose grant, similar to a capital-financing program. As it is given to all local governments, there is competition between the recipients for effective implementation of the programs.21 The resources mobilised from the central government are predictable and reliable. The financial transfer practice is uniform and predictable as stipulated in the Law No. 33 of 2004. The highest body responsible for auditing local government finances in Indonesia is the Supreme Audit Board of Indonesia (BPK), which has authority to examine the management and responsibility of state finances. According to the Constitution, BPK is a free and independent institution. Members of BPK are elected by the People\u2019s Legislative Assembly with due regard to the consideration of the Regional Representative Council, and inaugurated by the President. In addition, there are two other systems to measure local government performance. The first is an internal audit mechanism to measure financial development performance conducted by BPKP (Development and Financial Oversight Agency). This BPKP is a government agency which reports directly to the President and is not created by local governments. The second is an audit mechanism on the performance of local governments, conducted by the Ministry of Apparatus and Bureaucracy Reform. An annual independent audit is conducted by BPK (Financial Audit Body) with a regular timetable. The result of the audit is available to the public after it has been submitted to the House of Representative and is disclosed on the website of the Financial Audit Body and national newspaper. The audit outcome will be disclosed also on local government websites. BPK/Financial Audit Body is an independent audit agency belonging to the central government. A National Urban Development Policy and Strategic Document 2045 has been established by National Development Planning Agency, but the document has yet to gain the legal standing it requires to ensure implementation. Therefore, it does not yet have specific rules and regulations to be enforced. The Indonesian long-term development plan (2005-2025) also highlights the national vision for urban development until 2025. Indonesia has a National Action Plan on Climate Change Adaptation which specifically regulates climate change adaptation. These documents have mentioned the role of local government in climate change adaptation. However, the 21 http://bpbd.sulutprov.go.id/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/UU- No-23-Th-2014-Pemerintahan-Daerah.pdf LLaw No.23/2014 on Local Governance document is not legally binding and therefore it is not mandatory for local government to implement. Local governments do not recognise climate change mitigation action as they remain heavily dependent on sectoral ministries and provincial levels. Women\u2019s participation in local governance There is no rotation system applied once women have been elected in the legislative and/or executive bodies. Law No. 8 of 2015 on Governor, Regent, and Mayor elections regulates the quota of women candidate at the local level at 30 per cent. Nevertheless, for government officials, the rotation system is applied based on a merit system and, in general, the rotation system is available for women officials. Law No. 2 of 2011 on Political Party also regulates the quota of female candidates at the parliamentary seats at 30 per cent. However, these laws do not ensure the quota of 30 per cent is achieved for elected women. Currently, women\u2019s participation rate in the local legislative body remains at 14 per cent, while at the national level it is 17 per cent. At executive level, however, Indonesia does not have a 30 per cent quota for women; it uses a merit system for placement. Given this, Indonesia has been rated for 2 since national provisions on temporary special measures for women/\u2019quota system\u2019 at local level meet at least 1 of the following: \u2022 No rotation system is applied \u2022 Minimum per centage of women is above 30 per cent \u2022 Quota consists of reserved seats or placement mandates and quotas are enforced by law Proposed Reforms With the score of 37 out of 44, Indonesia is making good progress towards an adapted enabling environment for cities and local governments.

Explanation of the Rating Iran, officially the Islamic Republic of Iran, is bordered to the north by Armenia, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan, to the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan, to the south by the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea, to the west by Iraq and Turkey. The Constitution stipulates the form of Iran\u2019s government as an Islamic Republic. The Supreme Leader, Guardian Jurist, is the highest ranking political and religious authority in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The powers are vested in the legislature, judiciary, and executive, which are independent of each other. The functions of the legislature are exercised through the Islamic Consultative Assembly, consisting of 290 elected representatives. The term of membership in the Assembly is four years. The executive powers are exercised by the President and the ministers. After the Supreme Leader, the President is the highest official in the country, acting as the head of the executive, except in matters directly concerned with the Supreme Leader. The President is elected for a four-year term. The judiciary is an independent power, whose functions are performed by courts of justice, which are established in accordance with the criteria of Shia Islam.22 The Head of the Judiciary is appointed by (criteria 4): Financial transfer from central government to local government is difference across cities depending on their size. For example, big cities do not receive any financial support from the central government and they are responsible for their earning their revenue (criteria 5): Local government revenue is difference across cities depending on their size. For example, big cities do not receive any financial support from the central government and they are responsible for their earning their revenue. Local governments\u2019 revenue is not defined by central government and they have diverse sources of revenue. Assessment and allocation of tax is completely related to government and the local governments do not play any role. the Supreme Leader. The constitutional basis of the local councils is laid down in Chapter 7 (Articles 100-106) of the Constitution. The formation of councils and the election of mayors have been extensively stipulated by Law on Local Councils enacted in 1997-8, which outlines the decentralisation policy in Iran. City Councils in Iran are the Local Councils (in rural areas, it is called Dehyari) whose members are elected. Municipalities are executive bodies in cities. Mayors are selected by city council members and appointed by the Minister of Interior. According to the new urban management bill, which has not yet been endorsed by the Parliament, selection of mayors of cities with more than 200,000 people would be done by people. Municipalities may receive government assistance, but their revenues depend mostly on local taxes and fees. Yet, the Interior Ministry has the final say on municipal budgets.23 Financial transfers from central government to local government is different across cities depending upon their size. For example, big cities do not receive any financial support from the central government and they are responsible for earning their own revenue. Municipalities, in theory, have dozens of different tax- income sources yet, in practice, most of them yield no revenue. Before the Iran-Iraq war, the State provided 70 per cent of municipal budgets.

According to the Iran Country Report, Iran has improved technical capacity for urban planning and management through following measures: \u2022 Including urban planning and management in the related academic curricula. \u2022 Organising regular on-the-job training courses for municipal managers and staff. \u2022 Recruiting specialised staff for small cities. According to the law, all council meetings are public and become official when two-thirds of the main members are present. The Transparency and Freedom of Information Act requires councils to publish all information regarding legislation, budget allocation, projects, taxes and fees to the public. Councils are required to ensure the presence of media in all public meetings. Printed council publications are made available to the general public, with detailed information on council legislation, elections, and responsibilities, as well events and other topics.24 In accordance with the 7th Principle of Iran\u2019s Constitution, councils are the main decision- makers.25 These councils include local councils, business councils and high councils of provinces. Local councils are defined at various levels like villages, districts, cities and provinces. Decisions made at the councils within the framework of their jurisdiction are deemed mandatory for the local authorities. High councils of provinces consist of representatives of provincial councils. They are independent national institutions which are responsible for attracting cooperation and consulting in governmental decisions. Although the urban planning system in Iran has no specific national urban policy, there are some plans and programs that determine general urban policies; they act as part of a national urban policy and together form a whole strategy. Study of a full range of upstream documents indicates that some, such as the Islamic Republic of Iran\u2019s 20-year Vision Plan, the 6th Development Plan, the National/Regional Physical Plan, and the Housing Master Plan contain national policies and address urban issues. The 20- year Vision for the country, for instance, includes not only a general vision for the country, but vision for specific sectors which should be achieved by implementing other plans. 24 https://www.nabz-iran.com/sites/default/files/iran_ government_primer_en_0.pdf 25 The Constitution and Law of the Municipalities of Iran: Research Center of the Islamic Consultative Assembly: http:// rc.majlis.ir These plans are prepared at the national level and are the upstream of all plans in the country. The downstream plans at the lower levels must follow and comply with these plans. Iran has signed the Paris Agreement and Climate Change policy has been ratified by the Parliament. Nonetheless, the commitment is accepted at the country level only; there is no reference to local governments at the INDC. Most voluntary commitments by government to reduce emissions are on activities related to consumption of oil and gas, including oil and gas refineries, the petrochemical industry and; power generation in thermal power stations. Women\u2019s participation in local governance There is neither limitation for women to run as candidates in Iran nor a specific quota for them. For example, the current proportion of seats held by women in Tehran city council is about one third.

Article 93 of the Constitution provides for the establishment of local councils as the legislative body, and defines the direct public election of members of local council and the heads of the executive branch of local government (governors and mayors). Details of powers and relations between local councils, governors and mayors are defined in the local autonomy law, and electoral procedures are defined by the public offices election law.

Based on the principle of no taxation without law, basic tax affairs of local government are defined by the local tax law, which provides for the imposition and collection of taxes by local governments. The base of local taxes is defined by law; however, rates of tax are of three types; rates defined by the law, standard rates defined by the law where the local governments have discretion to change the rates within a certain range, and rates that local governments can decide. In addition to the local taxes defined by the local tax law, each local government can establish non-statutory (established by local ordinance, not by national law) local taxes. Establishment of non-statutory taxes by local governments needs consent of the Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications. The Minister shall give consent unless the proposed tax is unfair to taxpayers or has significant negative impact on the local economy.27 In relation to access to loans and financial markets, local governments with certain financial conditions (real debt service ratio (an index of the size of the redemption amount of debts (local bonds) and similar expenditure, and represents the cash-flow level) shall be under 18 per cent), local governments have discretion to issue local bonds by themselves (local government are required to notify the issuance of bonds to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications).

As of October 2013, almost all prefectures and municipalities with populations over 200,000 have their own performance measurement and evaluation systems. Smaller size municipalities tend to have lower level performance systems. The ratio of installing performance systems is down to one-third of municipalities. Three metropolitan areas (Greater Tokyo Metropolitan Area, Greater Osaka Metropolitan Area, and Greater Nagoya Metropolitan Area), all have national strategic development plans based on national development laws. These plans are comprehensive and umbrella plans coordinated with the development plans in their respective local governments. National and local governments work together within these plans to improve basic infrastructure. In some cases, national government may be directly involved with major infrastructure development projects, while local government is involved with smaller scale infrastructure development projects. The typical process for decisions on local government development plans in urban area is as follows. A Deliberative Council composed of experts, local leaders, general citizens, and others, have sessions to draft the development plan. In many cases, public comment and a series of public hearings and meetings are held during the drafting process. Once the final draft is prepared, it is submitted to the local council. The local council will set up a special committee to consider the draft plan, and officially approve it in the official session (composed of all members). Local government uses the national plan as a reference, but there is no stringent coordination mechanism, nor hierarchical order such as national plan as upper level plan, and local plan as lower plan between central government and local government. Some other specific plans such as disaster prevention plans are in place to prevent local government from developing a local plan which could be inconsistent with the national plan. However, there is lack of an appropriate coordination mechanism between national development plan and local plan in development planning and strategies. The Japanese Government submitted the INDC in 2015 and committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26 per cent by 2030, from 2013. Based on the INDC, central government revised the national strategic policy for the prevention of global warming, and local governments are expected to play key leading roles in achieving the goals.

The Kiribati Constitution is silent on urban development, local government and cities; it deals primarily with more general matters, including the Bill of Rights, the functions and processes of the Executive, the legislature and judiciary . However, the Local Government Act and other related Acts define clearly the responsibilities and powers of councils in accordance with the Constitution. Central government provides grants to local governments in the form of financial transfers as well as in-kind assistance. Financial transfers include government support grants to be used generally to meet overheads and project (development) funds.

This government support grant is considered small and therefore, over the years, councils have often requested increments. A specific Local Government System Review was carried out in 2013 by an independent evaluator. The review recommended an increase in the financial resources provided to Councils for the full exercise of their mandated responsibilities. The government is yet to implement the recommendation. Central government also provides financial assistance for specific development projects. This fund has strict spending guidelines which Councils generally conform with.

This view of local governments as a catalyst of development stands in contrast to the colonial period when they were looked upon as an agency primarily associated with tasks such as garbage collection and street cleaning. There are 144 local governments divided into cities (major administrative and commercial centres), municipalities (other urban areas), and districts (chiefly rural areas). The local authorities in Malaysia represent the third (and lowest) tier of government after the Federal and State governments. The Federal Constitution in 1957 (paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Ninth Schedule) \u2013 which outlines the framework of the relationship between the three tiers of government \u2013 stated that local governments are primarily under the jurisdiction of the State government. However, Clause 76 (4) of the Constitution highlighted that the Federal government has the authority to make laws to achieve uniformity in policy and law. The federal government deals with the local government through the Ministry of Urban Wellbeing, Housing and Local Government. Federal influence is also exercised through the National Council for Local Government, chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister with the Chief Ministers of the states in Malaysia as members. The Council is enacted to advise and coordinate the local authorities in various matters, especially concerning legal and policy issues. The Ministry of Urban Wellbeing, Housing and Local Government is responsible for the coordinating and supervising of the local authorities. However, any directives from the ministry need to be adopted by the state first. Since the local government is under the state list in the Constitution, the state has direct financial powers over the local authorities.

In theory, the Federal government cannot interfere directly in the affairs of the local authorities. In practice, however, State governments were seldom in a position to offer financial assistance to their local authorities, which therefore came to rely extensively on Federal funding. In Peninsular Malaysia, the local authorities are governed by the Local Government Act 1976, however the act is out of date in dealing with modern challenges of local governance. Those in East Malaysia, i.e., the states of Sabah and Sarawak, have their own ordinances. For instance, the local authorities in Sarawak are governed by the Local Authorities Ordinance 1996. It is important to note that Sarawak and Sabah have special constitutional status and exercise more independent control over local government than the states in Peninsular Malaysia. There is also the Street, Drainage and Building Act 1974 (Act 133). Malaysia has a clear urbanisation strategy in the form of the National Urbanisation Policy (2006) and the National Physical Plans which translates the strategic and sectoral policies in spatial and physical dimensions. In June 2017, The Third National Physical Plan and Second National Urbanisation Policy were launched. However, Malaysia still lacks the necessary finance, technical arrangements and capacities for implementation of the policy. One unique characteristic of local government in Malaysia is that unlike most countries, local governments do not have direct accountability to its citizens. Executive powers rest with the Mayor (cities) or President, supported by a system of committees. Currently, local councils in Malaysia are not elected.

The Local Government Act 1976 provides guidelines regarding the appointment of councillors. However, in practice the local Councillors are mainly selected based on their political affiliations and in most cases come from the ruling coalition. Local elections which were scheduled to occur in 1965 and 1966 were suspended in early 1965 by the Federal government regulations under authority of the Emergency (Essential Powers) Act, 1964 on the grounds that it was inappropriate to hold elections during the state of national emergency caused by Indonesia\u2019s Confrontation.

An example of this would be the Geran Tahunan Berasaskan Kaedah Keseimbangan (GTBKK, Annual Grant Based on Balanced Methodology) which is an annual grant from the central government to local authorities that uses a formula that takes into account population size, among others. \u2022 Citizen participation \u2013 National legislation on citizen participation exists but is not applied. Community participation in local government in Malaysia is considered very limited. However, growing community awareness is challenging the practice of centralised administration. In 2007, the Federal government initiated e-PBTs, an electronic system to bring local government closer to citizens. The four elements of the system are accounts, taxation, e-submission and complaints. Evaluation of local authorities \u2013 Local government performance is assessed by independent bodies. Local governments are financially audited by an independent body, and sustainability audit is carried out by the Ministry of Urban Wellbeing, Housing and Local Government. Additionally, for over a decade now, the Town and Country Planning Department has been running the MURNInet \u2013 the Malaysian Urban Rural Indicators system that assesses the performance and level of sustainability for Malaysian cities. These positive developments notwithstanding, over the years, there has been a growing tendency for Federal government, under the pretext of providing better services to the public, to remove traditional functions of local government and privatise them. This has further exacerbated the views that the local government remains tightly controlled from the centre with limited revenues despite the constant rhetoric of decentralisation. This has placed the local government system in serious difficulties in meeting the challenges of a changing global environment and global goals such as the New Urban Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. One example of this difficulty is in climate change adaptation. The Malaysian government submitted its INDC in 2015, where Malaysia committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions intensity of GDP by 45 per cent by 2030 relative to the emissions intensity of GDP in 2005. This consists of 35 per cent on an unconditional basis and a further 10 per cent condition upon receipt of climate finance, technology transfer and capacity building from developed countries. Urban areas were highlighted as being prone to climate change risks in the form of flash floods, but local governments were not specifically mentioned as playing a key lead role in achieving the goals. Women\u2019s participation in local governance In Malaysia, there is no term limit for women elected, as part of the quota. While the minimum per centage of women at local level is not yet 30 per cent, there is a government policy that women should make up at least 30 per cent Given this, the country is rated 2 as the national provisions on temporary special measure for women/\u2019quota system\u2019 at local level meets at least one of the following: \u2022 No rotation system is applied \u2022 Minimum per centage of women is above 30 per cent \u2022 Quota consists of reserved seats or placement mandates quotas are enforced by law Proposed Reforms With a score of 33 out of 44, Malaysia is making good progress towards an adapted enabling environment. Based on the scoring against criteria, the major area of reform needed is in the election of Councillors and Executive of the local authorities. This reform will enhance the accountability of local authorities to the citizens within their jurisdictions. 102 Explanation of the Rating Maldives is a low-lying island nation in the Indian Ocean with a population, in 2014, of 344,023.

There are 179 Island Councils, 18 Atoll Councils, and 3 City Councils in the Maldives as per the Local Council Elections in 2017. A new Constitution was ratified in 2008. It devolves clearly the functions into fiscal and administrative functions and authority are devolved to local councils. However individual or sectoral Acts that existed before the new Constitution were not changed to align them with the powers given to local councils by the Constitution.

Such conflicting laws and regulations include the Law on Public Finances (2006), Maldives Land Law Regulations (2004), Maldives Tourism Act (1999), Maldives Land Act (2002). Local governments are managed by local councils, which are mandated by the Constitution to: provide democratic and accountable governance; foster social and economic well-being and development of the community. Local governments are either unitary or two-tier. City councils are unitary councils, while island and atoll councils represent a two-tier system in which the lower level island councils are accountable to the atoll councils. City councils are headed by a Mayor, while island and atoll councils have a Council President elected from among themselves. The administrative wing of the councils is headed by a civil servant (Responsible Officer) who is responsible for implementing the decisions made by the Council and managing the day-to-day operations of the Council. All administrative staff working at the councils are civil servants. The Local Government Authority (LGA) is responsible for local government and advises councils on the formulation of regulations and by-laws.41 It is also the state agency created under the Decentralisation Act to monitor and regulate the work activities of local councils. Since 2015, the LGA has developed a performance measuring indicator called \u2018Local 40 Decentralisation Act of the Maldives (unofficial translation): http://www.shareefweb. com/documents/LocalGovReforms/MaldivesDraftlaw&regulations/Draft%20 Translation%20of%20decentralisation%20ActMaldives.pdf 41 Local Government Authority website www.lga.gov.mv Enabling Environment Rating for Cities and Local Authorities: 29 44 MALDIVES National legislation on citizen participation exists but is not applied.

All councils are entitled to obtain funds annually from the state for office administration, service provision and development projects. A fiscal formula is available to calculate and distribute this financial assistance from central government to local councils. Every council is required to prepare a 5-year island development plan, in consultation with the community, and submit them to the atoll council. Atoll councils and City councils are required to submit the plans to the LGA. The development plans consist of a 5-year strategic plan, 5-year action plan and a framework for monitoring the targets and activities.

Explanation of the Rating Mongolia is a landlocked unitary sovereign state in East Asia. Its area is roughly equivalent to the historical territory of Outer Mongolia, and that term is sometimes used to refer to the current state. Mongolia is bordered by China to the south and Russia to the north. The population of Mongolia in 2016 was 3,119,935. Since the end of the socialist period, the population of Mongolia has experienced substantial growth, from about 2.0 million in 1990 and 2.4 million in 2000 to nearly 3.12 million in 2016. The territory of Mongolia is divided administratively into Aimags and the capital city; Aimags are subdivided into Soums; and Soums into Bags. The capital city is divided into districts and districts into Khoroos.44 There are 21 Aimags, 330 Soums, and 1568 Bags in Mongolia. The capital, Ulaanbaatar, is administered separately as a capital city (municipality) with provincial status; it has 9 districts and 152 Khoroos. Administrative and territorial units of the capital city and Aimag (province) are clearly stated in the Constitution of Mongolia. The legal status of the capital city is regulated by the Law on Legal Status of the Capital City,45 while the legal status of cities and towns located in the territories of administrative divisions is regulated by the Law on the Legal Status of Cities and Towns,46 as 44 Constitution of Mongolia (January 13,1992) https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ eoir/legacy/2013/11/08/Constitution%20.pdf 45 The Law on the Legal Status of the Capital City (July 5, 1994) http://www.legalinfo.mn/ law/details/396?lawid=396 46 The Law on the Legal Status of Cities and Towns (December 20, 1993) http://www. legalinfo.mn/law/details/532?lawid=532 well as the Law on Administrative and Territorial Units of Mongolia and their governing bodies.47 According to the Constitution and other laws, units of governance must independently organise their local economy and social issues by combining municipal self-governance and public administration, following the basic principles of government operation.48 The Mongolian taxation system has three different sources: taxes, fees, and charges, which are obtained both from national and local government. National tax is enforced by the Parliament and applied in the country as a whole; local government tax is enforced by the Aimag representative council and city representative council to be applied in the Aimag or city area. According to the Tax Law, Article 7, local government tax includes individual income tax; income tax of individuals engaged in work and services, income from which cannot be immediately determined; immovable property tax; other state stamp duty; water and spring water charges; tax on auto and self-propelling vehicles; charges on permits for use of natural resources other than minerals; charges on use of natural plants; charges on use of commonly occurring minerals; charges on use of hunting reserves, hunting permit fees; land charges; charges on procurement and use of wood fuel and timber from forest; gun duty; capital city tax; tax on dogs; and tax on inheritance and gifts. The Constitution of Mongolia, Article 62, prescribes \u201cAuthorities of higher instance may not take decisions on matters coming under the jurisdiction of local self-governing bodies.

Based on the scoring against criteria, two key areas for reform are: \u2022 Election of the head of executive bodies. \u2022 Adequate delegation of powers in revenue generation through taxes. 106 Explanation of the Rating According to the census of 2014, from Myanmar\u2019s national population of 51.5 million, about 15.2 million people or 29.6 per cent of the entire population was living in urban areas in 2014. It is expected that Myanmar\u2019s urban population will grow from 15.4 million in 2014 to about 20.4 million in 2030. This trend shows a wide-ranging modernisation of both municipal governance and legal frameworks for urban development. Under the 2008 Constitution, Myanmar is a Federal Republic with a national (\u2018Union\u2019) government, and 14 States/Regions governments. The former constitutes the local government in Myanmar. Two distinct systems of administration need to be recognised: on one hand, the system of City Development Committees in the country\u2019s three largest cities (Yangon, Nay Pyi Taw, and Mandalay); and on the other, the system of township-level offices of national and regional ministries. Simply put, local governments are in Myanmar defined as State/Region governments which are formed after general elections every 5th year. The three City Development Committees are the only truly municipal authorities in Myanmar. Development Affairs Organisations (DAOs) have been established in each township in Myanmar outside the major cities under the Development Committees Law 1993.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9155d662-b0f8-47dc-95bd-8d36445db8de": {"__data__": {"id_": "9155d662-b0f8-47dc-95bd-8d36445db8de", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/city-enabling-environment-rating", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "City Enabling Environment Rating", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/city-enabling-environment-rating", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eceb0b6e38f5e7831ca756a19d10552be58834068ee4356ce03d4e8e2e063c2e"}, "2": {"node_id": "c3dc8a89-d134-45c3-849f-1269c75794ea", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/city-enabling-environment-rating", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2a857e49590aa589048b02a078a6a1230423d2e624f88ed6d06a8eb12c60508e"}}, "hash": "d2e6217b65fe6fd8e6c2cba3af1a404e7c88755a05be76f407ca1eed043c022d", "text": "They have responsibility for coordinating and overseeing different administrative officers assigned to the township level including basic service provision.

Local government performance is assessed irregularly. A clear national urban strategy exists, but the financial and technical arrangements and capacities necessary to implement it are lacking. The Constitution makes explicit mention of local governments as spheres of governance, detailing their recognised roles and responsibilities. Local governments have some latitude to determine rates for existing taxes, but the central government is responsible for setting the tax base for existing taxes, creating new taxes, and accessing loans and financial markets. All responsibilities and powers are clearly defined in accordance with the Constitution, but some relevant statutory laws and regulations are missing. There is a national framework of reference defining the qualifications and responsibilities of local government staff, and a national strategy for training and promoting human resources in local governments; so far, this concerns only a few local governments. Local assemblies and executive bodies are elected throughout the country. The transfer of resources to local governments or their distribution among local governments is predictable according to a transparent formula. Enabling Environment for Cities and Local Government in Asia Pacific 107 A separate municipal tier is not mentioned in the Constitution. A municipal governance structure democratically accountable to the local inhabitants of townships, the third tier of government in many other countries, remains absent. General (local) development affairs as well as town and housing development tasks fall under the purview of states and regions. Schedule II of the Constitution outlines responsibilities according to level of government. The Union level of government is responsible for administration of town and village land. State/ region level is responsible for land revenue, municipal taxes such as taxes on buildings and lands, water, street lightings and wheels, local plans, development matters, town and housing development. In terms of transparency, rules and legal provisions for independent financial audits are in place in the country. It happens every year yet the timeframe is not systematic. On the other hand, national legislation on citizen participation is not established yet a local committees are available providing space for public to involve. This committee can be in the form of township plan committee or farmland with the objective to facilitate dialogue and consultation with community. Myanmar has submitted an INDC. Moreover climate change and environmental concerns are represented in the national urbanisation policy (under development). There is a provisional building code in place, to be formally ratified by Parliament later this year, which accounts for disaster risk reduction. The INDC has an objective of ensuring that increasing urbanisation takes place in a sustainable manner. It notes that, \u201cTo promote sustainable urbanisation, the Government of Myanmar is drafting a National Urban and Regional Development Planning Law, a National Housing Policy, National Urban Policy, and is expanding its urban planning capacity.

Geographically, the country is small, measuring approximately 900 kms from east to west and 200 kms from north to south, accounting for only 0.3 per cent of the total land area of Asia.52 The most recent national census, conducted in 2011, indicated a population of almost 26.5 million people. By 2016, the population had grown to 28 million and it is projected to reach 33.5 million by 2031.53 In terms of governance, Nepal is currently in transition, having recently emerged (2006) from a decade long civil war, and is moving from a Monarchy to a multiparty Democratic Republic nation. A new Constitution was adopted in 2015 and a new federal form of governance is being prepared, with a strong focus on decentralisation of power to provincial and local levels. These changes place urbanisation in Nepal within a unique context, taking place in the midst of both a relatively rapid transition from a rural to urban nation and significant changes in how urban governance may operate in a federal state. Whilst the previous Constitution made no specific mention of local bodies and their roles, the new Constitution clearly articulates the general roles and responsibilities of local governments, giving them increased power and ability for revenue raising and decision- making. The division of roles for local executive and local legislature is explained in Articles 17 and 18 of the Constitution and a list of competencies of local governments are provided in Articles 8 and 52 The assessment was done before the country election in 2017ThapaPrahlad (2017) Economy and Development of Nepal 53 Central Bureau of Statistics of Nepal 2015 Factsheet <http://cbs.gov.np/image/ data/2016/Nepal%20in%20Figures%202015.pdf> 9. However, the Constitution also notes that some responsibilities could overlap between different levels of government such as federal, provincial, and local level in Article 20. The new Constitution establishes seven provinces, including the roles and relationships between the new provinces and local level. Nepal has a Local Body Fiscal Commission (LBFC) which provides both predictable unconditional grants, and additional conditional grants based on a well-developed and transparent formula-based grant system. The formula is calculated primarily taking into account geographical factors (ie. remoteness, whether it is in a mountain region etc.) and population (ie. whether it is designated metropolitan, sub metropolitan or municipal), as well as poverty levels. For the additional grants, these are based on a formula and performance indicator which is measured by using a tool called the \u2018Minimum Conditions and Performance Measures\u2019 (MCPM). Every year LBFC conducts MCPM for its local bodies such as District Development Committees (DDCs), and Municipalities and Village Development Committees (VDCs) to determine their performance. Since the fiscal year 2009/10 all the block and conditional grants allocated to the DDCs are performance-based. For the Village Development Committees (VDCs) and municipalities, a performance-based system was introduced in fiscal year 2007/08. In the case of the VDCs, however, only the grants funded under the Local Governance and Community Development Program are based on performance.54 The Local Self-Governance Act 1999 (LSGA) and the Local Self- Governance Regulations 2000 govern the existing structure and operation of the taxes.

The LSGA has categorised the revenue sources of local bodies into either internal or external sources. Local governments have some freedom to determine existing tax bases and rates, but the central government is responsible for setting new taxes and accessing loans and financial assistance. Furthermore, the current Constitution contains provision for the Natural Resources and Fiscal Commission to review issues in local level units for more appropriate financing schemes. Nonetheless, the relevant legislation to define the Constitution has not yet been formulated. Until the assessment takes place, local development officers, executive officers and the secretary are still appointed by the central government, and civil servants are generally staffing municipal offices. The first local elections in 14 years were held in Nepal in 2017. This reform to local elections is in line with the local self-governance act and new government acts. The election is scheduled to take place every 5 years in the Acts, and yet in practice this has not yet taken place. Centrally deputed Government Officers have been working as de-facto chiefs of local assemblies and executive boards. They are using the powers and responsibilities of local level assemblies and executive bodies without an elected mandate. Rules and legal provisions on transparency in the running of local governments require regular and independent audits (both financial and social audits) to be conducted within specified timeframes. An independent third-party auditor is appointed by the Municipality itself for financial audits. However, having all local bodies audited by the Auditor General is almost impossible. To bridge the gap, there is a process of social audit, public audit and public hearings. The Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development has published their guidelines and oversee implementation. A national urban strategy is in place in Nepal but financial and technical arrangements and capacities necessary to implement the strategy are lacking. The National Urban Development Strategy (NUDS) has been published by the Government of Nepal, in particular the Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD) in 2015.55 Public participation is practiced through various means, including through \u2018Ward Citizen Forum\u2019 (WCFs),\u2018 Community Awareness Centres\u2019 (CACs), and \u2018Tole lane organisations,\u2019 whereby local citizens, including disenfranchised groups are selected to be involved in participatory planning at various levels, ranging from information sharing to genuine citizen centric decision-making.

Based on the scoring against criteria, three key areas for reform are: \u2022 Local elections in Nepal need to be supported by specific technical regulation to govern the mechanism as well as adequate budget for running the elections. While relevant Acts have been enacted, implementation is lacking. Supporting schemes and mechanisms are essential to reinforce regulations. \u2022 As environmental problems occur locally, participation and contribution of local government in the environmental and climate change mitigation is essential. The roles of local government need to be embraced in the national policy plan to ensure corresponding programmes and mutual collaborative efforts at the local level. \u2022 Local government requires support from central government to enhance their capacity for local revenue generation through taxes. 110 Explanation of the Rating New Zealand is a Parliamentary Democracy with the Head of State Queen Elizabeth II of New Zealand who is represented by the Governor-General. Parliament is the supreme legislative power known as a Constitutional Monarchy. Its parliament only has one chamber, the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives consists of 120 members who are elected for a term of up to 3 years. There is universal sufferage for people over the age of 18 years and the voting system is Mixed Member Proportional (MMP). Urban and local government units can be created through local government re-organisation undertaken by the Local Government Commission and approved by the government through an Order in Council. The Commission is made up of three members appointed by the government to deal with requests for changes to local government boundaries, including reorganisation. The country has no a written constitution; instead it has a series of constitutional statutes, such as the Constitution Act 1986. Empowering legislation for local government is enshrined in three Acts: the Local Government Act 2002;59 the Local Government (Rating) Act 2002;60 and the Local Electoral Act 2001.61 These three statutes are widely regarded to be part of the country\u2019s constitutional framework and set 59 the Local Government Act 2002, http://www.legislation.government.nz/act/ public/2002/0084/latest/DLM170873.html?src=qs 60 the Local Government (Rating) Act 2002, http://www.legislation.government.nz/act/ public/2002/0006/latest/DLM131394.html?src=qs 61 the Local Electoral Act 2001. http://www.legislation.government.nz/act/ public/2001/0035/latest/DLM93301.html?src=qs out local government structures, membership, democratic status and powers to levy property tax and other charges. They also ensure that local government elections are held every three years without the risk of political interference and that the way in which decisions are made is accountable. However, as the statutes are not \u2018entrenched,\u2019 it only takes a simple majority vote in parliament to amend or abolish them. Local government is also deeply ingrained within the democratic traditions of the country. There are some gaps that should be filled however, such as protection against unfunded mandates, and a need for local government legislation to be entrenched to provide greater stability and certainty for its role and powers. New Zealand has three types of taxes: income, consumption and property tax. The income from property tax constitutes 8.3 per cent of the total. Central government levies income and consumption taxes, while local government is authorised to levy property taxes. Councils have full autonomy to determine the level of property taxes and wide discretion to determine the nature of the property on which the tax can be levied, such as the unimproved value of land or improvements.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eb7192b0-cea5-40d8-96d8-fa4faa2c4a92": {"__data__": {"id_": "eb7192b0-cea5-40d8-96d8-fa4faa2c4a92", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/city-enabling-environment-rating", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "City Enabling Environment Rating", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/city-enabling-environment-rating", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b42c932aa79dfeba6bfc12d0e2e8bf5f1c9875ae61cad3c86bbf916036de31d2"}, "2": {"node_id": "53aa0cb7-9bf7-44c4-a917-1a8f340ef2d6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/city-enabling-environment-rating", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "48da8d9881448bc3e03a8f157fe678467c40216a913b79be7434e06c4fc95d27"}}, "hash": "f294b9979c5abd467aa2a7fee37268d8e8149299ff628d42935bd3aff7287d39", "text": "Property taxes can be targeted at particular features of a property or differentiated on the basis of property use, such as business properties.

Enabling Environment Rating for Cities and Local Authorities: 37 44 NEW ZEALAND National legislation on citizen participation exists and is applied. Rules and legal provisions on transparency in the running of local governments requiring regular, independent audits be conducted within specified timeframes exist and are applied. Country\u2019s international commitments for environmental protection and promotion recognises the importance of urban areas and positive role of LGUs in implementation. There is legislation on measuring local government performance, and performance is assessed by independent bodies. A clear national urban strategy exists, but the financial and technical arrangements and capacities necessary to implement it are lacking. The Constitution makes explicit mention of local governments, but their responsibilities are defined by legislation. Local governments have total autonomy to determine tax base, rates and fees, and to collect the corresponding revenues; access to financial markets is allowed. All responsibilities and powers are clearly defined in accordance with the Constitution, but some relevant statutory laws and regulations are missing. There is a national framework of reference defining the qualifications and responsibilities of local government staff, or a national strategy for training and promoting human resources in local governments; but they concern only a few local governments. Local assemblies and executive bodies are elected throughout the country. The transfer of resources to local governments and their distribution among local governments are clear and predictable, with utilisation determined at the national level (conditional transfers). Enabling Environment for Cities and Local Government in Asia Pacific 111 Local governments receive a share of the Land Transport Fund (LTF). This fund is a hypothecated fund consisting of income from petrol taxes and vehicle registration fees. The fund is used to pay for local roads and state highways. Councils own the local roads (87 per cent of all roads) while central government owns the state highways. Approximately 45 per cent of the fund is allocated to local roads and 55 per cent to state highways, depending on priorities. Matched grants are made to local government on the basis of each council\u2019s annual capital investment program, using agreed criteria. Funding from the LTF can be used for capital investment in new roads or public transport assets or renewals. Occasionally special purpose funds are set up which councils can make application for. These funds have defined budgets, clear purpose statements and transparent criteria, as with a recent fund established to support council investment in new tourism infrastructure. Local government operates under a legal framework, the Local Government Official Information Act 1986, that guarantees public access to information except where it might be personally or commercially sensitive.62 The Ombudsman\u2019s\u2019 Office also has authority to investigate complaints made about local authorities, including failure to release information. Councils are subject to annual assessment by the Office of the Auditor General and must publish financial and performance information annually. The Government has only recently adopted a National Policy Statement on Urban Development Capacity (November 2016). The purpose of this policy is to provide guidance to urban local governments on urban development. Operational guidelines are currently being developed. Local government has devolved responsibilities to protect and enhance environmental quality and standards. Councils work with central government to meet the country\u2019s international greenhouse emissions commitments. New Zealand\u2019s international commitments recognise the role of local government but no specific targets apply to councils. Local government is regarded as a key partner with central government in efforts to curb climate change. The two critical planning documents that all local authorities are required to adopt are the Long-Term Plan and the City Plan.63 The Long-Term Plan (LTP) is responsible for setting out the activities of a council; describing the council\u2019s community outcomes; providing 62 http://www.mfe.government.nz/publications/towns-and-cities/ national-policy-statement-urban-development-capacity-2016 63 www.localcouncils.government.nz integrated decision-making and coordination; providing a long-term focus for the decisions and activities of the council, and providing a basis for accountability to the community. It includes: (i) budgeted revenue and expenditure for at least 10 years (including expected changes in tax revenue); (ii) detailed information on the council\u2019s priorities and planned investment for at least 10 years; (iii) the council\u2019s infrastructure plans for at least 30 years. The LTP is reviewed every three years and is subject to extensive community consultation. Details of the LTP can be found in Sections 93 \u2013 95 of the LGA 2002. Meanwhile, the city or district plan sets out the council\u2019s land use policies including zoning, land use rules and environmental standards. It must be reviewed at least once every 10 years.

Given this, no rating could be given to the country. Proposed Reforms With the score of 37 out of 44, New Zealand is highest ranked and is making significant progress towards an adapted enabling environment. Based on the scoring against criteria, the main area for reform is to establish a framework defining the qualifications and responsibilities of local government staff, or a national strategy for training and promoting human resources in local governments. 112 Explanation of the Rating Pakistan is an Islamic and Federal Parliamentary republic in South Asia. The Prime Minister of Pakistan solely leads the executive government which is independent of the state parliament. Pakistan has a bicameral parliament that is composed of two chambers: The Senate (upper house), and the National Assembly (lower house). The Judicature branch forms with the composition of the Supreme Court as an apex court, alongside the high court and other inferior courts. The judiciary\u2019s function is to interpret the Constitution and federal laws and regulations. The President of Pakistan is a ceremonial figurehead who represents the unity of the nation-state, and the presidency is a vital part of the Parliament. Pakistan is subdivided into 4 provinces, 2 territories, and 1 capital territory. Each province has a provincial assembly, a directly elected legislature. Members are elected for 5-year terms. Each assembly elects a Chief Minister, who then selects the ministers of his or her cabinet. According to the Constitution of Pakistan, it is the responsibility of the provincial governments to make laws for local governments and hold elections, but there is no full coverage given to local government matters in the Constitution.64 Although it contains no detailed explanation of local governments\u2019 powers and authorities, the Constitution makes provisions for local government activities. Article 140_A clearly states that every province will devolve administrative, political powers to the respective local governments hence the provincial governments are responsible for framing laws and establishing local governments both for urban 64 http://www.pakp.gov.pk/2013/ and rural areas within the provinces. The urban local governments include metropolitan corporations, municipal corporations, district municipal corporations, municipal committees, town committees, city district governments, district councils and tehsil/town councils. These local bodies are established under the provincial local acts which differ in many ways in all four provinces of Pakistan. There is no national law, policy or framework under which resources are directly provided to urban local/city governments. However, under the National Finance Commission (NFC), well- defined formula resources are distributed among provinces every year. The central government does not transfer resources to local governments directly, except for the capital city of Islamabad. On the other hand, the provinces under the Provincial Finance Commission (PFC) distribute resources to urban/city local governments with a different formula. Although there is a specific commission to manage the financial transfer to local government, the practice shows that provinces organise financial transfers to local governments directly without holding annual meetings of PFC, creating a less than transparent mechanism. Generally, transparency is a challenge nationally. The legal and constitutional provisions for ensuring transparency do exist but are not implemented properly.65 In terms of taxation, most taxes are levied and managed by the central and provincial governments, especially the major taxes. Local governments administer only a few taxes, resulting in limited sources of local revenue from taxes. On the other hand, local governments have authority to make changes on the tax schedule 65 http://www.pbs.gov.pk/ Enabling Environment Rating for Cities and Local Authorities: 22 44 PAKISTAN National legislation on citizen participation exists but is not applied. Only partial rules and legal provisions on transparency in the running of local governments exist and they are not systematically followed. Country\u2019s international commitments for environmental protection and promotion exist but does not recognise the importance of urban areas and positive role of LGUs in implementation. There is legislation on measuring local government performance, but performance is assessed by the authority responsible for supervising local governments. No national urban strategy. The Constitution makes explicit mention of local governments, but their responsibilities are defined by legislation. Local governments have some latitude to determine rates for existing taxes, but the central government is responsible for setting the tax base for existing taxes, creating new taxes, and accessing loans and financial markets.

There is no national framework of reference defining the qualifications and responsibilities of local government staff and no national strategy for training and promoting human resources in local governments.

Enabling Environment for Cities and Local Government in Asia Pacific 113 upon obtaining approval from the provincial government. This schedule is issued by the provincial government which may different from each category of taxes. As local governments work under provincial administration, there are no frameworks of reference and strategy for defining qualifications, responsibilities, and training in promoting human resources for local governments. Such regulations can be found at the provincial level, including recruitment, capacity building and promotion mechanisms for municipal staff. Urban local governments are responsible for city development planning and strategies, but they are bound to consult with parliamentarians from the area and with the district-level bureaucracy. Given this obligation, urban local governments have no independence to develop their planning and other strategies. In the case of large cities, there are parallel bodies, authorities and companies which handle various functions of urban services delivery such as solid waste. There is no mechanism to scale up urban strategy to the national level. A delegation from Pakistan, headed by the federal minister for climate change, was present in Paris for COP21, and confirmed the country\u2019s commitment to significant emissions reduction, by signing the Paris Agreement. In 2016, the National Assembly of Pakistan passed the Pakistan Climate Change Act 2016 under which the Pakistan Climate Change Council and the Pakistan Climate Change Authority shall be established to reduce greenhouse gasses by up to 2 per cent. In the context of the Paris Agreement, the National Assembly also passed the National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act 2016, and the Prime Minister\u2019s Green Pakistan Program was also started. National government does not directly support local government units to work on climate change, however local governments have some functions to deal with climate change issues. Rural local governments are only responsible for promoting plantations in their constituencies, while in big cities under urban local governments, departments have responsibility to control pollution, like the environmental protection agency, the solid waste management authority, water and sanitation, and transport authority. There is no specific law for local government where it is mandatory for them to ensure participatory budgeting, to incorporate public opinion and to engage citizens in development. Nevertheless, Section 139 of the Local Government Act 2013 states that nothing shall restrict or limit the right of the citizens or residents of a local area to bring any suit or other legal proceedings against any local governments, its officers or other functionaries for violation of his rights provided by any law. Women\u2019s participation in local governance There are reserved seats for the women in local government, but fewer than the 30 per cent level. In the 2001 and 2005 local government elections, there was a quota of 30 per cent seats for women which was reduced in 2013 by local government ordinances accross all the provinces. The country is rated 2 as the national provisions on temporary special measures for women/\u2019quota system\u2019 at local level meet at least one of the following: \u2022 No rotation system is applied \u2022 Minimum per centage of women is above 30 per cent \u2022 Quota consists of reserved seats or placement mandates quotas are enforced by law Proposed Reforms With the score of 22 out of 44, Pakistan is making moderate progress towards developing an adapted enabling environment for cities and local governments. Based on the scoring against criteria, three key areas for reform are: \u2022 Given limitations on tax generation, local government should be able to raise finances and implement carrot and stick policies eg. imposition of fines for parking, noise offences, etc. Such acts will increase local revenue, act as a deterrent, and establish the prestige of local governments and representatives. However, any revenue obtained by local governments should be subject to stringent audit for accountability and transparency. \u2022 Development of a national urban strategy is a priority given the availability of authentic data from the 2017 census.

It is bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Bashi Channel to the north, and the Sulu and Celebes Seas to the south. Its islands are classified into three main geographical areas: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, with a land area of 300,000 km2. The total population is approximately 101 million with 44 per cent is living in urban areas. The urbanisation rate is at 1.3 per cent (annual rate of change 2010-2015) and by 2050 the population is projected to increase to 84 per cent urban.66 A republic with a centralised and presidential system of government the Philippines has three branches of governance: executive, legislative and judicial.

All local assemblies and executive bodies are elected every 3 years as explained under the 1987 Philippine Constitution and the Philippine Election Law. Given the mandate of local government in the Constitution, LGUs have authority to enact their own local revenue code and local investment and incentive code as a basis for their revenue generation and collection. This fiscal autonomy is governed under Local Government Code, Book II Title 1 Chapter 1. Furthermore, within similar regulation, cities can impose tax on the transfer of real property ownership (Section 135), tax on business (Section 136), franchise tax (Section 137), tax on sand, gravel, and other quarry resources (Section 138), professional tax (Section 139), amusement tax (Section 140). Local governments have authority to determine existing tax base and rates, but the setting of new taxes and accessing loans and financial markets are done by central government.68 In addition to taxes, local governments also receive financial transfers from the national government. Addressed in Section 285 of 1991 LGC, local government may receive some allocations from 68 Philippine Statistics Authority. (31 March 2017).

Enabling Environment for Cities and Local Government in Asia Pacific 115 the national government based on a specific formula depending on population, land area, and equal sharing. Nonetheless, the transfer of resources is done conditionally depending on the eligibility of the LGUs. The use of Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA), for instance, is being guided by national government circulars to allocate funds to specifically grouped programs, eg, 20 per cent for development funds, 5 per cent for Disaster Risk Reduction Management (DRRM) funds, and 5 per cent for Gender and Development funds. The Philippine Government agencies are mandated by governing laws and regulations to monitor, assess and evaluate LGU performance and management, such as: The Commission on Audit\u2013 the supreme audit institution of the government; the Department of Interior and Local Government\u2013Seal of Good Local Governance (SGLG) for assessing the LGU\u2019s local governance performance and management; the Civil Service Commission\u2013personnel management; and the Department of Budget and Management (DBM)\u2013budgeting procedure. Support for local performance, development and maintenance of a high level of employee performance is a primary concern of government. It is government policy that a continuing program of employee training, supervisory, career and executive development be established under the leadership of the Civil Service Commission for all government personnel at all levels. Each department, bureau, office or agency shall have the appropriate training staff and shall establish its own in-service training programs in accordance with the standards laid down by the Commission. The Commission may request technical assistance for government training programs from the Budget Commission, the Institute of Public Administration and other professional and technical organisations. At local government level, the Local Government Academy handles the capacity-building program for mayors and other local chief executives. However, there is no national strategy for dealing with capacity building for all local government officials and staff. The training program is handled by specific Human Resource Departments in each city. There is a national urban strategy, but it lacks technical steps to aide implementation. Currently, the National Urban Development Housing Framework is available, guiding local governments to plan development in a rapidly urbanising world. The Habitat III Report of the Philippines mentioned the Philippine Urban Agenda which envisions better, greener, smarter cities in an inclusive Philippines. Nevertheless, translating these plans and agenda into action items is still lacking, particularly at the local level. As the country is prone to disaster, the Philippine Government has national laws mandating every LGU to provide and prepare long- and medium-term plans on environmental protection and promotion, mainstreaming climate change and disaster risk reduction (Solid Waste Management Plan, City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Plan, Forest Land Use Plan, Coastal Resource Management, Local Climate Change Adaptation Plan, etc.). The national government, through its environmental protection cluster, is doing its best to build capacity in LGUs on Disaster Risk Reduction Management-Climate Change Adaptation (DRRM-CCA). The amended law led to the introduction of the People\u2019s Survival Fund (PSF), which has a national budget allocation for adaptation needs of local communities and local governments. The 1987 Philippines Constitution and Local Government Code of 1991 (RA 7160), embodies citizen participation, such as NGOs, CSOs, POs, in local governance as an alternative strategy for sustainable growth/development. Citizen participation is manifested in some mandated local special bodies eg. the Local Development Council, the Local Peace and Order Council, the Local Health Board, the Local School Board, Prequalification, Bids and Awards Committee. Citizen participation in the budgeting process is a good example of the Bottom-Up Budgeting Program, a national program to empower people/citizens in identifying and implementing poverty reduction projects with LGUs.

The Constitution specifically mentions sub-national government and the main legislative texts for local government include the Local Government Act 1996, the Provincial Government Act 1997 and the Honiara City Act 1999.69 The Minister for Provincial Government (MPG) has responsibility for the provinces, while the Minister for Home Affairs has responsibility for all other local government. The Honiara City Council (HCC) has sole responsibility for trade, business licences and waste management, and shares responsibility with the provincial and central governments for regulation and conservation.70 Key national ministries related to urban development are: the Ministry of Development, Planning and Aid Coordination, the Ministry of Lands, Survey and Housing, the Ministry of Infrastructure and Development, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.71 69 Constitution of Solomon Island 70 Honiara City Act 1999 \u2013 link \u2013 http://www.paclii.org/ 71 www.mecdm.gov.sb Honiara City Council members are elected for 4-year terms under the first-past-the post system. The council is headed by a mayor, indirectly elected by the councillors. The HCC has 20 councillors, 12 elected councillors (each representing a ward), four members appointed by the minister, three members of parliament who represent Honiara and the premier of Guadalcanal province (the island on which Honiara sits). The 12 elected councillors are elected through a ward voting system on a first-past-the-post basis for 4-year terms. The mayor is elected by and from the full 20 councillors. Members of the nine provincial councils are also elected though the single ballot box system. The transfer of resources to local governments and their distribution among local governments are clear and predictable, with utilisation determined at the national level. The financial transfer from central government to HCC is in the form of annual Specific-Purpose Grants and the Unconditional Main Service Grant of a fixed amount. The HCC applies for the grant on a quarterly basis. The transfers are spent against the budgeted activities/annual work plans approved by central government. Provincial governments receive subsidised funding from the central government on a quarterly basis upon receiving satisfactory acquittals from Enabling Environment Rating for Cities and Local Authorities: 28 44 SOLOMON ISLANDS There is no national legislation on citizen participation, and no locally organised space for dialogue and consultation.

Bordered by North Korea to the north, Korea\u2019s population was 51,696,126 in 2016. South Korea is a Republic with a Presidential System; its official name is the Republic of South Korea. The government has three branches: legislative, judicial, and executive. The President represents the nation and heads the executive branch. The President is elected directly by the people and serves only for one 5-year term. The State Council is the highest body for policy deliberation and resolution in the executive branch. It is composed of 15-30 members including the President, the Prime Minister, the Vice Prime Minister (also the Minister of Strategy and Finance), and the Ministers of the 17 ministries. In terms of hierarchical divisions, the government system has three tiers: the central, provincial and municipal. South Korea has a two-tier local government structure. The upper-level (regional level) includes provinces and metropolitan cities and the lower- level (municipal) includes rural county (Gun), city and district (Gu). With the inclusion of the Sejong Special Autonomous City in July 2012, the number of upper-level local governments was increased to seventeen (ie. Seoul Special City, Six metropolises, eight provinces, and Jeju Special Self-Governing Province). The number of lower-level local governments stands at 227 (ie. si/gun/gu).73 The heads of local governments and councillors are directly elected. The term for local government heads is four years, and they can be re-elected for up to three more terms. There is no limit on how many terms a local councillor may serve.

Under the principles, local governments are given the right to assess and collect local taxes. Nonetheless, the authority to set up the taxes bases remains with the central government.74 The Korean government has implemented various strategies and practices with a view to achieving the policies related to urban reforms, balanced regional development and innovation of the spatial structure of land. In 2003, the government restricted the legal system to ensure no development without territorial planning. Several Acts such as the act on comprehensive development of national territory, national territory utilisation and management act, and urban planning act were combined to produce an integrated and strengthened framework of territorial planning through the establishment of the Act on Planning and Utilisation of National Territory. The Act ensures that plans and policies for the national territory are formulated and executed towards sustainable development and balanced development for higher national competitiveness, quality of life for people, and to be ecologically friendly.75 In line with the territorial approach in urban planning, many innovative policies were introduced at the national level. One of them is smart cities or digitalised cities in the form of new sustainable cities which connect energy, water and waste management, advanced transportation, green buildings, land use, and various infrastructures with artificial intelligence and ICT. Additionally, the country is also working to achieve climate smart cities by applying efficiency in connectivity, circularity and resilience of urban systems as well as sustainable job creation and green investment. However, economic development and growth-first policies remain key drivers. Territorial plans in South Korea have basically three levels: The Comprehensive National Territorial Plan (CNTP), the Province Comprehensive Plan, and the City or County Plan. Besides these principal plans, are various types of regional plans, irregular plans, and sectoral plans, which must be in harmony with the three types of principal territorial plans.76 74 Ministry of Strategy and Finance, Korea, KOREAN TAXATION, 2012 75 Jung, S.S (2015), Urban Planning, Gimungdam Publisher 76 Lim, S.

The Act of Planning and Utilisation of National Territory requires that the public hearings be held for both territorial and development planning.77 INDC report has been submitted by the government to affirm its commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Specific policies have also been developed on low carbon development, a roadmap on emissions reduction, a climate adaptation scheme and a masterplan to frame the implementation at a local level. These recognise the role and contribution of local government to the achievement of the country\u2019s climate change objectives.

Central government can develop a guidelines and framework for local government to work with. 120 Explanation of the Rating Sri Lanka is a unitary state with 9 provinces, 25 districts, and 335 local councils. It is situated close to the southern tip of the Indian Peninsula and is governed by a semi-presidential system. At the time of the 2012 Census, Sri Lanka\u2019s population was 20 million with a growth rate of 0.913 per cent; the estimated total population at June 2016 was 21.2 million.78 The 13th amendment to the Constitution devolved all powers and functions relating to local government to provincial councils.79 However, provincial councils cannot reduce existing powers of the local authorities but can assign additional powers to them. As provincial councils are mentioned as the second tier of governance, the current Constitution does not recognise local government as a sphere of governance. The Constitution was issued in 1978 before the notion of local government existed in Sri Lanka. Despite the neutral position of the Constitution, it does not implicitly or explicitly restrict the actions of local government. As a result of the ongoing reform of governance, local governments have been 78 http://www.statistics.gov.lk/ 79 http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/shrilanka/document/ actsandordinance/13th_amendment.pdf established and are regulated in statutory law of Municipal Council Ordinance, Urban Council Ordinance and Pradeshiya Sabha Act. The country has 23 municipalities, 41 urban councils and 271 Pradeshiya Sabhas. All responsibilities and powers of local governments are clearly written in the laws and in principle do not overlap with the Constitution. At the local level, the governance system is comprised of the Mayor/Chairperson, Municipal Councils, Urban Councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas (Town Councils). Among them, elections of councillors (assembly) are held periodically. Elections are sometimes curtailed, particularly in the recent past, due to political and regional instabilities, hence, the elections are not held on the same day throughout the country. Mayors and Deputy Mayors, are appointed by the political party which holds most seats in the council. The executives are appointed, as well Municipal Commissioners. Central government provides financial transfers to local government. A conditional transfer is given to cover salaries for the councillors and staff. They are predictable, have a fixed schedule, are transparent, but are limited to certain expenditure. In determining the amount of grants, criteria are applied based on specific preconditions. Central government also provides Enabling Environment Rating for Cities and Local Authorities: 29 44 SRI LANKA There is no national legislation on citizen participation, but there are locally organised spaces for dialogue and consultation Rules and legal provisions on transparency in the running of local governments requiring regular, independent audits be conducted within specified timeframes exist and are applied.

The Constitution is neutral on the question of local governments. Local governments have some latitude to determine rates for existing taxes, but the central government is responsible for setting the tax base for existing taxes, creating new taxes, and accessing loans and financial markets. All responsibilities and powers are clearly defined in accordance with the Constitution, and the relevant statutory laws and regulations are in place. There is a national framework of reference that applies to all local governments in the country defining the qualifications and responsibilities of local government staff, and a national strategy for training and promoting human resources in local governments. Local assemblies and executive bodies are elected, but not necessarily throughout the country. The transfer of resources to local governments and their distribution among local governments are clear and predictable, with utilisation determined at the national level (conditional transfers). Enabling Environment for Cities and Local Government in Asia Pacific 121 other transfers which are not predictable, which generally do not follow any transparent formula, and which can be used for purposes other than salary. In terms of local taxes, local governments have autonomy to determine rates but are limited in setting the tax base. They can decide the tax base if they have not collected any taxes which they are entitled to under the local government acts and ordinance. This condition can only be applied upon the establishment of necessary by-laws. Furthermore, power for taxation administration is devolved to the local council to determine the tax rates and levies as per the above legislation. Likewise, local councils also do not have any power to set direct and indirect taxes. Despite the limitation on taxes, local governments have the autonomy to access the financial markets such as deposits and bonds. All local councils are subject to regular government audits and periodic checks. Investigation officers attached to the office of the provincial commissioners of local government and assistant commissioners of local government are responsible for organising audits of local councils. However, the financial audits are not supported with a robust scheme and procedure, and follow up actions of audit queries often take a long time and are at times not systematically carried out. There is no other mechanism for local performance assessment, aside from financial audits. Central government provides incentives only in the form of awards made to good performing councils based on a certain standard set of criteria. This award is made at a national event to encourage and recognise good governance at local council level. While there is positive spirit for participatory development processes at the local level there is no specific national legislation for citizen participation. Some local councils apply participatory planning and budgeting processes where citizens are actively involved. To reinforce community involvement, some councils have established citizen committees such as ratepayers\u2019 associations and women\u2019s committees. The Pradeshiya Sabha has issued an act to legalise community committees and encourage community participation in the development process. Although such regulation is available, community contribution to the committees is not mandatory. Reforms such as making citizen representation compulsory in local council committees is ongoing and will be a consideration in the revision of the local government act. Despite their clear connection to climate change adaptation, city planning and human settlements have received limited attention in Sri Lanka. At the country level, a national urban strategy is being prepared by national government ministries and authorities such as the Urban Development Authority and the newly established Ministry of Megapolis and Western Province Development. Capacity to implement the strategy is yet to be defined. Furthermore, whilst an environmental protection plan has been committed to at many international treaties the role that needs to be played by the LGUs has not been adequately recognised. Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) is done by the national ministry through their provincial and local level organisations and authorities. DRR is not yet properly integrated into or implemented by the local government system. Women\u2019s participation in local governance The Local Government Elections Act No 01, provides a 25 per cent quota for women in the local council. In addition, the women can contest the elections or come from the mix list that is given on proportionate basis on the total number of seats won.

A bloodless revolution in 1932 led to the establishment of a constitutional monarchy. The country has switched between parliamentary democracy and military juntas for decades, but all governments have acknowledged a hereditary monarch as the head of state. The population in 2016 was 68.86 million, with an average urbanisation of 2.65 per cent from 2005 to 2015.80 Since the political reform of the absolute monarchy in 1932, Thailand has had 19 Constitutions and Charters. The newly drafted Constitution (passed at the national referendum in August 2016) specifies the existence of the local authority. In line with the Constitution, a number of legislations are enacted relevant to the establishment of different kinds of local authorities, human resource management, local elections, demotion of the administration, as well as plans and process for decentralisation. However, some legislative provisions are quite broad and create confusion in implementation. For instance, the overlapping mandates and roles between local governments and central government agencies without clear- 80 http://www.thaigov.go.th/ cut demarcation of power create uncertainty, particularly in local service provision. On July 10th, 2014, the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) issued an announcement to suspend the election of local administration officials whose terms of service had expired or would soon expire, and issue a new order to select and appoint the interim membership of local councils in the case of their dissolution or retain current executives and local councils. There are two types of intergovernmental transfers in Thailand: general and specific. The general transfer is made based on a formula, particularly accounted from numbers of registered citizens in local authorities. It is transparent and predictable, and has no restriction on its expenditure. However, government may have a prioritised agenda and provide additional earmarked funds. The specific grant is unpredictable. Local authorities must propose projects to the Department of Local Administration or other related departments. Those projects are generally for specific development purposes such as infrastructure development, education, and health. As there are no explicit criteria for the allocation and success of the grant allocation is uncertain, it is difficult for local authorities to plan effective budgets. Local governments can determine the rate of the existing taxes but do not have authority to initiate new taxes that are not specified by laws. Enabling Environment Rating for Cities and Local Authorities: 35 44 THAILAND National legislation on citizen participation exists and is applied. Rules and legal provisions on transparency in the running of local governments requiring regular, independent audits to be conducted within specified timeframes exist and are applied. Country\u2019s international commitments for environmental protection and promotion recognise the importance of urban areas and positive role of LGUs in implementation. There is legislation on measuring local government performance, but performance is assessed by the authority responsible for supervising local governments. A clear national urban strategy exists, but the financial and technical arrangements and capacities necessary to implement it are lacking. The Constitution makes explicit mention of local governments, but their responsibilities are defined by legislation. Local governments have some latitude to determine rates for existing taxes, but the central government is responsible for setting the tax base for existing taxes, creating new taxes, and accessing loans and financial markets. All responsibilities and powers are clearly defined in accordance with the Constitution, but some relevant statutory laws and regulations are missing. There is a national framework of reference defining the qualifications and responsibilities of local government staff, and a national strategy for training and promoting human resources in local governments; so far, this concerns only a few local governments.

First, local authorities are regularly audited on their financial and operational performances by provincial auditors of the Office of the Auditor General of Thailand (OAG). Second, the Ministry of Interior sets up specific monitoring and measures to audit local governments\u2019 expenditures. Third, the Constitution states that local authorities must disclose information and report their annual performances to the public so that citizens can take part in the local auditing process. The Department of Local Administration has carried out the Local Performance Assessment (LPA) since 2007. The LPA annually assesses the performance of all local authorities in four dimensions: management, personnel and council activities, financial management, and public services provision. Independent assessments are sometimes carried out by academia in the form of citizen satisfaction surveys, particularly for large local authorities. The roles of local governments in environmental protection and promotion have been well recognised in the 20-year National Strategic Plan (2017-2036), the 5-year National Economic and Social Development Plan (2017-2021), and the National Environmental Management Plan (2017- 2021). Areas of focus include management of solid waste, wastewater and air quality, carbon footprint reduction, and development of liveable environments. Funding and capacity support to local authorities has been made in these areas. There has also been the Master Plan for Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation (2015-2050) framing the long-term approaches for different concerned sectors, including the implementation of local governments.81 The three aforementioned national plans also concern greenhouse gas reduction, enhancing capacities for climate change adaptation, and monitoring and mitigating for natural disasters. However, implementation has been done in only a few large cities, whereas a number of smaller -towns have not participated actively. The national urban strategy in the 5-year National Economic and Social Development Plan, particularly in the section on regional, urban and economic development designated areas, has been formulated. Each province, 81 http://www4.unfccc.int/ndcregistry/PublishedDocuments/ Thailand%20First/Thailand_INDC.pdf cluster of provinces and local authority is then required to consider the national plan when preparing their local development plans. However, financial and technical arrangements and capacities to implement the plan vary according to resources and budget allocation from the central government. There is a national framework defining the qualifications and requirements of local government personnel and a local personnel development institute under the Department of Local Administration whose mandate includes enhancing the knowledge and capacities of local staff through various training programs. However, some smaller towns do not have adequate resources for personnel development in accordance with the national standards. Citizen participation is clearly stated in the Constitution and subsequent legislation. Also, according to the law, local citizens may access government information, participate in local development planning processes, participate in local performance assessments and have rights to vote in referenda, to sign up for proposing local ordinances and demotion of the executive and local council members.

Climate change adaptation is funded by multilateral agreements which have been ratified in the country. Specifically, for Community-Based Disaster Risk Management, the Ministry of Social Solidarity has produced a guideline within the Timor-Leste Disaster Risk Management Handbook to be implemented at national and local levels. The handbook has been applied by regional governments to manage disaster risk reduction. Participation by citizens in political life is stated in Section 63 and 6 of the Constitution.

Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) people throughout the world have led global efforts to raise awareness of their experience of ongoing discrimination, exclusion, and violence. Despite some gains that have made information more available, huge gaps in research and data on LGBTI experiences persist in every country, blocking progress toward inclusion and the realization of human rights for all. Clearly, significant donor investment in strategic research on LGBTI inclusion is needed, in both the immediate and the long term, to provide a reliable evidence base that can inform policies, legislation, programs, and investments to advance the human rights and inclusion of LGBTI people in national and global efforts. Identifying Research Priorities: This paper is not a specific proposal. Rather, its intention is to highlight for discussion the critical research and knowledge gaps with regard to human rights and inclusion for LGBTI people that require investments to ensure that they are part of the human rights and development agendas. In light of these significant gaps, the paper outlines a number of high-priority research needs that have been identified as a result of wide-ranging consultations with civil society organizations (CSOs), governments, research institutions, human rights and development agencies, and researchers. Data and research defining and measuring the social inclusion and exclusion of LGBTI people are at the top of the list of priorities. Global consultations led by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) about a proposed LGBTI Inclusion Index revealed widespread agreement on five high-priority dimensions of inclusion in development (from a rights-based approach): health, economic well-being, personal security and violence, education, and political and civic participation. In each of these dimensions, new data and research will be required to create an index that will track the degree of LGBTI inclusion, both cross-nationally and within individual countries, which can then be used to inform laws, policies, programs, and budgets to advance this goal. There are other related research priorities. For example, estimates of the size of the LGBTI population and accurate measures of public opinion would be invaluable in the effort to frame and evaluate the impact of investments in inclusion. Other priorities include examining the links between LGBTI inclusion and national economic development, tracking the impact of laws and practices that make LGBTI people more vulnerable, assessing the influence of prevailing gender norms, measuring the prevalence and impact of conversion therapies, and studying the impacts of mass movements of people on this community. Research on new data collection methods, as well as new survey questions about sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex characteristics (SOGIESC), would underpin the collection of all of this critical data. 3 Several themes cut across these priorities. As in all research, it will be important to take into account the multiple identities that people hold (such as race, ethnicity, religion, age, and so on). It will also be important to be able to disaggregate data to get measures for separate groups within the LGBTI umbrella term, particularly for transgender and intersex people, where there is a distinct dearth of research. Finally, research protocols and approaches will need to ensure that data collection efforts cause no harm and fully respect the rights of LGBTI people, including their privacy and dignity.

This recommendation includes short-term (12 month), medium-term (12\u201348 month), and long-term (48\u201360 month) investments to: build a research infrastructure and partnerships between governments, CSOs, academics, multilaterals and other stakeholders; mine existing data for relevant data on LGBTI inclusion; collect new data on the key priority dimensions of LGBTI inclusion; design, maintain, build, and analyze a database for the LGBTI Inclusion Index; and produce reports to support advocacy and evidence-based law, policy, program, and budgetary decisions to advance the inclusion and human rights of LGBTI people. Recommendation 3. Fund existing, new, or future research priorities identified by LGBTI civil society, whether related to local, national, regional, or global issues. Civil society has already identified and embarked on some essential projects that will need funding. Other important initiatives to fund would expand the knowledge base on under-researched groups, particularly 4 intersex people, transgender people, low-income LGBTI people, and LGBTI people in ethnic minority groups. What success looks like: If sufficient strategic investments are made in LGBTI research and data collection, knowledge about LGBTI people will increase dramatically, which will empower LGBTI people and their governments to move toward the SDG promise of inclusion and human rights for all. There will be a broad, active, and sustainable research infrastructure at the national and global level that is supported by government funding of and participation in new data and research. This research will inform and generate new programs, policies, and investments for inclusion and respect for the rights of LGBTI people. What is more, LGBTI people will be actively collaborating in the research process, and they will have the research and data that they need to advocate for social, legal, and political change. 1. Introduction In 2015, 193 United Nations member countries adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are rooted in human rights principles with the aim of fighting poverty and inequality and promoting inclusive development, \u201cleaving no one behind.\u201d Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) people have worked within their countries and globally to raise awareness about their experiences of persistent discrimination and exclusion.1 However, LGBTI people have had very little data or research about their lives to draw on to inform policies, legislation, programs, and investments to advance LGBTI inclusion and respect for their rights. Today, the need for such knowledge greatly outstrips the current supply, and countries in the Global South are particularly in need of knowledge to support human rights and human development efforts for LGBTI people. This paper proposes an investment in knowledge that will transform global action on LGBTI issues by jumpstarting a research revolution. As the SDGs heighten the focus on measurable outcomes, data on LGBTI people must catch up.2 It is time to expand beyond the historical attention to HIV, which has underpinned advocacy efforts and allowed many health-based financing mechanisms to focus research on populations particularly at risk for HIV, notably gay men, men who have sex with men (MSM), and (only recently) transgender women. An exclusive focus on HIV leaves out many other LGBTI people 1 The terms used by individuals and groups to describe their sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and sex characteristics (SOGIESC) vary across and within countries. In using LGBTI to identify the groups facing exclusion, it is acknowledged that these groups do not fully represent the range of identities found in the world. Nonetheless, this umbrella acronym is used because it captures vulnerability to similar kinds of exclusion that might be experienced by LGBTI people and by those with other identities related to SOGIESC. To avoid confusion, this acronym is used even in situations where some parts of that group might not have been represented, such as discussions of past research.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "449210be-9b5e-4e67-8586-598df3c6ffd5": {"__data__": {"id_": "449210be-9b5e-4e67-8586-598df3c6ffd5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investing-research-revolution-lgbti-inclusion", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Investing in a research revolution for LGBTI inclusion", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investing-research-revolution-lgbti-inclusion", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2ed6fdecf7428d51814bf621d6460493b9eff88c4d6e6c86152521c614c197d4"}, "2": {"node_id": "4798a675-e10d-426d-ab06-3f2677b78a53", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investing-research-revolution-lgbti-inclusion", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f3aa0678105d39bd1683ce6f22e8a750f1decf1cbf2b59ee001083ea447509db"}}, "hash": "60bd2f1058fe3df5beec5f1b25f522f772fdc38abf98904ba13d081b10063f82", "text": "2 For an analysis of how SOGIE issues fit into the SDGs, see Elizabeth Mills \u201c\u2018Leave No", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e0f46a15-9ef7-479f-9de0-15fcb46bef78": {"__data__": {"id_": "e0f46a15-9ef7-479f-9de0-15fcb46bef78", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investing-research-revolution-lgbti-inclusion", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Investing in a research revolution for LGBTI inclusion", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investing-research-revolution-lgbti-inclusion", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "285db500f86849cbea9b939bcd8400415c7142cb8372a2096400f374d51338b6"}}, "hash": "285db500f86849cbea9b939bcd8400415c7142cb8372a2096400f374d51338b6", "text": "One Behind\u2019: Gender, Sexuality and the Sustainable Development Goals,\u201d IDS Evidence Report 154 (Brighton, UK: Institute of Development Studies, 2015). 5 and the many other human rights and development challenges they face. Increasingly, bilateral and multilateral aid agencies, international foundations, and human rights organizations are prioritizing the well-being of LGBTI persons. More data and research would provide a better assessment of the lived experience of LGBTI people around the world, supporting advocacy and providing evidence on a range of fronts. Human rights organizations would have new ways to monitor the inclusion of LGBTI people and the fulfillment of government obligations and commitments in relation to international human rights standards. Governments, civil society organizations (CSOs), development agencies, and other partners need more data to understand the link between LGBTI exclusion and sustainable development and to create evidence-based laws, policies, programming, and budgeting. Moreover, LGBTI activists are seeking more data and research for advocacy to educate the world about their lives and the urgent need for change.3 Research has already been a powerful tool in LGBTI human rights and social change in some parts of the world. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and researchers on LGBTI issues have worked with and successfully encouraged governments to collect data on same-sex couples and LGBTI people in many countries in North America, Europe, and Latin America. This information has helped to counter stereotypes and morality-based arguments by showing the very real harm of exclusion for LGBTI people and for society as a whole, as well as the benefits of inclusion and respect for the rights all. Recent research has allowed civil society actors to craft new arguments and policy makers to make more informed decisions about decriminalization, nondiscrimination laws, health care, educational access, and family recognition, along with many other issues. This new information has also led to other important developments, including: \uf0b7 Research showing that LGBTI parents raise healthy children has supported successful litigation on child custody issues (Inter-American Court of Human Rights) and marriage equality (Colombia, United States). \uf0b7 A study demonstrating the economic cost of the exclusion of LGBTI people in India helped activists make new arguments to persuade policy makers of the value of inclusion. \uf0b7 Studies of the prevalence of HIV in Kenya have demonstrated the importance of focusing health care and prevention efforts on gay and bisexual men and transgender women. \uf0b7 Data on prejudice toward LGBTI people in the Caribbean documented the need for greater protection of human rights. These examples provide a glimpse of the change that might be possible on a global scale with a greater investment in data and research to inform laws, policies, programs, and budgeting. Yet in spite of its demonstrated utility, only a tiny share\u20145 percent\u2014of the limited global funding 3 This particular point was emphasized in a consultation between the authors, LGBTI organizations, and institutional partners at the Global LGBTI Human Rights Conference held in Uruguay in July 2016. See the Annex for more information. 6 for LGBTI issues currently goes to support research,4 a level that is simply not adequate to meet the growing knowledge needs and make use of the new opportunities, including in relation to the SDGs. Many new research investments could take advantage of \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d and produce immediate benefits. National and global data are currently available that are both unused and underused. Providing support to researchers and policy makers to analyze the LGBTI implications of that data in new research projects might, in some countries at least, meet some of the knowledge needs described below in Section 2. Other important goals will take longer to achieve, particularly the development of a global research infrastructure. In the context of LGBTI issues, the research infrastructure would be made up of national and global stakeholders and would include networks of researchers, LGBTI- related NGOs, government departments and ministries, parliaments, human rights and development institutions (national, bilateral, and multilateral), other funders, and universities that produce and share knowledge about LGBTI people and issues (see figure 1).5 The significant scaling up of research will require investments in many parts of the proposed infrastructure. For example, getting governments committed to and capable of collecting data on LGBTI people will require advocacy, sustained capacity building, and research strategies to create, test, and adapt methods for the most appropriate and reliable ways of asking questions on surveys about sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and sex characteristics (SOGIESC) in a range of contexts.

Section 3 presents recommendations for funding specific projects and high-priority research needs, such as the proposed LGBTI Inclusion Index of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and for building the underlying infrastructure that would create the needed research capacity. Section 4 concludes with a summary and long-term vision of what a successful global research community on LGBTI issues would look like. A discussion of methods informing this paper, including greater detail about the consultations, is in the Annex. The strategic investments outlined in this paper would ensure attention to LGBTI people in the SDGs and create an evidence base for policies and programs that would more rapidly advance the goals of LGBTI inclusion and human rights globally. To this end, all of the priorities and recommendations discussed in the next two sections share these common principles: \uf0b7 the importance of LGBTI community leadership and participation \uf0b7 the responsibility of governments to develop knowledge and data about LGBTI people and their inclusion and rights, including to inform laws, policies, programs, and budgetary priorities to advance these objectives \uf0b7 the use of ethical, safe, and respectful methodologies that are most appropriate for and effective in different contexts \uf0b7 the importance of research partnerships between governments, civil society, academia, and multilaterals institutions 8 \uf0b7 the crucial contributions of a vibrant academic community \uf0b7 the understanding that research should be relevant and useful to improving the lives of LGBTI people Building a research infrastructure will be a global public good, increasing research capacity and knowledge for all governments, interested agencies, civil society, and other stakeholders at the global, regional, and national levels. And as a shared public good, the plan outlined here provides opportunities for partnership and points to the need for collaboration across organizations in order to meet the knowledge needs for LGBTI human rights and development issues. 2. Research Priorities It is clear that large data and knowledge gaps about LGBTI people persist. These gaps are reflected in an examination of current literature reviews and reports primarily written by CSOs, research institutions, human rights organizations, and government and development agencies and informed by formal and informal consultations. This section prioritizes the topics relevant to LGBTI inclusion that have been identified as most important by CSOs and others and presents clear research priorities for donors, program countries, development partners, and the private sector to consider in the effort to promote a research revolution and create a sustainable LGBTI research infrastructure. Four cross-cutting themes emerge consistently in literature and research and should be considered in connection with each research priority: \uf0b7 Participant safety and ethical concerns.

Noting the diversity of \u201cletters\u201d within the LGBTI acronym, disaggregation into specific groups may fill in missing research and data gaps and highlight the experiences of specific groups of LGBTI people that have traditionally been ignored. Specifically, lesbian and bisexual women, transgender men and women, persons with non-binary identities, and intersex individuals are underrepresented in the bulk of existing research studies and data collection.9 \uf0b7 Alternative experiences and identities. The concepts in the LGBTI acronym may not always pertain to the diversity of experiences and identities that sexual and gender nonconforming individuals live with or adopt, for example, third gender hijras or kothis in South Asia.10 Alternative or local identities outside of the LGBTI acronym have substantial implications for data collection and measurements. In generating meaningful analysis and knowledge to guide policy, categories of identity can be developed through a participatory approach, with options to self-identify during data collection.11 Social inclusion priority dimensions Promoting the social inclusion of marginalized groups occurs through a series of actions and programs toward a targeted end. In this sense, social inclusion is both a process as well as an outcome.12 As such, inclusion offers salient entry points for analytical work on measuring the extent of LGBTI exclusion as well as establishing the indicators of a fully inclusive society. 8 CREA, \u201cCount Me In!

These dimensions will require that measures be developed that are comparable across countries in order to go into the index. 15 (See the recommendations and figure 2 in section 3). Health. Globally, data on the health equity and outcomes of LGBTI persons are sparse. However, some health institutions are building an evidence base and have already found an alarming global pattern: LGBTI persons experience poorer health outcomes than the general population and have specific vulnerabilities that are fueled by exclusion, social stigma, and discriminatory laws, policies, and practices.16 The stigma and pathologization of people with non-normative SOGIESC have even fueled targeted violence against LGBTI people, including forced sterilizations, forced abortions, and/or forced anal examinations.17 However, this evidence base needs to be bolstered with a specific focus on health issues beyond HIV, reproductive health, access to services, bias among health care providers, and other LGBTI health outcomes. In particular, research on the mental health of LGBTI people is largely absent in many countries, although data in some countries show that LGBTI people experience depression and anxiety at a higher rate in comparison to the general population, which can 13 UNDP, \u201cConcept Note, Global LGBTI Index\u201d (New York: UNDP, 2016). 14 A global index is just one of many culminations of research when regarding the dimensions listed above.

Due to a lack of data and research on the relationships between SOGIESC and poverty,20 there now exists only a limited empirical link between discrimination, violence, and a lower socioeconomic status among LGBTI individuals.21 What little research exists shows that LGBTI people are highly vulnerable to poverty,22 most likely because they are cut off from the opportunities or resources needed to build one\u2019s human and social capital, capabilities, and/or productive assets. Although a preliminary link has emerged to show a cycle of poverty for some LGBTI people, more data and analysis are needed.23 Personal security and violence. In many countries, LGBTI persons cannot safely report an act of violence or access justice following an attack, and thus the extent of SOGIESC-motivated violence is largely unknown. Although existing statistics show alarming rates of violence against LGBTI people24\u2014and in particular against transgender women25\u2014these figures are believed to be significantly underrepresenting the problem, including because of the reluctance of LGBTI people to report violence to the authorities. Education. Access to education for LGBTI persons is critical in its own right and also has direct impacts on other dimensions, including but not limited to economic empowerment. Not only do LGBTI people need to have access to education, education systems also need to meet their needs.

However, concrete research on the prevalence and extent of SOGIESC-motivated bullying, as well as its corresponding impact on individuals and society, is sparse in many contexts, particularly in college and university settings.26 When teachers, counselors, and other staff promote a culture of inclusion (perhaps by positive representation of LGBTI students in school curricula27), students are able to develop the essential skills necessary for", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1bdde919-0001-4316-b4c0-d94e1548e8e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "1bdde919-0001-4316-b4c0-d94e1548e8e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investing-research-revolution-lgbti-inclusion", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Investing in a research revolution for LGBTI inclusion", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investing-research-revolution-lgbti-inclusion", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cbb894ae9cdfb54c348663ec9a71a714c1e7ba9047c23ee531685ddb5483a54b"}, "3": {"node_id": "819fcdc4-db1d-4533-a617-5b3bf0894be9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investing-research-revolution-lgbti-inclusion", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e553be9dfd4f238a1538fca130079ddec85bea2b43cc22a01edb76a9c96d28cf"}}, "hash": "6920c04823565484743b66afd35c66ea46083a54b9a6a8c8fde55397b0fcc0d5", "text": "a fulfilled life and thus add to productive societies.28 Research can also show the effect of such inclusion programs on the prevalence of violence against LGBTI students and offer insights on how to combat it at a school-wide and government level. Political and civic participation. Although participation by LGBTI people in political bodies, state- building exercises, and intra-state conflict resolution has been observed, a systematic examination of the opportunities for LGBTI people to engage in civic and political processes is largely lacking. Indicators of participation would include being involved in decision making on legal frameworks, policies, and practices that relate directly to discrimination and also on legislation that shapes the degree to which LGBTI people are fully included in civic and political life, such as laws regarding legal recognition of identity and criminalization, the registration of NGOs, and funding restraints. In addition, analyses of elected officials, political parties, and LGBTI organizations and publications would further illuminate the degree of inclusion. This research could also directly identify the needs for capacity building within the LGBTI civil society community and effective strategies for political mobilization and change. Other high-priority needs as identified by LGBTI civil society and institutions Outside of social inclusion and the five sectors outlined above, many other important research priorities were articulated by CSOs, researchers, human rights institutions, government agencies, and development institutions. Population estimates of LGBTI persons. Public discussions and research about LGBTI issues often start with estimates of the size of the LGBTI population. One estimate of the proportion of the U.S. population who identifies as LGBT (not including intersex individuals) is 3.8 percent, with 26 UNESCO, Out in the Open, Education Sector Responses to Violence Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity/Expression (Paris: UNESCO, 2015), http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002447/244756e.pdf. 27 Ibid. 28 C.

Measures of stigma in the general population and among public officials. Public opinion and attitudes about LGBTI people and issues matter and are sometimes mentioned separately as a research priority. These attitudes can act as barometers of potential violence or discrimination.32 In this sense, research that measures attitudes toward LGBTI people may capture an important dimension of their ability (or inability) to access markets, services, or spaces. For example, measurements of antipathy among service providers can offer meaningful insights on why LGBTI people may experience barriers in accessing essential services.33 Public opinion data may also better inform LGBTI campaigns and identify weak points within a group\u2019s strategy.34 Attempts to measure attitudes in the general population should add more in-depth questions on gender identity and intersex status\u2014two largely ignored components. Relationship between rights, inclusion, and economic growth. Research can also uncover how micro-level forms of exclusion may aggregate to impact the human and economic development of the larger society.35 Specifically, research can show a relationship between human rights, inclusion, and economic growth. For example, in an analysis of 39 countries, an additional right for LGBT (not including intersex) persons in a country is associated with US$300 more in GDP per capita and a higher value in the Human Development Index.36 This research could be expanded upon to include a broader set of countries and economic outcomes to serve two purposes: first, in reaching out to more low- and high-income countries, an analysis might 29 G.

Deriving accurate estimates may be challenging if people are afraid to identify, perhaps due to stigma or insufficient trust between researchers and participants. In turn, low-end estimates may stymie appropriate policies for LGBTI people and groups.

Although laws alone will not end stigma, they often mitigate the terms by which LGBTI people may or may not engage in society. Outside of the HIV arena, few studies exist to show the link between laws and an LGBTI person\u2019s experience of discrimination and violence\u2014or even inclusion. Although anecdotal and qualitative data suggest direct impacts (particularly from the harshest and most punitive laws), quantitative and representative studies on specific impacts are rare. Research can also study the impact of positive laws designed to respect human rights and promote the participation and inclusion of LGBTI people in many sectors. In particular, research may uncover whether some laws, policies and programs actually promote inclusion, the development of human capital, and/or higher economic productivity, for example. A related research gap concerns the impact of other policies and programs on LGBTI people. Programs specific to LGBTI people and implemented by human rights or development agencies should be coupled with monitoring and evaluation (M&E) from an early stage. More general programs and policies in social, economic, justice, and other sectors should seek to monitor and evaluate the impacts on LGBTI people, including the lack of access or any other negative impact. This kind of research would provide an evidence base to inform future programming, filling the current immense M&E data gaps. Assessments can uncover the barriers LGBTI persons may face in accessing development programming, perhaps because heteronormative language or traditional notions of gender have been written into the programs. Poverty and Social Impact Analyses (PSIAs) or Policy Audits can assess anti-poverty interventions and public efforts to reduce exclusion, analyzing whether or not LGBTI people are benefiting from such programs.38 These analyses should also provide useful findings about the extent to which LGBTI inclusion/access helps bolster outcomes and development goals.39 Link to prevailing gender norms. Growing quantitative evidence shows that the more patriarchal and male-dominated a society, the more intolerant it will be toward LGBTI people.40 When hegemonic masculinity41 thrives, LGBTI people face specific vulnerabilities driven by strict 37 Ibid. 38 Hawkins and others, \u201cSexuality and Poverty Synthesis Report.\u201d 39 Consultations at the Uruguay conference indicated that, in addition to human rights\u2013based arguments, organizations are showing an increasing interest in research that highlights the link between policies and programs to actual improved outcomes, in order to appeal to decision makers who may be less convinced by the more traditional human rights approach. 40 M.

Impact of migration or forced movement. Sometimes LGBTI people have little choice but to leave their homes, moving from rural to more accepting urban areas or from an intolerant to a more tolerant country,45 or even as a result of a humanitarian crisis that displaces large segments of a population. Research can better uncover the reasons why LGBTI people leave a particular country, that is, the \u201cpush\u201d factors that may be fueled by violence and stigma. In understanding the impact on the country of origin, research can also better estimate the number of LGBTI people who are forced to leave and identify how that loss of human capital and productivity depletes larger societal goals (in other words, the possible effects of a \u201cbrain drain\u201d). Alternatively, research may also uncover \u201cpull\u201d factors from more tolerant countries and how the movement of LGBTI people may bring in human capital and boost the productivity of a host country.

Filling this \u201cmethods gap\u201d is critical to ensuring that the most appropriate and efficient ways to study LGBTI issues are utilized. There are several approaches that could also be used to address the research priorities outlined above. New research methods should also be considered within larger normative guidelines to respect the wishes, rights, and dignity of the LGBTI community.48 National-level surveys and representative individual/household surveys. Most authoritative data for national policy making and programming come from government-sponsored surveys of representative samples of a country\u2019s population, such as censuses and demographic surveys, crime victimization surveys, and poverty and welfare surveys. These surveys are considered representative because they are large, random (or \u201cprobability-based\u201d) samples of the population. Many of the research gaps outlined here will require such data to draw conclusions about the LGBTI population as a whole. This includes, for example, whether poverty and crime victimization rates are higher for LGBTI people than for the general population. But the data required to ask and answer those questions do not exist in most countries.

For a look at the many levels of vulnerability that refugees face (not necessarily motivated by SOGIESC), see the World Bank, \u201cForcibly Displaced: Toward a Development Approach Supporting Refugees, the Internally Displaced, and their Hosts,\u201d Advance Edition (Washington, DC: World Bank, 2016), https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/25016/9781464809385.pdf?sequence=2. 48 This point was emphasized in consultations with LGBTI organizations and institutional partners at the Uruguay conference. 17 discrimination against these persons in employment and health services may be between US$1.9 and US$30.8 billion.49 Mixed-methods research. Although quantitative research can uncover the scope of a problem, be used in rights-based advocacy at the UN level, and inform development programs, qualitative research can often fill in missing dimensions, specifically articulating the needs of subgroups and explaining quantitative data more clearly. A mixed-methods approach to data collection may better inform programs and policy on the national (and perhaps state or municipality) level, for example, by including questions and observations about implementation and enforcement.50 Further, mixed-methods research may also provide a better basis for creating the benchmarks needed to track progress51 across time. Using other innovative methods. Some new or rarely used methods address some of the methodological challenges of surveying representative probability samples (such as cost) and also provide meaningful information. For example, one study found that children who have non-normative sexual orientations were more vulnerable to physical as well as sexual abuse in the home compared to a control group of their heterosexual siblings.52 Other studies can unpack discrimination in formal sector employment. For example, in an experimental (or audit) study on resumes, researchers submitted several pair of almost identical resumes to 1,700 open positions, with the sole difference that one contained a marker that the applicant was LGBTI. The research demonstrated that the resume showing the LGBTI marker had a 40 percent lower chance of receiving an interview.53 Big data and data science. Big data and data analysis seek to find meaningful patterns in massive data sets that are based on online behavior rather than surveys. Big data may offer insights into population estimates, geographic dispersion, and experiences of stigma. Moreover, supporting the analysis of big data may provide new routes to circumvent barriers in traditional survey research methods.54 For example, faster computers have given researchers the ability to quickly mine very large data sets and find meaningful correlations that might 49 A.

As such, the potential of big data for LGBTI issues may be extraordinary, although few partnerships seem to currently exist between data scientists and LGBTI advocates. Big data is also a space in which the private sector is heavily engaged and thus has an important role to play in related partnerships. Social media platforms and mobile apps, for example, already have millions of users with significant user-generated input. Partnerships that promote sharing and analyzing those data can yield a rich analysis that might otherwise be underestimated, such as better estimates of HIV-positive individuals or educational outcomes, to cite just two examples. This analysis can be used in targeted campaigns to fulfill the SDGs, such as Goal 3 (healthy lives) or Goal 4 (inclusive education).

Strategic Investments to Jumpstart the Revolution The high-priority research needs outlined in section 2 would support the work of national governments to advance inclusion and respect for the rights of LGBTI people in the SDGs, and such projects would also have value for other national and global stakeholders. To generate that high-priority data and knowledge, three complementary investment strategies are needed: the first builds the research infrastructure to meet the knowledge needs, the second is the LGBTI Inclusion Index, and the third targets research on additional specific priorities identified by LGBTI civil society. Recommendation 1: Invest in capacities and partnerships between governments, LGBTI civil society groups, academics, multilateral institutions, the private sector, and other stakeholders to create an infrastructure for LGBTI data collection and research. To meet the significant challenge of addressing the momentous data and research needs for the SDGs and LGBTI Inclusion Index, a global research infrastructure will need to be created. This research infrastructure will be made up of the resources and activities necessary to produce knowledge about LGBTI people and would include representatives from government, civil society, human rights and development institutions, other funders of research, and academia (see figure 1 above). The infrastructure would necessarily be decentralized, given the wide range of local contexts in which LGBTI people live and with which researchers must contend. As was learned from the research infrastructure built up during the HIV/AIDS epidemic, an LGBTI research infrastructure will need to be adaptable and flexible so that over time, new research technologies, new research areas, and new funding opportunities can be incorporated, early research questions can be elaborated on, current and future needs can be addressed, and relevant and useful findings can be produced and disseminated.55 Building a research infrastructure on LGBTI people and issues means investing in five general components: (a) Invest in strategic networks in countries and regions to develop instruments and methodologies for survey and administrative data collection and to lead educational efforts with governments. High-quality data on LGBTI people will be essential for meeting the needs of the SDGs and the LGBTI Inclusion Index, as well as for other research. Particular countries or regions might be ripe for relatively quick wins in adding SOGIESC questions to national surveys. Well-funded national or regional networks of researchers could work on the development of sampling methods and survey questions that can be used to study LGBTI people in those countries or regions. Acting as an expert panel, those researchers can then educate and persuade government statistical agencies to add those questions to current surveys or to undertake LGBTI-specific surveys. For 55 For an analysis of the HIV infrastructure, see D. Ribes and J. Polk, \u201cOrganizing for Ontological Change: The Kernel of an AIDS Research Infrastructure,\u201d Social Studies of Science 45, no. 2 (2015): 214\u201341. 20 example, networks of researchers and activists in the United States deployed an effective theory of change built on the observation that government statistical agencies are influenced both by the scientific community and the political climate; as a result, new research plus educational efforts were successful in getting U.S. surveys to add sexual orientation and gender identity questions.56 A second example of expanding data comes from gender equality advocates\u2019 efforts to add a module on domestic violence against women to the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), to estimate the prevalence of domestic violence within and across countries.57 That module was first added in 1998 and is now included in 91 surveys. (b) Invest directly in government capacity on LGBTI inclusion and human rights by supporting government research and data collection on LGBTI issues. Donors could enhance a country\u2019s ability to promote the inclusion and human rights of LGBTI people by investing in government research and data collection capacity. For example, a donor could: invest in building the capacities of national statistical", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "816a2715-e435-4760-b62e-c1df4c95dd4f": {"__data__": {"id_": "816a2715-e435-4760-b62e-c1df4c95dd4f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investing-research-revolution-lgbti-inclusion", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Investing in a research revolution for LGBTI inclusion", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/investing
