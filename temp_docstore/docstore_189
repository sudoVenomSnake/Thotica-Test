The current policies scenario is estimated to reduce global GHG emissions in 2030 to about 55 GtCO2e (52\u201358), which is 9 GtCO2e lower than in the year 2010 policies scenario. It is also 4 GtCO2e lower than the median estimate of the current policies scenario of the 2020 UNEP Emissions Gap Report. The implementation gap, which is the difference between emissions expected under the current policies scenario and those needed to achieve the NDCs and announced reduction pledges, is estimated to be 3 GtCO2e and 5 GtCO2e for the unconditional and conditional NDCs and pledge scenarios respectively. Figure 4.2 illustrates the emissions gap in 2030, highlighting that while the new and updated NDCs together with announced mitigation pledges narrow the gap slightly compared to previous NDCs, they are highly insufficient to bridge the gap. They take only 7.5 per cent off projected 2030 emissions, compared to earlier unconditional NDCs, whereas 30 per cent is needed for 2\u00b0C and 55 per cent is needed for 1.5\u00b0C. Figure 4.2 shows that full implementation of unconditional NDCs and announced reduction pledges is estimated to result in a gap to a 1.5\u00b0C pathway of 28 GtCO2e (range: 25\u201330). This is about 4 GtCO2e lower than the gap assessed in the 2020 report (United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] 2020), due to the updated NDCs and announced reduction pledges. If the conditional NDCs and announced reduction pledges are also fully implemented, the emissions gap is further reduced by about 3 GtCO2e. The emissions gap between unconditional NDCs and announced reduction pledges and below 2\u00b0C pathways is about 13 GtCO2e (range: 10\u201316 GtCO2e), which is about 2 GtCO2e lower than last year. While NDC and announced mitigation pledges reduce global emissions by about 4 GtCO2e compared with previous NDCs, the updated 2\u00b0C scenario estimate for 2030 is about 2 GtCO2e lower than in previous Emissions Gap Reports (section 4.2.3), which means that the gap is only reduced by about 2 GtCO2e. 35 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On Figure 4.2.

Geophysical uncertainties in the climate response are reflected by the estimates for different warming percentiles (50 per cent, 66 per cent and 90 per cent). warming is kept to 2.5\u00b0C (range: 2.0\u20132.9\u00b0C) by the end of the century and a 90 per cent chance that it is kept to 3.3\u00b0C (range: 2.7\u20133.9\u00b0C).

Finally, these estimated improvements from net-zero targets should also be caveated by the fact that in many cases, current NDCs do not yet set countries\u2019 emissions on a direct path towards reaching longer-term net-zero targets (see chapter 3). 37 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On Figure 4.3.

Box 4.1. Estimating global warming implications of NDCs A variety of methods exist to extend near-term emissions until the end of the century (G\u00fctschow et al. 2018). We first estimate the global carbon price implied by the NDC emissions reductions in 2030 from a no-policies baseline. Here, we use the marker quantification of the second Shared Socioeconomic Pathway, called SSP2, which assumes a continuation of historical socioeconomic dynamics (Fricko et al. 2017; Riahi et al. 2017), to estimate the relationship between emission reductions and implied carbon prices in 2030. Subsequently, the carbon price implied by the global NDC reductions (e.g.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b7b629ed-b64d-430d-8ab9-909dc11cf621": {"__data__": {"id_": "b7b629ed-b64d-430d-8ab9-909dc11cf621", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "818f45c86d02464d6e19070e00fe2d3f84d811b4360c248be8de910b4f66603f"}, "2": {"node_id": "93672c2d-0512-45f4-aed2-8d1c9161efa6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "83725d0e4ae31e4974f586f12d8af9090cd93eef9776d904ac17911a00e0fe4d"}}, "hash": "618c8e54e1612ef16fe1505e588b49505c55c352c2008d780c1d45ca86a81540", "text": "Subsequently, the carbon price implied by the global NDC reductions (e.g. globally about US$202010 in 2030 for unconditional NDCs) is extended out until the end of the century by applying the same annual growth rate as for projected global gross domestic product (GDP) under SSP2. Based on the relationship between implied carbon prices and global GHG emissions levels over the course of the century, an emissions trajectory is estimated and divided into its constituting gases (Lamboll et al. 2020). Subsequently, the global warming outcome of each pathway is assessed with the reduced-complexity carbon- cycle and climate model MAGICC (Meinshausen et al. 2011) in a set up that captures the uncertainties in radiative forcing as well as climate and carbon-cycle response (Nicholls et al. 2021) as assessed in cross-chapter box 7.1 of the IPCC AR6 (Forster et al. 2021). Countries\u2019 net-zero targets, described and assessed in chapter 3, further bring down emissions projections over the course of this century (H\u00f6hne et al. 2021). The impact of this strengthening of climate action after 2030 is also estimated. This approach is an update compared to previous reports, both in terms of the method used to extend emissions to 2100 and the climate model set up used. If the NDC estimates of this report are assessed using last year\u2019s methods, the temperature projections for unconditional NDCs would be about 0.2\u00b0C higher than this year\u2019s estimates. 38 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On Are COVID-19 fiscal recovery measures bridging or extending the emissions gap?

Academic evidence and political narratives support this approach (Barbier 2020; O\u2019Callaghan and Murdock 2021). Countries that fail to capitalize on this opportunity for low-carbon and climate-resilient economic transformation risk their economic prosperity, environmental sustainability and long-term social cohesion. Despite this, most governments have so far failed to prioritize a transformative low-carbon recovery, with the relatively insignificant low-carbon investment announced to date likely to maintain current unsustainable situations.1 As at May 2021, only 2.5\u201312.1 per cent of US$16.7 trillion in total COVID-19 spending (excluding unallocated European Union spending) has been low-carbon or had mitigation co-benefits, while of a total US$2.25 trillion in announced COVID-19 \u2018recovery\u2019 spending,2 only 17\u201319 per cent has gone towards low-carbon spending, representing an insufficient commitment to align fiscal policies with the Paris Agreement (Andrijevic et al. 2020; O'Callaghan et al. 2021; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] 2021; Vivid Economics 2021). A small number of wealthy economies account for the overwhelming majority of low-carbon spending,3 with emerging market 1 Low-carbon investment is defined in this chapter as spending that is likely to reduce net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. 2 Fiscal \u2018recovery\u2019 initiatives are defined in this chapter as taxation or expenditure measures that aim to reinvigorate economic growth. Recovery initiatives are distinct from \u2018rescue\u2019 initiatives, which act over the short term and aim to keep businesses and people alive in the face of immediate crisis. 3 China, France, Germany, the Republic of Korea, Spain and the United Kingdom together account for 77.4 per cent of total low-carbon spending (O\u2019Callaghan, Bird and Murdock 2021a). 4 Hard-to-abate sectors are those in which low-carbon means of production are significantly more expensive or lacking in scalability than traditional means of production. Many of these sectors will require significant technological innovation to enable economically competitive GHG abatement without productivity loss. and developing economies in danger of being left behind. Although low-carbon recovery funds have supported a range of initiatives, they have so far been skewed towards clean energy and natural capital investments. This chapter explores three questions: 1. How could COVID-19-related public spending bridge the emissions gap? Section 5.2 summarizes key principles for low-carbon public spending in response to the pandemic. The section considers: (i) short-term rescue spending, to keep businesses and people alive; (ii) longer-term recovery investment, to reinvigorate the economy; and (iii) reinforcement processes, to embed new economic trajectories from recovery investment into long-term development plans. Targeted low-carbon rescue spending incentivizes the decarbonization of hard-to-abate sectors4 by including low- carbon conditionalities or commitments in liquidity and other short-term business support and/or by sustaining the industries likely to foster low-carbon economic growth (Barbier 2020). Low-carbon recovery investment accelerates the low-carbon transition both directly and indirectly by incorporating low-carbon incentives into traditional investment. Low-carbon reinforcement initiatives build long-term support for the projects and sectors targeted by low-carbon recovery investment, aligning long-term development pathways with a low-carbon and climate- resilient transformation of the economy. At every stage, low-carbon spending and regulatory reforms should be 39 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On considered in tandem, as successful implementation of the latter can amplify the impact of the former. 2.

This section discusses trends in fiscal response towards recovery investment before asking why a low-carbon recovery should be pursued and what it should incorporate. In the early stages of the pandemic, fiscal packages focused overwhelmingly on \u2018rescue\u2019 through the immediate protection of lives, livelihoods and business continuity. As death rates have gradually been controlled in many advanced economies, packages have slowly shifted to incorporate funds for reinvigorating the economy through \u2018recovery spending\u2019 (figure 5.1). However, recovery efforts continue to be inhibited by persistent COVID-19 outbreaks in many countries, particularly emerging market and developing economies (International Monetary Fund [IMF] 2020).

(2021) 40 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On Opportunities for rescue spending: Low-carbon rescue spending can ease industrial decarbonization, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors, through including green incentives in business liquidity support and other short-term support mechanisms (e.g. reduced taxation) and/or by directing support to industries likely to foster green growth (International Renewable Energy Agency [IRENA] 2020).6 These programmes should empower businesses to make cost-efficient choices to transition to carbon neutrality without compromising jobs and livelihoods. Opportunities for recovery spending: Growing evidence suggests that low-carbon investment can deliver stronger economic returns than conventional stimulus, while strengthening climate mitigation, adaptation, air pollution reduction, natural capital protection,7 health outcomes, inequality reduction, human mobility and broad social progress and prosperity.8 Carbon-intensive recovery packages that grow fossil fuel industries without conditions for a sustainable transition endanger economic returns as fossil fuel assets become devalued with reduced demand for their outputs (Mercure et al. 2018; Ansari and Holz 2020; van der Ploeg and Rezai 2020). An expert survey in Hepburn et al. (2020) identified traditional transport and energy infrastructure investment as the most harmful recovery policies for long-term GHG emissions, although this analysis did not consider armed forces infrastructure spending, which is also harmful compared with others (O\u2019Callaghan, Murdock and Yau 2021). Some of the most attractive recovery measures for reducing emissions \u2013 those which balance the potential to spur economic growth in a contractionary environment and the potential to mitigate emissions \u2013 include electric vehicle incentives and public transport modernization, clean energy infrastructure investments, energy efficiency upgrades, natural capital investments and clean research and development programmes (Barbier 2020; Garrett- Peltier 2017; United Kingdom, Climate Change Committee 6 Publicly-financed liquidity support and other short-term business support help businesses meet their immediate costs and continue operations, without the threat of expeditious liquidation. Low-carbon conditionalities may require businesses to take environmental commitments as a condition of receiving public funds (or having a lower temporary tax or expense load). Since these measures incentivize innovation, they may increase the economic impact of taxpayer spending while also delivering environmental and social benefits (O\u2019Callaghan and Hepburn 2020). 7 Natural capital refers to ecosystems, biodiverse habitats, clean water and air, productive soils and a stable and resilient climate. 8 Hepburn et al. (2020), OECD (2020a), Georgieva (2021), O\u2019Callaghan and Murdock (2021) and United Nations Economic Commission for Africa [UNECA] (2021), among others, expand on existing evidence to support economic, environmental and social narratives for low-carbon public investment. 9 See International Energy Agency [IEA] (2020); Malliet et al.

Opportunities for reinforcement spending: The role of low-carbon reinforcement measures following recovery remains largely undiscussed in academic and professional literature. However, as COVID-19 spending becomes integrated intro regulatory budgetary processes, it becomes increasingly less distinguishable from normal \u2018peacetime\u2019 spending. Going forward, sustainability-proofing the entire budgetary process and increasing policy coherence across sectors and levels will be crucial to maximize the impact of a low-carbon recovery. This could be achieved through implementing green budget tagging processes (Eltokhy et al. forthcoming) or applying more advanced green public financial management frameworks. Non-governmental and academic advisers collectively propose at least seven key principles for designing a low- carbon fiscal response to the pandemic, as summarized in figure 5.2. Consensus opinion suggests that policy design should be consultative, evidence-based and gender-sensitive, while ensuring prompt implementation that is considerate of pandemic realities. Importantly, fiscal action represents only one of several mechanisms available to advance climate action and stimulate economic growth following COVID-19. Regulatory and market interventions, among others, can play a key role.10 Fiscal measures are also likely to prove most effective when combined with appropriate regulatory and market interventions (OECD 2020b). 41 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On Figure 5.2.

To support accountability and transparency, low-carbon recovery investment of all kinds should include appropriate management structures for monitoring, reporting and verifying the effective implementation and use of recovery funds (Agrawala et al. 2020), as well as designated funds and standards for ex-post impact assessment. Such measures may also improve understanding of the relative strengths of low-carbon fiscal investment over alternatives.11 Oversight tools, such as the \u2018do no significant harm\u2019 principle included in the European Union\u2019s Recovery and Resilience Facility regulation, can counter measures that endanger environmental objectives (European Commission 2021). 5.3 What are the characteristics of fiscal rescue and recovery spending to date and how may they impact the emissions gap? This section provides a high-level assessment of the characteristics of global COVID-19 rescue and recovery spending so far with respect to mitigation. Across countries and data sources, several primary themes have emerged: 1) Only 2.5 per cent of US$16.7 trillion in total COVID-19 fiscal spending (excluding unallocated European Union spending) has been low-carbon, with only 17\u201319 per cent of a total US$2.25 trillion in announced COVID-19 recovery spending likely to reduce GHG emissions (O\u2019Callaghan et al. 2021).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6a912e7c-94c9-4461-aaf4-06f65b1d5a45": {"__data__": {"id_": "6a912e7c-94c9-4461-aaf4-06f65b1d5a45", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f46247a94613ec176cc3abea1e12a63f91bea8f63c21102428b0c5f2bb12ca1"}, "2": {"node_id": "d9bef400-68be-4081-b7ee-6a5f532ce288", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7665842503eb2c592a021f7464072d3486d1d725d36b90ba20f304f4984c5783"}}, "hash": "b01cf69204e13f05774fa9098b5ef98c38a604629c25febe56e021aa5f42027a", "text": "2021). Seven countries account for almost 90 per cent of this spending: China, France, Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Spain and the United Kingdom (figure 5.3). The percentage of recovery spending that is low carbon has slowly increased since Emissions Gap Report 2020 (UNEP 2020), perhaps driven in part by a better understanding of the potential for low-carbon investments to deliver strong economic, environmental and social returns. High-carbon, neutral and unclear spending (87.9\u201397.5 per cent of total spending) either worsens or maintains the unsustainable status quo of the current global emissions trajectory (O\u2019Callaghan et al.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c32e5b4-3765-4900-b83c-7c3f6a8d73e3": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c32e5b4-3765-4900-b83c-7c3f6a8d73e3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "afe31737e30829371d93d8458b4e33aa47d49c9f9e2ece600926288308072237"}, "3": {"node_id": "4ff86421-1a85-47f9-9a70-ae7045e4b18f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3d70caec159bb43ca5ec2636c99379a79a6b775a0b6e624e0d34c6542d35b069"}}, "hash": "462f01f4135813b0f1b59c8341af52ac4b8df6be261fbe69857cab5334b70816", "text": "2021; OECD 2021; Vivid Economics 2021). 42 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On Figure 5.3.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Climate Action Tracker (CAT) have discontinued their trackers since the release of the 2020 Emissions Gap Report. The Greenness of Stimulus Index from Vivid Economics has changed its methodology, such that it no longer directly assesses policy-level climate impacts. Instead, the Greenness of Stimulus Index assigns a \u2018greenness value\u2019 (positive or negative) to each sector of every tracked country, with the final index for each country being an average of sectoral impact. As this methodology is not comparable with other trackers, Vivid Economics advised excluding the Greenness of Stimulus Index information from the figure. The IEA\u2019s Sustainable Recovery Tracker and the Energy Policy Tracker only cover energy spending and are therefore excluded from this analysis. Many discrepancies between the included trackers relate to key differences in methodology: for instance, the Green Recovery Tracker (E3G undated) does not include certain types of rescue spending, while the Global Recovery Observatory (O\u2019Callaghan et al. 2021) accounts for all fiscal measures. Trackers also vary in their definitions of \u2018low-carbon\u2019: one measure may receive a low-carbon tag by one tracker and a neutral tag by another, resulting in substantial differences in spending recorded in either category. A comparison of trackers and their methodologies can be found in appendix B4. 43 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On 2) Low-carbon fiscal investment has covered a wide range of policy types. Over 500 low-carbon rescue and recovery measures have been introduced worldwide, covering most emerging and established low-carbon industries (figure 5.4). The range of spending has been notably wider in advanced economies, with emerging market and developing economies focusing their low-carbon recovery funds on clean energy generation and natural capital investments. Spending on worker retraining initiatives remains low across countries, indicating an insufficient focus on long-term human capital development. A minor portion of investment in what have traditionally been considered \u2018neutral sectors\u2019 include accompanying low-carbon incentives (appendix B.2 lists a few examples of this type of investment). 13 Leaders\u2019 are classified as having spent above 1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) on fiscal recovery and above 30 per cent of this on low- carbon measures (O\u2019Callaghan and Murdock 2020).

Source: O\u2019Callaghan et al. (2021) As chapter 2 shows, global emissions dropped in 2020, but are expected to bounce back in 2021. Studies on the impact of announced fiscal investment on global emissions suggest that decisions made so far will maintain the unsustainable trajectory of pre-pandemic economies (Forster et al. 2020; Malliet et al. 2020; Meles et al. 2020; Pollitt et al. 2020; IEA 2021; Shan et al. 2021). In line with the 2020 Emissions Gap Report, the studies suggest that a more carbon-intensive recovery would increase emissions substantially in the medium to long term, while a low-carbon recovery would significantly reduce emissions (see also appendix B.3). 5.4 Do lower-income nations face greater barriers for low-carbon recovery spending? If so, what can be done? This section describes the disproportionately negative impacts of COVID-19 on vulnerable nations. It then discusses the need for significantly increased international aid to simultaneously support economic recovery, long-term economic development and climate priorities. 44 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On 5.4.1 Vulnerable nations are being left behind The COVID-19 crisis has had an especially negative impact on vulnerable nations: global extreme poverty rose in 2020 for the first time in over 20 years, with an estimated 120 million additional people estimated to be living in poverty due to the pandemic (World Bank 2021a). Foreign direct investment fell by 8 per cent in developing countries in 2020 compared with 14 Foreign direct investment refers to cross-border investment where an investor establishes lasting financial interest in and influence over an enterprise domiciled in another economy. 15 Although many advanced countries have announced dramatic increases in expenditure at near- or below-zero financing costs (Blanchard 2019), the same is not true of most emerging market and developing economies. Severe pandemic-induced economic contractions in most emerging market and developing economies have caused a dramatic rise in debt-to-GDP ratios (IMF 2021b), temporarily increased credit default insurance premiums as measured by credit default swap spreads (Council on Foreign Relations [CFR] 2021) and reduced current account balances (World Bank 2021b), leaving emerging market and developing economies in the Latin America and the Caribbean, and Europe, the Middle East and Africa regions with historically low credit risk ratings (S&P 2021a; S&P 2021b). Across both advanced economies and emerging market and developing economies, climate change is likely to expose some forms of debt to even more risk, particularly debt to finance climate-exposed investments such as agriculture (Dibley, Wetzer and Hepburn 2021; European Central Bank 2021). 2019, driven by a 15.6 per cent decline in Africa and a 45.4 per cent decline in Latin America and the Caribbean (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD] 2021).14 Despite these trends, COVID-19 spending has been far lower in low-income economies (~US$60 per person) than advanced economies (~US$11,800 per person; see figure 5.5). Figure 5.5. COVID-19-related spending per capita across development categories (US$) Advanced economies US$11,826 per person Emerging market and developing economies US$578 per person Low-income economies US$57 per person Source: O\u2019Callaghan et al. (2021) Unequal access to finance is a key driver of disparities in COVID-19 spending between high- and low-income nations (O\u2019Callaghan and Murdock 2021).15 In 2020, development partners committed US$89.5 billion to support African nations in response to COVID-19, of which US$59.5 billion has been disbursed (figure 5.6). This represents just 0.4 per cent of total global COVID-19 spending. Without a substantial increase in foreign aid, the difference in spending between advanced economies and emerging market and developing economies will exacerbate gaps in development, while also restricting progress against climate change. Emerging market and developing economies are also likely to become the world\u2019s top GHG emitters if climate finance does not significantly increase (World Resources Institute undated), all while disproportionately suffering the burden of climate change, which has historically been caused by high-income economies (see IMF 2021a). 45 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On Figure 5.6.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "accc57d1-b218-46ac-af2c-8228b3eeeddc": {"__data__": {"id_": "accc57d1-b218-46ac-af2c-8228b3eeeddc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eefcfdaaa796fd09a0d495442511ae0811dbe71f5190b5be82cc603f6bec24b5"}, "2": {"node_id": "3aa0fe5c-aa74-4f40-a7e8-cd3fd2d4561f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7cee803e7bf0b736238aa756035c15f1719db2d3136338ed1d44d62b7b6f4d7d"}}, "hash": "dd4a81944205246191b9dd3abc3eaed9073da1f55b7e904ffe262174a0d8709f", "text": "45 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On Figure 5.6.

These instruments offer a vehicle for generating low-carbon recovery investment in sectors that facilitate the transition to low- carbon growth. 5.4.2 How to support vulnerable nations As in advanced economies, low-carbon investment in emerging market and developing economies has the potential to shorten the duration of COVID-19 impacts, address climate concerns and set strong long-term development pathways. Natural resource endowments in many low-income nations make investments in renewable energy generation facilities and natural capital solutions particularly attractive (Kim 2020). By prioritizing local supply chains, long-term partnerships between emerging market and developing economies and high-income economies can enable sustainable growth and build future-proof infrastructure. Wealthier economies could support vulnerable nations in several ways: \u25cf Debt forgiveness Based on IMF and World Bank debt sustainability analysis, debt treatments, including debt write-offs, must be considered for vulnerable countries. Debt relief programmes, including debt-for-climate swaps, could help support low- carbon recovery and a transition to low-carbon growth.16 A haircut of 10 per cent in debt repayments could result in savings of US$100 billion for reinvestment in low-carbon recoveries (Jensen 2021). Debt restructuring, including private debt, through new bond issuances aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement could help avert a \u2018lost decade\u2019 and provide fiscal resources for investment in a low-carbon recovery (Volz et al. 2021). \u25cf Direct grants and concessional finance New low-carbon and climate-resilient recovery investments can improve inclusion while advancing progress on the SDGs. Advanced economies can accelerate this by providing resources commensurate with the scale of the required transformation, i.e. significantly more than the commitments agreed at the sixteenth United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP16) of US$100 billion per year 46 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On (United Nations 2010). Disjointed interventions may widen further divergence. \u25cf Concessional finance for green and blue bonds The proceeds of green and blue bond issuances respectively finance environmentally-friendly projects and ocean conservation projects, often unlocking new finance to advance climate goals (Banga 2018; World Bank 2008). Green and blue debt markets are growing in emerging market and developing economies, yet several challenges remain, including only a small pricing benefit of green and blue bonds over regular bonds (Doran and Tanner 2019; Otek Ntsama et al. 2021).17 Foreign monetary authorities and governments could commit to purchasing green and blue bonds at lower interest rates in emerging market and developing economies (Liaw 2020). Robust, standardized and stringent certification and monitoring systems could provide greater credibility for such issuances. \u25cf Guaranteeing private sector debt The impact of public investment in climate resilience and mitigation can be significantly improved by \u2018crowding-in\u2019 additional private sector resources. Blended finance and partial guarantees have a key role in supporting this for emerging market and developing economies, particularly following the pandemic-induced crash in international project finance and other forms of foreign direct investment (UNCTAD 2021). \u25cf Redistributing multilateral finance to vulnerable nations The proposed IMF issuance of US$650 billion in new special drawing rights could strongly support a low-carbon recovery if funds are directed to future-oriented low-carbon and climate-resilient investments. On-lending a substantial amount of such funds to the world\u2019s most vulnerable countries could significantly enhance the issuance. Without such an action, only 3.2 per cent of the issuance will be directed to low-income countries (The Economist 2021). While the current IMF call for US$100 billion to be on-lent is positive, it remains insufficient given the extreme disparity in fiscal space between advanced and vulnerable economies. Appendix B5 compares alternative approaches that could be implemented. 17 For example, Egypt\u2019s October 2020 issuance of a US$750 million green bond was broadly price aligned to its normal standard bond issuances (London Stock Exchange 2020). 18 Carbon border adjustment mechanisms act to \u201cequalise the price of carbon between domestic products and imports\u201d to eliminate financial incentives to relocate production outside of regions with strong climate controls (European Commission undated). 19 Emerging tools, such as the sustainable development and climate action green recovery screening tool (SCREEN, of the NewClimate Institute) can assist in identifying high-potential opportunities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "315a38de-6abb-4c91-aa00-03ae7e9f5d27": {"__data__": {"id_": "315a38de-6abb-4c91-aa00-03ae7e9f5d27", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "953c30c9a87a7d85663a4400085cd0bf3b9db4228749b1e62e1d6efeff203692"}, "2": {"node_id": "eb855ca4-646f-48b4-947a-71c46f42ab73", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fee45b96922911ae1b734a6ce0342fd69eedaecc4f89e8571f50b248e00677bf"}}, "hash": "cf04d3a31ed12825961307cac2622c0609dc824d0a21d08bfdf4912ab212ce7a", "text": "\u25cf Considerations for carbon border adjustment mechanisms18 Carbon border adjustment mechanisms, such as those proposed by the European Union, could provide highly effective trade-based regulations to drive down emissions and reward sustainable supply chains.

Support for low-carbon recovery in emerging market and developing economies often relies directly on the nation\u2019s demonstrated interest to pursue public policy reforms that are consistent with the Paris Agreement goals, such as, for example, consideration of and action on carbon pricing, fossil fuel subsidies reform, green budgeting systems and regulations for financial sector greening.19 47 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On The role of anthropogenic methane emissions in bridging the emissions gap Lead authors: Drew Shindell (Duke University, USA), Marielle Saunois (Universit\u00e9 de Versailles Saint-Quentin [UVSQ], Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l'Environnement [LSCE], France) Contributing authors: Dominik Brunner (Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology [EMPA], Switzerland), Lena H\u00f6glund- Isaksson (International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis [IIASA], Austria), Kevin Karl (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [FAO], Italy), Euan Nisbet (Royal Holloway, University of London, UK), Stefan Schwietzke (Environmental Defense Fund [EDF], USA), Francesco Tubiello (FAO, Italy) 6 6.1 Introduction Methane emissions are the second largest contributor to global warming to date after carbon dioxide (CO2), accounting for about one third of the warming impact of all well-mixed greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and 45 per cent of the net warming impact of all anthropogenic activities in 2019 (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC] 2021). Along with black carbon, tropospheric ozone and some hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), methane is a short-lived climate pollutant (SLCP), a class that has much greater warming impacts per ton than CO2, but a much shorter atmospheric residence time. Methane accounts for more than half of the warming of all SLCPs. Atmospheric observations show that emission growth rates have accelerated over the past 15 years, with methane atmospheric concentrations reaching 1,879 parts per billion in 2020 on annual average, which was 6 per cent higher than in 2000 (Dlugokencky undated) and 260 per cent higher than during pre-industrial times (World Meteorological Organization [WMO] 2020). Anthropogenic emissions account for roughly 60 per cent of total methane fluxes to the atmosphere, amounting to around 365\u00b130 megatons of methane (MtCH4)/year. Approximately 35 per cent come from fossil fuels (two thirds from oil and gas and one third from coal), 40 per cent from agriculture (three quarters from enteric fermentation and manure management and one quarter from rice) and 20 per cent from waste (mostly landfills and solid waste), with the remaining ~5 per cent emitted through biofuel and biomass burning (Saunois et al. 2020). The remaining roughly 40 per cent of total methane emissions are generated by several natural sources: inland freshwaters (including wetlands, lakes, reservoirs and rivers), geological releases, wild animals, termites and permafrost. Sectoral partitioning of methane emissions varies greatly among countries/regions and large uncertainties remain in both anthropogenic and natural emissions (figure 6.1). Over the last two decades, the main cause of increasing atmospheric methane is likely increasing anthropogenic emissions, with hotspot contributions from agriculture and waste in South and South-East Asia, South America and Africa, and from fossil fuels in China, the Russian Federation and the United States of America (Jackson et al. 2020). Emissions from natural sources may also be increasing, as wetlands warm, tropical rainfall increases and permafrost thaws. The size of methane sinks (mainly oxidation in the atmosphere), and how this varies over time, remain difficult to predict and study. Unlike CO2, little attention has been given to capturing methane from the air, and further assessment of the feasibility of methane removal is therefore required (Jackson et al. 2019).

Black dots show the average for each approach (based on Saunois et al. 2020 data sets). The colours in the map indicate regions only. 6.2 Optimizing methane emission reductions The level of methane emissions (and other short-lived substances) at the time of reaching net zero for long-lived GHGs will play an important role in determining the level at which temperatures stabilize. Methane stabilization at a level greater than the pre-industrial level will mean a long- term commitment to warming relative to the pre-industrial level, whereas changes in methane emissions will contribute further to future temperature changes. As a GHG that does not accumulate semi-permanently in the atmosphere, achieving net-zero methane emissions is not required for climate stabilization, nor is it expected, in marked contrast to the sum of CO2 and nitrous oxide (N2O), for which net-zero emissions are required for stabilization (Rogelj et al. 2018; see also chapter 3). Methane abatement would affect warming rates in the near term, resulting in benefits for ecosystems and the ability of humans to adapt. As a precursor of tropospheric ozone,1 which can be toxic to both humans and plants, methane emissions affect public health and crop yields via air pollution. Defining the optimal path for methane emission reductions is therefore arguably more suited to a multiple- benefits analysis than other GHGs, rather than an analysis 49 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On only defined by a climate metric (though other GHGs may also have co-benefits that affect air pollution and health). Captured methane has a clear use and market value as natural gas. As a result, many methane reduction measures have low or even negative costs, with many models examining least-cost pathways to meet low warming targets reducing methane sharply in the current decade (Harmsen et al. 2019a; UNEP and CCAC 2021), though such reductions are not yet occurring. Depending on progress in mitigating emissions of long-lived GHGs, rapid reductions of methane are also likely to play a role in limiting peak warming (chapter 3). That role depends heavily on how quickly emissions of CO2 are reduced, how much CO2 removal is deployed, and on the emissions trajectories of other short-lived climate forcers. 6.3 Short- and long-term mitigation potentials The UNEP and CCAC Global Methane Assessment assessed the methane mitigation potential and cost estimates produced by several teams. This assessment included sector-specific assumptions about technology turnover times, estimates for improvements in technology over time and the achievable pace of regulations.

Methane emissions from this sector could be reduced by approximately 75 Mt/year (~2.2 gigatons of CO2 equivalent (GtCO2e)/year using global warming potential over 100 years \u2013 GWP100) in the short- term (2030) using methane-specific emission abatement measures relative to ~130 Mt/year in projected 2030 business-as-usual (BAU) emissions. Within the sector, oil and gas has a substantially larger reduction potential than coal in two of the analyses and roughly equal potential in the third analysis. Based on the Global Methane Assessment, all-cost oil and gas emission mitigation potential is 25\u201358 Mt/year by 2030 and 35\u201395 Mt/year by 2050 (relative to projected BAU 2050 emissions of ~155 Mt/year). Averaged over all measures, abatement costs are quite similar for the coal subsector, but vary substantially for the oil and gas subsector. Restricting the analysis to low cost (< US$600/tCH4; < ~US$20/tCO2e using GWP100) measures only, ~17\u201332 Mt/year can be abated by 2030 in the oil and gas subsector, compared with ~8\u201324 Mt/year in the coal subsector. The largest and most cost-effective abatement potentials within the fossil fuel sector for 2030 are to prevent all venting of associated gas during oil and gas extraction (including from inefficient flaring), to install leak detection and repair programmes for natural gas infrastructure and to utilize ventilation air methane oxidation technology in coal mines (table 6.1). Reducing methane emissions from waste and agriculture will be more challenging but is crucial to achieving low warming targets. For waste, the three analyses assessed in the Global Methane Assessment have very similar 2030 all-cost abatement potentials relative to projected 2030 BAU emissions (~28\u201332 Mt/year; ~30\u201335 per cent; ~0.9 GtCO2e/ year using GWP100), but with widely varying cost estimates (+US$3 to -US$200/tCO2e using GWP100). The largest and most cost-effective abatement in the waste sector comes from municipal solid waste, typically either by diverting organic waste from the waste stream or capturing and utilizing landfill gas. More simply, covering landfills with soil is a very effective and low-cost measure, and reduces fires, odours and air pollution. This could be an attractive option for many tropical and subtropical megacities, which typically have extremely large and ill-managed landfills. Crop waste fires are widespread in the tropics, leading to significant air pollution and methane emissions from partial combustion. Such crop waste could instead be burned under controlled conditions to generate electricity or returned to the soil to provide nutrients. All-cost abatement estimates for rice cultivation have similar abatement potentials (~7\u201310 Mt/year) but vary markedly in costs (roughly US$3\u2013100/tCO2e using GWP100), whereas low-cost abatement potentials and costs are quite similar across analyses. Abatement within rice cultivation is possible through changes in agricultural production techniques, such as alternate wetting and drying of paddy fields, though the benefits can be undermined by increased N2O emissions (table 6.1). In contrast, all-cost abatement potential estimates for the livestock sector have similar costs (~US$13\u201330/tCO2e using GWP100) but significantly varied abatement potentials (4 to > 40 Mt/year). These differences are largely attributable to assumptions about the feasibility of some countries being able to switch to higher- yielding livestock breeds. The average abatement potential is therefore smallest in the agriculture sector at ~20\u201325 per cent. Several less well-established abatement options are also under study for the livestock sector, including feed substitutes and methane inhibitors (UNEP and CCAC 2020; Ocko et al. 2021).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a4f7d191-2064-4cd1-a2f4-d90e2eae5aa1": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4f7d191-2064-4cd1-a2f4-d90e2eae5aa1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c73ee1a9ad3ebe0c90408dc7dca0e5c51d4c8c4f44fddcd92c225f188e14ece5"}, "2": {"node_id": "45747df3-9e05-4d82-ae66-6e90fa55d399", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b2921148317064db4b3a4527a878660ed37e96eafb3a688e696393f6ecd13925"}}, "hash": "9456719bf484b6b4e52edc50cbc52fd55617c0357d17e11b717fa0b981ead4a6", "text": "2021). At the same time, substantial mitigation of livestock-related methane could be achieved through widespread changes in human dietary choices, possibly reaching 30 Mt/year (~0.9 GtCO2e/year using GWP100) by 2050, with additional CO2 and N2O reductions (Willett et al. 2019; UNEP and CCAC 2021). 50 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On For 2050, abatement potentials tend to increase moderately compared with 2030, with the exception of waste and oil and gas in one analysis that shows very large abatement increases.

Similarly, the average all-cost abatement potential in oil and gas increases to ~80 per cent of the 2050 value, with roughly half of these emission controls available at low net cost. Targeted abatement estimates (without behavioural changes) increase only modestly in agriculture, which is expected to become the main anthropogenic source of emissions in low warming scenarios (e.g. Rogelj et al. 2018).

Changes in livestock abatement costs vary significantly among analyses. There are additional opportunities to reduce methane beyond methane-targeted abatement measures. These include fuel switching from natural gas to renewables in electricity generation and in buildings, and behavioural changes such as reduced consumption of cattle-based foods and reduced food waste and loss. Integrated assessment models show large ranges in potential methane mitigation due to these processes. On average, these models indicate that such actions could reduce methane emissions by another 15 per cent beyond the targeted measures, for a total 2030 reduction under 1.5\u00b0C scenarios of 45 per cent relative to BAU (UNEP and CCAC 2021). Both the Global Methane Assessment and Ocko et al. (2021) emphasize that fast methane action, as opposed to slower or delayed action, can contribute greatly to reducing midterm (2050) temperatures, i.e. peak warming if long-lived GHG emissions are also controlled. Fast action to reduce methane to a trajectory consistent with 1.5\u00b0C scenarios was found to be able to reduce both 2050 and 2100 global mean temperatures, by 0.2\u20130.4\u00b0C and 0.4\u2013 0.8\u00b0C, respectively, compared with a broad set of potential baseline scenarios (UNEP and CCAC 2021). 51 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On Table 6.1.

However, decarbonization will lead to more abandoned oil and gas wells and coal mines, which would need targeted actions to reduce methane emissions that are distinct from direct decarbonization policies (e.g. Kholod et al. 2020). By 2050, methane abatement associated with decarbonization alone is only about 30 per cent of the methane abatement seen under a broad multi-pollutant, multi-policy 2\u00b0C scenario, emphasizing the large role played by methane- specific policies.

For example, within land use, the abatement of livestock-related methane typically involves reduced demand for cattle, which then frees up pasture and feed lands for potential production of biofuels or afforestation. Methane-formed surface ozone is known to reduce the growth rate of many plants, affecting both crops (and therefore land use, as a greater area would be required to produce the same yield) and decreasing CO2 uptake by forests (e.g. Sitch et al. 2007).

As shown, several methane mitigation pathways also have the potential to contribute to CO2 mitigation. 6.5\ufffd Methane\ufffdmitigation\ufffdin\ufffdthe\ufffdfirst\ufffdNDCs Many countries present their mitigation pledges for GHG emission reductions in various ways in their NDCs.2 Some emissions targets are not quantitative, while most that are quantitative tend to be provided as aggregated GHGs, which makes it difficult to discern projections for individual gases (at present, individual gases are only reported in national communication submissions by Annex I countries for trajectories based on current policies). The emissions implications of many major emitters\u2019 first NDC commitments have been analysed as part of a large international research project. Using a suite of global and national models and 2 The assessment in this chapter only considers the first round of NDCs. New or updated NDCs are not considered. informed by policy-specific input from national experts, the project developed a range of plausible implementation pathways to achieve the NDCs (Roelfsema et al. 2020). The project also examined a least-cost 2\u00b0C scenario (accounting for mitigation costs only, and excluding environmental costs), with reductions starting in 2020 and a 66 per cent chance of staying below 2\u00b0C. According to those estimates, some countries have made pledges that would lead to substantial decreases in their methane emissions by 2030 (table 6.2). Extrapolating countries\u2019 NDCs reveals that most are projected to achieve substantially greater reductions by 2050 than 2030. Japan is the exception, showing a smaller reduction in 2050. A group of major emitting countries, including the United States of America, European Union nations, Japan and Canada, have NDCs that will likely result in reductions of ~80\u201388 per cent of those seen in 2\u00b0C least-cost pathways by 2030 compared with 2015, and ~69\u201377 per cent by 2050. However, most of the world is not yet as close to 2\u00b0C pathways, so at the global scale, NDCs are expected to deliver only about a third of 2030 methane reductions expected under 2\u00b0C scenarios. Among the major emitting countries analysed, China, the Russian Federation, India and Australia show the greatest emission gaps for methane, with their NDC reductions relative to their 2\u00b0C reductions less than the global mean for both 2030 and 2050. Methane reductions in 1.5\u00b0C least-cost pathways are 44 per cent at the global level by 2030 compared with 2015, rather than 34 per cent for 2\u00b0C. The NDCs are therefore projected to deliver only about one quarter of 2030 reductions in 1.5\u00b0C pathways. The International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) has also carried out analyses of the impact of NDCs on methane for the European Union, which show decreases of 21 per cent by 2030 and 34 per cent by 2050 (relative to 2015), results that are very similar to those shown in table 6.2. 53 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On Table 6.2.

Although ranges across the models were not specified for methane alone, the tenth to ninetieth percentile range of the emissions gap between the NDCs and 2\u00b0C scenario for all GHGs was ~36 per cent at the global level and 30\u201355 per cent at the national level, indicating that a similar uncertainty range is appropriate for methane estimates.

In countries or regions with large projected decreases in methane emissions, specific policies have been put into place to achieve such reductions. Examples include the 2016 North American Leaders\u2019 Summit agreement to reduce oil and gas methane emissions by 40\u201345 per cent by 2025 (relative to 2012) in Canada, Mexico and the United States of America, the European Union\u2019s 2020 strategy to reduce methane emissions (COM/2020/663 final) and the goals of Nigeria and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire to reduce oil and gas methane emissions by 60\u201375 per cent by 2030 as part of the UNEP and CCAC Global Methane Alliance. In September 2021, the United States of America and the European Union announced a Global Methane Pledge to reduce anthropogenic methane emissions by at least 30 per cent globally relative to 2020 levels by 2030. On 11 October 2021, they reported that more than 30 additional countries had committed to joining the Pledge, with coverage now including nine of the top 20 methane emitters globally, and urged others to sign on before the official launch at the twenty-sixth United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26). There is a clear need for increased ambition almost everywhere, with possible actions that policymakers could consider including increased efforts to build on growing momentum to monitor and address environmental impacts within the private investment community. More transparent data on sector-specific \u2018best practice\u2019 methane emissions would help support a market for both monitoring and mitigation services by facilitating the identification of the best- performing companies. 54 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On NDCs typically include more information about the energy sector than the agriculture or waste sectors. Every country emits GHGs from municipal waste, which is largely generated by the human population (Eggelston et al. 2006). In NDCs representing 174 countries, 137 included general waste sector mitigation commitments, with 67 citing specific mitigation actions (Powell et al. 2018). The most common mitigation action was improved landfilling, followed by converting waste into energy (e.g. incineration and conversion of landfill gas into energy). Improvements in waste management systems could provide public health co-benefits, such as reducing hazards associated with wastewater mismanagement, improving air quality and diminishing land and water contamination (Mittal et al. 2017; Cohen et al. 2021). Agricultural methane emissions primarily derive from animal stocks and rice cultivation, as well as deliberate biomass burning, factors that vary widely from country to country (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [FAO] 2021). In their first NDCs, 32 countries referred to \u2018climate-smart agriculture\u2019, with aims to optimize agricultural systems to increase productivity and incomes, enhance resilience and reduce GHG emissions (Strohmaier et al. 2016). However, countries rarely included quantitative targets for reducing agricultural methane emissions (H\u00f6nle et al. 2019). In fact, of the top 46 countries that contribute to 90 per cent of global agricultural emissions, only a quarter included broadly-stated measures targeting emissions from ruminant livestock. This may be due to relatively high abatement costs and the impact such measures may have on economically important sectors such as beef and dairy. Mitigation measures such as sustainable intensification of rice cultivation were more likely to be included, in part because they present clear co-benefits for modernization or productivity (H\u00f6nle et al. 2019). The magnitude of agricultural methane emissions suggests that agriculture should receive more attention than it currently does in methane mitigation strategies, and that strategies that include changes in consumption through a food systems approach will need to be considered (Tubiello et al. 2021). Setting quantitative goals for cropland and livestock management, which could come in the form of targets for best practices, would help countries raise their ambition in this sector. 6.6\ufffd Measurement-based\ufffdverification\ufffdof\ufffd uncertain emission reporting In many cases, methane mitigation efforts are hampered by uncertainties relating to actual emission numbers, making it important to urgently improve approaches for measuring and reporting emissions. Improved monitoring at the facility level could serve to motivate action to reduce emissions and to verify the effectiveness of such action. This would open up opportunities for regulators to use flexible policy instruments that directly target measurable emission reductions compared with more prescriptive best available technology standards. Effectively prioritizing methane sources, reducing methane emissions and tracking mitigation progress necessitates a broad suite of measurement-based technologies that draw on the unique advantages of each. Traditional bottom-up approaches, based on source- specific emission factors combined with statistical activity data (for example, livestock numbers, amount of oil and gas extracted), have inherent uncertainties that can be large at the national/sectoral scale (figure 6.1), especially for non- Annex 1 countries with", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6f1361ac-e8d7-42f6-bb9c-7fcb6a5b6d72": {"__data__": {"id_": "6f1361ac-e8d7-42f6-bb9c-7fcb6a5b6d72", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4b9f656ab7a2247a0a2bc3c6e974cd3f204f4f905666b302430ebd4126788229"}, "3": {"node_id": "8e73b150-ca2f-4371-9269-cfe576f71ca4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "902b8f490108b9f1c33d8e72ce5cc171ed90542320f28770576d01dc9ba39758"}}, "hash": "275f7e199d086429cb3413d29b334273a80dc430c1e201de52e24d1afadddc1b", "text": "limited institutional capacity and data availability (Solazzo et al. 2021). Even in countries such as Germany and the United Kingdom, which have well-established emission reporting systems, methane inventories have been revised by up to 60 per cent between subsequent submissions (Bergamaschi et al. 2010). New top-down approaches have been developed that use atmospheric observations (at the surface, airborne or from satellites), which when combined with atmospheric transport models, can be applied to determine emissions for a specific facility, sector, region or other aggregation. These top-down approaches have proven effective in correcting emission factors and in revising sectoral methane emissions in multiple geographies (e.g. Alvarez et al. 2018; Zavala-Araiza et al. 2021), and in this way have provided opportunities for identifying specific sources and mitigation opportunities (Lyon et al. 2016; Johnson et al. 2017). Top-down approaches can also support the transparency of reporting processes, with the updated IPCC reporting guidelines recommending the application of such approaches as additional quality control (Bartram et al. 2019). However, at present, only Switzerland and the United Kingdom include top-down methane estimates in an annex to their national inventory reports (Manning et al. 2011; Henne et al. 2016). New observational capabilities are revealing emission hotspots and facility- or city-scale emissions through measurements from cars, drones and aircraft, and satellite remote sensing, especially in remote world regions, which in at least a few cases has led to industry action to eliminate major emission point sources (Nisbet et al. 2020). However, at a larger scale, top-down methods depend highly on the density of observations and are challenged by the difficulty in disentangling different sources and separating natural emissions from anthropogenic emissions, which is crucial for many countries with large natural emissions. Compared with high-frequency in situ surface measurements, satellite observations have a broader coverage but less sensitivity to methane sources, and are limited by cloud coverage. Further deployment of mobile measurements and fixed stations should therefore be supported to better monitor methane concentrations, especially over tropical and boreal regions. 55 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On In the near future, wider use of top-down approaches will be facilitated by a new International Methane Emissions Observatory (IMEO) hosted by UNEP. The International Energy Agency (IEA) Methane Tracker (2020) already includes data on leaked methane of super emitters, which is detected by the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), with a new generation of satellites, such as GHGSat (Varon et al. 2020), being specifically designed to map and quantify point sources. 56 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On The role of market mechanisms in bridging the emissions gap Lead authors: Sha Yu (Pacific Northwest National Laboratory [PNNL], USA), Maosheng Duan (Tsinghua University, China), Jae Edmonds (PNNL, USA) Contributing authors: Katherine Calvin (PNNL, USA), Stefano De Clara (International Carbon Action Partnership [ICAP], Germany), Dirk Forrister (International Emissions Trading Association [IETA], Switzerland), Stephanie La Hoz Theuer (adelphi, Germany), Luca Lo Re (International Energy Agency [IEA], France), Ruben Lubowski (Environmental Defense Fund [EDF], USA), Axel Michaelowa (Perspectives and University of Zurich, Switzerland), Clayton Munnings (University of California, Berkeley, USA), Karen Holm Olsen (UNEP DTU Partnership, Denmark), Mandy Rambharos (Eskom, South Africa), Chandra Shekhar Sinha (World Bank, USA), Detlef van Vuuren (PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, the Netherlands) 7 7.1 Introduction: The role of carbon markets and current status In the Paris Agreement, cooperation among countries is considered a way to both implement nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and promote greater ambition, while also fostering sustainable development and encouraging broad participation from the private and public sectors. Market mechanisms are therefore seen as an important component in collective action to achieve the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement. In principle, the role of markets within the context of the agreement is to enable all parties engaged in mitigation actions to implement these in a cost-effective manner, while simultaneously providing an opportunity to enhance their ambition.

These rules, modalities and procedures are an anticipated key outcome of the of twenty-sixth United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26). There is already considerable experience in designing and implementing market mechanisms to control pollutants, including different forms of carbon markets (Schmalensee and Stavins 2017; Michaelowa et al. 2019a; World Bank 2021a). The current state of carbon markets is very diverse. Such markets include both voluntary and compliance- driven programmes, which are used both domestically and internationally to reduce emissions, and involve different types of allowances and credits and both public and private sector entities as buyers and sellers (box 1, figure 7.1). 57 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On Box 7.1. Current state of carbon markets Compliance carbon markets are marketplaces in which participants act in response to an obligation established by a regulatory body. The most prominent examples of such markets are national or regional emissions trading systems. In national emissions trading systems, governments set a cap on the aggregate level of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that regulated entities can emit over a period of time. These entities are required to submit an emission permit (or allowance) for each ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) they emit. Emissions trading systems can be restricted to domestic borders or may have international elements through links with other emissions trading systems (e.g. the European Union, the European Union-Swiss link and the California-Quebec link) and/or the acceptance of international offsets (e.g. the Republic of Korea\u2019s Emissions Trading Scheme \u2013 K-ETS). In voluntary carbon markets, participants are under no formal obligation to achieve a specific target. Instead, companies, private entities and national governments seek to voluntarily offset their emissions, for example, as part of a social responsibility strategy. Voluntary buyers can procure domestic or international carbon credits from various different crediting programmes, as well as allowances from compliance markets (Doda et al. 2021). Compliance carbon markets have historically generated more mitigation action and stronger incentives for decarbonization than voluntary carbon markets, though they may face more political opposition and entail higher regulatory burdens. Voluntary carbon markets can be an important tool to mobilize the private sector and expand the reach of carbon markets beyond sectors and regions subject to explicit climate regulation. In terms of structure, domestic carbon markets have the advantage of normally allowing better oversight and control through full regulatory control by a relevant authority, with little risk of spillover effects from other systems or jurisdictions, and all mitigation benefits accrued domestically. Adding international elements to markets will increase their complexity, but also presents a significant advantage of potentially reducing compliance costs by making use of cheaper mitigation opportunities in other jurisdictions.

The heterogenous nature of the current NDCs in this way creates challenges for both negotiating and establishing effective real-world markets, as well as the risks of double counting, emission leakages and unattainable targets. There is growing interest from countries in using markets and voluntary cooperation to implement their NDCs. As of 30 July 2021, the share of parties that indicated an intention or possibility of using voluntary cooperation has nearly doubled, from 44 to 87 per cent in the new or updated NDCs, compared with previous NDCs. Moreover, the share of parties that have set qualitative limits on voluntary cooperation, such as using certain standards and guidelines to ensure additionality and avoid double counting, has increased from 19 to 39 per cent (UNFCCC 2021). The existing quantitative literature that estimates the maximum potential gains from cooperation generally assumes that the heterogeneous NDCs could be translated into a common comprehensive, transferable emissions mitigation metric. This is evidently not something that is going to happen quickly, if at all, and the results must therefore be interpreted as estimates of potential gains from cooperation compared with independent implementation of the same targets. These studies do not include ancillary domestic benefits that may have motivated countries\u2019 choice of NDC target methods. A relatively limited number of studies have so far provided quantification of the gains from cooperative implementation of NDC pledges (e.g. Fujimori et al. 2016; Hof et al. 2017; Edmonds et al. 2019; B\u00f6hringer et al. 2021; Edmonds et al. 59 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On 2021). With the aim of achieving the current NDC ambition through global cooperation, most models estimate a global carbon price of US$9\u201338/tCO2 between 2025 and 2030.1 In contrast, the studies find that due to the varying stringency in NDCs, the shadow price of carbon for a country to independently and cost-effectively achieve its unconditional NDC pledge by 2030 ranges from US$0/tCO2 to over US$250/tCO2 across models and studies (with each study analysing then-current NDC pledges), highlighting the potential gains through international emissions trading. As a result, the estimated mitigation costs by 2030 in an ideal situation could be reduced by 40\u201360 per cent through the full use of market mechanisms (Aldy et al. 2016; Fujimori et al. 2016; Hof et al. 2017; Edmonds et al. 2019; Edmonds et al. 2021). Although there are uncertainties associated with economic modelling, results in all studies suggest significant potential cost reductions and economic gains from using market mechanisms. These results provide a strong incentive for countries to negotiate a credible agreement on article 6 and to move towards more compatible NDCs over time. The modelling studies estimate that around 4\u20135 GtCO2e could be traded per year by 2030 with a market volume of US$60\u2013100 billion per year if NDCs are transformed into tradable emission mitigation actions (Fujimori et al. 2016; Edmonds et al. 2019; Edmonds et al. 2021). Net market transactions constitute balance-of-trade changes and therefore changes to participants\u2019 gross domestic product (GDP) and/or exchange rate position. For selling regions, this would represent a potentially significant new net export (Piris-Cabezas et al. 2019; Edmonds et al. 2021; Kachi et al. 2020). The extent to which this will actually occur is very uncertain, with many parties emphasizing domestic implementation and mentioning flexible mechanisms as an additionality in their NDCs. Carbon markets shift both emission mitigation actions and emission mitigation investments from buyers to sellers. Provided that sellers are primarily developing countries, carbon markets have the potential to transfer emission mitigation-related capital towards developing economies, help prevent lock-ins to carbon-intensive infrastructure and contribute to capacity-building to further reduce emissions. Redistributing capital investments potentially carries implications for other sustainability metrics, such as local air quality, forest conservation, rural livelihoods, food prices, water quality and energy access, as well as for the regional distribution of incentives for technology development and innovation.

Studies of potential emissions mitigation with international markets indicate that land-use emission mitigation opportunities are undertaken earlier than under independent NDC implementation (Edmonds et al. 2021). By valuing land-use change emissions, international carbon markets can also provide incentives to prevent deforestation and increase afforestation and reforestation (Lubowski and Rose 2013; Fujimori et al. 2016; Edmonds et al. 2019; Piris- Cabezas et al. 2019; Edmonds et al. 2021; Fuss, Lubowski and Gulub 2021). The need for an interlinked implementation of climate goals and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is being increasingly recognized at the political level to enhance synergies and maximize co-benefits. However, tools and approaches to assess and report on sustainable development impacts of article 6 cooperative approaches are lacking and remain an unresolved topic in negotiations (Olsen, Arens and Mersmann 2018; Kachi and Mooldijk 2020). Similarly, there are unresolved issues about how the use of cooperative approaches can be designed to contribute to financing adaptation in vulnerable countries with limited potential for direct participation. 7.2.2 Net-zero implications For climate change to stabilize, global anthropogenic net emissions must decline to zero (chapter 3). As of 13 September 2021, 50 parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have announced net-zero targets, of which five parties have explicitly indicated their intent to use international trading to achieve their net-zero pledges. In addition, a growing number of non-State and subnational actors have made net-zero pledges with trading considered. When global net carbon emissions start to approach zero, carbon market conditions will be very different to how they are currently. Reducing global carbon emissions to net zero involves reducing carbon emissions to near zero in all sectors in all regions, with emissions that remain positive being offset by so-called negative emissions or carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (see chapter 3). This suggests that the overall scope for transactions in physical (i.e. tons of CO2 \u2013 tCO2) will shift towards negative emissions over time. 60 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On The marginal cost of removing the final tons of CO2 from some hard-to-abate sectors and regions could become high, implying that transactions that occur could be very valuable. As discussed in chapter 3, net-zero pledges across countries and organizations have different timings, sectoral coverage, gas coverage and legal statuses. In addition to the challenges discussed in section 5.3, ambiguity of net-zero targets creates additional barriers to using market mechanisms to achieve net-zero targets. Further complexity arises from uncertainty in how to treat the various forms of CO2 removal (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2019) in carbon markets. Some carbon markets (Australia, Colombia, New Zealand and the Republic of Korea, and California, Alberta and China\u2019s regional systems) already recognize the role of nature-based removal credits and the long-term importance of bringing emission sources and sinks into a common market framework aimed at achieving net-zero emissions (La Hoz Theuer et al. 2021). To reach global net-zero emissions, countries with emissions greater than zero may need to be balanced by countries with negative emissions. Almost all global net-zero scenarios assessed in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on global warming of 1.5\u00b0C and Fifth Assessment Report databases have similar marginal costs across world regions, which implicitly assume international cooperation to achieve global net-zero scenarios. Van Soest et al. (2021) examined cost-optimal emission phase-out years, without fairness considerations, for both 1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C targets across six integrated assessment models. Their findings revealed significant variations in the timing in which countries reached net-zero emissions, which indicates that there is potential for using market mechanisms to achieve a global net-zero goal. The magnitude, value and patterns of emissions trading to reach a global net-zero target are dynamic and depend on several factors, such as the use of CO2 removal technologies and the timing of reaching net zero in each region (Yu et al. 2021). Market size, for example, reaches US$300\u2013400 billion in 2030 and around US$1 trillion in 2050 in scenarios with different net-zero timings.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6d95fd2a-c832-4af1-939f-f1231dfd0bf9": {"__data__": {"id_": "6d95fd2a-c832-4af1-939f-f1231dfd0bf9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4aac8a5cd4c9ed6071efb7ee778a303dcab6853b767df4ed8ec2222ac51c6645"}, "2": {"node_id": "892171ec-57ef-451a-bbb1-544d0bf16d57", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b5860b7a81d7808666660c9608fd667e44d0c3bac35b0e27f58f0d003cd8926a"}}, "hash": "1103474b7af15380fcb008979fa508eaf11a15aa1a8b4e098bcc9ba23600ca45", "text": "Studies have found that land resources also play an important role (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC] 2018; Yu et al. 2021).

Many researchers have documented that the initial nationally determined contributions (NDCs) are insufficient to be aligned with trajectories to reach the long-term Paris Agreement goals (Fawcett et al. 2015; United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] 2020). However, recent studies by Piris-Cabezas et al. (2019) and Edmonds et al. (2021) have shown that if the savings from more cost-effective global implementation of NDCs were redeployed towards increased ambition, global emission reductions could be roughly doubled over the next decade at no added cost to parties compared with parties acting alone to implement their commitments (figure 7.2). A major part of the potential ambition increases derives from natural climate solutions, notably forests. Piris-Cabezas et al. (2019) estimate that this doubling of climate ambition provides about two thirds of the reductions necessary to get on a 2\u00b0C pathway through 2035, closing about half of the current gap without any added cost compared with parties acting independently. Although these calculations are evidently speculative, they highlight both the potential power of carbon markets and how far NDCs need to be enhanced to capture that potential. Carbon markets do not create ambition for parties. Rather, they create conditions that make enhanced ambitions more attractive through the implicit incentive that emissions mitigation is cost-effective, thereby lowering political and stakeholder resistance to tightening targets and facilitating emission reductions and strengthened targets over time. Experience from the world\u2019s current major emissions trading systems supports this approach (Parker 2019). Emissions within trading systems have always fallen faster and at a lower cost than initially expected (Haites 2018). Periods of low prices have been followed by a period of policy reassessment and more ambitious targets, as seen under the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and California\u2019s cap-and-trade programme. Various explicit mechanisms have been proposed to increase ambition. These include, for example, taxing or \u2018cancelling\u2019 a portion of emission mitigation trades. Under a fixed emissions budget, such schemes could increase overall emissions abatement in the near term. However, according to Piris-Cabezas et al. (2019), such an approach applied on a per transaction basis functions as a type of tariff on mitigation exports and hinders the ability of markets to deliver cost-effective mitigation. In the long term, this prevents markets from lowering costs and thereby from facilitating increases in ambition. 61 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On Figure 7.2.

(2021) 7.3 Using market mechanisms under article 6 Although there is potential for international carbon markets to reduce costs to achieve NDC goals and increase ambition, such potential will remain unknown until important details are determined under article 6. These include establishing robust rules to ensure environmental integrity, including the avoidance of double counting, capacity-building and the management of potential carbon leakages. 7.3.1 Getting the accounting right To avoid double counting the same emission reductions/ removals, the Paris Agreement requires parties participating in article 6.2 cooperative approaches to apply \u2018corresponding adjustments\u2019, i.e. adjusting the balance of their emissions or removals covered by their NDCs to reflect internationally transferred mitigation outcomes. To ensure environmental integrity under article 6.4, parties are negotiating the application of corresponding adjustments, though their implementation is being complicated by the diverse scope and formulation of the parties\u2019 NDC pledges (Greiner et al. 2019; Asian Development Bank 2020). Parties have different views on how to define the scope of NDCs, for example, whether to define them in terms of sectors, gases and/or policies and measures. There is also disagreement over whether corresponding adjustments should be required for internationally transferred mitigation outcomes generated outside the scope of selling countries\u2019 NDCs. Many NDCs only include single-year targets, such as 2025 or 2030, which raises the question of how to treat non- compliance years when accounting for internationally transferred mitigation outcomes. Several accounting methods have been put forward to address this challenge (Greiner et al. 2019; Lo Re and Vaidyula 2019; Asian Development Bank 2020).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b408339-2d36-40fa-a1f4-755f6e8d5a7e": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b408339-2d36-40fa-a1f4-755f6e8d5a7e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dcaa4c7d942460464a684f6b2db621571c480c03ad96ec09081b45ba950122a6"}, "2": {"node_id": "32c9c2ad-0198-4deb-8b79-406f94daf120", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "af5c97d3f57f0d846387d4f2186057cce9f4ae26007af7ce5f1b688b6b6bc819"}}, "hash": "5c5bc490c77a9df90be2706c1d3de823701ba43ece0cb8f8d03ec187d8c1f0ce", "text": "2019; Lo Re and Vaidyula 2019; Asian Development Bank 2020). 7.3.2 Trade when the basic policy environment lacks a fixed emissions limit Target setting in the NDCs is still very heterogeneous.

Uncertainties in BAU emission projections may weaken the actual ambition of mitigation targets (Hood, Briner and Rocha 2014; Graichen, Cames and Schneider 2016; Hood and Soo 2017; Vaidyula and Hood 2018; and Rocha and Ellis 2020). The scope of NDCs also differ in terms of sectors and GHGs: some cover all sectors and all GHGs, some have more limited coverage and others are unclear and only include indicators, such as policies and measures. The lack of a fixed emissions limit in many NDCs makes accounting complex. Some researchers have recommended the use of economy-wide absolute emission targets for all NDCs to facilitate robust accounting and reduce complexity 62 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On (Graichen, Cames and Schneider 2016; Schneider et al. 2019). Although this is not likely to happen anytime soon, parties could be requested to provide clearer and more transparent NDC targets as a potential short-term step. For this purpose, the Katowice Climate Package includes detailed provisions on how countries should describe or clarify the scope of their NCDs. However, some provisions of this package are only mandatory for second and subsequent NDCs or require countries to provide relevant information by 2024 (Schneider et al. 2020). The treatment of mitigation outcomes generated outside the scope of NDCs is an important issue in negotiations. The main advantages of allowing emission reductions outside the scope of NDCs include the full utilization of mitigation potential, reduced mitigation costs, improved data quality of uncovered sectors and the facilitation of their inclusion into future NDCs (Spalding-Fecher 2017; Schneider et al. 2020). Disadvantages include disincentives to enhancing the scope of NDCs, a lack of fairness, scrutiny and quality assurance, and double-counting risks (Spalding-Fecher 2017; Howard 2018; Warnecke et al. 2018; Hood 2019; Michaelowa et al. 2019b; Schneider and La Hoz Theuer 2019; Schneider et al. 2020). Many options have been raised to address the above cited concerns, such as applying corresponding adjustments regardless of NDC scope, bringing relevant sectors and GHGs into the scope of next NDCs, imposing international oversight on the quality of NDCs and restrictions on the number of and deadline for achieving internationally transferred mitigation outcomes, quantifying NDC targets in terms of GHG emissions and specifying the scope of NDCs (Marcu et al. 2017; Mizuno 2017; Spalding-Fecher 2017; Howard 2018; Greiner et al. 2019; Warnecke et al. 2018; Schneider and La Hoz Theuer 2019; Schneider et al. 2020). Care needs to be taken in framing such offset programmes so that macroscale outcomes deliver the intended aggregate emissions mitigation. Calvin et al. (2015) showed that well-intentioned offset programmes have the potential to inadvertently lower overall ambition. Although some of the proposed options are ideal in theory, they may lack political feasibility. Many parties have been concerned by potential limitations on article 6 participation and threats to the bottom-up nature of NDCs. 7.4 The way forward One possible outcome of COP26 is that initial article 6 rules will be agreed upon, with the intention that they be improved gradually over time and strengthened through other market arrangements. This has been the case for other parts of the Paris Agreement. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) could be a useful reference in this regard, as despite receiving many criticisms, it has played a crucial role in facilitating or enhancing many countries\u2019 mitigation efforts. In many developing countries, the capacities developed through participation in the CDM (e.g. to measure and verify emissions) have helped them prepare their initial NDCs. In some countries, such as China and the Republic of Korea, participation in the CDM provided valuable lessons and capacities for establishing domestic carbon markets. Success of the Paris Agreement market arrangements will require the establishment of solid managerial, technical and institutional capacity. Parties participating in article 6.2 will need to jointly agree on a cooperative framework for emission reductions, decide how to establish domestic modalities and procedures to complete the authorization, quantification, monitoring, verification and reporting of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes and make corresponding adjustments after the transfer of these outcomes (World Bank 2021b). Participation in the article 6.4 mechanism will be more demanding for host parties than the CDM, as it will involve documenting transparent reductions, as well as showing additionality to their NDCs and supporting sustainable development.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "abd5d03c-3038-430c-aabb-e2e5e5d49f33": {"__data__": {"id_": "abd5d03c-3038-430c-aabb-e2e5e5d49f33", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "86ed8f39bdb04685db911907cc16ce30957afe0e3ea08af487b27ebf2f5fdaf7"}, "2": {"node_id": "63cd01ba-4f91-4d22-b61a-c7328db482f8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cf8ea0856541aebdde2ffb419466b12e2a60b1f7f256ef3824d8c98edac6a362"}}, "hash": "17f436e0fb5008293c0dc38de920a55efd61e7027487693b0ca5231cf5962a84", "text": "63 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On References U A B C D E Chapter 1 United Nations and United Kingdom (undated).

Baseline/reference: The state against which change is measured. In the context of transformation pathways, the term \u2018baseline scenarios\u2019 refers to scenarios that are based on the assumption that no mitigation policies or measures will be implemented beyond those that are already in force and/or are legislated or planned to be adopted. Baseline scenarios are not intended to be predictions of the future, but rather counterfactual constructions that can serve to highlight the level of emissions that would occur without further policy effort. Typically, baseline scenarios are then compared to mitigation scenarios that are constructed to meet different goals for greenhouse gas emissions, atmospheric concentrations or temperature change. The term \u2018baseline scenario\u2019 is used interchangeably with \u2018reference scenario\u2019 and \u2018no policy scenario\u2019.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9935e9e5-1212-4ad0-b26f-bb8b82a4128f": {"__data__": {"id_": "9935e9e5-1212-4ad0-b26f-bb8b82a4128f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2020", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2abfe503679a381321f7bd3f4c4ec94b8d761bbae36a8fd6546088306f329dc7"}, "2": {"node_id": "faf5e821-4f97-4279-b730-9ccd3608ac24", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e482a168f44f6cf0c440aabc7c8086270ac5ad4bdad7c1689aa31a01e8da9688"}}, "hash": "589d6da61f9c4f4f9c3bf000971ef378d61aa1dc957c9e55d87bc2f1f3165db0", "text": "In much of the literature the term is also synonymous with the term \u2018business as usual (BAU) scenario\u2019, although the term \u2018BAU\u2019 has fallen out of favour because the idea of \u2018business as usual\u2019 in century-long socioeconomic projections is hard to fathom. Bioenergy: Energy derived from any form of biomass such as recently living organisms or their metabolic by-products. Cancun Pledge: During 2010, many countries submitted their existing plans for controlling greenhouse gas emissions to the Climate Change Secretariat and these proposals were formally acknowledged under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

Carbon dioxide emission budget (or carbon budget): For a given temperature rise limit, for example a 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C long-term limit, the corresponding carbon budget reflects the total amount of carbon emissions that can be emitted for temperatures to stay below that limit. Stated differently, a carbon budget is the area under a carbon dioxide (CO2) emission trajectory that satisfies assumptions about limits on cumulative emissions estimated to avoid a certain level of global mean surface temperature rise. Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e): A way to place emissions of various radiative forcing agents on a common footing by accounting for their effect on climate. It describes, for a given mixture and amount of greenhouse gases, the amount of CO2 that would have the same global warming ability, when measured over a specified time period. For the purpose of this report, greenhouse gas emissions (unless otherwise specified) are the sum of the basket of greenhouse gases listed in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol, expressed as CO2e assuming a 100-year global warming potential. Carbon intensity: The amount of emissions of CO2 released per unit of another variable such as gross domestic product, output energy use, transport or agricultural/forestry products. Carbon offset: See Offset. Carbon price: The price for avoided or released CO2 or CO2e emissions. This may refer to the rate of a carbon tax or the price of emission permits. In many models that are used to assess the economic costs of mitigation, carbon prices are used as a proxy to represent the level of effort in mitigation policies. Carbon tax: A levy on the carbon content of fossil fuels. Because virtually all of the carbon in fossil fuels is ultimately emitted as CO2, a carbon tax is equivalent to an emission tax on CO2 emissions. Co-benefits: The positive effects that a policy or measure aimed at one objective might have on other objectives, without yet evaluating the net effect on overall social welfare. Co-benefits are often subject to uncertainty and depend on, among others, local circumstances and implementation practices. Co-benefits are often referred to as ancillary benefits. Conditional NDC: NDC proposed by some countries that are contingent on a range of possible conditions, such as the ability of national legislatures to enact the necessary laws, ambitious action from other countries, realization of finance and technical support, or other factors. X Emissions Gap Report 2020 Conference of the Parties (COP): The supreme body of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. It currently meets once a year to review the Convention\u2019s progress. Current policy trajectory: This trajectory is based on estimates of 2020 emissions considering projected economic trends and current policy approaches including policies at least through 2015. Estimates may be based on either official data or independent analysis. Deforestation: Conversion of forest to non-forest. Economic mitigation potential: The mitigation potential, which takes into account social costs and benefits and social discount rates, assuming that market efficiency is improved by policies and measures and barriers are removed. Emissions gap: The difference between the greenhouse gas emission levels consistent with a specific probability of limiting the mean global temperature rise to below 2\u00b0C or 1.5\u00b0C in 2100 above pre-industrial levels and the GHG emission levels consistent with the global effect of the NDCs, assuming full implementation from 2020. Emission pathway: The trajectory of annual greenhouse gas emissions over time. Fiscal measure: Fiscal, monetary or regulatory intervention by a government to reinvigorate economic activity in response to a crisis. Global warming potential: An index representing the combined effect of the differing times greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere and their relative effectiveness in absorbing outgoing infrared radiation. Greenhouse gases: The atmospheric gases responsible for causing global warming and climatic change. The major greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Less prevalent, but very powerful, GHGs are hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). Integrated assessment models: Models that seek to combine knowledge from multiple disciplines in the form of equations and/or algorithms in order to explore complex environmental problems. As such, they describe the full chain of climate change, from production of greenhouse gases to atmospheric responses.

INDCs are thus only used in this publication in reference to countries that have not yet ratified the Paris Agreement. Kigali Amendment: The Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer aims for the phase-down of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by cutting their production and consumption. Kyoto Protocol: An international agreement, standing on its own, and requiring separate ratification by governments, but linked to the UNFCCC. The Kyoto Protocol, among other things, sets binding targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by industrialized countries.

Lock-in: Lock-in occurs when a market is stuck with a standard even though participants would be better off with an alternative. Mitigation: In the context of climate change, a human intervention to reduce the sources, or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases. Examples include using fossil fuels more efficiently for industrial processes or electricity generation, switching to solar energy or wind power, improving the insulation of buildings and expanding forests and other \u2018sinks\u2019 to remove greater amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere.

XIII Emissions Gap Report 2020 Foreword Foreword As the world deals with the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the climate crisis has not gone away. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions hit a new high in 2019. The year 2020 is on course to be the warmest on record. Wildfires, storms and droughts continue to wreak havoc while glaciers melt at unprecedented rates. The pandemic-linked economic slowdown is expected to cause a drop of up to 7 per cent in carbon dioxide emissions this year. However, as the UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2020 shows, this dip will have an insignificant impact on the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to well below 2\u00b0C, and pursuing 1.5\u00b0C, unless the international community prioritizes a green recovery. The report says that the expected 2020 fall in emissions translates to a 0.01\u00b0C reduction of global warming by 2050.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6a9c782c-6256-4726-b0ed-90c22042ec60": {"__data__": {"id_": "6a9c782c-6256-4726-b0ed-90c22042ec60", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2020", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "02e0b29357657ca9ad2bf8508cde05bca8602d0841cbb8fa16c9de057a8b1f76"}, "2": {"node_id": "986ff7b6-85bd-4835-930b-861f23942ba8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e652ad4d86ad0ec725b0209bb68bfab7011a9598e2f08e1b97072566ee7d7ea7"}}, "hash": "19e59c75ccde1f7da2ff75645043c003a85b7b93579a796eab9e49c77f18a34f", "text": "Overall, we are heading for a world that is 3.2\u00b0C warmer by the end of this century, even with full implementation of unconditional nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement.

These include direct support for zero-emissions technologies and infrastructure, reducing fossil fuel subsidies, and backing nature-based solutions \u2013 including large-scale landscape restoration and reforestation. Some G20 members have already announced green recovery measures. Yet COVID-19 fiscal spending, as at October 2020, had overwhelmingly supported the status quo or fostered new high-carbon investments. While there have also been stronger pledges on climate \u2013 including China targeting carbon neutrality by 2060, South Africa by 2050, and the Japanese and European Union net-zero GHG target of mid- century \u2013 they are yet to be reflected in updated NDCs. Governments must go greener in the next stage of COVID-19 fiscal interventions and increase their NDC ambitions in 2021. The report finds that stronger action must include facilitating, encouraging and mandating changes in consumption behaviour by individuals and the private sector \u2013 enabling consumers to avoid high-carbon consumption by, for example, redesigning cities, making housing more efficient and promoting better, less wasteful diets. The wealthy bear the greatest responsibility in this area. The combined emissions of the richest 1 per cent of the global population account for more than twice the combined emissions of the poorest 50 per cent. This elite will need to reduce their footprint by a factor of 30 to stay in line with the Paris Agreement targets. The pandemic is a warning that we must urgently shift from our destructive development path, which is driving the three planetary crises of climate change, nature loss and pollution. But it is clearly also a major opportunity. I urge governments, businesses and individuals \u2013 particularly those with the greatest climate footprint \u2013 to take this opportunity to protect our climate and nature for decades to come. Inger Andersen Executive Director United Nations Environment Programme XIV Emissions Gap Report 2020 Executive summary \u2013 Emissions Gap Report 2020 Introduction This eleventh edition of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Emissions Gap Report has been produced in a year where the COVID-19 crisis has dominated the news and policymaking and has caused immense suffering and economic and social disruption worldwide. This economic disruption has briefly slowed \u2013 but far from eliminated \u2013 the historic and ever-increasing burden of human activity on the Earth\u2019s climate. This burden is observable in the continuing rise in extreme weather events, including wildfires and hurricanes, and in the melting of glaciers and ice at both poles. The year 2020 has set new records \u2013 they will not be the last. As in previous years, this report assesses the gap between estimated future global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions if countries implement their climate mitigation pledges and the global emission levels from least-cost pathways that are aligned with achieving the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. This difference between \u201cwhere we are likely to be and where we need to be\u201d is known as the \u2018emissions gap\u2019. The report also examines two areas that are highly relevant for bridging the gap and which have become even more relevant in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic: the shipping and aviation sectors, where international emissions are not covered by nationally determined contributions (NDCs), and lifestyle change. Reflecting the unusual circumstances, the 2020 report deviates from its usual approach of exclusively considering consolidated data from previous years as the basis for assessment. To maximize its policy relevance, preliminary assessments of the implications of the pandemic and associated rescue and recovery measures are included throughout the report. Are we on track to bridging the gap? Absolutely not. Although 2020 emissions will be lower than in 2019 due to the COVID-19 crisis and associated responses, GHG concentrations in the atmosphere continue to rise, with the immediate reduction in emissions expected to have a negligible long-term impact on climate change. However, the unprecedented scale of COVID-19 economic recovery measures presents the opening for a low-carbon transition that creates the structural changes required for sustained emissions reductions. Seizing this opening will be critical to bridging the emissions gap. The United Nations Secretary-General is calling on governments to use COVID-19 recovery as an opportunity to create more sustainable, resilient and inclusive societies. Aligned with this, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has stressed that governments could integrate and specify some of their post-COVID-19 recovery plans and policies in their new or updated NDCs and long-term mitigation strategies, both of which countries are requested to submit in 2020. The most significant and encouraging development in terms of climate policy in 2020 is the growing number of countries that have committed to achieving net-zero emissions goals by", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8316c97e-abf1-4ef3-a8c2-1c474f293515": {"__data__": {"id_": "8316c97e-abf1-4ef3-a8c2-1c474f293515", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2020", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "831be2657d816bc90bd6295fdd7a95c4d011bb6be33b2485352278fe57400bc9"}, "3": {"node_id": "725a64cf-7930-48f4-8602-45825c23578f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "765ac3405e173575f602c66c81c52e30e94077862a0d1a5439948d145cd54c37"}}, "hash": "3ccff85c37c90590d7975eb14331ba452f714efc43d102bc716ffe91ee7afde6", "text": "around mid-century. These commitments are broadly consistent with the Paris Agreement temperature goal, provided they are achieved globally. The litmus test of these announcements will be the extent to which they are reflected in near-term policy action and in significantly more ambitious NDCs for the period to 2030. As in previous years, the 2020 Emissions Gap Report has been guided by a distinguished steering committee and prepared by an international team of leading scientists, assessing all available information, including that published in the context of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, as well as in other recent scientific studies. The assessment process has been transparent and participatory. The assessment methodology and preliminary findings were made available to the governments of the countries specifically mentioned in the report to provide them with the opportunity to comment on the findings. 1. GHG emissions continued to increase in 2019. \u25b6 Global GHG emissions continued to grow for the third consecutive year in 2019, reaching a record high of 52.4 GtCO2e (range: \u00b15.2) without land-use change (LUC) emissions and 59.1 GtCO2e (range: \u00b15.9) when including LUC. \u25b6 Fossil carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions (from fossil fuels and carbonates) dominate total GHG emissions including LUC (65 per cent) and consequently the growth in GHG emissions. Preliminary data suggest that fossil CO2 emissions reached a record 38.0 GtCO2 (range: \u00b11.9) in 2019. \u25b6 Since 2010, GHG emissions without LUC have grown at 1.3 per cent per year on average, with Executive summary XV Emissions Gap Report 2020 preliminary data suggesting a 1.1 per cent increase in 2019. When including the more uncertain and variable LUC emissions, global GHG emissions have grown 1.4 per cent per year since 2010 on average, with a more rapid increase of 2.6 per cent in 2019 due to a large increase in vegetation forest fires. LUC emissions account for around 11 per cent of the global total, with the bulk of the emissions occurring in relatively few countries. \u25b6 Over the last decade, the top four emitters (China, the United States of America, EU27+UK and India) have contributed to 55 per cent of the total GHG emissions without LUC. The top seven emitters (including the Russian Federation, Japan and international transport) have contributed to 65 per cent, with G20 members accounting for 78 per cent. The ranking of countries changes dramatically when considering per capita emissions (figure ES.2). \u25b6 There is some indication that the growth in global GHG emissions is slowing. However, GHG emissions are declining in Organisation of Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD) economies and increasing in non-OECD economies. Many OECD economies have had a peak in GHG emissions, with efficiency improvements and growth in low-carbon energy sources more than offsetting the growth in economic activity. Despite improving energy efficiency and increasing low-carbon sources, emissions continue to rise in countries with strong growth in energy use to meet development needs. \u25b6 There is a general tendency that rich countries have higher consumption-based emissions (emissions allocated to the country where goods are purchased and consumed, rather than where they are produced) than territorial-based emissions, as they typically have cleaner production, relatively more services and more imports of primary and secondary products. In the 2000s, the gap between consumption and production was growing in rich countries but stabilized following the 2007\u20132008 global financial crisis. Even though rich countries have had higher consumption-based emissions than territorial-based emissions over the last decade, both emission types have declined at similar rates. Figure ES.1.

CO2 emissions could decrease by about 7 per cent in 2020 (range: 2\u201312 per cent) compared with 2019 emission levels due to COVID-19, with a smaller drop expected in GHG emissions as non-CO2 is likely to be less affected. However, atmospheric concentrations of GHGs continue to rise. \u25b6 The reduction in GHG emissions in 2020 due to COVID-19 is likely to be significantly larger than the 1.2 per cent reduction during the global financial crisis in the late 2000s.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "725a64cf-7930-48f4-8602-45825c23578f": {"__data__": {"id_": "725a64cf-7930-48f4-8602-45825c23578f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2020", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "831be2657d816bc90bd6295fdd7a95c4d011bb6be33b2485352278fe57400bc9"}, "2": {"node_id": "8316c97e-abf1-4ef3-a8c2-1c474f293515", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3ccff85c37c90590d7975eb14331ba452f714efc43d102bc716ffe91ee7afde6"}}, "hash": "765ac3405e173575f602c66c81c52e30e94077862a0d1a5439948d145cd54c37", "text": "Studies indicate that the biggest changes have occurred in transport, as COVID-19 restrictions were targeted to limit mobility, though reductions have also occurred in other sectors (figure ES.3). \u25b6 Although CO2 emissions will decrease in 2020, the resulting atmospheric concentrations of major GHGs (CO2, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O)) continued to increase in both 2019 and 2020.

The COVID-19 crisis offers only a short- term reduction in global emissions and will not contribute significantly to emissions reductions by 2030 unless countries pursue an economic recovery that incorporates strong decarbonization. \u25b6 Assessments of the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated recovery measures on emissions by 2030 are still few and highly uncertain. However, this report provides explorative projections based on available studies (figure ES.4). \u25b6 The impact of the general slowdown of the economy due to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated rescue and recovery responses is expected to reduce global GHG emissions by about 2\u20134 GtCO2e by 2030 compared with the pre-COVID-19 current policies scenario (figure ES.4 \u2013 current trends scenario). This assumes a pronounced short-term dip in CO2 emissions, after which emissions follow pre-2020 growth trends. \u25b6 If the initial short-term dip in CO 2 emissions is followed by growth trends with lower decarbonization rates due to countries\u2019 potential rollback of climate policies as part of COVID-19 responses, the decrease in global emissions by 2030 is projected to be significantly smaller at around 1.5 GtCO2e and may actually increase by around 1 GtCO2e (figure ES.4 \u2013 rebound to fossil fuels second-hit and single-hit scenarios, respectively) compared with the pre-COVID-19 current policies scenario. \u25b6 Global GHG emissions are only projected to be significantly reduced by 2030 if COVID-19 economic recovery is used as an opening to pursue strong decarbonization (figure ES.4 \u2013 IEA sustainable recovery scenario). This could result in global GHG emissions of 44 GtCO2e by 2030, a reduction of 15 GtCO2e (just over 25 per cent) by 2030 compared with the pre-COVID-19 current policies scenario. \u25b6 There is a significant opportunity for countries to integrate low-carbon development in their COVID-19 rescue and recovery measures, and to incorporate these into new or updated NDCs and long-term mitigation strategies that are scheduled to be available in time for the reconvened twenty- sixth session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26) in 2021. XVII Emissions Gap Report 2020 4. The growing number of countries that are committing to net-zero emissions goals by around mid-century is the most significant and encouraging climate policy development of 2020. To remain feasible and credible, it is imperative that these commitments are urgently translated into strong near-term policies and action, and are reflected in the NDCs. \u25b6 At the time of completing this report, 126 countries covering 51 per cent of global GHG emissions have net-zero goals that are formally adopted, announced or under consideration. If the United States of America adopts a net-zero GHG target by 2050, as suggested in the Biden-Harris climate plan, the share would increase to 63 per cent. \u25b6 The following G20 members have net-zero emissions goals: France and the United Kingdom, which have legally enshrined their 2050 net-zero GHG emissions goals; the European Union, which aims to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050; China, which announced plans to achieve carbon neutrality before 2060; Japan, which announced a goal of net-zero GHG emissions by 2050; the Republic of Korea, the president of which committed the country to becoming carbon neutral by 2050 in a speech to parliament; Canada, which has indicated its intention to legislate a goal of net- zero emissions (though it is unclear if this refers to just CO2 or all GHGs) by 2050; South Africa, which aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050; and Argentina and Mexico, which are both part of the UNFCCC Climate Ambition Alliance working towards net-zero emissions by 2050.

As at mid-November 2020, nine G20 members (Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States of America) have submitted long-term low GHG development strategies to the UNFCCC, all of which were submitted before net-zero emissions goals were adopted. No G20 member has officially submitted a new or updated NDC target. \u25b6 Although the recent announcements of net- zero emissions goals are very encouraging, they highlight the vast discrepancy between the ambitiousness of these goals and the inadequate level of ambition in the NDCs for 2030. Furthermore, there is inconsistency between the emission levels implied by current policies and those projected under current NDCs by 2030, and, more importantly, those necessary for achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. \u25b6 To make significant progress towards achieving the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement by 2030, two steps are urgently required. First, more countries need to develop long-term strategies that are consistent with the Paris Agreement, and second, new and updated NDCs need to become consistent with the net-zero emissions goals. XVIII Emissions Gap Report 2020 5. Collectively, G20 members are projected to overachieve their modest 2020 Cancun Pledges, but they are not on track to achieve their NDC commitments. Nine G20 members are on track to achieve their 2030 NDC commitments, five members are not on track, and for two members there is a lack of sufficient information to determine this. \u25b6 In line with previous Emissions Gap Reports, this report pays close attention to G20 members, as they account for around 78 per cent of global GHG emissions and thereby largely determine global emission trends and the extent to which the 2030 emissions gap will be closed. \u25b6 Collectively, the G20 members are projected to overachieve their 2020 Cancun Pledges, even without considering the expected impact of COVID-19. According to the latest pre-COVID-19 scenario studies, South Africa is now projected to likely achieve its Cancun Pledge. The United States of America is also projected to achieve its Cancun Pledge, though only when the expected impact of COVID-19 is considered. It is still unlikely or uncertain whether Canada, Indonesia, Mexico and the Republic of Korea will achieve their Cancun Pledges, even when COVID-19 implications are considered. \u25b6 Collectively, the G20 members are not on track to achieve their unconditional NDC commitments based on pre-COVID-19 projections. Nine of the 16 G20 members (counting the EU27+UK as one), are on track (Argentina, China, EU27+UK, India, Japan, Mexico, the Russian Federation, South Africa and Turkey). Five G20 members are projected to fall short and therefore require further action (Australia, Brazil, Canada, the Republic of Korea and the United States of America). Projections for Indonesia and Saudi Arabia are inconclusive. \u25b6 The impacts of COVID-19 and economic recovery measures on 2030 emissions of individual G20 members may be significant, although estimates are still highly uncertain and vary across the few studies available.

In line with the findings of previous editions of the Emissions Gap Report, countries must collectively increase their NDC ambitions threefold to get on track to a 2\u00b0C goal and more than fivefold to get on track to the 1.5\u00b0C goal. \u25b6 The lack of sufficient mitigation action to date has added significantly to the challenge of meeting the Paris Agreement goals. Global average emissions reductions required per year to meet emission levels by 2030 that are consistent with the 2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C scenarios have increased remarkably. By now, they are approximately more than double and four times what they would have been respectively had serious collective climate action started in 2010. Failure to significantly reduce global emissions by 2030 will make it impossible to keep global warming below 1.5\u00b0C. \u25b6 Unconditional NDCs are consistent with limiting warming to 3.2\u00b0C by the end of the century (66 per cent probability). If both conditional and unconditional NDCs are fully implemented, this estimate is 0.2\u00b0C lower. The pre-COVID-19 current policies scenario, on the other hand, results in higher emissions by 2030, which unless strengthened would result in an average global temperature rise of 3.5\u00b0C by 2100. \u25b6 COVID-19 containment measures have significantly reduced global GHG emissions in 2020. However, unless these are followed by economic rescue and recovery measures that support a low-carbon transition, this dip in global GHG emissions is estimated to result in no more than a 0.01\u00b0C reduction of global warming by 2050, which by then is expected to have exceeded 1.5\u00b0C. \u25b6 The temperature projections change when considering the potential effects of the recently announced net-zero emissions goals. Preliminary estimates suggest that, collectively, these goals could further lower the temperature projections consistent with unconditional NDCs by about half a degree Celsius to around 2.7\u00b0C. If the United States of America also adopts a net-zero GHG target by 2050, as suggested in the Biden-Harris climate plan, projections until the end of the century are estimated to be 0.6\u00b0C\u20130.7\u00b0C lower in aggregate compared with the global warming estimate for current unconditional NDCs, i.e. around 2.5\u20132.6\u00b0C. 8. COVID-19-related fiscal spending by governments is of unprecedented scale, currently amounting to roughly US$12 trillion globally, or 12 per cent of global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020. For G20 members, fiscal spending amounts to around 15 per cent of GDP on average for 2020. \u25b6 To date, most governments have focused on funding rescue measures to protect lives and businesses in their immediate economic response to COVID-19, with some including conditions that encourage businesses to decarbonize. Given the varied COVID-19 impacts and response timelines, some governments are also starting to fund recovery measures to reinvigorate their economies. \u25b6 There are large disparities in fiscal spending around the world. Average fiscal spending of G20 members currently hovers around 15 per cent, reaching as high as 40 per cent for some members. For middle-income and developing countries, however, this figure is much lower at less than 6 per cent of GDP. 9. So far, the opening for using fiscal rescue and recovery measures to stimulate the economy while simultaneously accelerating a low- carbon transition has largely been missed. It is not too late to seize future opportunities, without which achieving the Paris Agreement goals is likely to slip further out of reach. \u25b6 As at October 2020, COVID-19 fiscal spending has primarily supported the global status quo of high- carbon economic production or had neutral effects on GHG emissions. While it is understandable that immediate rescue measures were directed to incumbent industry, later rescue and recovery measures could have supported low-carbon development, without forsaking opportunities for economic gain. \u25b6 Based on four main trackers of COVID-19 fiscal investments, few G20 members have put words into action in terms of low-carbon rescue and recovery measures (i.e. those resulting in reduced GHG emissions). Around one-quarter of G20 members have dedicated shares of their spending (up to 3 per cent of GDP) explicitly to low-carbon measures. For most, spending has been predominantly high- carbon (implying net negative effects on GHG XXII Emissions Gap Report 2020 Figure ES.6.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5c25e904-a2c0-4cf0-9997-f5799ee5cdf3": {"__data__": {"id_": "5c25e904-a2c0-4cf0-9997-f5799ee5cdf3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2020", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6aa2c62f34b9d6298aed888a4119dc19336be20f4fc771a048941c321e8de72a"}, "2": {"node_id": "0fc2f861-62cc-4900-9e2c-94afeca7493f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b473931ae77be626b788d928f3c392fff8b8a121ff4269942aa42d15f41167bc"}}, "hash": "f8138cff13167ae88138666bfe4fbad734c39b73fb5e874308846e17bb7a09a3", "text": "Non-exhaustive overview of total fiscal rescue and recovery measures of G20 members with high-carbon, neutral and low-carbon effects as a share of 2019 GDP High-carbon effects Low-carbon effects Neutral / Unclear (in %) 3 2 1 0 3 2 1 0 USA UK Turkey South Africa Saudi Arabia Russia Mexico Republic of Korea Japan Italy Indonesia India Germany France China Brazil Australia Argentina Canada European Union", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5331e0e4-921e-4ddd-ad8a-45fbef7bf379": {"__data__": {"id_": "5331e0e4-921e-4ddd-ad8a-45fbef7bf379", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2020", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8e4aa4bd85d6c9b598dc5168226902cfaf828deac8b2cf0b4557b524ba1400da"}, "3": {"node_id": "1765aade-e4b4-4a5a-a356-ab18e6f0f92e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9e45aa6c1fbe1076eb5d014d5a1846ca884629c0375446badf852a06c10b4876"}}, "hash": "238e813591e856252e57e7f81d927f8d41fe9fa6d3be1e8b07b72e9a3034363c", "text": "Oxford Recovery Project 4.6% IMF 5.1% Vivid Economics 5.8% Oxford Recovery Project 21.7% IMF 13.0% Vivid Economics 11.7% Oxford Recovery Project 9.01% IMF 10.8% Vivid Economics 12.1% Oxford Recovery Project 14.3% IMF 15.3% Vivid Economics 16.5% Oxford Recovery Project 10.4% Climate Action Tracker 14.3% IMF 5.9% Vivid Economics 4.3% Oxford Recovery Project 20.0% IMF 18.3% Vivid Economics 16.1% Oxford Recovery Project 36.3% IMF 37.9% Vivid Economics 34.3% Oxford Recovery Project 10.1% Climate Action Tracker 3.0% 6.3% IMF 6.3% Vivid Economics 9.2% Oxford Recovery Project 7.4% IMF 3.5% Vivid Economics 3.6% Oxford Recovery Project 36.4% IMF 34.74% Vivid Economics 27.7% Oxford Recovery Project 11.1% 23.2% IMF 33.6% Vivid Economics 42.7% Oxford Recovery Project 32.4% Climate Action Tracker 5.9% IMF 13.2% Vivid Economics 17.7% Oxford Recovery Project 1.7% IMF 0.9% Vivid Economics 1.0% Oxford Recovery Project 2.1% IMF 2.9% Vivid Economics 3.3% Oxford Recovery Project 10.8% IMF 2.7% Vivid Economics 4.4% Oxford Recovery Project 9.9% IMF 6.9% Vivid Economics 7.5% Oxford Recovery Project 8.6% IMF 11.8% Vivid Economics 9.5% Oxford Recovery Project 35.2% IMF 23.8% Vivid Economics 21.6% Oxford Recovery Project 14.9% Climate Action Tracker 11.6% IMF 13.3% Vivid Economics 13.4% Climate Action Tracker 5.4% 4.9% Vivid Economics 9.7% XXIII Emissions Gap Report 2020 emissions) or neutral (having no discernible effects on GHG emissions). In a number of cases, it is still unclear what effect countries\u2019 measures will have on GHG emissions (figure ES.6). \u25b6 Policies with positive impacts on reducing GHG emissions have been slightly more prevalent in fiscal recovery measures than rescue measures. This is noteworthy, as the next stages of COVID-19 fiscal interventions are likely to shift a greater proportion of capital towards recovery measures, indicating that there is potential for increased implementation of low-carbon measures. \u25b6 It is still in the hands of policymakers whether global economic rescue and recovery responses to the COVID-19 pandemic will lead to decreased or increased global GHG emissions in the longer term. The future can still be shaped through decisions yet to be made on the composition and implementation of announced recovery packages and future recovery actions. 10. Early COVID-19 fiscal rescue and recovery measures provide valuable insight for policymakers designing measures for the immediate future. \u25b6 Many fiscal rescue and recovery measures can simultaneously support rapid, employment- intensive and cost-effective economic recovery and a low-carbon transition. Broad categories include: \u25cf support for zero-emissions technologies and infrastructure, for example, low-carbon and renewable energy, low-carbon transport, zero- energy buildings and low-carbon industry \u25cf support for research and development of zero- emissions technologies \u25cf fossil fuel subsidies through fiscal reform \u25cf nature-based solutions, including large-scale landscape restoration and reforestation. \u25b6 Conversely, some fiscal rescue and recovery measures are likely to perpetuate high-carbon and environmentally damaging development. These include: \u25cf fossil fuel-based infrastructure investments or fiscal incentives for high-carbon technologies and projects \u25cf waivers or rollbacks of environmental regulations \u25cf bailouts of fossil fuel-intensive companies without conditions for low-carbon transition or environmental sustainability (such as airlines, internal combustion automotive companies, industrial industries and fossil energy companies). 11. Domestic and international shipping and aviation currently account for around 5 per cent of global CO2 emissions and are projected to increase significantly. International emissions from shipping and aviation are not covered under the NDCs and, based on current trends, are projected to consume between 60 and 220 per cent of allowable CO2 emissions by 2050 under IPCC illustrative 1.5\u00b0C scenarios (figure ES.7). \u25b6 Combined, the shipping and aviation sectors currently account for approximately 2 GtCO2 per year (distributed evenly across the two sectors) and emissions have increased in the past decades.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1765aade-e4b4-4a5a-a356-ab18e6f0f92e": {"__data__": {"id_": "1765aade-e4b4-4a5a-a356-ab18e6f0f92e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2020", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8e4aa4bd85d6c9b598dc5168226902cfaf828deac8b2cf0b4557b524ba1400da"}, "2": {"node_id": "5331e0e4-921e-4ddd-ad8a-45fbef7bf379", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "238e813591e856252e57e7f81d927f8d41fe9fa6d3be1e8b07b72e9a3034363c"}}, "hash": "9e45aa6c1fbe1076eb5d014d5a1846ca884629c0375446badf852a06c10b4876", "text": "About 71 per cent of the CO2 emissions from shipping and 65 per cent of emissions from aviation are international and are not included in national totals reported to the UNFCCC but are instead added as memo items.

However, because ships and aircraft are often active on both domestic and international routes, there are synergies in addressing domestic and international shipping and aviation emissions. 12. Current policy frameworks to address emissions are weak and additional policies are required to bridge the gap between the current trajectories of shipping and aviation and GHG emissions pathways consistent with the Paris Agreement temperature goals. Changes in technology, operations, fuel use and demand all need to be driven by new policies. \u25b6 International aviation currently intends to meet its International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) goals through heavily relying on carbon offsets, which do not represent absolute reductions, but at best provide time to transition to low-carbon fuels and implement energy efficiency improvements.

Current carbon offsetting is therefore not a long-term solution and its role should only be temporary. \u25b6 Improvements in technology and operations can improve the fuel efficiency of transport if policies incentivize them, but projected increases in demand (even considering potential impacts of XXIV Emissions Gap Report 2020 the current global COVID-19 pandemic) mean that the improvements will not result in decarbonization and absolute reductions of CO2 for either the aviation or shipping sectors. \u25b6 Both sectors, will therefore need to maximize their energy efficiency while rapidly transitioning away from fossil fuels. Although there are technologically mature production processes for non-fossil fuels, rapid scale-up of new production and supply chains is required and hinges on policies to mandate the use of these fuels, as their costs are much higher. \u25b6 Biofuels and synthetic kerosene from biomass or CO2 and hydrogen have lower carbon footprints than fossil hydrocarbon fuels, provided the biomass is sourced sustainably. These are probably the most realistic fuel alternatives for aviation and shipping in the short to medium term, but will compete with other uses, such as road transport. \u25b6 For ships, CO2-free ammonia is an option, given that a ship\u2019s design is less constrained than that of a plane in terms of volume, fuel mass and safety. \u25b6 The hydrogen feedstock used in ammonia and synthetic hydrocarbon fuel will only present net benefits if the production is powered by renewable electricity, CO 2 is produced from non-fossil sources, or CO2 is removed from the atmosphere. \u25b6 Long-term fuel alternatives, such as electricity or (CO2-free) hydrogen will require different aircraft and ship designs and will likely only be applicable for certain purposes. \u25b6 Regardless of the feedstock and process, the cost of fuel will increase severalfold, raising the overall cost of both aviation and shipping. This will likely supress demand, especially for aviation, which may ultimately be the most effective means to manage the sector\u2019s emissions. 13. Lifestyle changes are a prerequisite for sustaining reductions in GHG emissions and for bridging the emissions gap. Around two thirds of global emissions are linked to the private household activities according to consumption-based accounting. Reducing emissions through lifestyle changes requires changing both broader systemic conditions and individual actions. \u25b6 Lifestyle emissions are influenced by social and cultural conventions, the built environment and financial and policy frameworks. Governments have a major role in setting the conditions under which lifestyle changes can occur, through shaping policy, regulations and infrastructure investments. At the same time, it is necessary for citizens to be active participants in changing their lifestyles through taking steps to reduce personal emissions Figure ES.7.

The participation of civil society is necessary to bring about wider changes in the social, cultural, political and economic systems in which people live. \u25b6 Lifestyle emissions are linked to many sources and sectors. Foremost among these are mobility, residential and food, each of which contributes close to 20 per cent of lifestyle emissions, thus implying strong mitigation potential in these areas. For example, foregoing one long-haul return flight has the potential to reduce annual personal emissions by 1.9 tCO2e per capita on average. Home energy emissions can be tackled through improving existing and new housing stock. The use of renewable electricity by households could also reduce emissions by approximately 1.5 tCO2e per capita per year for those on higher incomes. In terms of food, shifting consumption towards low-carbon diets has strong emissions reduction potential. Moving to a vegetarian diet, for example, could reduce emissions by an average of 0.5 tCO2e per capita per year. \u25b6 There are numerous examples of good practices in both the developing and developed world that show it is possible to lead more sustainable lifestyles. Such examples include: replacing domestic short-haul flights with rail journeys and providing incentives and the infrastructure", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "53811eba-2c8a-40b3-beea-902985721e58": {"__data__": {"id_": "53811eba-2c8a-40b3-beea-902985721e58", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2020", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "75ac519f5e46a6fa681d506c5a82509ee7f67b1737e837bb8d59f4371a6bc712"}, "3": {"node_id": "9ceb5b27-f3f8-4751-b21f-56178aa17f6b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "792b796a7057b08269ab2c21d2e19454e68acd4b51d7f95ca667e935b23b17b5"}}, "hash": "cc30cd59aa99762fc6ccabeb1852679db302dd7f306b857761bc1fa974b5e664", "text": "necessary for cycling and car-sharing, while restricting petrol cars; improving the energy efficiency of housing and renewable energy defaults from grid providers; ensuring the provision of low-carbon food in the public sector and developing policies to reduce food waste. 14. Equity is central to addressing lifestyles. The emissions of the richest 1 per cent of the global population account for more than twice the combined share of the poorest 50 per cent. \u25b6 Compliance with the 1.5\u00b0C goal of the Paris Agreement will require reducing consumption emissions to a per capita lifestyle footprint of around 2\u20132.5 tCO2e by 2030. This means that the richest 1 per cent would need to reduce their current emissions by at least a factor of 30, while per capita emissions of the poorest 50 per cent could increase by around three times their current levels on average (figure ES.8). \u25b6 COVID-19 has provided insight into how rapid lifestyle changes can be brought about by governments (who must create conditions that make lifestyle changes possible), civil society actors (who must encourage positive social norms and a sense of collective agency for lifestyle changes) and infrastructure (which must support behaviour changes). The lockdown period in many countries may be long enough to establish new, lasting routines if supported by longer- term measures. In planning the recovery from COVID-19, governments have an opportunity to catalyse low-carbon lifestyle changes by disrupting entrenched practices. Figure ES.8.

The economic disruption has briefly slowed \u2013 but far from eliminated \u2013 the historic and ever-increasing burden of our activity on the Earth\u2019s climate. This burden is manifested in the continuing rise in extreme weather events, including wildfires and hurricanes, and in the melting of glaciers and of ice at both the poles. This year, Arctic sea ice cover shrank to its second lowest extent since the beginning of modern record-keeping (National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NASA] 2020), the USA is about to break the record on climate-related weather events costing more than US$1billion each (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA] 2020) and 2020 is on course to become the warmest year on record globally (CarbonBrief 2020). The year 2020 has set new records: they will not be the last. It is clear that global carbon dioxide (CO2) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2020 will experience a sizeable drop compared with 2019 levels as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. Yet, enhanced climate ambition and action remain as urgent as ever. Although 2020 GHG emissions will decline, GHG concentrations in the atmosphere continue to rise (World Meteorological Organization (WMO) 2020) and the immediate reduction in emissions caused by COVID-19 lockdown measures is assessed to have a negligible long- term impact on climate change (Forster et al. 2020). How governments around the world respond to COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 recovery will be critical to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. The unprecedented scale of COVID-19 economic recovery measures offers an opening for a low-carbon transition that creates the structural changes required for sustained emission reductions.

These commitments are broadly consistent with the Paris Agreement temperature goal, provided they are achieved globally. The litmus test of these announcements will be the extent to which they are reflected in near-term policy action and in significantly more ambitious NDCs for the period to 2030. 1.2 Focus and approach of the report Each year, the Emissions Gap Report provides an updated assessment of the gap between estimated future global GHG emissions if countries implement their climate mitigation pledges, and the global emission levels from least-cost pathways that are aligned with achieving the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to well below 2\u00b0C and pursuing 1.5\u00b0C. This difference between where we will likely be and where we need to be is known as the \u2018emissions gap\u2019. The reports also look at opportunities for bridging the emissions gap. This year, the report focuses on three areas that are highly relevant for our ability to bridge the gap and that have become even more pertinent in the wake of COVID-19: i) the role of COVID-19 fiscal rescue and recovery measures in the global transition to decarbonization; ii) the role and opportunities for reducing emissions from the shipping and aviation sectors, where international emissions are not covered by the NDCs; and iii) the role of lifestyle change in decarbonization. 2 Emissions Gap Report 2020 Reflecting the unusual circumstances of 2020, this year's report deviates from its usual approach of exclusively considering consolidated data from previous years as the basis for assessment. To maximize its policy relevance, preliminary assessments of the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated rescue and recovery measures are included throughout the report. As in previous years, this Emissions Gap Report has been prepared by an international team consisting of 51 leading scientists from 35 expert institutions across 18 countries, assessing all available information, including that published in the context of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, as well as in other recent scientific studies. The assessment process has been overseen by a distinguished steering committee and has been transparent and participatory. All chapters have undergone an extensive external review process. In addition, the assessment methodology and preliminary findings were made available to the governments of the countries specifically mentioned in the report in order to provide them with the opportunity to comment on the findings. 1.3 Structure of the report The report is organized into six chapters, including this introduction. Chapter 2 assesses the trends in global GHG emissions and G20 member progress towards their Cancun Pledges in 2020 and their NDCs in 2030. In addition, it considers the potential implications of COVID-19 on G20 emissions projections. Chapter 3 updates the assessment of the likely emissions gap in 2030. Furthermore, the chapter provides a preliminary assessment of how COVID-19 and associated rescue and recovery measures may impact global GHG emissions in 2030 under various scenarios. The chapter then looks at the implications of the emissions gap on the feasibility of achieving the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. Chapter 4 assesses the size and extent to which COVID-19 fiscal rescue and recovery measures to date can be said to support low-carbon or high-carbon development. It also outlines emerging lessons for governments in the pursuit of a low-carbon economic recovery. The two final chapters of this year's report cover areas that have received limited attention in previous Emissions Gap Reports, but that receive much international attention and have been particularly affected by COVID-19. Chapter 5 looks at the trends and opportunities for decarbonizing the shipping and aviation sectors, with a particular focus on international transport. Finally, chapter 6 assesses the role and opportunities for reducing GHG emissions through lifestyle and behavioural change, paying particular attention to inequalities in per capita emissions within and across countries and the systemic changes necessary to support and induce lifestyle change.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "87809396-4f88-4151-9cef-a5c67986fee3": {"__data__": {"id_": "87809396-4f88-4151-9cef-a5c67986fee3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2020", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "23bd2adfdd733f3384a089cf26ef7aebfe3099435fbc7aadc1e82a067afb24a5"}, "2": {"node_id": "9f356d59-fe7a-42a2-8cf2-d1682b26edca", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b06e57df011d6e401217b5ed0118b96ad71af3d69ca96d55215d5727510747b6"}}, "hash": "a04993692cbdf974911bca5f9c7020ca27b8b8b782f34241b4d7fff03dafd242", "text": "Emissions Gap Report 2020 3 Global emissions trends and G20 status and outlook Lead authors: Takeshi Kuramochi (NewClimate Institute, Germany), Michel den Elzen (PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, the Netherlands) and Glen P.

Throughout the chapter, the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on emissions in 2020 and by 2030 are considered. The chapter is organized as follows: section 2.2 takes stock of the current trends in total global GHG and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuel use and industry-related sources. These trends are discussed in the context of global peaking of emissions and general economic trends. Sections 2.3 and 2.4 assess G20 members\u2019 progress, both collectively and individually, towards their Cancun Pledges and NDCs.1 The assessment covers all individual G20 members and regions, including the European Union and its three individual Member States (France, Germany and Italy), as well as the United Kingdom (hereafter EU27+UK) as one member.2 Section 2.5 provides an update of announced net-zero emissions goals and the implications for short- to medium-term action in the context of new and updated NDCs. 1 Turkey has not ratified the Paris Agreement, so its 2030 target remains an intended nationally determined contribution (INDC). Hereinafter, both INDCs and NDCs are referred to as NDCs, except when specifically referring to Turkey\u2019s INDC. 2 The United Kingdom has left the European Union but is in a transition period until the end of 2020, during which the NDC submitted by the European Union still applies to it. 3 This change was made to be more in line with the decisions made at the twenty-fourth session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 24) in Katowice, where Parties agreed to use GWPs from the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) for reporting reasons. However, a full switch to using AR5 GWPs in this report is not yet possible as the literature is still not up to date on this decision. All GHG emission figures in this report are expressed using the 100-year global warming potentials (GWPs) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4),3 unless otherwise noted. With regard to historical emissions data, section 2.2 uses globally consistent and independent data sets rather than officially reported United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) inventory reports, whereas sections 2.3 and 2.4 use UNFCCC inventory reports when comparing historical emissions to individual G20 members\u2019 NDC targets. Please see Annex I for more information about the definitions of scenarios, GWPs and land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) accounting used in the chapter. The methodology and preliminary findings of this chapter were made available to the governments of the countries specifically mentioned to provide them with the opportunity to comment on the findings. Emissions Gap Report 2020 4 2.2 Current global emissions: status and trends 2.2.1 GHG emissions up to 2019 Global trends GHG emissions grew in 2019 for the third consecutive year, indicating that the slowdown in emissions growth during 2015 and 2016 was short-lived (figure 2.1). Since 2010, GHG emissions (excluding land-use change (LUC)) have grown 1.4 per cent per year on average, with preliminary data suggesting a 1.1 per cent increase in 2019. When including the more uncertain and variable emissions from LUC, global GHG emissions also grew 1.4 per cent per year since 2010 on average, but increased a more rapid 2.6 per cent in 2019 4 Emissions data used in this report are based on analysis from EDGAR (Crippa et al. 2020), PBL (Olivier and Peters 2020, in preparation) and the Global Carbon Project (GCP) for LUC.

The presented uncertainty ranges are consistent with IPCC AR5 (Blanco et al. 2014). GWPs are from the IPCC AR4. All estimates for 2019 emissions should be considered preliminary. Uncertainties are added in quadrature and assumed independent. 5 Fossil CO2 emissions include CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and from carbonates. 6 In this report, CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry grew 0.9 per cent in 2019 (Crippa et al. 2020). The updated Global Carbon Budget estimates that fossil fuel emissions grew 0.1 per cent in 2019 (Friedlingstein et al. in review). Most other estimates do not include process emissions from cement manufacturing. EDGAR estimates that process emissions from cement manufacturing grew 5.1 per cent in 2019, while the GCP estimates 3.3 per cent in 2019. For combustion-related emissions only, BP estimated a 0.5 per cent growth in emissions (BP 2020), with the IEA and GCP both estimating no change (IEA 2020b), which differs to the EDGAR estimate of 0.6 per cent. The differences in these estimates for 2019 (EDGAR and BP versus GCP and IEA) are primarily due to uncertainty in the growth of Chinese coal use in 2019. due to a significant increase in forest fires, particularly in Asia and the Amazon. GHG emissions4 reached a record high of 52.4 GtCO2e (range: \u00b15.2) in 2019 without LUC emissions and increased by 5.5 GtCO2 (range: \u00b12.6) when including the more uncertain LUC, which pushes the total to 59.1 GtCO2e (range: \u00b15.9) (fi gure 2.1). Land-use emission estimates used in this report are based on the average of two separate models (leading to higher overall emissions) (Friedlingstein et al. 2019) and included CO2 and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from LUC (Olivier and Peters 2020, in preparation). If the same data set was used as in previous years (Houghton and Nassikas 2017; blue dotted line in figure 2.1), global 2019 emissions would have been lower at 57.1 GtCO2e or 56.7 GtCO2e if excluding methane (CH4) and N2O emissions from LUC.

From 2014 to 2016 GHG emissions showed little to no growth due to a reduction in coal use, but started to grow again from 2016. In the last decade, GHG emissions have grown 2.4 per cent on average, growing 3.1 per cent in 2019 to reach a record high 14.0 GtCO2e. Chinese coal use may have peaked in 2013, but that peak may be crossed given its growth from 2016 onwards.

In today\u2019s globalized world there is a weakened connection between where goods and services are purchased (consumed) and where emissions occur. Consumption- based emissions are allocated to countries where goods and services are consumed, which differs to territorial-based emissions, as they exclude national emissions required to produce exported products, instead including emissions from other countries to import products (consumption ~ territorial \u2013 exports + imports). Rich countries generally tend to have higher consumption-based emissions (fi gure 2.3), Emissions Gap Report 2020 7 as they have cleaner production, relatively more services and more imports of primary and secondary products. In the 2000s, the gap between consumption and production was growing in rich countries but stabilized following the 2007\u20132008 global financial crisis (Pan et al. 2017). Despite rich countries having greater consumption-based emissions than territorial-based emissions, both have declined at similar rates in the last decade (Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al. 2019). Consumption-based emissions can also be used to allocate emissions to the products purchased (food, clothing, electronic products), and not the sectors emitting (agriculture, electricity, industry). Although consumption- based emissions are more uncertain, they provide additional information to help refine climate policies (see chapter 6). Figure 2.3.

Source: Friedlingstein et al. (2019) Sector trends in GHG emissions The distribution of GHG emissions across sectors is an important consideration for policymaking (figure 2.4). Many studies primarily focus on fossil CO2 emissions (65 per cent of total global GHG emissions), which are primarily associated with energy use. The inclusion of CH4 and N2O emissions highlights the importance of the agriculture sector in emission trends. This section considers the sector distribution of all GHG emissions, including non- CO2 emissions. Energy transformation dominates GHG emissions, with electricity and heat generation accounting for 24 per cent of total GHG emissions in the last decade and other energy transformation and fugitive emissions adding another 10 per cent. Emissions from energy use in buildings and other sectors, such as agriculture and fishing, are around 7 per cent. The industry sector has significant emissions from energy use (11 per cent of total GHG emissions), in additional to industrial processes (9 per cent) from mineral products (such as cement) and other chemical reactions. The transport sector has contributed to around 14 per cent of global GHG emissions on average over the last decade, with road transport \u2013 a sector that continues to have strong growth \u2013 primarily responsible. Shipping and aviation are relatively smaller than road transport, with emissions in international territory comprising 2.2 per cent of total GHG emissions. Agriculture and waste are 15 per cent of total GHG emissions, with most emissions from enteric fermentation (ruminant animals, such as cattle), nitrogen fertilizers on agricultural soils, and municipal waste. LUC, primarily associated with agricultural activities, is around 11 per cent of the total and has larger inter-annual variations. Emissions are growing in all sectors, though there are signs that growth is slowing for electricity and heat generation, due to a stronger growth in renewables and decline in coal.

Similarly, data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) cover all countries, but do not fully capture carbon dynamics and only report five- or ten-year averages due to the relatively simple method used (Tubiello et al. in review). Furthermore, country-reported UNFCCC emission inventories only cover Annex I countries. Second, LUC is defined in several different manners. For example, the scientific community often only considers direct influences on land use, while FAO and UNFCCC emission inventories include a more expansive definition of \u2018managed lands\u2019, which captures a much larger component of the carbon sink (Grassi et al. 2018). Estimates using these different definitions should not be compared as they report quite different emissions. Emissions from LUC predominantly originate from several key countries (Tubiello et al. in review). The largest emitters from land conversions (for example, forests converted to cropland or pastures) are Brazil, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The largest managed sinks (for example, forests remaining forests) are in China, the Russian Federation, the United States of America and Brazil. When combining the conversions (sources) and managed sinks (Grassi et al. 2018), the countries with the biggest net LUC emissions are the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Brazil and Indonesia, while China, the Russian Federation and the United States of America have the largest net sinks. Reducing deforestation and enhancing carbon sinks can lead to significant emissions reductions and benefits for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services in key countries, while also greatly contributing to global mitigation efforts. How close are peak GHG emissions? Growth in global GHG emissions has averaged 1.4 per cent per year since 2010, which is lower than the growth rate of 2.4 per cent per year from 2000 to 2009. In the past decade, two years (2015 and 2016) have had almost zero growth (after removing inter-annual variations from LUC), indicating to some extent that the growth in global GHG emissions is slowing. From 2010 to 2015, GHG emissions without the variable LUC data grew at a rate of 2.2 per cent per year, which slowed to 1.2 per cent per year from 2015 to 2019. Despite the indication that global GHG emissions growth is slowing, dynamics at the country level are significantly different, with GHG emissions declining in Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) economies and increasing in non-OECD economies. Many OECD economies have had a peak in GHG emissions, as efficiency improvements, structural change and growth in low-carbon energy sources have been enough to overcome the growth in economic activity. Despite improving energy efficiency and increasing low-carbon sources, emissions continue to rise in countries with strong growth in energy use to meet development needs (Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al. 2019). Globally, emissions from coal may have peaked, with rapid declines observed in Europe and the United States of America, and slower growth in China, despite an increase in other regions. Oil and particularly gas are increasingly driving the growth in global emissions, with gas now the largest contributor to fossil CO2 emissions (Peters et al. 2020). Non-fossil energy sources continue to grow rapidly and now exceed that of fossil sources in electricity generation. However, whether these factors have been sufficient to cause global GHG Emissions Gap Report 2020 9 emissions to peak is unknown, due to the rapidly unfolding and tragic consequences of COVID-19. 2.2.2 How might COVID-19 affect GHG emissions in 2020? In response to the health crises created by COVID-19, most countries have implemented various measures to help avoid its spread. These measures have had unprecedented effects on many aspects of the global economy, and consequently emissions. This section provides a synthesis of the estimated effects of the COVID-19 crisis on emissions in 2020 based on available studies. Most studies have focused on changes in energy use and CO2 emissions, with less attention given to how non-CO2 emissions may have changed. CO2 emissions are generally estimated based on reported energy use, but these data are not available in real time. To estimate emissions during 2020, studies have used various proxy data, such as information on mobility from Google, Apple and TomTom, real-time data on electricity generation and other similar statistics that indicate activity levels. Some studies have estimated emissions for the year to date (Liu et al.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5dd9de72-22bd-48b0-b930-7d3838445742": {"__data__": {"id_": "5dd9de72-22bd-48b0-b930-7d3838445742", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2020", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9debed3da5d063563b02ec94c3e0bc609e4a0f1194448242eaaa72f0ed578e75"}, "2": {"node_id": "7fb90bd9-8eac-48a3-bcba-6bc8235b9edc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a2f9e8adfada438937c459b504127a1d93bca37805f5572475037a08f47caa83"}}, "hash": "3465ab8a61569fe5c21e306d2651a446d11295bf749818296aecf8aff3fb0a77", "text": "Some studies have estimated emissions for the year to date (Liu et al. 2020), while others have additionally estimated emissions for the full year (Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al. 2020).

(2020) focused only on changes due to the COVID-19 restrictions, finding that global daily emissions decreased a maximum of 17 per cent in April 2020, with emissions reductions for the full year estimated at 7 per cent (range: 2\u201312 per cent, updated to mid-June) if some restrictions remain to the end of 2020, which is now the case. A key driver for the uncertainty is the extent of COVID-19 restrictions for the remainder of 2020. Recent full-year estimates for 2020 emissions compared with 2019 include a decrease of 7 per cent (IEA 2020b) and 8.5 per cent (Enerdata 2020) in CO2 emissions. Based on this, emissions reductions in 2020 are likely to fall within the range of 2\u201312 per cent per cent as suggested by Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al. (2020). All studies indicate that the biggest changes have occurred in transport, as COVID-19 restrictions were targeted to limit mobility, though small reductions have also occurred in other sectors (fi gure 2.5).

Daily differences between January and October of 2019 and 2020 (Mt CO2) per day Power Ground transport Industry Residential Aviation Shipping Power Industry Ground transport Source: Liu et al. (2020) Based on these studies, the expected reduction in CO2 emissions is 7 per cent in 2020 (range: 2\u201312 per cent), with a smaller drop in GHG emissions as non-CO2 is likely to be less affected (Forster et al. 2020). The reduction is unprecedented and significantly larger than the reduction of 0.9 per cent in CO2 emissions during the 2007\u20132008 global financial crisis (0.6 per cent for all GHGs). Most relevant for climate, is how countries respond in the years beyond 2020. Previous analysis has shown that emissions often rebound after crises (Peters et al. 2012), though the nature of the rebound depends on the crisis (Hanna, Xu and Victor 2019). As the COVID-19 crisis eases emissions will rebound, but how far and how fast is highly uncertain (IEA 2020d) and depends primarily on the choices made by governments. If COVID-19 recovery packages focus on accelerating the ongoing renewable energy transition, then emissions may continue to decline depending on how large and long-term the recovery packages are (see chapter 4). Emissions Gap Report 2020 10 2.3 Achievement of Cancun Pledges by G20 members, considering the potential impact of COVID-19 Collectively, G20 members are projected to overachieve their Cancun Pledges.8 Even without consideration of the potential impacts of COVID-19, Australia, Brazil, China, EU27+UK, India, Japan, the Russian Federation, and this year, also South Africa, are projected to meet their 2020 pledges with currently implemented policies. For South Africa, the change compared with the 2019 assessment reflects revised (lower) historical emissions data as well as lower projections from the new Integrated Resource Plan (Climate Action Tracker 2019; Keramidas et al. 2020). For Australia, the Government projected in December 2019 that they would miss its \u201cpoint in time\u201d 2020 target, but will overachieve its carbon budget target for the 2013\u20132020 period (Commonwealth of Australia 2019). Several individual members (Canada, Indonesia, Mexico, the Republic of Korea and the United States of America) are still projected to miss their pledges or are not expected to achieve them with great certainty. Consideration of the potential impacts of COVID-19 is only likely to change this conclusion for the United States of America, where available assessments suggest that the country will achieve its Cancun Pledge (reducing GHG emissions to 17 per cent below 2005 levels) when accounting for the expected impact of COVID-19. The latest analysis by the U.S. Energy Information Administration projects a 10 per cent decrease in energy-related CO2 emissions in 2020 compared with 2019 (U.S. Energy Information Administration [EIA] 2020), partly due to the effects of fuel switching.

For Indonesia, it remains uncertain whether 2020 emissions would meet their Cancun Pledge, due to the uncertainty on LULUCF emissions. 8 European Union Member States are not assessed individually. Argentina, Saudi Arabia and Turkey have not made 2020 pledges. 9 Current policy scenario projections assume that no additional mitigation action is taken beyond current policies, even if it results in NDC targets not being achieved or being overachieved (United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] 2015; den Elzen et al. 2019). Current policy projections reflect all adopted and implemented policies, which for the purpose of this report are defined as legislative decisions, executive orders or their equivalent. This implies that officially announced plans or strategies alone would not qualify, while individual executive orders to implement such plans or strategies would qualify. 10 As Turkey has not ratified the Paris Agreement, its submission to the UNFCCC remains an INDC. Acknowledging this, the report refers to NDCs for simplicity in the rest of the chapter. 2.4 Assessment of G20 members\u2019 progress towards NDC targets This section assesses the progress of G20 members towards their NDC targets based on emissions projections published before the COVID-19 pandemic (section 4.2.1), and also provides some preliminary findings regarding the potential impact of COVID-19 and related policy responses on G20 emissions by 2030 (section 4.2.2). Projections of GHG emissions were compiled and reviewed to assess the emission levels expected for G20 members under existing policies (the \u2018current policies scenario\u2019)9 and whether the members are likely to meet their respective emissions reduction targets for 2030. Projections of the current policies scenario assume that no additional mitigation policies and measures are taken beyond those adopted and/or implemented as of a certain cut-off date (den Elzen et al. 2019). The progress assessment is based on the first NDCs (INDC for Turkey).10 As at mid-November 2020, no G20 member has officially submitted a new or updated NDC to reflect a revised NDC target (Japan resubmitted its original NDC target in March 2020) (United Framework Convention on Climate Change [UNFCCC] undated a). This report follows the methodology of den Elzen et al. (2019) to enable a robust comparison of projections from different data sources, including both official sources published by G20 governments and sources published by independent research institutions. European Union Member States are not assessed individually, and all projections for the European Union include the United Kingdom. The most important caveat for the 2020 assessment is the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the current policies scenario projections. As most projections to date were published or prepared before the pandemic was declared, they do not account for its potentially significant impact not only for emission trends in 2020 and 2021, but also until 2030. As previously mentioned, the impact of the pandemic on 2030 emissions projections for some individual G20 members is discussed in section 2.4.2. Other important caveats are similar to those of previous Emissions Gap Reports (adapted from den Elzen et al. 2019). First, whether a country is projected to achieve or miss its Cancun Pledge or NDC targets with existing policies depends on both the strength and stringency of the existing climate policy packages and the ambition level of the targets given structural factors (such as demographic and Emissions Gap Report 2020 11 macroeconomic trends) that shape how easy or difficult a target is to achieve. Although targets have been assessed as diverging in ambition, this report does not assess the degree of each country\u2019s efforts to achieve a certain mitigation projection, and does not assess the ambition of the targets in the context of equity principles. Countries that are projected to achieve their NDCs with existing policies are therefore not necessarily undertaking more mitigation actions than countries that are projected to miss them, and vice versa. Second, current policies scenario projections are subject to the uncertainty associated with macroeconomic trends, such as gross domestic product (GDP), population growth and technology developments, as well as the impact of policies. Some Cancun Pledges and NDCs are also subject to the uncertainty of future GDP growth and other underlying assumptions. These all add to the fundamental uncertainty resulting from COVID-19. Up-to-date emissions projections published since November 2019 were collected from official documents, namely 11 Japan\u2019s \u2018with measures\u2019 scenario is excluded as it also considers the expected impact of planned policy measures (Government of Japan 2019a) and is therefore not considered a current policy scenario under the definition used in the UNEP Emissions Gap Report series. countries\u2019 recently published National Communications and fourth biennial reports of five G20 members (\u2018with measures\u2019 scenarios).11 Estimates were", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a6917939-ccb1-4648-88c1-d0aecffd1c5a": {"__data__": {"id_": "a6917939-ccb1-4648-88c1-d0aecffd1c5a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2020", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0fae184cd5e486abe9c9910611b076a6da0acaf8766224f08b1828c18ebbbbbf"}, "3": {"node_id": "9ba6b9e3-6130-4dd6-9436-51760837cf51", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "300dec3bba735e96d0f56b2fa825a36adb5889c550e9cb88f659ea3f4f973d1b"}}, "hash": "601bf8cf7c1ae90385ad5f40853460d0d49f4f7cf55098c480115d4925f66dc3", "text": "also collected for the current policies scenario and NDC scenario projections from independent studies and several new national models and integrated assessment model studies for China, India, Japan, the Russian Federation and the United States of America through the Linking Climate and Development Policies \u2013 Leveraging International Networks and Knowledge Sharing (CD-LINKS) project (Roelfsema et al. 2020), as well as independent global studies, such as the Climate Action Tracker (2019), Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (Keramidas et al. 2020) and PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (Kuramochi et al. 2019; PBL 2020; Roelfsema et al. 2020).

(2019) 12 All emissions projections for the European Union reviewed in this report include the United Kingdom. 2.4.1 Progress assessment based on pre-COVID-19 studies This section assesses progress of G20 members towards their NDC targets based on emissions projections published before the COVID-19 pandemic, as few updates considering the potential impact of COVID-19 and related policy responses were available as at October 2020. An assessment of the potential impact of the pandemic on emissions by 2030 based on a limited set of studies is provided in section 2.4.2. Although, the emissions projections reviewed here do not consider the implications of COVID-19 on future GHG emissions, they provide important information about the impact of recent policy developments in respective G20 member countries and regions. Collectively, G20 members are not on track to achieve their unconditional NDCs based on current policies. Nine of the 16 G20 members, counting the EU27+UK as one member, are likely to achieve their unconditional NDC targets (INDC for Turkey) under current policies (fi gure 2.6). These members are Argentina (new compared with the 2019 assessment), China, EU27+UK,12 India, Japan (back in this group since the 2018 assessment), Mexico, the Russian Federation, South Africa (new) and Turkey (see table 2.3). Among them, four countries (Argentina, India, the Russian Federation and Turkey) are projected to reach emission levels that are 14\u201334 per cent lower than their respective NDC emissions target levels (fi gure 2.6). The assessment has changed compared with the 2019 assessment for the following three countries: \u25b6 Argentina is now expected to achieve its unconditional NDC target with current policies. The median projection from independent analyses has been revised downward, partially due to downward- revised economic growth and LULUCF projections (see table 2.4 for recent developments). \u25b6 For Japan, current policies scenario projections for 2030 have been close to the NDC target for the past several years. The country\u2019s GHG emissions Emissions Gap Report 2020 14 have been decreasing continually since 2013 due to increased renewable electricity generation, reduced electricity consumption and reduced total end-use energy consumption. \u25b6 For South Africa, the central estimate from independent analyses (see table 2.2) has been revised significantly downward. This is mainly due to the consideration of the recently updated Integrated Resource Plan (see table 2.4 for details) (Republic of South Africa, Department of Energy 2019) and the likelihood of its implementation, as well as the most recent national GHG inventory report that noted flattened emission trends between 2010 and 2015. Substantial changes in the current policies projections compared with the 2019 assessment are also observed for other G20 members projected to achieve their unconditional NDC targets: \u25b6 The central estimate for the EU27+UK was revised downward, meaning it is now projected to overachieve its 40 per cent GHG reduction target for 2030. The change in assessment mainly reflects that the underlying studies now account for the full implementation of directives, regulations and legislation adopted in 2018 and 2019 that comprise the Clean Planet for All policy package. According to a baseline scenario that assumes full implementation of adopted policies in climate, energy and transport, emissions for the EU27 could reduce around 45 per cent below 1990 levels by 2030 (European Commission 2020b). If the status of policy implementation is considered at the level of European Union Member States, studies indicate that additional collective effort is required both by Member States and the European Union to meet its energy efficiency target as part of the NDC (EEA 2019). Additional Member State measures are in preparation, as indicated by the national energy and climate plans submitted in 2020, which have been assessed by the European Commission as being consistent with a 41 per cent reduction (European Commission 2020a) .", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "89dbcf34-330a-4bbb-a358-e4a4b76389f4": {"__data__": {"id_": "89dbcf34-330a-4bbb-a358-e4a4b76389f4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2020", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "431cfa1c6666e3733cc9af5fc1ffd5f88225c4f777efa741126e55eeb9057fe9"}, "2": {"node_id": "fb6c7a1f-74c1-4ca2-95fc-9b20fe4745d6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "030d67a0def13434ae16a632d1fd645d8db7b00be314551c0d290c42bdd9fdec"}}, "hash": "c02adadd75342453d62305407d83787c79cfa84045d078c4376a40574072c9a1", "text": "\u25b6 The central estimate for the Russian Federation\u2019s 2030 emissions projections decreased by about 300 MtCO2e due to the independent analyses\u2019 consideration of the 2019 national GHG inventory report, which made significant downward revisions on the historical emissions data compared with previous inventory reports.

However, overall, the nation is still projected to miss its NDC target, unless policies are strengthened. Canada has acknowledged this and in September 2020 it committed to bring forward enhanced measures that will allow the country to meet and exceed its target. \u25b6 For the United States of America, the government has revised, rescinded and/or replaced regulations, but the GHG emissions projections remain similar to previous projections. The central estimate for 2025 under current policies scenario projections is still far from the NDC target level (central estimate: 5.8 GtCO2e compared with 4.7 GtCO2e). As the withdrawal of the United States of America from the Paris Agreement took effect on 4 November 2020, the country no longer has an official NDC. However, its former NDC for 2025 is still included as a reference. In November 2020, Joe Biden won the presidential election (NBC News 2020). President-elect Biden intends an immediate return to the Paris Agreement (Biden 2020). This can be achieved in 2021, without the intervention of Congress. \u25b6 For the Republic of Korea, it should be noted that the current policies scenario projections could be revised downward significantly, when the total amount of emissions allowances (caps) under Korean Emissions Trading Scheme (K-ETS) are set for years towards 2030 and reflected in the emissions projections. According to the third Master Plan for the K-ETS established in December 2019, the emissions caps for Phase III (2021\u20132025) will be strictly set to be consistent with the annual target emissions from the 2030 Greenhouse Gas Reduction Roadmap, while the emission caps for Phase IV will be set to achieve the NDC target for 2030. The emissions cap for Phase III has recently been set (see table 2.4). Figure 2.6b.

These are compared to the available studies, as indicated in brackets, and the average estimate (median for countries with five studies or more) of the current policies scenario projections across all studies with the average 2030 NDC target. 1. Current policies scenario projections from official publications were also examined. The number of scenarios that support the above findings out of the total number of official scenarios are: Australia: 1 of 1; Canada: 1 of 1; Russian Federation: 1 of 1; European Union: 2 of 4 (see chapter footnote 4). 2. Climate Action Tracker indicates that upper-end projections would miss the NDC target range. Joint Research Centre analysis projected that the European Union would almost reach the target, with less than 10 MtCO2e difference by 2030. 3. Three official studies for EU27+UK (European Commission 2018; EEA 2019; UNFCCC undated b (BR4, \u2018with measures scenario\u2019)) and one official study for EU27 (European Commission 2020b) were assessed in addition to three independent studies. The evaluation was made based on an independent analysis by PBL that took into account the best recently adopted policy packages (Kuramochi et al. 2019) and official projections that considered full implementation of current European Union-wide policies (European Commission 2018; European Commission 2020b). 4. South Africa\u2019s current policies scenario projections were compared with the upper-bound estimate of the NDC range. 5. The Korean Emissions Trading Scheme (K-ETS) is an instrument to fully achieve the country\u2019s NDC target and covers about 70 per cent of its GHG emissions. At the time when three studies containing emissions projections for the Republic of Korea were conducted, a Master Plan for K-ETS Phase III (2021\u20132025) and IV (2026\u20132030) and a National Emission Allowance Allocation Plan for Phase III were not established. Thus, the three independent studies do not explicitly assume an implementation of the emissions caps consistent with the NDC target for the phases after 2020, which partially explains why they project the Republic of Korea to miss its NDC target under current policies. Studies do not agree on whether Indonesia and Saudi Arabia are on track to meet their unconditional NDCs. For Indonesia, this mainly results from the uncertainty surrounding LULUCF emissions due to peat fires. The projection this year is considerably lower than the previous assessment due to updated GHG inventory data and the upward revision of renewable electricity generation projections (Kuramochi et al. 2019). For Saudi Arabia, the limited information about its NDC target and policies to achieve this target prevented a detailed assessment of the country\u2019s progress. Collectively, G20 members are not on track to achieve their unconditional NDCs based on current policies. The aggregate Emissions Gap Report 2020 17 emissions of G20 members by 2030 are projected to be 40.1 GtCO2e13 (range: 35.8\u201342.6 GtCO2e), which is 0.9 GtCO2e lower than projected in the 2019 report and about 26 per cent above 2010 levels (range: 7\u201348 per cent). These estimates do not consider the potential implications of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic responses, but instead reflect various factors, including the impact of policies adopted in recent years, as well as revisions in GHG inventory data, changes in emissions scenario methodologies and underlying assumptions on macroeconomic drivers. Current policies imply increased 2030 emissions compared with 2010 levels for several G20 members (Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, the Republic of Korea, Russia, Saudi Arabia and South Africa).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5325e4a6-4624-4b01-98ed-2cbce9913bd8": {"__data__": {"id_": "5325e4a6-4624-4b01-98ed-2cbce9913bd8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2020", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "42b6ad876d1e787d48b08776960a1a96f1f424e89730ef304f1a2695ba971d0d"}, "2": {"node_id": "851fbfdc-0756-42f3-869c-3937da935345", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2aacf78d9cbc07e2cc1fe00bc80e104e41d0fe08446fd9279cb5effd2b4f06e0"}}, "hash": "12ef8e476b7385a11485b6832b9ae2ef51251cd758cf45f9237b57d703744281", "text": "Collectively, G20 members need to reduce their GHG emissions further by about 0.3 GtCO2e per year by 2030 to achieve unconditional NDC target emission levels and by about 2.4 GtCO2e per year to achieve conditional NDC target emission levels.

The estimated difference between the current policies scenario and NDC scenario projections for G20 members remains similar to 2019 Emissions Gap Report projections.14 A sizeable number of policies adopted by G20 members over the past year have the potential to positively and negatively affect progress towards NDC targets (table 2.4). Many of these policies were adopted after the publication of the scenario studies reviewed in this section and were therefore not taken into account. Although several policies are expected to have positive mitigation outcomes, there are many that have negative implications for emissions, such as fossil fuel extraction projects, coal-fired power plant construction plans, and rollbacks of environmental regulations during the COVID-19 pandemic, as table 2.4 illustrates (for COVID-19 implications, see section 2.4.2 and chapter 4).

Its economic viability and attractiveness are at stake due to a plunge in oil prices and reduced demand. The Government is renegotiating its foreign debt with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), with the future of Vaca Muerta dependent on the results of these negotiations. Australia \u2022 No new renewable energy targets for post-2020 have been put forward (the 2020 target was achieved a year early). \u2022 The Government has announced plans to support investment in natural gas, in a gas-led recovery to the pandemic, including through government investment in gas infrastructure. \u2022 The Technology Investment Roadmap Discussion Paper, published in May 2020, proposes changing the remit of two renewable energy government agencies and advocates for natural gas and carbon capture and storage (CCS). \u2022 The First Low Emissions Technology Statement, published in September 2020, outlines the five technologies requiring investment for emissions reduction: clean hydrogen, energy storage, low- carbon materials, CCS and soil carbon sequestration. A new AUD 1.9 billion investment package was also announced in September 2020 to support the above activities and energy productivity, excluding support for renewable energy technologies. Brazil \u2022 The Government has recently approved the Forest+ project, which will fund environmental services linked with conservation efforts. However, rollbacks continue to hinder efforts to stop deforestation. \u2022 Three-quarters of the latest energy auction (October 2019) went to renewable energy, with the remainder going to natural gas. Solar (18 per cent) had the lowest cost of all technologies. Despite this, investments in fossil fuel energy infrastructure still dominate the current 10-year energy plan. The spring 2020 auction was postponed due the pandemic. Canada \u2022 The Minister of Environment and Climate Change reversed his 2019 decision not to subject a coal mine expansion project to a federal environmental impact assessment after claims that such action was inconsistent with Canada\u2019s founding member status of the Powering Past Coal Alliance. \u2022 Canada has announced that it will establish a Clean Power Fund to help finance the development and linking of clean energy to transmission systems, including support for an Atlantic Loop that will help the country\u2019s most eastern provinces transition away from coal-fired electricity generation. \u2022 Regulations regarding fugitive and venting CH4 emissions from upstream oil and gas production came into effect at the beginning of 2020. These regulations are part of Canada\u2019s commitment to reduce CH4 emissions in the sector by 40\u201345 per cent below 2012 levels by 2025. \u2022 Canada continues to invest in electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure and has provided funding to support EV purchase incentives as part of its sales targets for EVs of 10 per cent by 2025, 30 per cent by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2040.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3337641d-84cd-4cc5-989f-1ec6c7a51bfe": {"__data__": {"id_": "3337641d-84cd-4cc5-989f-1ec6c7a51bfe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2020", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9c0bbef6a1dc437010dcecb791b5b5a30a0e2bb1f147550660a306f6331ab33c"}}, "hash": "9c0bbef6a1dc437010dcecb791b5b5a30a0e2bb1f147550660a306f6331ab33c", "text": "Further support measures are anticipated as part of COVID-19 economic recovery measures. Emissions Gap Report 2020 19 \u2022 Mandatory carbon pricing has been in effect across Canada since 2019. Provinces and territories may implement their own pricing systems, provided that they meet certain criteria, or apply the federal system. The federal carbon pricing system consists of a charge on fossil fuels and a regulated emissions trading system for heavy industry. For direct pricing systems in Canada, the carbon price is CAD 30/tCO2e in 2020, which will rise to CAD 10/year to CAD 50/tCO2e in 2022. Some provinces have challenged the constitutionality of the carbon pricing legislation, with lower courts split on the issue. Canada\u2019s top court heard the case in September 2020 and reserved judgment. China \u2022 The new coal-fired power monitor up to 2023 allows or restricts provinces to permit construction of new coal-fired power plants. Restrictions were rolled back compared with the 2019 monitor, with more provinces permitted to construct new plants. \u2022 The target for the new energy vehicles (NEVs) market share in total car sales was raised from 20 per cent to 25 per cent by 2025, with the Government extending the NEV purchase tax exemption programme and subsidies programme until 2022. \u2022 Partly in response to COVID-19, the Government will prioritize acceleration of its New Infrastructure Plan. In 2020, China added 200,000 EV charging facilities nationwide, which is an increase of about 16.5 per cent compared with 2019. As at October 2020, 21 ultra-high voltage (UHV) power transmission projects have been commissioned, six of which are under construction. Infrastructure to connect large-scale rural renewable projects to densely populated areas, along with new inter-city high-speed rail networks will also be promoted. \u2022 China will scale up its NDC by adopting more vigorous policies and measures. China aims to peak CO2 emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060 (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People\u2019s Republic of China 2020). European Union \u2022 The European Union adopted the European Green Deal to become climate neutral by 2050 in December 2019. The European Green Deal includes the development of a climate law, which was proposed by the European Commission in March 2020 and is in discussion between the European Council and European Parliament. \u2022 In July 2020, the European Council (European Union Heads of State and government) agreed on the main elements of a proposed recovery package known as NextGenerationEU. This package is additional to the European Union\u2019s 2021\u20132027 budget and would total EUR 750 billion in grants and loans. Thirty per cent of NextGenerationEU funds and the European Union\u2019s long-term budget for 2021\u20132027 have been earmarked for climate action. All funds will support the 2030 climate target and 2050 climate neutrality objective. \u2022 In September 2020, the European Commission proposed that the European Union increase its domestic emissions target to at least 55 per cent below 1990 levels by 2030 (including LULUCF). In October 2020, the European Parliament voted for a reduction of 60 per cent. Considerations are ongoing in the European Council on how to revise the target. India \u2022 No new coal-fired power plants were built in the first half of 2020 and the country\u2019s coal fleet shrank by 0.3 GW. However, there are still plans to expand coal-fired power generation in the future. Domestic coal production could reach record levels in 2020. \u2022 India plans to expand solar investments in its agriculture sector to develop 25 GW of capacity by 2022 through the Pradhan Mantri-Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthan (PM-KUSUM) scheme. (At the national level, India has a renewable energy capacity target of 175 GW by 2022). \u2022 The second phase of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME II) project, which came into effect in April 2019, provides support to EV purchases and charging infrastructure. \u2022 Indian railways aims to completely electrify the network by 2023 and in July 2020 announced its plans to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030. Emissions Gap Report 2020 20 Indonesia \u2022 In January 2020, the Government put a cap on domestic coal below market value to boost consumption. It also plans to subsidize fuel for industries and businesses using roughly 14 per cent of the budget reserved for its National Economic Recovery programme. \u2022 Indonesia has postponed the 2020 geothermal auctions, with the demand for solar photovoltaic (PV) panels dropping 70 per cent during the pandemic, due to reduced household and government spending for rooftop installations.

Mexico \u2022 Mexico passed a bill on fiscal support to its state-owned petroleum company (Pemex), which would allow Pemex to continue its investments in oil exploration and extraction. \u2022 The Government established a policy to strengthen energy security in the country, which effectively halts private renewable energy investment in Mexico and prioritizes state-owned fossil fuel-fired power plants supplied with coal, heavy oil and natural gas. However, as the judiciary processes against this policy are still ongoing, the renewable electricity dispatch continues and its use has not been affected. No significant renewable power capacity has been added in 2020, with the dispatch of renewables in the country\u2019s electricity matrix (excluding large hydropower) reaching just 13 per cent in September 2020. Republic of Korea \u2022 The Ninth Electricity Plan is currently in development, but its draft already includes electricity generation targets that are lower for coal and nuclear and higher for renewables and natural gas, compared with the Eighth Electricity Plan. The new plan\u2019s targets for 2034 are 17 per cent for nuclear, 15 per cent for coal, 32.3 per cent for natural gas and 40 per cent for renewables. \u2022 The Government\u2019s Green New Deal includes a plan to boost renewable energy deployment (with the focus on offshore wind farms and building installations) and low-carbon infrastructure, as well as support to build a smart grid for efficient energy management and put 1.13 million EVs and 200,000 hydrogen vehicles on the roads by 2025. \u2022 In October 2020, the National Emission Allowance Allocation Plan for Phase III (2021\u20132025) was established. The plan sets the total emission allowances (caps) for Phase III. According to the plan, the portion of allowances allocated through an auction is being increased to 10 per cent, with the number of industries that have a benchmark methodology applied for free allocation also set to increase compared with Phase II. Russian Federation \u2022 The long-delayed 2035 Energy Strategy was adopted in June 2020, which focuses on expanding fossil fuel production, exports and domestic consumption. Plans for expanding renewable energy generation are absent. \u2022 A draft energy efficiency plan, published in August 2020, sets a 2030 target of reducing total energy intensity of GDP by 20 per cent below 2017 levels. Emissions Gap Report 2020 21 Saudi Arabia \u2022 The Government launched the third round of its National Renewable Energy Program, tendering 1.2 GW of solar PV. Rounds 1 and 2 tendered around 2.2 GW of solar PV in total. \u2022 As part of the economic recovery response to the pandemic, the Government has temporarily increased consumers\u2019 electricity subsidies in commercial, industrial and agriculture sectors. These subsidies provide additional support to the electricity system, powered almost exclusively by fossil fuels. South Africa \u2022 South Africa has revised its 2011 Integrated Resource Plan. The 2019 Integrated Resource Plan aims to decommission over 35 GW (of 42 GW currently operating) of Eskom\u2019s coal generation capacity by 2050 (5.4 GW by 2022 and 10.5 GW by 2030). The plan also includes the construction of 7.2 GW of new coal capacity, 15.8 GW of wind capacity and 7.4 GW of solar capacity by 2030. \u2022 In 2020, the chemicals and energy group Sasol announced the launch of a 2030 emissions road map for its South African operations. The road map details its path to at least a 10 per cent reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 compared with a 2017 baseline, and was developed with a long-term view. Turkey \u2022 Turkey continues to expand its coal-fired power generation with almost 32 GW of planned capacity in various stages of planning; 1.3 GW of this is currently under construction. \u2022 Turkey announced that it would seek tenders for small-scale renewable projects of 1 GW in total in early 2021. Some renewable energy auctions have already taken place, such as the 1 GW solar PV auction in 2017 and two 1 GW onshore wind auctions in 2017 and 2019, respectively. \u2022 Since 2019, Turkey has had the energy saving target of 15 per cent for public buildings, which it aims to achieve by 2023 as part of its National Energy Efficiency Action Plan 2017\u20132023.

However, a comprehensive strategy for the sector has not yet been developed. \u2022 The United Kingdom was considering moving its ban on new petrol and diesel cars forward by five years from 2040 to 2035 and held public consultations at the beginning of 2020. In November 2020, the Government announced it was considering more ambitious plans to bring the ban forward by 10 years to 2030. A decarbonization plan for the entire transport sector is expected by the end of the year. United States of America \u2022 The United States of America withdrew from the Paris Agreement on 4 November 2020. \u2022 The Clean Power Plan, which aimed to reduce emissions from the power sector by 32 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, is being replaced with the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) plan. ACE limits the scope of the plan to efficiency measures or CCS technologies. It is currently under at least two legal challenges. \u2022 The Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule revised fuel efficiency standards set by the previous Administration to less stricter ones. The SAFE rule now requires automakers to improve the fuel efficiency of their light duty vehicles by 1.5 per cent annually (previously 5 per cent) and to reach 40 miles per gallon by 2025 (previously set at 54 miles per gallon). The rule also revokes California\u2019s waiver to set its own emission standards for cars and trucks that are stricter than the federal standards.

(2020) To supplement these findings presented, figure 2.7 shows projected per capita GHG emissions for the 16 G20 members, counting the European Union, its three Member States and the United Kingdom as one (EU27+UK), under the current policies and unconditional NDC scenarios based on independent studies and 2010 historical data Emissions Gap Report 2020 22 from national GHG inventories.15 G20 members are shown in decreasing order of NDC emissions projections. Overall, average G20 annual emissions per capita by 2030 are projected to decline compared with 2010 levels under the unconditional NDC scenario. The figure illustrates that there are large differences in per capita emission levels across G20 members. For example, the projected per capita emissions of India are about half of the G20 average, whereas Saudi Arabia\u2019s per capita emissions are projected to reach three times the G20 average by 2030. All but five G20 members (the European Union, India, Indonesia, Mexico and Turkey) are projected to still emit more than the 2010 15 Note that the 2010 estimates are not the same as those in the bottom panel of figure 2.2 due to the differences in data sources and the consideration of land-use sector emissions. 16 Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan, Mexico, the Republic of Korea, Turkey and the United States of America. G20 average (7 tCO2e per capita) by 2030 under current policies. For comparison, the G20 average per capita emissions consistent with 2\u00b0C warming would roughly be around 5 tCO2e per capita by 2030 (authors\u2019 estimate based on den Elzen et al. 2019). Among OECD members,16 the EU27+UK performs well in terms of both absolute and per capita emission levels by 2030 and their change rates compared with 2010 levels, although it should be noted that their consumption-based emissions are considerably higher as shown in figure 2.3. Mexico also performs well in terms of the projected development of per capita emissions under both current policies and NDC scenarios. Figure 2.7.

By nature, these findings are highly uncertain. First, the literature assessing these potential impacts is sparse and based on very limited information about how COVID-19 has affected the economy and subsequently GHG emissions across G20 members in 2020. Second, the literature adopts simplistic and speculative assumptions about the longer- term impacts of COVID-19 and associated responses. Third, a comparison of pre- and post-COVID-19 projections Emissions Gap Report 2020 23 requires distinguishing the impact of COVID-19 and associated responses from the impact of other factors, such as recently adopted policies unrelated to COVID-19, the use of updated national GHG inventory data for years 2019 and earlier, and methodological changes. A synthesis of the literature on COVID-19 stimulus measures implemented in key emitting economies is presented in chapter 4. Looking at individual G20 members, multiple CO2 and/or GHG emissions scenario studies are available for seven G20 members (table 2.5). Note that the studies included in table 2.5 are not fully comparable due to differences in the coverage of GHGs and sectors, the scenarios examined and scenario definitions across studies. That said, studies on the United States of America seem to agree on the magnitude of the COVID-19 impact on 2030 emissions projections, noting a reduction of around 5\u201310 per cent compared with pre- COVID-19 projections. Two studies (Climate Action Tracker 2020c; IEA 2020e) also indicate that India may see larger reductions by 2030 compared with other major emitters. Table 2.5.

Emissions Gap Report 2020 24 As at November 2020, 126 countries covering 51 per cent of global GHG emissions are covered by net-zero goals that are formally adopted, announced or under consideration (Climate Action Tracker 2020a, based on Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit 2020).17 If the United States of America were to also adopt a net-zero GHG target by 2050, as suggested", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8d771a25-5a05-4e1c-bf6f-c6d3ed44d69a": {"__data__": {"id_": "8d771a25-5a05-4e1c-bf6f-c6d3ed44d69a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2020", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "88120e06b4c66cd78c2c199ae12461b1b34a1ffd43c06075b1c210e7bbaefff7"}, "3": {"node_id": "223c71ba-2552-49a7-a779-7c84c3d2bdb2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "311fd05b96152d7a65d769e3e94286b625d51eb92818bee41066f2f23e65cb2c"}}, "hash": "b8c9cfa6960510b0699ba1a2e677ccd2abb139121736ddbd4cdea549f5b0aa7d", "text": "in the Biden-Harris climate plan (Biden 2020), the share could increase up to 63 per cent. Of the G20 members, the following have net-zero emissions goals: \u25b6 France legally enshrined its goal to achieve net- zero GHG emissions by 2050 (Journal officiel de la R\u00e9publique Fran\u00e7aise 2019). \u25b6 The United Kingdom legally enshrined its 2050 net- zero GHG emissions goal (United Kingdom 2019). \u25b6 The European Union aims to be climate neutral through achieving net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 (Croatian Presidency of the Council of the European Union and the European Commission 2020). \u25b6 At the United Nations General Assembly, China announced its aim for a CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and to achieve carbon neutrality before 2060 (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People\u2019s Republic of China 2020). \u25b6 In October 2020, Japan announced a goal of net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan 2020), strengthening their previous goal of achieving a decarbonized society as early as possible in the second half of this century (Government of Japan 2019b). \u25b6 The President of the Republic of Korea committed to carbon neutrality by 2050 in his speech to parliament (Cheong Wa Dae 2020). \u25b6 Canada has indicated its intention to legislate a goal of net-zero emissions18 by 2050 (Governor General of Canada 2020). \u25b6 South Africa aspires to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 (Republic of South Africa 2020). \u25b6 Argentina and Mexico are part of the UNFCCC Climate Ambition Alliance working towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 (UNFCCC 2019). Progress is significantly slower when considering the formal submissions of mid-century, long-term low GHG emission development strategies and new or updated NDCs that 17 Countries with proposed legislation or targets under discussion include those that have signed up to the UNFCCC\u2019s Climate Ambition Alliance (UNFCCC 2019). 18 It is not clear if \u2018net zero\u2019 refers to CO2 emissions only or all GHG emissions. 19 The government of the United States of America has removed the mid-century strategy from all its websites following the country\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement (Climate Action Tracker 2020b). countries are invited or requested, respectively, to submit to the UNFCCC by 2020. As at mid-November 2020, nine G20 members (Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, United Kingdom and the United States of America)19 have submitted long-term low GHG development strategies to the UNFCCC, though no G20 member has officially submitted a new or updated NDC target (Japan resubmitted its original NDC target in March 2020) (UNFCCC undated a). Although the recent announcements of net-zero emissions goals are very encouraging, they highlight the vast discrepancy between the ambitiousness of these goals and the inadequate level of ambition in the NDCs for 2030. Furthermore, there is inconsistency between the emission levels implied by current policies and those projected under current NDCs by 2030 (of 2.1\u20133.5 GtCO2e per year), and, more importantly, those necessary for achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. To make significant progress towards achieving the long- term temperature goals of the Paris Agreement by 2030, two next steps are urgently required. First, more countries need to develop long-term strategies that are consistent with the Paris Agreement, in particular, by setting time frames for net-zero emissions. Second, new and updated NDCs need to become consistent with the net-zero emission goals (Levin et al. 2020). It will therefore be particularly important to ensure coordination between the development of the next NDCs and the long-term strategies in order to enable a seamless transition to a decarbonization pathway that is consistent with the Paris Agreement (Levin and Fransen 2019), and to transform the announced net-zero emissions goals into detailed shorter-term implementation plans and mitigation targets that are reflected in the NDCs for 2030. Previous Emissions Gap Reports have highlighted the large menu of options and opportunities to strengthen mitigation ambition and action (Fransen and H\u00f6hne 2018; H\u00f6hne et al. 2019). Model-based, multidisciplinary assessments could also be a key aspect when informing policymakers and engaging stakeholders in the process of developing updated NDCs and long-term strategies (Weitzel et al. 2019).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "223c71ba-2552-49a7-a779-7c84c3d2bdb2": {"__data__": {"id_": "223c71ba-2552-49a7-a779-7c84c3d2bdb2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2020", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "88120e06b4c66cd78c2c199ae12461b1b34a1ffd43c06075b1c210e7bbaefff7"}, "2": {"node_id": "8d771a25-5a05-4e1c-bf6f-c6d3ed44d69a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b8c9cfa6960510b0699ba1a2e677ccd2abb139121736ddbd4cdea549f5b0aa7d"}}, "hash": "311fd05b96152d7a65d769e3e94286b625d51eb92818bee41066f2f23e65cb2c", "text": "2019).

Consistent with previous Emissions Gap Reports, the emissions gap is defined as the difference between projected global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions under full implementation of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and emissions under least-cost pathways consistent with the Paris Agreement long-term goal of limiting global average temperature increase to well below 2oC and pursing efforts to limiting it to 1.5oC compared with pre-industrial levels (section 3.2). This chapter assesses up-to-date emissions scenarios that underlie the quantification of the emissions gap (section 3.3). The emissions projections for the current policies and NDC scenarios published in the literature mainly predate the COVID-19 outbreak. Potential implications of COVID-19 on 2030 emissions are therefore explored based on expert knowledge and indicative calculations (section 3.4), which is consistent with the approach used in chapter 2. The implications of failing to bridge the emissions gap by 2030 and the feasibility of achieving the long-term temperature goals of the Paris Agreement are also discussed (section 3.5). The key questions assessed in this chapter are: What is the likely emissions gap for 2030? What is the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated recovery measures on emissions by 2030? What are the temperature implications? What does the 2030 emissions gap imply in a longer-term, mid-century context? 3.2 The 2030 emissions gap In line with previous reports, the emissions gap for 2030 is defined as the difference between global total GHG emissions from least-cost scenarios that keep global warming to below 2\u00b0C, 1.8\u00b0C or 1.5\u00b0C with varying levels of likelihood, and the estimated global GHG emissions resulting from a full implementation of the NDCs. This section updates the gap based on estimated levels of GHG emissions in 2030 for the seven scenarios considered in this assessment and further described in section 3.3. Table 3.1 provides a full overview of 2030 emission levels for these scenarios, as well as the resulting emissions gap, while Figure 3.1 illustrates the emissions gap for 2030. 26 Emissions Gap Report 2020 Table 3.1.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "67c0b044-57dd-4517-9be7-0e862298de45": {"__data__": {"id_": "67c0b044-57dd-4517-9be7-0e862298de45", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2020", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "52f4dc267eb787f490d91b8404473498f17b386ab74c2878c5656be9a8e47b6f"}, "2": {"node_id": "95915f6e-b501-46eb-864e-9186ed975c5e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a93d76640a4a5ca539097dcf308638140ec6918a8c92a34c2f421eff1038907b"}}, "hash": "c6c45e729549b2bb07d97ef7774a6442803a06c182eb96e95cc47ffcaac96352", "text": "26 Emissions Gap Report 2020 Table 3.1.

The inset shows how 1.5\u00b0C, 1.8\u00b0C and 2.0\u00b0C scenarios continue to 2050. In contrast to CO2 emissions, total GHG emissions do not reach net zero by 2050 in the 1.5\u00b0C scenario, but about 10\u201320 years later (table 2.4 in Rogelj et al. 2018 and section 3.5). As figure 3.1 shows, the gap between the unconditional NDC scenario (56 GtCO2e in 2030) and least-cost pathways limiting warming to below 2\u00b0C in 2100 with limited overshoot (41 GtCO2e in 2030) is 15 GtCO2e (range: 12\u201319 GtCO2e), whereas the gap between the unconditional NDCs scenario and least-cost pathways limiting warming to below 1.5\u00b0C in 2100 with limited overshoot (25 GtCO2e in 2030) is 32 GtCO2e (range: 29\u201336 GtCO2e). The full implementation of both unconditional and conditional NDCs would reduce each of these gaps by around 3 GtCO2e. 28 Emissions Gap Report 2020 The emissions gap is unchanged compared with 2019, meaning that countries need to strengthen their NDC ambitions dramatically, specifically threefold to achieve a 2\u00b0C goal and more than fivefold to achieve the 1.5\u00b0C goal. There are two reasons why the gap has not changed. First, adjustments to the NDC scenarios have been very minor: as at November 2020, none of the major emitters had submitted new or updated NDCs with stronger NDC targets for 2030. Overall, any NDC target updates from 2019 are expected to reduce total 2030 emissions by less than 1 per cent (section 3.2.2). Second, no new 1.5\u00b0C, 1.8\u00b0C and 2.0\u00b0C scenarios have been added to the assessment since 2019. Furthermore, the 2020 gap assessment is unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As noted in figure 3.1, this gap assessment is still based on scenarios that do not specifically consider the implications of COVID-19 and related rescue and recovery measures.

The 2010 policies scenario projects global GHG emissions assuming no new climate policies have been put in place from 2010 onwards. Similar to the Emissions Gap Report 2019, the data for this scenario are based on the baseline projections of Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP2: middle of the road) scenarios from six modelling studies that also underpin the current policies scenario projections as of 2019 (the CD-LINKS Scenario Database, version 1.0) (McCollum et al. 2018; Roelfsema et al. 2020). This scenario database has not changed for SSP2 compared with 2019. The current policies scenario projects global GHG emissions assuming all currently adopted and implemented policies (defined as legislative decisions, executive orders, or equivalent) are realized and that no additional measures are undertaken. The data for this scenario are updated and based on the current policies projections (cut-off year for policies: 2019) of the Climate Action Tracker (2019), International Energy Agency (IEA 2019) World Energy Outlook 2019, Joint Research Centre (Prospective Outlook on Long-term Energy Systems (POLES) model) (Keramidas et al. 2020), and PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment (IMAGE)) (den Elzen et al. 2019; Kuramochi et al. 2019; PBL 2020). Four international modelling groups that were also included in the 2019 report provided updated projections in Roelfsema et al. (2020): the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA, using the MESSAGE\u2013GLOBIOM model) (Fricko et al. 2017); the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES, using the AIM model) (Fujimori et al. 2017); the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK, using the REMIND\u2013MAgPIE model) (Luderer et al. 2015); Resources for the Future Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change (RFF-CMCC) European Institute on Economics and the Environment (using the World Induced Technical Change Hybrid (WITCH) model) (Emmerling et al. 2016). One additional modelling group was also included from Roelfsema et al., the Computable Framework for Energy and the Environment (COFFEE) model of the Graduate School of Engineering (COPPE) of Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (Rochedo et al. 2018). It should be noted that the latter five current policy projections from Roelfsema et al. (2020) originally use 31 December 2016 as their cut-off date for current policies. Post-2016 policies, rollback of policies since 2017, or planned policies to be implemented are not included. Policies are also assumed to be realized (Roelfsema et al. 2020). To ensure comparability, these latter five current policy projections have been adjusted to reflect changes to 2019. The influence of moving the policy cut-off date from 2016 to 2019 was analysed by comparing the results of the four modelling studies that provide estimates for both cut-off dates (United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] 2017), which gave an estimated reduction of 1.5 GtCO2e (range: -0.4 to -3.0). The emissions projections of the last five modelling studies are adjusted accordingly to reflect the best estimate of the most recent current policies. Overall, this only has a small impact on the globally aggregated emissions projections for which the uncertainty ranges are large. The median estimate of global GHG emissions by 2030 for the current policies scenario is 59 GtCO2e (range: 56\u201365 GtCO2e) (for comparison, 2019 emissions were 54 GtCO2e), which is 29 Emissions Gap Report 2020 1 GtCO2e lower than the median estimate of the Emissions Gap Report 2019 of 60 GtCO2e (range: 58\u201364 GtCO2e). The change in projections varies across model studies, ranging from -0.5 to -3 GtCO2e. The current policies scenario does not take implications of COVID-19 and related rescue and recovery measures into account. These are explored in section 3.4. Box 3.1.

The difference to be considered is therefore 56.7 GtCO2e against 53.6 GtCO2e, which is relatively small and well within the certainty range of the emissions estimates.

In line with previous Emissions Gap Reports, two NDC scenarios are considered: the unconditional and conditional NDC scenarios. The NDC scenarios of the 2020 report are based on the same data sources as the current policies scenario and are provided by the same 10 modelling groups as cited above, with updates for the Joint Research Centre, PBL and the Climate Action Tracker. PBL and the Climate Action Tracker have also analysed the impact of NDC target updates on global emissions by 2030 (last update 20 September 2020), which is estimated to be limited, resulting in reductions in total emissions by 2030 of less than 1 per cent compared with NDC scenarios without target updates reported since the Emissions Gap Report 2019. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on projected emissions under the NDC scenarios is limited so far, as NDC targets of major emitting countries, such as the G20 economies, have not changed at this point. For countries, whose reduction targets are defined per unit of gross domestic product (GDP), in particular China and India with intensity targets, the pandemic may likely affect the NDC emissions projections due to its impact on GDP growth, though information at this level is not yet available. 3.3.3 Mitigation scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement GHG emissions by 2030 that are consistent with a least- cost pathway towards limiting global warming below 2\u00b0C, 1.8\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C are estimated in the same way as for the 2019 report and calculated from the scenarios underlying the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C (SR1.5) (Huppmann et al. 2018a; Huppmann et al. 2018b; Rogelj et al. 2018). Maximum cumulative CO2 emissions from 2018 onwards are used to classify scenario groups, which is consistent with the approach of the IPCC SR1.5, which groups scenarios based on their maximum temperature outcome (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC] 2018; Rogelj et al. 2018). This approach enables a close mapping of scenarios to the maximum temperature increase they would cause and thus informs various possible interpretations of the Paris Agreement long-term temperature goal (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change [UNFCCC] 2015; Schleussner et al. 2016). A comparison with the IPCC SR1.5 approach is provided in box 3.2. The three temperature scenario groups represent various degrees of ambition that range from limiting warming to around 2\u00b0C, to interpretations of limiting warming to well below 2\u00b0C, to pursuing to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C (see table 3.1). Each scenario considers a least-cost climate change mitigation pathway that starts long-term reductions from 2020. 30 Emissions Gap Report 2020 \u25b6 Below 2.0\u00b0C scenario: This scenario limits maximum cumulative CO2 emissions from 2018 until the time net-zero CO2 emissions are reached (or until 2100 if net-zero emissions are not reached before)1 to between 900 and 1,300 GtCO2, and cumulative 2018\u20132100 emissions to at most 1,200 GtCO2, when net negative CO2 emissions in the second half of the century are included. It is consistent with limiting warming below 2.0\u00b0C with about 66 per cent probability, both at the time of peak global warming and at the end of the century.

In theory, a 420 GtCO2 cut-off would suffice for a scenario to be included in this category based on the IPCC SR1.5 (Rogelj et al. 2018). emissions for this scenario is 35 GtCO2e. This scenario is included to provide more granular information on how emissions reduction requirements for 2030 change with gradually increasing stringency of global mitigation action. \u25b6 Below 1.5\u00b0C in 2100 scenario: This scenario limits maximum cumulative CO2 emissions from 2018 until the time net-zero CO2 emissions are reached (or until 2100 if net-zero emissions are not reached before) to 600 GtCO2, and cumulative 2018\u20132100 to at most 380 GtCO2, when net negative CO2 emissions in the second half of the century are included.2 It is consistent with limiting global warming to below 1.5\u00b0C in 2100 with about 66 per cent probability, while limiting peak global warming during the twenty-first century to about 1.6\u20131.7\u00b0C with about 66 per cent or greater probability. This class of scenarios is consistent with the scenarios in IPCC SR1.5\u00b0C that limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C with no or limited overshoot (explained in box 3.2; see also characteristics in table 3.1). The median estimate of 2030 emissions of 25 GtCO2e falls well within the range of 22\u201328 GtCO2e of the IPCC SR1.5 1.5\u00b0C scenarios with no or limited overshoot (see table 2.4 in Rogelj et al. 2018). 31 Emissions Gap Report 2020 Box 3.2. Technical comparison with the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C The analysis included in this chapter is consistent with the latest assessment of the IPCC SR1.5 (2018). The range of Kyoto-GHG emissions in 2030 consistent with limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C used in this report (24 GtCO2e/ year with a range of 22\u201330 GtCO2e/year) closely matches the 25\u201330 GtCO2e/year range reported in IPCC SR1.5 (2018) for scenarios limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C with no or limited overshoot. Differences are attributed to the exclusive use of scenarios that start emissions reductions from 2020 onwards in this report, compared with the wider set used in IPCC SR1.5. Overall, these minor changes do not affect the assessment of the adequacy of current NDCs for limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C or well below 2\u00b0C. Cumulative CO2 emissions from 2018 onward never exceed 600 GtCO2 in the below 1.5\u00b0C by 2100 scenario. This broadly corresponds to the remaining carbon budget for limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C with 50 per cent probability (580 GtCO2 from 2018 until net-zero emissions are reached) of IPCC SR1.5, suggesting that temperature overshoot is limited to less than 0.1\u00b0C with 50 per cent probability, and to 1.6\u20131.7\u00b0C with 66 per cent probability. Cumulative CO2 emissions from 2018 until the end of the century are at most 380 GtCO2 in the available scenarios, which is less than the IPCC SR1.5 remaining carbon budget of 420 GtCO2 for limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C with 66 per cent probability.

As indicated in chapter 2, 2020 global CO2 emissions may drop 7 per cent (range: 2\u201312 per cent) below 2019 levels depending on how national epidemics and lockdowns develop over time. Almost all the emissions reductions are due to a temporary drop in activity resulting from lockdown measures, which include, for example, the transport sector, with people requested to stay home and halt travelling, as well as economic activity. Since these emissions reductions are not the result of structural changes, they may quickly reverse once lockdown measures are lifted (Forster et al. 2020; Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al. 2020). This means that a pronounced short-term dip in energy- and industry-related CO2 emissions is anticipated, after which emissions may follow the pre-2020 growth trend. Implications of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated rescue and recovery measures on 2030 emissions and global emissions pathways towards meeting the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement were assessed in a recent study (Dafnomilis et al. 2020), which presents \u2018what if\u2019 scenarios based on explorative calculations and using sources available before June 2020. This methodology is used here, with some adjustments made to the GDP data. Using the short-term GDP projections of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) single-hit and second-hit scenarios for 2020 and 20213 (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] 2020a; OECD 2020b), two post-COVID-19 economic growth scenarios are calculated. These economic projections are combined with two scenarios for future decarbonization rates (i.e. change in fossil CO2 emissions per unit of GDP): one based on the pre-COVID-19 current policies scenario from the original model studies (labelled current trends), and one based on a post-COVID-19 scenario with lower decarbonization rates due to the rollback of current policies in countries (see chapter 2) and possible delays in climate 32 Emissions Gap Report 2020 policy implementation (labelled rebound to fossil fuels). The rationale behind the second scenario is that several countries have announced emissions-intensive policies to stimulate economic recovery, therefore putting climate policies at risk of being rolled back (Climate Action Tracker 2020a; Miosio et al. 2020; Vivid Economics 2020). This impact is quantified by applying a decarbonization rate that is 50 per cent lower than the rate of the original model study for 2021\u20132024 (Dafnomilis et al. 2020). The total energy and industry CO2 emissions for 2021\u20132024 are calculated using a Kaya decomposition (Kaya 1990). For 2025\u20132030, fossil CO2 emissions follow the same growth trend as suggested by the original model projections. The 4 No directly comparable figures could be obtained for the IEA World Energy Outlook 2020 (2020c) because the 2020 edition does not provide current policies scenario projections. The following are used instead: i) the stated policies scenario, in which COVID-19 is gradually brought under control and the global economy return to pre-crisis levels the same year (this scenario reflects all current announced policy intentions and targets); ii) the delayed recovery scenario, which is designed with the same policy assumptions as the stated policies scenario, but shows lasting damage to economic prospects following a prolonged pandemic (IEA 2020c). non-CO2 GHG emissions and CO2 land-use-related emissions for 2020\u20132030 are identical to the original pre-COVID-19 projections. However, preliminary data suggest that there may be an expansion of farming and livestock activities due to COVID-19-related consumption changes and market disruptions (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [FAO] 2020), which could lead to increased methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Deforestation rates in South American and Asian regions are also expected to increase due to a lack of regulatory measures, limited budgets and weak enforcement of adopted legislation to protect native ecosystems (Amador-Jimenez et al. 2020; Azevedo 2020; L\u00f3pez-Feldman et al. 2020; Rondeau et al. 2020).

This assumes a pronounced short- term dip in CO2 emissions, after which emissions follow pre-2020 growth trends. The Climate Action Tracker (2020a) finds a similar difference of about 2\u20134 GtCO2e between the post- and pre-COVID-19 current policies projections by 2030. Comparing the IEA\u2019s World Energy Outlook 2020 (IEA 2020b) post-COVID-19 global energy and industry CO2 emissions projections for their stated policies scenario4 (estimates published in 2019) suggests a similar difference 33 Emissions Gap Report 2020 of about 1.5\u20134 GtCO2e between the post- and pre-COVID-19 stated policies projections by 2030. If the initial short-term dip in CO2 emissions is followed by growth trends with lower decarbonization rates due to countries\u2019 potential rollback of climate policies as part of COVID-19 responses, the decrease in global emissions by 2030 is projected to be significantly smaller at around 1.5 GtCO2e (instead of 4 GtCO2e) and may actually increase by around 1 GtCO2e (instead of -2 GtCO2e) (figure 3.2 \u2013 rebound to fossil fuels second-hit and single-hit scenarios, respectively) compared with the pre-COVID-19 current policies scenario. Around the world, countries are launching economic rescue and recovery measures to cushion the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Future global GHG emissions depend critically on the extent to which recovery measures are green (low carbon), which at present is difficult to evaluate comprehensively (see chapter 4). At the global level, the impact of \u2018green recovery\u2019 responses can be estimated based on the IEA\u2019s (2020a) Sustainable Recovery Plan and its associated global energy and industry CO2 emissions projections under the IEA (2020b) sustainable recovery scenario. For the GHG emissions projections in figure 3.2, the IEA\u2019s energy and industry CO2 emissions were supplemented with land-use CO2 and non-CO2 emissions projections under current policies of the model studies underlying the original current policies scenario. The emissions projections in figure 3.2 also adopted the IEA\u2019s (2020b) assumption of a 0.8 GtCO2e emissions reduction following investments to tackle CH4 leakages from oil and gas operations by 2024, and kept this reduction constant to 2030. Figure 3.2 shows that 2030 emissions are only projected to be significantly reduced if COVID-19 economic recovery is used as an opportunity to pursue strong decarbonization. The sustainable recovery scenario results in global GHG emissions of 44 GtCO2e by 2030, which is a reduction of 15 GtCO2e (just over 25 per cent) compared with the original current policies scenario used for the emissions gap assessment, and would bring 2030 emissions within the range consistent with least-cost pathways that limit global warming to below 2\u00b0C (table 3.1). More dedicated attention would be required to reach levels consistent with limiting global warming to below 1.8\u00b0C or 1.5\u00b0C. As noted in the beginning of this section, the emissions projections for the post-COVID-19 policy scenarios are highly indicative. They are based on simple calculations compared to the model-based pre-COVID projections and are driven by a wide range of GDP estimates for 2020 and 2021 from the OECD single-hit and second-hit scenarios published in June 2020 (OECD 2020a; OECD 2020b). The more recent GDP estimates of the IMF (2020) (June) and the OECD (2020c) Economic Outlook (September) are both within the projected GDP range of the OECD June estimates. Applying the more recent GDP estimates would result in GHG emissions projections for 2030 that are closer to those of the current trends scenario (figure 3.2 \u2013 single- hit). It should be noted that the post-COVID-19 projections do not yet include information based on announcements of specific economic recovery measures (Miosio et al. 2020; Vivid Economics 2020).

They also indicate that emissions continue to rise under the (pre-COVID-19) current policies scenario and that COVID-19 is only likely to significantly reduce total GHG emissions by 2030 if used as an opening for economic recovery that fosters strong decarbonization. This section examines the implications of inadequate and delayed short- term action in achieving the long-term temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. 3.5.1 Implications of postponing action in the context of long-term zero emissions goals Achieving the long-term temperature goals of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2\u00b0C and pursue 1.5\u00b0C depends strongly on implementing mitigation action by 2030. Taking a longer-term perspective illustrates how the low-carbon transition challenge until 2050 depends critically on this near-term action. The Paris Agreement aims to reach net-zero GHG emissions in the second half of this century, which means that any remaining CO2 and non-CO2 emissions are balanced with net CO2 removal or negative emissions. When calculated using the 100-year global warming potentials (GWPs) typically applied by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to compare different GHGs, global warming will peak and then gradually decline thereafter. The timing of global net-zero CO2 and GHG emissions provides milestones for pathways that are consistent with the Paris Agreement and can be estimated from long-term emissions scenarios. According to the IPCC SR1.5, limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C with no or limited overshoot requires global CO2 34 Emissions Gap Report 2020 and GHG emissions to reach net zero around 2050 (range: 2046\u20132055) and 2067 (range: 2061\u20132084), respectively. For temperature limits higher than 1.5\u00b0C, the timing would be later (see table 2.4 in Rogelj et al. 2018). It should be noted that these net-zero target years are for the global pathways and therefore need to be achieved collectively. Setting net- zero targets for individual countries involves considerations of equity and fairness, which means that national net-zero targets do not necessarily have to coincide with the net-zero years and global pathways. Previous Emissions Gap Reports have highlighted the key implications of postponing mitigation action and failing to bridge the 2030 emissions gap (Luderer et al. 2018), which are summarized in figure 3.3. Furthermore, the implications of postponed action are apparent when looking across the Emissions Gap Reports produced to date (UNEP 5 Since most scenarios that are used to inform the extension of emissions after 2030 assume exponentially increasing carbon prices throughout the century, the method applied here also implicitly assumes that climate action continues to be strengthened until 2100. 2019; H\u00f6hne et al. 2020). The global average emissions reductions required per year to meet 2030 emission levels that are consistent with the 2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C scenarios are by now approximately quadruple and more than double, respectively, what they would have been had serious collective climate action started in 2010. This remarkable increase in annual emission reduction rates due to the lack of sufficient action add significantly to the challenge of meeting the Paris Agreement. The conclusion is clear: postponing ambitious climate action, thereby delaying the path towards reaching net- zero emissions, will make it impossible to achieve the Paris Agreement temperature goal of limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. Greater climate action is therefore needed by 2030 to make reducing global GHG emissions to levels consistent with 1.5\u00b0C pathways feasible. Figure 3.3.

However, the trend until 2030 can be used to estimate the projected warming based on the assumption that this trend will continue until 2100. The method used in previous Emissions Gap Reports has been followed to link 2030 GHG emissions and their continuation until 21005 to projected warming throughout the twenty-first century (Rogelj et al. 2016). This approach results in global warming estimates that are consistent 35 Emissions Gap Report 2020 with temperature outcomes found in the wider integrated scenario literature (Jeffery et al. 2018). Since current policies and NDC scenarios have not changed since the 2019 report, the estimated temperature implications remain the same. The unconditional NDCs are consistent with limiting warming to no more than 3.2\u00b0C (range: 3.0\u20133.5\u00b0C) by the end of the century (with 66 per cent probability). Full implementation of both conditional and unconditional NDCs would lower this estimate by about 0.2\u00b0C. In contrast, the current policies scenario (pre- COVID-19) results in greater emissions by 2030, which if continued until the end of the century would result in a global mean temperature rise of 3.5\u00b0C by 2100 (range: 3.4\u2013 3.9\u00b0C, 66 per cent probability). In all cases, global warming would not be stabilized by 2100 and would continue to increase thereafter. These global warming ranges do not consider the growing number of announced net-zero emission goals, such as China\u2019s 2060 announced net-zero carbon goal, the European Union\u2019s 2050 net-zero GHG emissions goal, the United Kingdom\u2019s legally enshrined 2050 net-zero GHG emissions goal, and South Africa\u2019s aspirational 2050 net-zero carbon emissions goal. Japan and the Republic of Korea have also announced similar goals. Although detailed studies of the temperature outcomes of these targets are not yet available, a preliminary estimate carried out for this report suggests that, collectively, these targets could further lower the temperature projections consistent with unconditional NDCs by about half a degree Celsius to around 2.7\u00b0C. If the United States of America were to also adopt a net-zero GHG emissions target by 2050, as suggested in the Biden-Harris climate plan, the combined effect of all net-zero targets would be further strengthened. In that case, projections until the end of the century are estimated to be 2.5\u20132.6\u00b0C, which is 0.6\u20130.7\u00b0C lower than the global warming estimate for current unconditional NDCs. This is consistent with 6 These values consider the impact of Earth system feedbacks such as permafrost thaw, as assessed in the IPCC SR1.5. other preliminary analyses (Climate Action Tracker 2020c). Once countries submit their announced net-zero targets as long-term low GHG emission development strategies to the UNFCCC, temperature projections can more formally reflect these intentions. The 2020 analysis makes it clear that neither NDCs nor current policies are adequate to limit warming below the temperature limits included in the Paris Agreement. This inadequacy is even further emphasized when considering the cumulative CO2 emissions by 2030 as implied by current NDCs. Starting from the 2018 level of global CO2 emissions of 41.6 GtCO2 (Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al. 2018) and assuming a straight trajectory to 2030, the current unconditional NDC scenario implies cumulative emissions of about 510 GtCO2 (range: 495\u2013528 GtCO2) until 2030. Meanwhile, the IPCC SR1.5 estimated that the remaining carbon budget starting from 2018 and consistent with limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C (with 50\u2013 66 per cent probability) amounts to around 320\u2013480 GtCO2, which rises to 700 GtCO2 and 1,070 GtCO2 for limiting warming to 1.75\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C (with 66 per cent probability), respectively.6 Current NDCs therefore fully deplete the carbon budget consistent with limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and strongly reduce the remaining budgets for limiting warming to well below 2\u00b0C, without making any progress towards bringing global CO2 emissions closer to net zero.

These new challenges compound many existing social and economic challenges, including widespread social inequality, rural/urban disparities and climate change. This confluence of challenges requires a considered response. At the same time, COVID-19 rescue and recovery measures present an opening to stimulate the economy, while simultaneously accelerating a transition towards a low- carbon economy consistent with the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. Unless this opening is pursued, the Paris Agreement goals are likely to slip further out of reach (chapter 3). Against this background, this chapter assesses two main questions: \u25b6 What can we say about the size and extent to which COVID-19 rescue and recovery measures to date support low-carbon or high-carbon development? (sections 4.2 and 4.3) \u25b6 What are the emerging lessons for governments in the pursuit of a low-carbon economic recovery? (section 4.4) Global fiscal actions to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic are of an unprecedented scale. As section 4.2 shows, in September 2020, fiscal actions amounted to around US$12 trillion, or 12 per cent of global gross domestic product (GDP). Particularly for countries with capacity to cheaply borrow funds (high \u2018fiscal space\u2019), governments have been willing to spend large sums of money, often drastically increasing public debt. For nations without this fiscal space (often developing countries), public spending has been significantly lower to date. To date, most governments have rightly focused on funding economic rescue measures to protect lives and businesses in their immediate economic response to COVID-19. As competing objectives and varied COVID-19 impact and response timelines have emerged around the world, some governments have also started sharpening their fiscal focus to funding recovery measures to reinvigorate their economies. This chapter shows that so far, the opening to use rescue and recovery measures to support a low-carbon transition has largely been missed. Although there are examples of measures that support a transition towards a decarbonized world, most countries are currently adopting measures that support a high-carbon status quo of their economies \u2013 or even foster new high-carbon investments. This is particularly the case for rescue measures. The jury is still out on whether COVID-19 rescue and recovery measures will lead to lower or higher global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the longer run (see also chapter 3). However, this chapter illustrates that certain rescue and recovery measures can simultaneously support a rapid, employment-intensive and economically cost-effective economic recovery and a low-carbon transition. Such measures include i) support to low-carbon and renewable energy, low-carbon transport, zero-energy buildings and low-carbon industry; ii) support to research and development of zero-emissions technologies; iii) fiscal reforms of fossil fuel subsidies; and iv) nature-based solutions, including large-scale landscape restoration and reforestation. A detailed evaluation of the appropriateness of given measures in various country contexts is required to assess the scope for rolling them out across countries, as impacts vary across different political, environmental, 37 Emissions Gap Report 2020 economic, business, legal, regulatory and social contexts. Well-designed spending can also tackle other pressing problems such as air pollution, natural capital deficit, wealth and income inequality, inadequate quality of life and rural/urban disparities. The future can still be shaped in a way that helps bridge the emissions gap, through the decisions yet to be made on the composition and implementation of the announced recovery packages and on future recovery actions. 4.2 Unprecedented global fiscal spending on economic rescue and recovery measures Fiscal actions to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic are unprecedented in scale (see figure 4.1): around US$12 trillion, or 12 per cent of global GDP, had been spent by September 2020 (International Monetary Fund [IMF] 2020a, 2020b). For some G20 members, fiscal spending has been as high as 40 per cent of GDP.

The average across all G20 members excluding the European Union represents the weighted average by country-specific GDP values. The classification according to emerging market and middle-income economies and low-income developing countries comes from the IMF's Fiscal Monitor: Policies for the Recovery of October 2020 (IMF 2020b). Sources: IMF (2020a); IMF (2020b) 38 Emissions Gap Report 2020 and deregulation initiatives.1 For instance, the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) estimates the total fiscal stimulus of G20 countries, excluding fiscal actions at the European Union institutional level, at US$10.8 trillion as at August 2020 (Overseas Development Institute [ODI] 2020), compared with the US$10.3 trillion estimated by the IMF as at September 2020 (IMF 2020a) and the US$12.4 trillion estimated by the Oxford University Economic Recovery Project and the Green Fiscal Policy Network as at November 2020 (O\u2019Callaghan et al. 2020). If monetary liquidity stimulus provided by countries\u2019 central banks is considered in addition to fiscal spending, the share of GDP spent on COVID-19 measures increases sharply: up to 70 per cent for some G20 members (ODI 2020). The range of fiscal and monetary interventions reflects the full policy space available to each country to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since many developing countries entered the pandemic with pre-existing vulnerabilities and limited fiscal space, and given the immediate threat to lives due to the health and income impacts of COVID-19, spending in these nations has primarily targeted short-term rescue measures. Key vulnerabilities include high levels of public indebtedness, slowing economic growth rates due to subdued global demand, and trade tensions. To date, this has left little room to fund recovery strategies with a longer-term perspective. In view of this, regional development banks and the international donor community have increased their commitment of support. At the regional level, for example, the African Development Bank initially responded by raising US$3 billion for a \u2018Fight COVID-19\u2019 social bond in March 2020, the largest US-dollar- denominated social bond transaction in the capital markets to date (African Development Bank [AfDB] 2020a). This was followed by its creation of a US$10 billion response facility to assist governments and the private sector, its approval of loans and grants to individual member countries, and its support for regional efforts to combat the pandemic (AfDB 2020b; AfDB 2020c). Meanwhile for most European and Central Asian countries, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) plans to devote more than half of its total COVID-19 recovery investments to the green economy (Bennett 2020).

Meanwhile, the World Bank Group also significantly increased its commitment for COVID-19 projects from US$14 billion in March 2020 to US$160 billion in April 2020 (World Bank 2020a; World Bank 2020b). The World Bank had allocated US$43 billion of this pool as at September 2020 (World Bank 2020c). Reflecting global spending patterns, in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, most World Bank projects supported emergency funding to address health priorities. More recently, the scope of funding has widened to include financial sector reform, education, governance, and market support.2 The international donor community is likely to play an important role in supporting and steering funding towards measures that support an inclusive, resilient and low-carbon economic recovery (UN Regional Commissions 2020), especially in the least developed countries. 4.3 Fiscal COVID-19 spending has so far primarily supported the global status quo of high-carbon economic production This section provides a preliminary assessment of the extent to which COVID-19 fiscal rescue and recovery measures to date support low- or high-carbon development, and whether they have a positive net effect on GHG emissions. As at October 2020, COVID-19 fiscal spending had primarily supported the global status quo of high-carbon economic production. While it is understandable that immediate rescue measures were directed to incumbent industry, later rescue and recovery measures could have supported low-carbon development, without forsaking opportunities for economic gain (Hepburn et al. 2020). Only a few countries have transformed green rhetoric into low-carbon recovery measures (that is, measures that lead to a reduction in GHG emissions). For most, recovery spending has mostly been high-carbon (that is, implying negative net effects GHG emissions) or neutral (that is, having no discernible effects on GHG emissions).

These are mostly considered neutral in terms of GHG emissions impact (for example, health-care-related spending) or supporting high-carbon industries without conditions for a low- carbon transition attached. \u25b6 Around a quarter of G20 members have dedicated shares of their packages (accounting for up to 3 per cent of GDP) explicitly to low-carbon measures as at October/November 2020 (Climate Action Tracker 2020; Energy Policy Tracker 2020; O\u2019Callaghan et al. 2020; Vivid Economics 2020a). Several countries are spreading the announced sums across the years up to 2025. \u25b6 Most G20 members have brought forward measures and packages supporting a high-carbon status quo of their economies or are even fostering new high- carbon investments (O\u2019Callaghan et al. 2020; Vivid Economics 2020a). For some G20 members, no explicit low-carbon measures could be identified (O\u2019Callaghan et al. 2020; Tiftik et al. 2020; Vivid Economics 2020a). \u25b6 Assessments of the effects on GHG emissions are preliminary (see chapter 3), but will become more robust as the composition and implementation details of rescue and recovery packages become clearer. Methodologies for identifying and quantifying the climate impacts of rescue and recovery measures and times of analysis vary slightly across institutions, bringing corresponding variance in results (figure 4.2, Annex II). However, for all trackers and across geographies, low- carbon measures are significantly outweighed by neutral and high-carbon measures. Preliminary analysis3 indicates that low-carbon policies have been slightly more prevalent in recovery measures than in rescue measures (O\u2019Callaghan et al. 2020). This 3 As at October 2020. is noteworthy, as the next stages of COVID-19 fiscal interventions are likely to shift a greater proportion of capital towards recovery measures, indicating prospects for increasing low-carbon measures in upcoming new recovery plans or in revisions to announced recovery plans. 4.4 Emerging lessons and examples for governments in the pursuit of low- carbon economic recovery The previous sections show that the economic rescue and recovery measures announced by governments worldwide are unprecedented in scale. Although section 4.3 clearly shows that measures supporting a low-carbon transition have been limited to date, there is scope to adjust announced recovery measures to become more low- carbon and to design future packages in a manner that supports an inclusive, resilient and low-carbon economic recovery (UN Regional Commissions 2020). As chapter 3 illustrates, global GHG emissions are projected to be significantly reduced by 2030 only if COVID-19 economic recovery is used as an opening to pursue decarbonization. Therefore, bridging the 2030 emissions gap critically depends on the extent to which this opening is used and integrated into substantially more ambitious new or updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Previous editions of the Emissions Gap Report have highlighted the major long-term sectoral transformations that are needed to bridge the gap and reach net-zero GHG emissions globally and these are also relevant to consider in the context of recovery measures (box 4.1). Governments evaluate fiscal rescue and recovery spending, taxation and regulatory options against a variety of criteria. In most instances, the ability to stabilize or stimulate the economy through a specific measure is likely the first criteria considered by policymakers. However, measures that have similar short-term economic characteristics may differ considerably in terms of their social, environmental and long-term economic impacts. Considering medium- to long-term economic, environmental and social indicators can therefore help governments maximize the long-term prosperity benefits of their recovery measures. Various studies discuss, in a global context, the benefits of aligning policy with different indicators. These are summarized in table 4.1 (Flyvbjerg 2020; Hepburn et al. 2020; International Energy Agency [IEA] 2020; Jotzo et al. 2020; O\u2019Callaghan et al. 2020; Vivid Economics 2020b; World Bank 2020d).

Some fiscal rescue and recovery measures are likely to perpetuate high-carbon and environmentally damaging development (see table 4.2 to table 4.7 for detailed COVID-19 examples). These include: \u25b6 fossil fuel-based infrastructure investments or fiscal incentives for high-carbon technologies and projects \u25b6 waivers or rollbacks of environmental regulations \u25b6 bailouts of fossil fuel-intensive companies without conditions for low-carbon transition or environmental sustainability: relevant industries include airlines, internal combustion automotive companies, industrial industries and fossil energy companies. Conversely, many fiscal rescue and recovery measures can simultaneously support rapid, employment-intensive and cost-effective economic recovery and a low-carbon transition (see table 4.2 to table 4.7 for detailed examples). Broad categories include: \u25b6 support for zero-emissions technologies and infrastructure, for example, low-carbon and renewable energy, low-carbon transport, zero-energy buildings and low-carbon industry \u25b6 support to research and development of zero- emissions technologies \u25b6 fossil fuel subsidies through fiscal reform \u25b6 nature-based solutions, including large-scale landscape restoration and reforestation. Experience from early COVID-19 rescue and recovery measures can provide valuable insights for policymakers designing economic rescue and recovery measures for the immediate future. Based on an assessment of recently published literature and information from available rescue and recovery trackers, table 4.2 to table 4.7 provide case examples of low-carbon and high-carbon recovery measures organized by main sectors. All tables have been constructed based on information available in October 2020. Each table includes a set of examples that reduce GHG emissions and a set of examples that tend to increase GHG emissions or foster lock-in of high carbon emissions. The case examples presented have all been cited by multiple sources and many incorporate relevant additional socioeconomic considerations, such as employment or social benefits (CarbonBrief 2020; Energy Policy Tracker 2020; O\u2019Callaghan et al. 2020; Vivid Economics 2020a).

A potential opening for accelerated retirement of coal plants in India Coal-based power is an important part of India\u2019s immediate energy future to enable reliable and modern electricity access in a historically energy-poor nation. However, beneficial economics of an accelerated phase- out of old coal-fired power plants, and expressions of political support for doing so, offer the possibility of post- COVID recovery and both climate and air pollution gains. India has one of the largest and youngest coal power fleets in the world, with an installed capacity of 205 GW and average plant age of around 12 years (Malik et al. 2020). India\u2019s fleet continues to grow, with 6.7 GW added in FY2019-20 and another 59.8 GW in the pipeline, of which 23.7 GW are on hold for various reasons (Central Electrical Authority [CEA] 2020a). In contrast, 10 GW have been retired since April 2014 (India, Ministry of Power 2020a). However, rapid capacity addition in recent years (nearly 60 per cent of India\u2019s coal capacity was commissioned between 2010 and 2020), lower-than-forecasted growth in demand, and competition from renewable energy have created a power surplus. The entire coal fleet is facing low utilization rates (55\u201360 per cent) and competition for limited coal supply. Forty GW of coal-fired projects were financially stressed in 2018 (India, Ministry of Power 2018). In addition, new pollution control norms will add costs to coal-based electricity production. Reflecting these developments, in her budget speech for 2020, the Finance Minister suggested that old thermal plants with high carbon emissions should be closed, and the Power Minister later announced that 5.1 GW had been earmarked for shutdown due to non- compliance with pollution standards.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1d0adbd0-db71-44e8-823c-331975ae53d8": {"__data__": {"id_": "1d0adbd0-db71-44e8-823c-331975ae53d8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2020", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f62861970f92882b25d7952a485e48e840d9438151d431dc439802773a74d4f8"}, "2": {"node_id": "82b0e7ad-d703-42be-b431-bcb64f819bdd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2101c6af30b8d59781f51f955e6c97dedd82a821ae589781521260358c25019a"}}, "hash": "3672818b1cfb254a5de7fe93175b89e0eb0fef58d1f7cc9e170fd5abe05dda84", "text": "Two major states, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh, have announced that they will no longer construct new coal plants (Carbon Copy Editorial Team 2019).

This could reinforce a move away from coal. Analysts have identified accelerated retirements of coal plants as a catalyst for reviving the power sector, while reducing air pollution and GHG emissions. Studies estimate that there is a strong economic and environmental case for decommissioning 27\u201336 GW of old, expensive or polluting plants in the short term (Fernandes and Sharma 2020; Srikanth and Krishnan 2020). This would release debt-ridden utilities from contractual fixed cost obligations and improve the utilization of younger, more efficient and cleaner plants, while also releasing low- cost coal linkages. At the same time, it would result in considerable savings in terms of system-level costs and GHG emissions (Dang, Nuwal and Acharya 2020; Ghosh and Ruha 2020). It would also generate upstream benefits on the balance sheets of public sector banks at a critical moment. Increasing the usage of cleaner plants would avoid the cost of retrofitting old, dirty plants with air pollution control equipment. Furthermore, utilities would be free to lower their power purchase costs by replacing the lost generation with cheaper renewable energy or power exchange. Implementing an accelerated retirement programme for old coal plants will face technical and political constraints, particularly if the promoter has not fully recovered their equity. Proposals to overcome such challenges have recently emerged, such as bundling the decommissioning costs into renewable energy auctions (Dang, Nuwal and Acharya 2020) or raising government bonds funded by ratepayer surcharges to buy out brownfield assets (known as \u2018securitization\u2019) (Shrimali 2020). One aspect not directly considered in this chapter is the extent to which the implications of COVID-19 and associated rescue and recovery measures may influence underlying drivers of high-carbon production and consumption. Box 4.2 provides an example of how COVID-19 could compound economic and environmental incentives for a transition out of coal, using India as an illustrative example. 46 Emissions Gap Report 2020 Table 4.3.

About two- thirds of these emissions are international, meaning they are not included in national totals reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and are instead added as memo items. Although international emissions are not covered under the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) of most signatories to the Paris Agreement, article 4 commits its signatories to reducing all anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. No sector is exempt from this commitment. At present, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) are the specialized United Nations agencies tasked with addressing international GHG emissions. Shipping and aviation both largely depend on liquid fossil fuels and have inherently long technology development and fleet turnover times, which make it difficult for the sectors to decarbonize. In addition to GHG emissions, both sectors emit other emissions that contribute to climate change, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), water vapour, back carbon (soot) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) (Eyring et al. 2010; Eide et al. 2013; Lee et al. in press). This chapter presents current and projected emissions to assess how much the international transport sectors are contributing to the emissions gap (section 5.2). Section 5.3 analyses the technical, operational and fuel options available to decarbonize shipping and aviation. Section 5.4 contrasts the projected emissions with global emissions pathways required to meet the Paris Agreement temperature goals in order to assess when, and to what extent, the decarbonization options should be implemented, while also evaluating the current policy goals in the context of the Paris Agreement.

CH4 emissions have risen in recent years (albeit from a low base), due to the increased number of liquified natural gas (LNG)-fuelled ships. Shipping also emitted around 100,000 tons of black carbon (soot) in 2018, which is a short-lived climate pollutant that contributes to warming (Comer et al. 2017; IMO 2020). Other non-CO2 emissions (such as NOx and SO2) cause net cooling effects, largely through the formation of low-level clouds from SO2 emissions (Fuglestvedt et al. 2009; Peters et al. 2012), although in January 2020, new air quality protection regulations for shipping entered into force, with the aim of reducing these emissions (Sofiev et al. 2018). 53 Emissions Gap Report 2020 In 2018, international voyages (those between ports in different countries) were responsible for 71 per cent of the sector\u2019s CO2 emissions (IMO 2020).1 Many of the ships that undertake international voyages also undertake domestic voyages. For example, a ship may load cargo in a port in one country, sail to a second port in that same country to load more cargo, and then sail to a port in another country to discharge cargo. CO2 shipping emissions in 2018 were lower than in 2008, which was the historic peak. As shown in figure 5.1, seaborne 1 According to another definition of international shipping emissions, which refers to ship types rather than to voyages, 87 per cent of emissions are international (IMO 2020). trade and emissions were closely correlated between 1990 and 2008. At the end of 2007, an oversupply of ships led ships to reduce their speed in order to ensure optimal utilization of their cargo capacity, which consequently reduced emissions. This became even more prominent in 2008 due to the decline in transport demand caused by the global financial crisis. After 2008, ships permanently reduced their speed by about 10\u201320 per cent compared with their pre-2008 speed, and the average size of bulkers and container ships increased, resulting in further efficiency improvements.

Source: IMO (2020) In future decades, CO2 emissions from shipping are projected to increase by 4\u201350 per cent from 2018 levels according to a range of plausible business-as-usual (BAU) scenarios that assume no further policy intervention on shipping emissions. This is due to the projected 40\u2013100 per cent increase in transport demand, despite projected fuel efficiency improvements in some scenarios (Faber et al. 2016; IMO 2020). The main driver of the increase in transport demand is the projected growth in wealth, as there is a strong positive correlation between gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and maritime transport demand. DNV GL (2020) estimates that COVID-19 will cause the total demand for seaborne transportation to decline by approximately 8 per cent in 2020, which will vary between cargo segments. By May 2020, some segments had seen an increase in activity compared with the same period in 2019, though container shipping capacity reduced by 6 per cent. Manufacturing is typically more affected in an economic downturn, which in turn reduces the demand for seaborne trade of manufactured products and base materials.

For example, \u2018top- down\u2019 methodologies are used for IEA data, while Fleming and de L\u00e9pinay (2019) use a \u2018bottom-up\u2019 approach for their emissions models. aerosol particles have a net warming impact on climate, with the total impact of both types of emission estimated at 3.5 per cent of all drivers of climate change from human activities (Lee et al. in press). Historical CO2 emissions from global aviation result in approximately 34 per cent of present-day aviation-related effective radiative forcing (ERF), with non-CO2 impacts accounting for approximately 66 per cent of ERF from (global) aviation (Lee et al. in press). The aviation industry expects emissions to increase in the coming decades, despite the current COVID-19 pandemic, which is currently estimated to impact traffic until at least 2024 (IATA 2020b). The latest emissions projections from the eleventh meeting of the ICAO Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP/11) (figure 5.2, prepared prior to the pandemic) suggest that emissions of international aviation will increase from about 0.5 GtCO2 of emissions (2015) to 1.2\u20131.9 GtCO2 by 2050 (Fleming and de L\u00e9pinay 2019). Revenue ton-kilometres (a metric for transport work in the aviation sector) are also expected to increase fourfold in the same period. Figure 5.2.

These trends assume that growth is unconstrained by airport infrastructure or airspace operational constraints. A wide range of factors, such as fluctuations in fuel prices and global economic conditions, can affect such trends. The current COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected demand for aviation transport, with 2020 passenger numbers expected to be 55 per cent lower than 2019 levels, and air cargo 12\u201315 per cent lower (IATA 2020b; IATA 2020c), though it is too early to tell what this will mean in terms of emissions. Current IATA forecasts suggest that short-haul traffic will recover more quickly than long-haul 55 Emissions Gap Report 2020 traffic.

Overall, emissions are likely to increase as traffic recovers, but there is significant uncertainty over the rate of recovery and impact on long-term projections. 5.2.3 International shipping and aviation emissions and the goals of the Paris Agreement Unless States choose to include international shipping and aviation GHG emissions in their initial NDCs, these emissions are not addressed by national policies.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5c48759d-ac83-45ec-a10f-f1e1fc48af77": {"__data__": {"id_": "5c48759d-ac83-45ec-a10f-f1e1fc48af77", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2020", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "78cee3dba4f5fe5baf7175cee2a4fdc0b16070df9b00f027ba6b129ceb5bd42b"}, "2": {"node_id": "85f7a99d-dee9-4488-9c3e-133c0f746c26", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "72374487fec691dd4fe211da64cd6e72cb0b2b50f879ec32e2f52fe41db89371"}}, "hash": "91b7657a184ae8fc783166f3ded3d37fe69d588ec34e44317a8ec1a02b9912ba", "text": "The emissions trajectories from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C (SR1.5) (2018) indicate that global temperature increase can only be limited to no more than 1.5\u00b0C if CO2 emissions reach net zero by 2050 (interquartile range: 2045\u20132055), with active permanent removal of CO2 from the atmosphere thereafter.

Improving fleet efficiency can be achieved through increased utilization (for example, reducing ballast leg using larger vessels, assuming the increased capacity is utilized), alternative sea routes that have shorter distances, and reduced speed (DNV GL 2019). Reducing ships\u2019 speed has large emissions reduction potential. The required propulsion power of a ship increases approximately to the third power of its speed. Since 2008, the shipping fleet has reduced its average speed and significantly reduced its emissions, though further reductions are possible (IMO 2020). Reducing the speed of large tankers from 12 knots to 11 knots for example, 56 Emissions Gap Report 2020 reduced emissions per ton-mile by around 8 per cent. Below 7 knots, the emissions begin to increase again (Lindstad and Eskeland 2015). Improving ship design and operation The newest generation of ships (built after 2015) are typically about 10\u201315 per cent more efficient than older ships, mainly due to optimized hull design and propeller efficiency and reduced auxiliary loads. This was at least partly driven by regulation on the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI), an IMO efficiency standard that applies to new ships contracted from 2013 (Faber and \u2019t Hoen 2016). Ships built in the next five years may improve by another 15\u201325 per cent through improved machinery and electricity systems, which could include measures such as hybridization (peak load shaving in conjunction with batteries) and waste heat recovery. Later generations could include a full-scale application of sails and kites, air lubrication and more advanced waste heat recovery, with another 5\u201310 per cent improvement on average (DNV GL 2017). Operational measures could reduce emissions by a further 5\u201310 per cent (DNV GL 2017; IMO 2020). The total potential of improving the energy efficiency of shipping up to 2050, including logistics and supply chain improvements, speed reduction and ship design and operation, ranges from 35 to 55 per cent compared with 2018 (DNV GL 2019; Balcombe et al. 2020; IMO 2020). Most measures are expected to be cost-efficient with current fuel prices, though wind power, solar panels, air lubrication and waste heat recovery, which require significant investment, need a higher fuel price to be cost-efficient (IMO 2020). 5.3.2 Aviation Technological improvements \u2013 engine and airframe A recent review (ICAO 2019a) requested by ICAO using independent experts examined the two types of aircraft that burn the overwhelming majority of fuel, the single-aisle (such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320) and the twin-aisle (such as the Boeing 777 and 787, and Airbus A330 and A350), and estimated their performance in 10 and 20 years (2027 and 2037). According to the review, radical alteration in aircraft shape is unlikely by 2037, with improvements limited to \u2018tube and wing\u2019 type aircraft. The following targets were deemed challenging but possible by 2037: reductions in fuel burn for single-aisle and twin-aisle aircraft of 21.6 per cent and 21.0 per cent, respectively, which are annual improvements of 1.22 and 1.28 per cent.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9d441233-8753-49a9-ad8e-f27238dd3713": {"__data__": {"id_": "9d441233-8753-49a9-ad8e-f27238dd3713", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2020", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b3a0933f89998eed0565386e88302f593379f87ea06a53c7b97112b3901ece3d"}, "2": {"node_id": "e5df4891-f779-41d2-a013-9e914c104a21", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "37093934cdb68c5e50d951c1a5a8cde768b50863892699476a4372b72390f4d5"}}, "hash": "0a1d46123548800a8b01e256b0db92ab91ffcc41b9a0290a554c491f23ff8104", "text": "Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, in October 2018, IATA forecasted compound annual growth in air travel of 3.5 per cent, which equates to a doubling over 20 years and is considerably greater than the reductions likely to follow from technological improvements.

In a 2010 ICAO review (ICAO 2010), the following additional, but relatively small, savings were identified from changing design constraints: \u25b6 reducing the cruise Mach number from M=0.84 to 0.78 would give potential savings of around 4 per cent for twin-aisle aircraft \u25b6 increasing wingspan for some designs would reduce fuel burn, though this would require wider gates at airports or folding wings (as on the Boeing 777X) \u25b6 injecting water into engines to mitigate the high- temperature problems experienced at take-off would improve engine performance during cruise as less turbine cooling air would be required \u25b6 restricting top-of-climb performance (to make the clime rate smaller) would allow for better optimization of engines. The independent experts also looked at advanced alternative aircraft types, such as the blended wing body (a design that merges fuselage with a large delta wing), and configurations with wider bodies, smaller wings and engines at the rear of the aeroplane. For the blended wing body, the fuel-burn reduction was 10\u201312 per cent compared with advanced conventional aircraft. Another alternative design, the Aurora D8, which was studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) with support from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), has wings and a separate fuselage, and offers roughly a 13 per cent improvement. Chen et al. (2019) estimate that blended wing bodies will be 31.5 per cent more efficient in terms of fuel burn than current aircraft. In general, there are likely to be improvements in aircraft airframes and engines in the next 20 or so years, which will improve the burn-fuel metric by around 1.2 per cent per year. However, the crucial conclusion is that the sum of the potential improvements does not come near to matching the projected growth in aviation, let alone to reducing emissions from the current level. Operational improvements In practice, the operation of aircraft is generally less than optimal as they often fly below full capacity and cannot take the best flight route due to diversions and holding patterns. Improved operations could be achieved from, for example, single-engine taxi procedures and ground holds in the terminal area, reduced or de-rated thrust on departure, more direct routing and weather-optimized routing en route, and continuous descent approach (CDA) during arrival. A recent ICAO study calculated that routing inefficiencies currently total 2\u20136 per cent (Brain and Voorbach 2019). Clearly, the scope for operational improvements to reduce CO2 emissions is limited. 5.3.3 Alternative fuels For both the aviation and shipping sectors, decarbonization cannot occur without a transition away from the fossil fuels 57 Emissions Gap Report 2020 that they currently burn to alternative fuels. Such fuels could include synthetic hydrocarbon fuels3 produced from biomass, waste products or CO2 direct air capture (DAC) from the atmosphere (The Royal Society 2019), zero-carbon fuels and energy carriers, such as hydrogen and ammonia (as long as they are produced without generating additional GHG emissions). This section discusses non-fossil alternative fuels for shipping and aviation that have low, zero or negative GHG emissions throughout their life cycle. Biofuels Various biofuels are currently used in shipping and aviation, albeit on a small scale, with estimates suggesting that these will comprise less than 1 per cent of total aviation fuel by 2024 (International Energy Agency [IEA] 2019). While biofuels can have lower life cycle emissions, assessing their merits is complex, as gains towards \u2018carbon neutrality\u2019 depend heavily on their feedstocks and processes, as well as on their direct and indirect emissions, particularly those resulting from land-use change (LUC) from biofuel production. Assuming that biofuel combustion is carbon neutral is therefore a fundamental accounting error that rests on implicit spatiotemporal boundaries and assumptions (Searchinger et al. 2009), as for many biofuels, the energy return on investment is comparatively low or possibly negative (Hall, Lambert and Balogh 2014; Chiriboga et al. 2020). The availability of land and water is also a key and potentially ethical constraint on the availability of biofuel (Nuffield Council on Bioethics 2011). For shipping, biofuels are currently three to five times as expensive as conventional fuels (CE Delft and Ecorys forthcoming) and are of similar magnitudes for aviation (IEA 2018).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "92748f31-3e04-42ad-8e64-676fc76393bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "92748f31-3e04-42ad-8e64-676fc76393bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2020", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f0bd7ad86c986c3b1213cc381a1d3a97778300a7734826a60f0c6dfed47c3655"}, "2": {"node_id": "9e0efb88-af0c-465e-b9fd-ee8e2cc0c241", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0288225db186de76d5b7901279c615d47769b1ca4073674aa335fa1dabf7fb33"}}, "hash": "a9a73311ab327da038eb4d805c195be9f95fdeaa8a949ebe2802ea9e7e71b714", "text": "E-fuels from renewable energy Other pathways have been discussed for the production of synthetic hydrocarbon fuels, such as power-to-liquid \u2018electro-fuels\u2019 (e-fuels) (Schmidt et al. 2018), or more broadly \u2018power-to-x pathways\u2019 (Kober et al. 2019) (for example, by incinerating municipal waste).

DAC still represents a significant challenge, although some CO2 may be captured from residual emissions, which includes processes such as fermentation and cement manufacturing. In terms of environmental performance, e-fuels have much smaller land requirements than biofuel and do not depend on arable land (Schmidt et al. 2018), though they 3 Meaning hydrocarbon fuels generated from non-fossil fuel feedstocks and with renewable electricity in the manufacturing process (and avoiding an increase in fossil-powered electricity generation because of the increase in demand for electricity). do require significant renewable electricity (Fuhrman et al. 2020). Notwithstanding the significant barriers of sufficient available renewable energy and CO2 from DAC, creating synthetic fuel is technologically feasible, though at much greater costs than direct fossil fuel extraction and refining. In the case of aviation, the use of renewably-generated synthetic fuels (or biofuels) would also benefit the climate through reducing contrail-related warming, due to their absence of soot particles (which are formed from fossil kerosene aromatics and cause the formation of contrails) (Bier et al. 2017; Bier and Burkhardt 2019). Hydrogen and ammonia Hydrogen can be used as a zero-carbon fuel, either in combustion engines or fuels cells. To ensure that hydrogen is carbon neutral, it must be generated from renewable energy sources or reformation of fossil fuels during carbon capture and storage (CCS). Although liquid hydrogen (LH2) has an energy density per unit mass approximately three times greater than aviation kerosene, it has a much lower energy density per unit volume. Thick layers of insulation are also required, which further increases the effective volume. Its use in aviation would therefore require radical aircraft design changes (McKinsey and Company 2020). Similarly, for ships, hydrogen requires about seven times the space of diesel tanks (DNV GL 2019) and would result in a loss of revenue and range. There are also many infrastructural barriers to LH2-powered aircraft or ships, such as generation and distribution, meaning its development is only likely under a larger-scale hydrogen- oriented energy economy. The energy content of hydrogen may be obtained without the problems of cryogenic or high-pressure storage by using a hydrogen-containing compound as a carrier. This is done with hydrocarbons but can also be done with nitrogen to form ammonia. Burning ammonia releases the energy of hydrogen on combustion without producing CO2. Ammonia requires a volume of around 3.5 times the space of traditional fuel tanks (DNV GL 2019). Internal combustion engines can be modified to run on ammonia, though research and development are needed, including on ways to limit emissions of N\u2082O, a potent GHG (Valera-Medina et al. 2018). Full-electric propulsion Full-electric propulsion can be carbon neutral if the electricity is generated without emitting CO2 (Epstein and O\u2019Flarity 2019). However, a major barrier in both aviation and shipping is that the energy stored in batteries per unit mass is around 250 W-hr/kg, whereas hydrocarbon fuel has a calorific value of around 12,000 W-hr/kg. In addition, electrical machinery and control units are heavy and large. 58 Emissions Gap Report 2020 For aircraft, the heaviness of batteries means that battery- propelled aircraft will be limited to shorter ranges. A recent paper by Langford and Hall (2020) states that electric propulsion makes economic sense for ranges between 50 and 200 miles, meaning it will only slightly contribute to reductions in aviation sector emissions. Similarly, batteries can be used as propulsion energy for ships undertaking short voyages, most obviously ferries, but not long voyages unless radical improvements are made. Implications and key challenges: a focus on price signals and economic incentives There are several options that the shipping sector can take to transition away from fossil fuels. Techno-economic analyses from the last two years (Ash and Scarbrough, 2019; Lloyd\u2019s Register [LR] and University Maritime Advisory Services [UMAS] 2019; DNV GL 2020; IEA 2020) all indicate that sustainable ammonia is the cheapest decarbonization option for shipping in many scenarios, and would only require a small evolution in current on-board machinery. However, the technology is just in development and full-scale pilots are unlikely for another three years, thus prolonging the period of uncertainty in least-cost fuels.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f4f7facb-51b1-4999-a735-267c912733d4": {"__data__": {"id_": "f4f7facb-51b1-4999-a735-267c912733d4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2020", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d245e35f76ba7e9bcbc0d3db783afec995cf8c354579fe748e6f4b65c18d6e18"}, "2": {"node_id": "3dca6de0-cb9f-43a1-9004-4d6226a6688b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "15922942bc3c3fb5ba9cc6423cd10bb0d95550690e0192e93d359cbf941c4fd1"}}, "hash": "7fd7bf6e32a40798bc7aed9f5aa15e2af6d5281ecf9cee028e354b317df30739", "text": "Non-hydrocarbon fuel options for aviation require radical airframe/engine and infrastructural changes.

For operators, this will be reflected in the cost of fuel, which is significant for both shipping and aviation. Future carbon-neutral and zero-carbon fuel prices are estimated to cost in the range of US$20\u2013100/GJ, which is significantly higher than current aviation fuel costs of around US$7.5/GJ. IEA estimated that the mean production costs of aviation biofuels in 2018 were approximately two to three times that of fossil jet kerosene (IEA 2018). The major uncertainty lies in the cost and availability of the primary energy sources, such as sustainable biomass and renewable electricity (DNV GL 2020; IMO 2020; LR and UMAS 2020). Shipping fuels traded at around US$8\u20139/GJ in summer 2020 (Ship & Bunker undated), although recent prices have reached over US$16/GJ. A shift to fuels that emit low GHG emissions and are renewable provides a very strong economic signal that will further affect the fundamental inputs to fleet growth scenarios. If higher fuel costs translate into airfares, demand will reduce according to price elasticities, assuming all other factors remain equal. Elasticities for passenger air travel vary considerably (Smyth and Pearce 2008) but could average in the order of -1.1 across travel classes (Becken and Carmignani 2020). In the case of shipping, supply chains that adapt to these new economic conditions may enable fleets using renewable fuels to modify their services and modernize their technologies in such a way that allows GHG targets to be met with minimal impacts on the growth in demand for shipping services (Halim, Smith and Englert 2019). Ultimately, the price gap between incumbent fossil fuels and post-fossil fuels represents a key challenge that prevents investment both in the sectors and infrastructure on land. Without sufficiently stringent regulation in place to force or enable a business case for zero-carbon fuel use, these investments are unlikely to flow at the required scale until there is either a customer preference or a price premium for zero-carbon shipping services. 5.4 Pathways to lower emissions Section 5.2 shows that projected emissions from shipping and aviation are incompatible with emissions pathways that are consistent with the Paris Agreement temperature goals, given projected increases and the lack of permanent CO2 removals. This means that the decarbonization options presented in section 5.3 need to be implemented despite their high costs. This section discusses the agreed policy goals for both sectors, concludes that they are not sufficient to achieve full decarbonization by 2050 or well before 2070 and discusses how policies could be intensified. 5.4.1 Current shipping policies In 2011, the IMO adopted mandatory technical and operational energy efficiency measures that were expected to significantly reduce the amount of CO2 emissions from international shipping. These mandatory measures (EEDI/ Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan \u2013 SEEMP) entered into force on 1 January 2013. In 2016, additional amendments were adopted to mandate the collection and reporting of ships\u2019 fuel oil consumption data. The IMO\u2019s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) adopted the Initial IMO Strategy on reduction of GHG emissions from ships in 2018, which sets out levels of ambition for shipping emissions. These are stated in the strategy as: \u25b6 phase out GHG emissions from international shipping as soon as possible through strengthened energy efficiency design requirements for ships \u25b6 improve the carbon intensity (CO2 emissions per unit of transport work) of international shipping by at least 40 per cent in 2030 and 70 per cent by 2050, both relative to 2008 \u25b6 set GHG emissions from international shipping on a declining pathway as soon as possible, reducing the total annual GHG emissions of international shipping by at least 50 per cent by 2050 compared with 2008 as a point on a pathway of emissions 59 Emissions Gap Report 2020 reductions consistent with the Paris Agreement temperature goals. The IMO is due to agree on a Revised GHG Strategy in 2023, which will be a key opportunity to update the quantitative targets in line with the latest science, and to remove current ambiguities on their alignment to the Paris Agreement temperature goals. Currently, CO2 emissions from domestic shipping are generally not addressed in NDCs. Role of non-State actors and national strategies The system change required for shipping to decarbonize is considerable and demands industry regulation in order to overcome a range of market barriers and failures.

Private standards and initiatives to reduce GHG emissions from shipping include the following: \u25b6 Getting to Zero Coalition: a collaboration of approximately 140 corporations focused on achieving the goal of establishing scalable zero-carbon energy solutions for international shipping from 2030 (Global Maritime Forum 2020). \u25b6 Poseidon Principles: a commitment to transparent annual reporting of portfolio operational carbon intensity relative to an interpretation of the Initial IMO Strategy by financial institutions representing approximately 30 per cent of the capital invested in international shipping (Poseidon Principles undated). \u25b6 Sea Cargo Charter: a commitment to transparent annual reporting of supply chain operational carbon intensity relative to an interpretation of the Initial IMO Strategy by charterers and cargo owners (Sea Cargo Charter undated). Altogether, these create a growing set of decarbonization- aligned initiatives that will move capital and purchasing decisions and hold organizations accountable to the Paris Agreement temperature goals. Their connection to the Initial IMO Strategy and Paris Agreement temperature goals indicates that a clarification of the IMO\u2019s ambitions within its Revised Strategy could be easily translated into further private sector action. 5.4.2 Current aviation policies ICAO, as a specialized United Nations organization, has the lead role in steering the aviation industry\u2019s response to climate change goals. It has developed two global 4 This only refers to growth over and above the 2019\u20132020 levels. Owing to COVID-19 air travel disruptions, the ICAO Council has changed the baseline for the CORSIA pilot period to 2019 levels. 5 CORSIA only addresses international emissions. aspirational climate change goals for international aviation, which are to improve fuel efficiency by 2 per cent per year until 2050, and to achieve carbon-neutral growth from 2020 onward. ICAO Member States have identified four main elements in a \u2018basket of measures\u2019 to achieve these goals: aircraft technologies, operational improvements, sustainable alternative fuels and a market-based mechanism. Member States are also exploring the feasibility of a long-term aspirational goal for international aviation (ICAO 2016; ICAO 2019b). The means of in-sector reductions include aircraft technology improvements through the Aeroplane CO2 Standard (ICAO undated a), along with guidance on operational improvement measures to minimize fuel burn (ICAO undated b) and sustainability criteria for aviation fuels. The Aeroplane CO2 Standard is expected to deliver incremental reductions in line with historic improvements in efficiency. Recent reports suggest that about 1.2\u20131.4 per cent in fleet efficiency gain is possible per year (ICAO 2019; Fleming and de L\u00e9pinay 2019), which falls short of the ICAO target of 2 per cent per year and is significantly less than the projected annual growth in aviation. The route taken by ICAO to achieve carbon-neutral growth is being predominantly pursued via out-of-sector measures, in particular through the offsetting element of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which sets a target of not increasing net CO2 emissions from international aviation over average 2019\u2013 2020 levels for the 2021\u20132035 period (ICAO 2020).4 CORSIA will require airlines to purchase eligible units to offset emissions above the baseline. Airlines can reduce their offsetting requirement by claiming emission reductions from CORSIA eligible fuels, thus incentivizing the use of fuels with a lower carbon footprint. It is crucial that the UNFCCC and Member States provide clarity on mechanisms to avoid double counting of units. The nature of offsetting means that there will be no absolute reductions in the aviation sector itself through the use of such credits, and could in fact result in a potential increase in CO2 emissions. Instead, aviation relies on other sectors\u2019 avoidance or removal of carbon. By not only continuing to emit but potentially increasing emissions, the net effect will be that no overall reductions can be achieved. This outcome is in stark contrast with the reduction pathway necessary for limiting warming to within 1.5\u00b0C (Becken and Mackey 2017). Furthermore, the ambiguity of international aviation\u2019s CO2 emissions in the Paris Agreement is a constraint to multilateral regulation. Regardless of concerns around the net benefit of offsetting, Scheelhaase et al. (2018) estimate that CORSIA will result in the offset of only 12 per cent of total international and domestic aviation emissions by 2030.5 Currently, offsets 60 Emissions Gap Report 2020 are almost exclusively provided by emissions avoidance.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "559944b5-29c8-42ab-9811-23781f459cad": {"__data__": {"id_": "559944b5-29c8-42ab-9811-23781f459cad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2020", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "549cd518d4c62460fb441a6221b8c639fbf6c9373c047de59a4cad1fc80342bd"}, "2": {"node_id": "8c1a5e38-ec91-420b-896d-e923cec15014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "90cec31f012ba77dc29aea598ee4e125656b2c908083ec54e6a318a743e601b4"}}, "hash": "97594a87b136a189286ff85706a9c648aba3fc00837400b3df6ba4a5f734f4d7", "text": "At a hypothetical maximum, if additionality is assumed, only 50 per cent of the emissions will be \u2018offset\u2019 (Becken and Mackey 2017) as the \u2018baseline\u2019 is an intention to emit two units of CO2; if the avoidance is achieved, aviation still emits one unit.

CORSIA sits alongside several other policies, most notably the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) that currently includes intra-European flights. How European flights will be treated in terms of compliance with both the EU ETS and CORSIA remains a point of uncertainty (Erling 2018; Scheelhaase et al. 2018; Maertens et al. 2019). 5.4.3 Intensifying policy measures to achieve decarbonization The previous section shows that decarbonization of shipping and aviation in line with the Paris Agreement is very challenging but necessary and feasible. It requires policies that specify energy consumption reduction targets for existing fleets, along with policies that aim to achieve a rapid transition away from fossil fuels to alternative fuels with a lower carbon footprint. Policy instruments related to the introduction of new fuels should incentivize an early adoption phase this decade and take a full life cycle approach to emissions accountancy (DNV GL 2020). Policies should aim to rapidly scale the deployment of new fuels as soon as possible (given the long lifetimes of assets), encourage investment in production processes and ramp up the required generation of renewable electricity. Suitable regulation to bridge the fuel pricing gap could start at the domestic or regional levels. Satellite observations of shipping activity reveal that an estimated 30 per cent of total shipping emissions fall directly within the responsibility of national governments, which is twice the magnitude previously estimated (UCL 2020). Governments could therefore take action on this policy area as part of their NDCs. Domestic or regional actions towards regulating shipping emissions could also prompt ambitious action at the international level (known as \u2018autonomous interaction\u2019 in international law) and serve as a signal to the industry (Martinez Romera 2016). Given that supply and demand are interlinked, and because investors need to have confidence that fuels will find a market or that ships or aircraft will be able to purchase the type of fuel they require, it takes time to make a transition. Due to these various lag effects, it is important to start the transition early and gradually, taking into account all United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 5.5 Conclusions 1. If left unabated, the international shipping and aviation sectors are projected to emit increasing amounts of CO2 and other GHG emissions in the coming decades. BAU scenarios indicate that international emissions from these sectors will consume between 60\u2013220 per cent of allowable CO2 emissions under the IPCC SR1.5 illustrative scenarios by 2050. 2. Current policy frameworks are insufficient and additional policies are therefore required to bridge the gap between the sectors\u2019 current BAU trajectories and GHG pathways consistent with the Paris Agreement temperature goals. 3. Improvements in technology and operations can increase the fuel efficiency of transport if further policies incentivize them. However, due to expected increases in demand (even considering the potential impacts of the current global COVID-19 pandemic), improvements are unlikely to result in decarbonization and absolute reductions of CO2 for either the shipping or aviation sectors. 4. Both sectors will therefore need to combine a maximization of energy efficiency with a rapid transition away from fossil fuel. Fossil fuel substitutes will need to be produced without combustion of fossil fuels, which will require a decarbonization (and rapid scale-up) of new production and supply chains. 5. International aviation currently intends to meet its ICAO goals through heavily relying on carbon offsets, which do not represent absolute reductions, but at best, provide time to transition to low-carbon fuels and introduce energy efficiency improvements. At worst, offsets create a disincentive for investment in in-sector decarbonization and delay the necessary transition. Current carbon offsetting is clearly not a long-term solution and therefore needs to be minimized and eventually phased out. ICAO recognizes this through the CORSIA review scheduled for 2032. 6. For the next few decades it is highly likely that aircraft will be fuelled with hydrocarbons due to their inherent advantages as fuels. Compared with aeroplanes, ships have a less constrained design in terms of volume and mass of fuel, and therefore have greater options, including ammonia. 7. Biofuels can have a lower carbon footprint than fossil hydrocarbon fuels, but this is sensitive to induced LUC emissions, either direct or indirect, which are difficult to quantify. Large-scale production of fossil fuel substitutes will be difficult, expensive and potentially detrimental to the environment. 61 Emissions Gap Report 2020 8.

This is underscored by the fact that household consumption accounts for around two-thirds of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; Ivanova et al. (2016) estimate lifestyle and consumption emissions at 65 per cent of the global total, while Hertwich and Peters (2009) suggest the proportion to be around 72 per cent of total emissions.1 On an aggregate level, compliance with the 1.5\u00b0C goal of the Paris Agreement will require reducing consumption emissions to a per capita lifestyle carbon footprint of around 2 to 2.5 tons of CO2e by 2030, and an even smaller 0.7 tons by 2050 (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC] 2018; Institute for Global Environment Strategies [IGES] et al. 2019; Ivanova et al. 2020). Most climate mitigation pathways that seek to keep temperature rise to within 1.5\u00b0C envisage a major role for lifestyle change (IPCC 2018). The International Energy Agency (IEA 2020) has likewise concluded that behaviour change is an integral part of emissions reduction strategies that accomplish net-zero emissions by 2050, emphasizing in particular the need for changes to domestic energy use, as well as reductions in car use and passenger aviation (see chapter 5). Understanding the distribution of lifestyle emissions among populations and by activities is important for equitable 1 Calculated using consumption-based accounting, encompassing GHG emissions associated with the production and use of products and services used by households. targeting of mitigation measures, in order to encourage reductions from households with high consumption emissions and to avoid regressive impacts associated with imposing burdens on the poor (Rao et al. 2017; Roberts et al. 2020; Wiedman et al. 2020). Average consumption emissions vary substantially between countries. For example, current per capita consumption emissions in the United States of America are approximately 17.6 tons CO2e per capita, around 10 times that of India at 1.7 tons per capita. By contrast, the European Union and the United Kingdom together have an average footprint of approximately 7.9 tons per capita (see chapter 2). A range of estimates point to a strong correlation between income and emissions, with a highly unequal global distribution of consumption emissions. Such studies estimate that the emissions share of the top 10 per cent of income earners is around 36\u201349 per cent of the global total, whereas the lowest 50 per cent of income earners account for around 7\u201315 per cent of all emissions (Chakravarty et al. 2009; Chancel and Piketty 2015; Oxfam 2015; Hubacek et al. 2017; Dorband et al. 2019; Oxfam and Stockholm Environment Institute [SEI] 2020).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "10e0b4d1-5cca-4c23-b4bc-3e046150e987": {"__data__": {"id_": "10e0b4d1-5cca-4c23-b4bc-3e046150e987", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2020", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9c164057a7fd810cfe2df5e1ad1f2584fda6e8e0ed5efaad0c4f25b331d943b6"}, "2": {"node_id": "b3c3f317-95f4-4d69-8bf0-1541bcbd8678", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "68ceda4adc6f7dbd91663a9c51b81970db9efb074e7fac3f378fd2019c3fc1c9"}}, "hash": "2a63024cd908bbf4f11917f87ff8566ccae3f3a3640356c1b49dc3c263861437", "text": "2019; Oxfam and Stockholm Environment Institute [SEI] 2020).

One study estimates that the \u2018super-rich\u2019 top 0.1 per cent of earners have per capita emissions of around 217 tCO2 \u2013 several hundred times greater than the average of the poorest half of the global population (Oxfam and SEI 2020). Estimates of the per capita CO2 consumption emissions of different global income groups are shown in figure 6.1, based on Oxfam and SEI (2020). This analysis estimates per capita CO2 emissions rather than CO2-equivalent, and allocates all consumption emissions to individuals rather than just those associated with household consumption. To indicate the relative scale of lifestyle emission changes required, a target for global average per capita consumption emissions of 2.1 tCO2 per capita in 2030 is also shown, as implied by 1.5\u00b0C-consistent pathways estimated by Oxfam (2020). Estimates in figure 6.1 show that per capita consumption emissions of those in the global top 10 per cent of income earners would need to be reduced to about one-tenth of their current level by 2030 and those of the top 1 per cent by at least a factor of 30, while those of the poorest 50 per cent could increase by around three times their current level.

Income thresholds in 2015 are according to US$ purchasing power parity in 2011: 1 per cent > US$109,000; 10 per cent > US$38,000; middle 40 per cent > US$6,000; poorest 50 per cent < US$6,000. Other estimates also affirm wide disparities in emissions by income bracket. Oswald et al. (2020) estimate that households of the global top 10 per cent of income earners use around 45 per cent of all energy for land transport and around 75 per cent of all energy for aviation, compared with 10 per cent and 5 per cent respectively for the poorest 50 per cent of households. Similarly, Ivanova and Wood (2020) find that a large share of the emissions of the top- emitting European Union households are transport-related. To design equitable low-carbon lifestyle approaches, it is important to consider these consumption inequities and identify populations with very high and very low carbon footprints. Central to addressing consumption inequities is reframing the meaning of \u2018progress\u2019 and \u2018affluence\u2019 away from the accumulation of income or energy-intensive resources to the achievement of well-being and quality of life. Studies show that a comprehensive idea of well-being that includes basic needs for all people can be attained with 64 Emissions Gap Report 2020 a much-reduced level of energy consumption (Rao et al. 2019; Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020). 6.2 Achieving lifestyle emissions reduction by sector To help understand the options available to reduce lifestyle emissions, the Avoid-Shift-Improve (ASI) framework (Creutzig et al. 2018; van den Berg et al. 2019) provides a useful conceptual categorization. This framework does not articulate how lifestyle change occurs, but provides distinctions around the types of possible emissions reduction. In this chapter, we emphasize emissions reduction from mobility, residential energy use and food, as these constitute key sectors through which lifestyle change can enable climate mitigation, comprising approximately 17 per cent, 19 per cent and 20 per cent of lifestyle emissions respectively (Hertwich and Peters 2009). The Avoid category refers to the reduction in energy or carbon demand by foregoing some aspect of consumption 2 For more detail on the results included in this chapter, please see Annex III.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "42a4e925-3d98-4135-b8ad-4e6547f1ea8f": {"__data__": {"id_": "42a4e925-3d98-4135-b8ad-4e6547f1ea8f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2020", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "15920cfd7341e7024bdf806cfddbf2e2cc09a66ed94330a8788a3a95187f62e6"}, "2": {"node_id": "46f67f4d-e2f3-483c-9a01-7f95aea5d9ab", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "488b9abbbb03216c6696035a8058bdc4a6145ea984600ab6968b4dbb2e9ad00a"}}, "hash": "fab705ec7d8b366ba2372e84ac738caf7e55d1832f6c927a8a0c4abff2eb410e", "text": "For more detail on the searches, procedure and inclusion criteria, please see Ivanova et al. 2020.

Figure 6.2 shows boxplots for options of varying carbon mitigation potential, aggregated by different sectors and ASI categories, based on a meta-review of 53 lifecycle assessment studies by Ivanova et al. (2020).2 These studies included the supply chain impacts that may occur elsewhere than the country of consumption. Also shown in figure 6.2 are illustrative examples of impactful changes across sectors, based on median emissions reduction potential across studies. 65 Emissions Gap Report 2020 Figure 6.2.

Examples for each ASI category per sector are given. For a detailed breakdown of consumption options included, see Annex III and Ivanova et al. 2020. Building on the types of changes identified in figure 6.2, tables 6.1 to 6.3 offer examples from different countries on approaches to encourage low-carbon lifestyles for mobility, residential energy use and food, covering both hypothetical and implemented cases, as well as a range of mechanisms (for example, city-based projects, national policies and citizen-led initiatives). We discuss in more detail the range of mechanisms by which lifestyle change can be accomplished in section 6.3. In terms of mobility (table 6.1), there is substantial mitigation potential to reduce emissions by avoiding and curtailing travel. Reducing long-haul flights has strong potential to reduce emissions in an equitable manner: air travel accounts for around 41 per cent of the carbon footprint of the highest- emitting 1 per cent of households in the European Union, but less than 1 per cent of the emissions of the poorest 50 per cent of households. Although this mitigation option is available only to primarily wealthier people who fly, it has the potential for substantial emissions reduction, at around 1.9 tCO2e per avoided long-haul return flight (see chapter 5 for a more detailed discussion of technology-centric options to reduce aviation-sector emissions). Emissions from mobility can also be reduced through more active travel such as cycling and walking, and greater use of public transport. Further options to improve mobility emissions include greater vehicle efficiency or the adoption of BEVs. Overall, consumption options in the mobility sector show high mitigation potential and high income-elasticity of demand (i.e. there is a strong link between income and mobility emissions; Ivanova and Wood 2020; Oswald et al. 2020). This suggests that emissions reduction measures across this sector can be relatively impactful and equitable, as they concern limiting luxury consumption by higher- income households. 66 Emissions Gap Report 2020 Table 6.1.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "21e0f985-312a-4662-ba6e-cfd17e84fafe": {"__data__": {"id_": "21e0f985-312a-4662-ba6e-cfd17e84fafe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2020", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c55a36efe28727226414312a05cc9d87d9cf2c28ec7f99f771711229ad4bdf6b"}, "2": {"node_id": "95e629c8-3a43-46da-916e-c2e75e3511c3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "67c5d5e92165a5d445e1d172cc476c8baed2b67cd57d893f59432c9e7ba2557b"}}, "hash": "b7b7187dcb4eefc0db216fd39685e7be64eaa9250cedd68b52e4df9c681ae972", "text": "66 Emissions Gap Report 2020 Table 6.1.

While the estimates considered here are drawn from a range of geographical regions, evidence of mitigation from lifestyle change from developing countries are typically lacking in the literature relative to European and North American studies. Approaches to promote low-carbon lifestyle measures in developing countries are critical, however, with structural transitions offering opportunities to align development and climate objectives (McCauley and Heffron 2018). Many developing countries\u2019 economies are growing quickly, and infrastructure and policy decisions taken now have the potential to lock in high- or low-carbon lifestyles (the latter with multiple benefits) for the long-term. For instance, an estimated 3 billion people worldwide currently rely on highly polluting and unhealthy traditional solid fuels for household cooking and heating (Yadama 2013). Shifting these energy sources to electricity and clean fuels could heavily influence residential emissions reductions and provide multiple development outcomes (Creutzig et al. 2016; Mulugetta et al. 2019). 6.3 Realizing lifestyle change: which mechanisms encourage low-carbon lifestyles? The evidence presented so far shows that rising emissions are underpinned by contemporary lifestyles. Major reductions in emissions require substantial changes to these patterns of consumption and behaviours \u2013 especially among the global rich (Davis and Caldeira 2010; Liobikien\u0117 and Dagili\u016bt\u0117 2016; Oswald et al. 2020; Oxfam and SEI 2020). A person\u2019s choices operate within broader contexts that enable or constrain action (Akenji and Bengtsson 2014; Walker 2014) \u2013 including physical environments, cultural conventions, social norms and financial and policy frameworks \u2013 and are inseparable from income levels and access to resources. Even so, individuals can exercise environmental citizenship to bring about societal change through the various roles they occupy: including as 71 Emissions Gap Report 2020 consumers, members of organizations and communities, citizens participating in social movements and deliberative processes, or as owners of assets and investments (Stern 2000). These types of personal action can influence not only the underlying social conditions that shape lifestyles, but also the actions of governments and businesses (Otto et al. 2020a; Nielsen et al. 2020; Amel et al. 2017). The interaction between structural conditions and how people live is dynamic: personal choices have consequences for the contexts within which they are made, which in turn reinforce or challenge the contribution of lifestyles to climate change (see figure 6.3). Figure 6.3. Mechanisms to change lifestyles Structural Social and Contextual Personal and Immediate Media and advertising Legal and institutional frameworks Supply chains Economics and incentives Policies and governance Behaviour change Knowledge and information Consumer choices Attitudes and awareness Habits and routines Infrastructure Conventions Citizen participation Interpersonal influence Social norms Social movements Note: Personal, social and contextual, and structural factors affecting lifestyle consumption options. 6.3.1 Incentives, information and choice provision Approaches that encourage voluntary behaviour change (for example, information provision, economic incentives) have been a dominant means by which policy has attempted to influence lifestyles (Pykett et al. 2011). Economic policies such as renewable energy incentives have stimulated uptake of solar voltaic panels (Briguglio and Formosa 2017; Mundaca and Samahita 2020) and changed the competitiveness of renewable energy compared with fossil fuels. Market-oriented policies can also increase the behavioural plasticity (i.e. how responsive behaviours are to changes in external conditions) of actions for carbon emissions reduction (Dietz et al. 2009), which can be crucial in increasing access to low-carbon lifestyle options. Targeted information (energy efficiency information, carbon labelling) can also shift consumer decision-making towards more efficient and low-carbon products (Langley et al.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f2e4da2a-28cd-444a-9918-40196b3b3881": {"__data__": {"id_": "f2e4da2a-28cd-444a-9918-40196b3b3881", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2020", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "81bc8729fe75f45ca47f4cc85464bebad5eadd380ff44861e885cb7771b01046"}, "2": {"node_id": "0ad808f5-b7a8-489f-b02a-b49dde5f15b0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ec97add3fcab6a4c7ad000aac7a19b5d8a2a40037ba3373ae09c65e8a3cf4946"}}, "hash": "3e8b3a1b3db1485ac82f71ee6400fe1a55222436913a0fecf9b92c5630d54d64", "text": "2012; Kunreuther and Weber 2014; Khosla et al. 2019; Whittle et al. 2019) and often has broad public support (Carbon Trust 2020). Adjustments to the contexts under which decisions are made can also be influential, by offering low-carbon products and services as the default option (Kaiser et al. 2020).

Such approaches risk \u2018scapegoating\u2019 citizens (Akenji 2012) and may not be enough to overcome inertia (Kaiser et al. 2020). Historically, sustainable transitions have not been strongly driven by voluntary consumer choices (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] 2003), but by factors such as social norms and by changing the options available to consumers (Sustainable Consumption Roundtable 2006). While there have been calls for integrated policy that combines more assertive and restrictive policies with voluntary ones (Moberg et al. 2018), public acceptability is key for both approaches, with the risk that policies that unfairly burden households will receive backlash (Sovacool et al. 2017; Moberg et al. 2018). 72 Emissions Gap Report 2020 6.3.2 Infrastructure and conventions of everyday life Patterns of everyday life \u2013 the way we eat, travel and occupy our homes \u2013 are shaped and directed by the built environment, how services are provided, and expectations of normal conduct (Breadsell et al. 2019). In many developed nations, the dominance of the car has been enabled through urban infrastructure that is car-dependent, spatial planning that has led people to live far from workplaces and essential services, and a \u2018car culture\u2019 that favours this mode of transport (Mattioli et al. 2020). Likewise, high-carbon diets have become established through supply chains and market liberalization that has promoted convenience foods, bulk- buying and meat-based meals (Hoolohan et al. 2016; Xiong et al. 2020). Attempts to reduce lifestyles emissions are more likely to be effective if they address the infrastructures on which high- carbon lifestyles depend and enable knock-on effects to other carbon-intensive practices. For example, high-speed rail networks may lower demand for domestic aviation (Clewlow et al. 2014). Conversely, infrastructural changes that do not anticipate how decisions might influence wider patterns of daily life may result in failure or unintended increases in emissions. 6.3.3 Social influence Where lifestyle change is accomplished \u2013 by one person, household or community \u2013 this can act as a catalyst to promote wider change, spreading behaviours through peer influence and reconfiguring what is typical or expected (Shwom and Lorenzen 2012; Guilbeault et al. 2018; Wolske et al. 2020). Social influence has contributed to wider uptake of rooftop solar panels (Bollinger and Gillingham 2012; Richter 2013; Graziano and Gillingham 2015), transport modal shift (Feygin and Pozdnoukhov 2018), transitioning to plant- based diets (Cherry 2006) and purchase of energy-efficient products (Wolske et al. 2020). At the interpersonal level, people follow the example of others who are similar to themselves (Welsch and K\u00fchling 2009; Abrahamse and Steg 2013; Amel et al. 2017). At a larger scale, the actions of a committed minority of people can comprise a \u2018critical mass\u2019 that is able to prompt broader change in patterns of behaviour, leading to a tipping point whereby social conventions change rapidly towards a new normal (Centola et al. 2018; Otto et al. 2020a). Actions taken by key individuals can lead to greater uptake of similar choices by others. The social influence of high- emitting groups, especially those in prestigious or influential positions, may be particularly important in shaping what is desirable and affect people\u2019s willingness to cooperate on shared problems (Anderson 2011; Henrich et al. 2015). Additionally, climate communicators, advocates and researchers are seen as more convincing \u2013 and their advice more likely to be acted upon \u2013 if they themselves pursue low-carbon lifestyles (Attari et al. 2016; Attari et al. 2019; Sparkman and Attari 2020). 6.3.4 Citizen participation Social movements can give individually disempowered people a strong voice if they act collectively (Kashwan 2016; Otto et al. 2020b). The example of the Fridays for Future youth climate protests has demonstrated collective agency among individuals \u2013 many of whom do not even have voting rights \u2013 with the movement becoming widely established across Europe, Africa, South America and Asia (Marquardt 2020). The involvement of people in bringing about change is enshrined in article 6 of the UNFCCC Doha Convention and article 12 of the Paris Agreement.

For example, Project 90 in South Africa advocates for a 90 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030 through youth leadership programmes and community engagement (Kyle 2020), while Bold Nebraska brought together farmers, Native Americans and other concerned citizens to build community action that successfully opposed the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline (Ordner 2017). 6.3.5 Disrupting habits Much of our behaviour is habitual \u2013 unconscious routines triggered by contextual cues (such as time of day), rather than a conscious intention to act (Kurz et al. 2015). Habits are a substantial barrier to lifestyle change, as they lock in individual behaviour and maintain its automatic repetition over time (Mar\u00e9chal and Lazaric 2011). However, since habits develop in, and are cued by, stable contexts (Wood et al. 2005), changes in context can in turn provide opportunities to disrupt well-established routines (Verplanken et al. 2008; Kurz et al. 2015). \u2018Moments of change\u2019 \u2013 defined as occasions when an individual\u2019s circumstances change considerably within 73 Emissions Gap Report 2020 a short time frame (Thompson et al. 2011) \u2013 have been identified as an important lever for lifestyle change (Capstick et al. 2014). Research shows that disruptions \u2013 whether concerning a person\u2019s life-course (such as moving house) or structural changes (such as economic growth or downturn) \u2013 can provide opportunities to recraft lifestyles in new directions (Birkmann et al. 2010; Verplanken et al. 2018), such as shifting from commuting by car to home-working (Marsden et al. 2020) or investing in energy-efficient housing and the use of LEDs in the home (Khosla et al. 2019; Kamat et al. 2020). 6.3.6 Lessons from COVID-19: opportunity to lock in positive changes COVID-19 has impacted everyday life around the world, disrupting many established patterns of behaviour. As noted in chapter 2 of this report, an unintended side effect of lockdown policies was a sharp, unprecedented drop in carbon emissions (Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al. 2020), representing the largest relative reduction globally since WWII. However, policies to contain COVID-19 differ from those needed to curb carbon emissions in important ways, and there are risks in drawing simplistic parallels between these very different issues. Lockdown policies were enacted quickly and designed to be temporary disruptions to the status quo. By contrast, lifestyle changes to address climate change entail carefully managed and long-term transitions away from the status quo towards more sustainable and equitable practices (Howarth et al. 2020). Nonetheless, COVID-19 has shown that rapid, extensive and profound changes in lifestyles are possible with the coordination of governments and civil society. The lessons for climate mitigation from COVID-19 are less about the magnitude or longevity of the drop in emissions observed, and more about the insights gained into how rapid lifestyle changes can happen. First, governments must lead the way and create conditions under which lifestyle changes are possible (for example, economic measures that enable workers to remain at home). Second, positive social norms and a sense of collective agency are important for behavioural change. Finally, infrastructure to lock in behaviour changes is critical \u2013 for example in the case of cities that, in response to COVID-19, took action to promote walking and cycling and encourage local food production (C40 Cities Network 2020). New habits take around two to three months to form (Lally et al. 2010), meaning the lockdown period in many countries may be long enough to establish new, enduring routines, if these are supported by longer-term measures. In planning the recovery from COVID-19, governments have an opportunity to catalyse low-carbon lifestyle changes by disrupting entrenched practices, rethinking infrastructure and protecting environmental standards (B\u00fcchs et al. 2020, see also chapter 4). 6.4 Integrated policies in each sector Drawing on the mechanisms described above, the following sections outline integrated approaches to lifestyle change across the mobility, residential and food sectors, providing practical examples of measures that have been implemented, as well as potentially effective approaches.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "084b1eee-c3a6-41fd-84da-91f71835990b": {"__data__": {"id_": "084b1eee-c3a6-41fd-84da-91f71835990b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2020", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f5054e978f71c690cfea77a9e4a87f0eb0067fbb31dc8345c1473d9bc8aefc9c"}, "2": {"node_id": "27c6a2f2-8455-4aaa-a9a5-085f2f9e8c99", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e790052ada90f75f43c97e5249f22e7b04e7f1d044bc6a5a5176e4b33cfba4f2"}}, "hash": "4f5cbc5af77a7aa3d374e8571844c80d3e1ea55d61bc1454d2575695add42f72", "text": "6.4.1 Towards low-carbon mobility Approaches to enable lifestyle change for the mobility sector include assertive policies that prioritize active travel, incentivize shifts to low-carbon modes of transport and discourage non-essential travel, particularly among high- consuming groups.

Social influence is important when shaping mobility lifestyle decisions. For example, near-exponential growth in electric vehicle ownership in Norway that has strongly aligned with climate policy conferring price advantages has been consolidated by peer-to-peer communication (Figenbaum 2017), as well as neighbourhood effects (for example, visibility in residential areas) and perceptions of what is expected and desirable (Pettifor et al. 2017). Similarly, there is a role for social influence in shaping norms around the desirability of flying (\u2018flight shaming\u2019; G\u00f6ssling et al. 2020), potentially in conjunction with policies such as frequent flyer levies (Fouquet and O\u2019Garra 2020). Citizen participation can also mobilize support for low-carbon mobility policy. For example, in Leeds, United Kingdom, the city\u2019s citizens\u2019 jury recommended halting local airport expansion (Place-based Climate Action Network [PCAN] 2019); the French Convention Citoyenne proposed the prohibition of both new airports and the extension of existing airports, as well as ceasing most domestic flights by 2025 (Convention Citoyenne pour le Climat 2020) and the Switch ON organization in India has mobilized concerned citizens to push back against planned restrictions on bicycles and non-motorized transport (Roy 2015). Assertive policies around the world have challenged the social status of the car. For instance, in Bogot\u00e1 the reallocation of street space, construction of off-street bike paths and car-free days has encouraged a shift towards cycling and walking (Rosas-Satiz\u00e1bala and Rodriguez- Valencia 2019). Such measures can be achieved equitably: in the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark, cycling is distributed evenly across income, gender and age groups (Pucher and Buehler 2008). In China, BEV uptake has been encouraged using a combination of mandatory restrictions 74 Emissions Gap Report 2020 on petrol cars (limiting their purchase and use) and market- oriented policies (government subsidies, tax exemptions, and dedicated licence plates that afford parking benefits, as well as having symbolic value; Li et al. 2019). Health practitioners have also argued for warning labels at point of sale for fossil fuels (for example, at petrol stations) and in the context of high-carbon services (for example, on airline tickets; Gill et al. 2020). In developing nations, there are opportunities to leapfrog the car-dependent, carbon-intensive infrastructure that dominates many developed nations. High-density, mixed- use urban forms that emphasize access by modes of transport other than cars are beneficial from an emissions perspective, and also enable more equitable participation in employment, cultural and entertainment activities (Kenworthy 2006). Such modal shifts also reduce local air pollution, thereby emphasizing the multiple benefits of more active, less carbon-intensive mobility options. 6.4.2 Towards a low-carbon residential sector Policies that enable residential lifestyle change \u2013 particularly low-carbon technologies operating at the individual or household level (for example, energy-efficient building envelopes, heat pumps, electric vehicle charging points, household solar) \u2013 have been shown to lead to more rapid diffusion of technology and more widespread social returns (such as job creation) than in the case of larger-scale energy investments (Wilson et al. 2020). Incentives, information and changes to how choices are presented (behavioural \u2018nudges\u2019) have met with some success, especially in terms of enabling equitable access to low-carbon options. Green defaults (whereby new customers are automatically assigned green energy tariffs) have been shown to dramatically increase their uptake (Ebeling and Lotz 2015; Kaiser et al. 2020). In 2017, around 5 million customers in California, United States of America, were able to access greater renewable energy at lower cost through the green default provided by the state- enabled Community Choice Aggregation programmes (O\u2019Shaughnessy et al. 2019). More broadly, successful residential lifestyle changes require anticipating how policies will impact daily life. Financial incentives to encourage uptake of efficient and improved cookstoves in developing countries show that policies also need to account for ongoing costs of use and maintenance (Pattanayak et al. 2019), the role of female empowerment, as well as attachment to traditional cooking techniques (Lewis and Pattanayak 2012).

Infrastructural changes can moderate this growth: for instance, in Viet Nam and India, successful examples of vernacular architecture (buildings designed using local knowledge and materials for local needs) require much lower energy inputs (Creutzig et al. 2016). In the past, recovery measures during economic downturn have been used to incentivize sustainable changes to households (for example, enabling retrofitting, solar panels and insulation; Climate Action Tracker 2020). Such policies bring multiple benefits by hastening the energy transition, enabling low-income households greater access to low- carbon living, stimulating the economy and reducing income burdens from high energy costs. 6.4.3 Towards low-carbon diets In comparison to current average diets, full or partial vegetarianism has the potential to reduce emissions from food consumption by around 31 per cent, with a pescatarian diet leading to an approximately 27 per cent reduction (Aleksandrowicz et al. 2016). However, attempts to encourage more sustainable diets have tended to be limited to information and awareness campaigns, which typically have marginal effects (Traill et al. 2014; Schanes et al. 2016; Bianchi et al. 2018). Recent modelling shows that for the best outcome for emissions, global well-being, land-use and other factors, food policies should provide food to the undernourished while simultaneously reducing overconsumption and food waste in high-consumption regions (Hasegawa et al. 2019). Placing costs on emissions-intensive foods such as beef and lamb, in conjunction with financial support to encourage healthy fruit and vegetable consumption, can shift demand and reduce food-related emissions by nearly 10 per cent globally (Springmann et al. 2017). Low-carbon diets also tend to be those that are healthier, thus providing opportunities for health and climate policy to be aligned (Aleksandrowicz et al. 2016; Willett et al. 2019). In Latin America, North America, Europe and many parts of Asia, consumption of red meat is at much higher levels than is recommended for a healthy, low-carbon diet (Willett et al. 2019). While it is not easy to shift notions of normal and culturally acceptable ways of eating (Bailey et al. 2014; Mozaffarian et al. 2018), recent history shows that this can occur rapidly and that diets in many parts of the world are in flux (Vermeulen et al. 2019). Comparable measures have been effective in influencing purchasing choices, such as taxes on unhealthy foods (Colchero et al. 2016) and subsidies for fruit and vegetables (for example, through food assistance programmes in the United States of America; Olsho et al. 2016). Complementary 75 Emissions Gap Report 2020 measures such as restricting advertising of high-carbon foods (Hyseni et al. 2017), while improving access to low- carbon foods, such as by increasing vegetarian meals in cafeterias and other food outlets, has the potential to enable dietary change (Garnett et al. 2019). Globally, close to one- third of global food sales are from just 10 supermarket chains (IPES-Food 2017): major retailers have the ability to influence consumer practices, for example by encouraging alternatives to meat protein through ensuring their availability and prominence in stores (Gravely and Fraser 2018). Policies against food waste offer benefits such as saving consumers money without reducing the quantity consumed (Hasegawa et al. 2019). Food waste bans and other policies can also allow providers of fresh fruit and vegetables to better address the needs of underserved or deprived communities (Pearson and Wilson 2013). Where authorities have direct control over food provision, including in the public sector, its carbon footprint can be cut: for example, the city of Leeds in the United Kingdom introduced meat-free and vegan catering into 182 primary schools for climate mitigation (Leeds City Council 2020). In Quezon City, Philippines, legislation is being developed for urban agricultural zones, with a scheme termed Fresh Market on Wheels delivering fresh produce from local farms to vulnerable communities around the city (C40 Cities Network 2020). However, as large segments of the global population still lack sufficient food (Willett et al. 2019), acknowledging divisions in terms of income and access are important if food sector emissions are to be reduced while meeting basic human needs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2886b988-6569-4bef-8eec-aabd0cca2b52": {"__data__": {"id_": "2886b988-6569-4bef-8eec-aabd0cca2b52", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2020", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2181f49fb8cc827b62d9a12eef7baaff4d11c8a759dfedb727d62e8752954098"}, "2": {"node_id": "9682a4fc-05cd-44fa-835e-82aa2d24c194", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "faadcd5fec0a71e58f0d56d35dc5956f15720bd2b21e4aa52b3b201742152df0"}}, "hash": "22e1337f3f357b1c2fdec2450cd01858d17385f3f9539969acaef1a84cb12cf4", "text": "6.5 Looking forward 6.5.1 Communicating lifestyle change Popular debate has often pitted \u2018behaviour change\u2019 and \u2018system change\u2019 against each other, presented as a trade-off between two choices.

Recognizing the role of interpersonal influence can also help emphasize the social and collective nature of lifestyle change, and is potentially more empowering than a view of personal actions that occur in isolation or that are negligible compared to the need for large-scale climate mitigation (Maniates 2001; Capstick 2013; Kubit 2020). Communicating where actions would be most impactful, and that changes to lifestyles are a necessary component to meeting global emissions reduction targets, is a powerful tool that can be wielded by a diverse range of actors. 6.5.2 Overcoming barriers and accomplishing long- lasting change In seeking to shift focus from economic growth towards equity and well-being within ecological limits, a move towards sustainable lifestyles is likely to challenge powerful vested interests. For example, the focus of the global economy on paid employment \u2013 and the devaluation of unpaid care work that sustains it \u2013 is an overlooked barrier to low-carbon lifestyles. Higher income tends to be correlated with higher emissions; by contrast, an alternative economic system that places caring responsibilities and well-being at the centre of community and economic life (for example, through a shorter working week and fairer distribution of care work) has the potential to reduce emissions. With enabling policies in place, such an approach could reduce emissions and gender and income inequality, while improving standards of living (Coote et al. 2010; Biesecker et al. 2014; Gottschlich and Bellina 2017; Wiedenhofer et al. 2018; Fremstad and Underwood 2019). On the other hand, an approach of this kind is poorly aligned with the current economic and political system in many parts of the world, in which large corporations are increasingly determining how private and social needs are met and shaping the conditions of everyday life (Dauvergne and Lister 2013). Changes to underlying social and cultural norms are more difficult to accomplish than transitory behavioural changes, but once established they are likely to be more durable and to support a wider range of low-carbon lifestyles (De Young 2011). By contrast, the process of changing laws and written codes of behaviour and conduct can occur in only a few years (Williamson 1998), and large infrastructural projects can enable and disable choices of citizens for decades or longer (Seto et al. 2016; Otto et al. 2020b). One example that seeks to redress the balance of power towards long-term sustainable societies is an ombudsman for future generations (Beckman 2016) who intervenes in public policy design and investments that present structural barriers to a low-carbon transition. Such an approach has already been implemented in Wales, United Kingdom (Davidson 2020) and in Hungary (Vincent 2012). From a cross-European study of demand-side options in line with 1.5\u00b0C pathways, Moberg et al. (2018) conclude that while current policies are insufficient to achieve emissions reduction in line with this, households are keen to see stronger government intervention, with high public acceptability of \u2018command-and-control\u2019 measures across mitigation options. Ultimately, the accomplishment of low-carbon lifestyles will require deep-rooted changes to socioeconomic systems and cultural conventions. The participation of actors and groups across civil society, as well as government, is needed to ensure this happens in a way that preserves people\u2019s well-being while achieving substantial and rapid cuts in GHG emissions. 76 Emissions Gap Report 2020 References Chapter 1 CarbonBrief (2020).
