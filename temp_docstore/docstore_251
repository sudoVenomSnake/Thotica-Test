 cotton yarn, cotton fabrics, garments and bedwear all show strong growth in the first six months of fiscal 2005-06. Despite a decline in average unit price, the value of cotton yarn exports increased by nearly 29 percent, thanks to strong volume growth. Cotton fabrics also grew by 19.3 percent in value and 17 percent in volume. Bedwear showed the biggest increase among T&C commodities. In the first six months of fiscal 2005-06 vis-\u00e0- vis fiscal 2004-05, exports of bedwear increased from US$802 million to US$1.3 billion, 65.7 percent growth. Knitwear including hosiery increased slightly, by nearly 2 percent. The commodities where exports dropped include synthetic textiles (38.17 percent); made-up textile articles, excluding towels and bedwear (14.35 percent); and knitted or crocheted fabrics (76.85 percent); and other textile products (46.65 percent). Looking at the breakdown of Pakistan\u2019s exports to its two primary markets, the EU and United States (Table A-10), Pakistan has overall lost its exports in the former while expanding in the latter. The only exception is cotton yarn and fabrics (HS 52), which increased in Europe and decreased in the United States. As a total, Pakistan increased its volume growth in the two major markets from 2004 to 2005 but slightly lost in terms of value. The US and EU markets account for about 60 percent of Pakistan\u2019s T&C exports. A survey by Siegmann (2006), which was conducted from September to November 2005, found that, despite the overall positive export performance, most companies exporting fabric and garments realised reduced profits because of price competition after the elimination of quotas. Increasing sales offset the reduced margins for now, but 38.5 percent of the firms surveyed, especially exporters of garment and other textile made-ups, answered that they know companies that have gone out of business.

Overall, the T&C sector accounts for 60 percent of the country\u2019s exports and 35 percent of its industrial employment and employs the second-largest numbers of women after agriculture (ibid). In 2000, 2.3 million people, including informal workers, were employed in the T&C industry (Siegmann 2005). Given the lack of accurate methods of capturing the size of informal economy, this number probably underestimates employment in the industry. 90 percent of production of cloth and 80 percent of apparel are done by the non-mill sector, i.e., cottage industry, and 90 percent of the work in the T&C sector is subcontracted to small- and medium-sized plants (ibid; Working Women\u2019s Organisation, nd.). The female share of T&C employment in Pakistan is low relative to other countries such as Bangladesh and Cambodia, where women account for 85-90 percent of employment.

Again, these percentage shares probably underestimate female representation due to a large share of the informal economy not being adequately covered by statistics. In addition, women\u2019s constrained mobility in the patriarchal settings in Pakistan, their responsibility for reproductive work, their low educational attainment relative to men, and lack of female role models who joined the paid work help to explain the low female participation in the paid economy and gender segregation between the formal workplace (i.e., factory) and informal workplace (home-based work) (Khattak, 2001; Siegmann, 2006). As for impacts of the expiry of ATC on women\u2019s and men\u2019s employment, Siegmann (2006) found replacement of male by female workers in apparel and yarn production. For example, the numbers of female production workers increased by 63 percent in yarn sector while 95 percent of male production workers are dismissed, resulting in increases in female share of employment. Numbers of employees and workers\u2019 wage levels are not discussed in the study; thus, numbers of retrenched workers and impacts on wages are unknown. This \u201csubstitution\u201d effect is assumed to have taken place based on the gender wage gap during economic hardship; with price competition cheaper female labour is more attractive to the firms. Gender gap in terms of employment and wages may narrow, but human development may worsen because of job losses among male workers and lower wages paid to women who enter the labour force. Philippines The Philippines\u2019 T&C exports to the United States and EU, its primary markets, declined in 2005 as compared to 2004, but most of decline occurred in the EU market (Table A-11). EU T&C imports from the Philippines dropped to two-thirds of its 2004 level in terms of value, from US$367 million to US$245 million. EU imports of RMGs, both woven and knitted products, decreased by 40.6 and 30.3 percent respectively in terms of value and by 40.5 and 38.8 percent in terms of volume. As for the US market, exports of knitted products remained strong in 2005. The value of US imports of knitted RMGs (HS 61) increased from US$674.8 million to US$834.9 million, a rise of 23.7 percent from 2004 to 2005. On the other hand, US imports of woven RMGs declined from US$1.090 billion to US$986 million, a drop of 9.6 percent from one year earlier. Overall, exports of textiles (HS 50-60) declined in the US and EU markets, while exports of other made-up textile articles have shown steady growth since 12 13 2002 (Figure A-9). The US market alone accounts for more than 70 percent of the Philippines\u2019 T&C exports in terms of value. The country\u2019s export data show that overall, the T&C sector in the Philippines has survived the global competition after the expiry of the ATC; Philippine T&C exports increased from US$ 2.397 billion to US$ 2.531 billion from 2004 to 2005 (Table 6). In terms of volume, Philippines exports slightly gained; the growth of exports in RMGs and other textile made- ups was off-set by a 13.8 percent decline in textile products. Table 6.

Sri Lanka, which lacks the production of raw materials as well as processing facilities, relies heavily on the exports of knitted and woven RMGs (HS 61 and 62). Indeed, exports of RMGs account for more than 90 percent of the country\u2019s total T&C exports (Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, 2006). The country\u2019s export data show that Sri Lankan T&C exports increased by 3.4 percent in terms of value. The T&C exports, which grew rapidly at the beginning of 2005, have been a slowdown from May and onwards. The exports of woven RMGs, the largest category in T&C exports that accounts for about 60 percent of total T&C exports, declined by 3.7 percent from 2004 to 2005. In contrast, the second largest category of knitted RMGs performed well in 2005 to record a growth of about 17 percent. Table A-12 shows that the volume of Sri Lankan exports to the United States and EU declined in 2005 compared to 2004. As for the EU market, the value of exports also declined. Sri Lanka was granted GSP plus benefits from the EU in July 2005. However, the lack of strong textile processing sector does not permit Sri Lanka to benefit from the scheme. The industry is lobbying to get the value addition criteria of the rules of origin reduced to about 35 percent (ibid). The top five T&C products of Sri Lanka are all RMGs, given high concentration of its exports on this category. However, share of the top five products in overall T&C exports is low relative to other Asian-Pacific countries with limited production capability in textile production. For example, the T&C export basket of Nepal with the top five export items accounts for 76 percent of total T&C exports while the top five export items of Sri Lanka only account for 33 percent of the total exports, suggesting a well-diversified export structure (Adhikari, 2006). Sri Lanka\u2019s conscious efforts to move towards exports of high value added apparel is evident from the increase in exports of brasseries (HS 621210), which grew by more than 18 percent in 2005 and accounts more than 11 percent of the Island\u2019s T&C exports. Numbers of manufacturing units in the Sri Lankan apparel sector were reported as 891 in 1998 and 830 in 2003. Preliminary results of a 2005 survey show only 733 apparel factories in Sri Lanka. The numbers of direct employment also fell from 340,367 in 2003 to 273,600 in 2005. The share of large firms, 28 percent has not changed much over the time; rather, the number of small firms reduced by half from 282 to 140 units (Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, 2006). This indicates that there already has been some restructuring of enterprises, e.g., mergers of small firms, and the recent decline may not have caused solely by the expiry of quotas. Regardless of reasons, among 15 factories which closed between January and October 7 See Adhikari and Yamamoto (2005). 14 15 2005: Less than four had paid some form of compensation to the workers; many of them closed abruptly without adequate notice to the worker; and some of them had not paid earned wages (Oxfam, 2005). In the Sri Lankan RMG sector, 85 percent of workers are women, and female workers tend to concentrate in smaller firms. The consolidation of smaller firms into large enterprises may have serious negative impacts on women\u2019s employment in the near future.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "87559c21-fca3-4d69-8c4d-da510209a6ea": {"__data__": {"id_": "87559c21-fca3-4d69-8c4d-da510209a6ea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sewing-thoughts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sewing Thoughts", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sewing-thoughts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c1994b779f04e1fe68f43487933dc7dce63efabe60e8d35a0d6c9fdda49bd68a"}, "2": {"node_id": "918d6f94-49fb-44c0-9819-42b94096acd4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sewing-thoughts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "26260d61d9970458edaf83a09a08c4f26299f5b8f8b5acc7374b2754439eb59b"}}, "hash": "d8a88eb426ae702f9da74c2d64b0606f06cf42032f595d2ea127b8e2897520de", "text": "In addition, a slowdown in exports of woven RMGs is likely to harm women\u2019s jobs further as we discussed earlier.

The South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Co-operation Agreement (SPARTECA), signed in 1981, provided garment producers in Fiji with a preferential market access to Australia and New Zealand when they use 50 percent locally manufactured fabric. The 1987 Tax Free Factories (TFF) scheme, which granted a 13-year tax holiday and other benefits to companies exporting 70 percent or more, also attracted foreign investors to open up production facilities in Fiji. Finally, the 1991 Import Credit Scheme (ICS) allows Australian fabrics to be shipped to Fiji at competitive prices for production of garments that will be re-exported to Australia. Under the MFA, Fiji enjoyed the quotas from the United States as well. The number of tax-free garment factories rose from 27 in 1988 to 88 by the end of 1991 (Harrington, 2000). In 2000, the industry employed nearly 20,000 people, more than 70 percent women. With limited manufacturing jobs in Fiji, about two-thirds of such jobs were provided by the garment sector Exports peaked at FJ$322.1 million (US$187 million) in 1999, which accounted for more than 30 percent of total exports and 11 percent of GDP (Storey, 2004). The coup in 2000 triggered the downfall of Fiji\u2019s garment exports, as Figure 1 shows. A dozen factories closed during 2002, and up to 6,000 people lost their jobs (GEC and FPAID, 2004). Overall, T&C exports recorded negative growth of 28 percent from FJ$312 million to FJ$223 million between 2000 and 2002. In 2005, T&C exports hit their lowest in 10 years, FJ$120 million, down by 47 percent from 2004. US garment imports in 2005 alone declined by nearly 80 percent from US$85.8 million to US$19.2 million (Table 8). As a result, 6,000 workers, predominantly women, became out of work (ADB, 2006). Experts fear that a free trade agreement negotiated between Australia and China will have a further severe effect on Fiji\u2019s garment industry (Fiji Times, 2006). Relaxation of the rules of origin from 50 to 25 percent local content, as well as inclusion of wool and wool blend textiles in the rules of origin, are demanded by producers in Fiji, who believe urgent help from Australia and New Zealand is needed.

Having \u201cguest workers\u201d from Asia is not unique to the garment sectors in island economies like Fiji. When foreign investors opened factories on islands, they brought managerial as well as production workers from their own nation. Those workers were first brought as skilled workers so that they pass on new skills and encourage productivity, efficiency and quality of production on the factory floor. Others argue that productivity is about the same between expatriates and locals but since expatriates cannot be absent from the work or quit their jobs, they force all workers to accept lower wages and poor working conditions (Harrington, 2000; Storey, 2004). In Fiji, at one point between 800 and 2,000 women from China and the Philippines were employed in the garment sectors (Harrington, 2000). The impacts of the eliminations of quotas on such workers have not been reported yet in Fiji, but similar situation on the island of Saipan has led to the recent closure of four garment factories, leaving thousands of guest workers unemployed. As a result, forced prostitution of these women, also brought from China and the Philippines, was reported (Rosario, 2005).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c7dda7d-d5ff-4f6a-b7ed-2e7bbcad0923": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c7dda7d-d5ff-4f6a-b7ed-2e7bbcad0923", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sewing-thoughts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sewing Thoughts", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sewing-thoughts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2ffc4f3a9921b1c300db45528ceb7b36b3167eff1ac9cb7885c865b64e5891ea"}, "2": {"node_id": "c58adaf0-8f56-4c6b-a364-76ba30a597cb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sewing-thoughts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8f1546e6b6927e0cc45155f9388875e4b9c22285a6be5ee01c91e42ca4f6d328"}}, "hash": "9bc4b73654b27f1385d6b0196440c3c2e8a14da051b83d007dfb12ed61070a0e", "text": "In many cases, women had paid commissions to recruiters and incurred other travel expenses, with dues still to pay back.

Sri Lankan firms, which no longer need to restrict their T&C exports bounded by quotas, have shifted their operations back home. Five garment factories that had exported principally to the United States closed in 2005 (US Department of State, 2006a). One analysis claims effects of the elimination of quotas on the economy of Maldives are expected to be negligible, since many garment workers had been brought from abroad; the apparel industry yielded little value-added, and all inputs were imported (US Department of State, 2006b). However, the negative impacts on the economy are not underestimated by the local people. Immediate negative impacts on them include loss of income and the fear of long-term unemployment, since alternative job opportunities are hardly available (Wajdy, 2004). At least several hundred Maldivians lost their jobs. A 4 percent loss of Government revenues derived from land rentals (US Department of State, 2006b) and loss of foreign exchange may be other factors to consider. Apparel and clothing accounted for about one-third of total merchandise exports and half of merchandise exports by private sectors in 2003 (Ministry of Planning and National Development, 2004a). The Government of Maldives records expatriate employment monthly; Figure 3 displays expatriate employment in the wearing apparel sector from 2002 to 2005, while Tables 10 and 11 show expatriate employment in the sector by occupation and by nationality. The number of expatriates started declining in 2004: In one year, it halved to 1,228, and by the end of 2005 it had declined to 431. In 2002 and 2003, more than 70 percent of expatriate employment in the sector was as sewing machine operators, with more than 90 percent of these women. Interestingly, in 2004 and 2005, while female sewing machine operators were sent back home with the closure of factories, more male tailors were brought into Maldives. The majority of the expatriates are Sri Lankan. Even so, female Sri Lankans, who mostly worked as sewing machine operators, also were sent home as operations slowed down. As for local employment, detailed data are not available, but the 2000 Census data show that 2,699 men and 5,518 women were working as \u201ccraft and related trade workers\u201d in manufacturing (Ministry of Planning and National Development, 2004a). In addition, female production workers in manufacturing received the lowest pay among industries (Ministry of Planning and National Development, 2004b). Although Maldives has already achieved many of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), e.g., halving the proportion of people whose income is less than $1 a day, income inequality between Mal\u00e9 and the atolls has increased and unemployment among women aged 15-24 has increased from 30 to 40 percent during 1997- 2004. This compares to the male unemployment rate of the same age cohort of 10 to 23 percent (Ministry of Planning and National Development, 2005). Many garment factories were located in the outer atolls, including the southernmost atoll, Addu. Although Addu atoll is not one of the poorest atolls, it is illustrative of the point that alternative jobs for low-paid garment workers are hard to find.

Mongolia In the late 1990s, Mongolia\u2019s RMG sector was built on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) from East Asia, mostly China, which filled out its quotas to the United States. Most of its products are cotton apparel made from cotton imported from China. The sector accounts for 11.3 percent of total exports in 2004 (ADB, 2006). Employment was estimated from 20,000 to 40,000, mostly women (ibid; Brook, 2004). With the elimination of quotas, US imports of RMGs dropped from US$229 million to US$134.7 million, a steep 41.2 percent decline, between 2004 and 2005 (Figure 4). The volume of US imports also dropped by 30.6 percent. As discussed earlier, products that faced severe decline in 2005 to be those for quotas expired at the end of 2004 as well as the products that other countries are producing. Table 12 shows the top five US T&C imports from Mongolia, based on their value in 2004. All five are RMGs; three out of the five experienced significant decline, including knitted jerseys and pullovers of cotton, cashmere and man-made fibres, whose export value plunged by 35.1, 91.6 and 54.8 percent. Two other products, women\u2019s and girls\u2019 woven cotton trousers and knitted cotton T- shirts, are also common RMGs produced by many other countries. Figure 4.

Overcoming Supply-Side Constraints At a time when the survival of the T&C industry is threatened in Asia-Pacific, especially in countries like Fiji, Maldives, Mongolia and Nepal, there is no doubt that market access initiatives should be pursued at different levels and on various fronts. These issues have been covered extensively elsewhere.8 However, focus on market access alone will not provide all intended benefits to the country, primarily for two reasons. First, even when market access opportunities are available, no country can convert them into market entry unless and until it has the necessary supply capacity to do so. Second, preferential market access opportunities, which several developing countries gain either through unilateral trade preferences such as GSPs or by virtue of entering into free trade agreements (FTAs), are likely to erode because of a general trend towards most favoured nation (MFN) tariff liberalisation. This is more so in the context of ongoing negotiations on non-agricultural market access (NAMA) taking place at the WTO. In the long run, enhancing competitiveness by addressing supply-side constraints is the only way to survive in a global market characterised by intense competition. Competitiveness is affected by several factors, including low level of skills and productivity of the workers, absence of opportunity for technological upgradation, limited linkages to the local economy as well as the global supply chain, poor quality of infrastructure, cumbersome trade procedure and documentation requirements, lack of information on market opportunities, and lack of finance. The purpose of this chapter is to discuss policy options with a view to helping relatively less competitive countries in Asia-Pacific, particularly LDCs, overcome supply side- constraints, thereby contributing to achievement of their human development objectives. Investments in Human Capital Low wages, touted as the primary comparative advantage of LDCs engaged in exports of textiles and clothing products, may not necessarily provide a competitive edge to these countries. While wages in most LDCs (e.g., Bangladesh, Cambodia, Lao PDR and Nepal) are very low, their productivity also is much lower than China, Thailand and Sri Lanka where workers are skilled . Not surprisingly, many US firms therefore consider that the difference in productivity between, say, China and LDCs more than offsets the wage difference (USITC, 2004). Lack of skilled workers is a major disadvantage not only because additional workers have to be hired for a similar task, but also because overtime wages (which are higher than normal wages) must be paid to workers at times, in order to meet tight deadlines. Both of these put additional burdens on resource strapped firms, which contributes to reduced competitiveness in the export market. While a more skilled worker can contribute to the process of manufacturing high- value products, firms or countries with only unskilled workers are locked into manufacturing least- 8 See Adhikari and Yamamoto (2005). skill-intensive items \u2013 precisely those in which competition tends to be highest. This can be illustrated by comparing Nepal with Sri Lanka: Sri Lanka has been able to diversify into the exports of niche, value-added products such as women\u2019s undergarments, requiring skilled human resources, whereas Nepal remains extremely vulnerable and locked into the export of a narrow range of items. This clearly underscores the need to invest in training and human resource development. Training is necessary at two levels: First, for the workers, with a view to enhancing their skills, speeding up the production process and minimising waste, and which results in significant payoff for the enterprise as a whole. Second, training will assist mid-level managers, who can then supervise the operations, assign responsibilities to their workers and perform line balancing work effectively, communicate well with buyers or their agents, and process the orders efficiently. This agenda is even more critical for LDCs, where expatriates fill middle-level jobs because of limited national human resources. For example, skilled labour comprises only 1.1 percent of the labour force in Cambodia, so technical and supervisory staffs in the T&C sector are usually drawn from the overseas operations of the parent company (WTO, 2005a: 83). A recent survey in Cambodia indicated that 40 percent of indirect personnel positions in the factories that responded were staffed by expatriates (USAID, 2005b: 22). Because using expatriate staff in technical and supervisory positions raises costs, this can have a significant impact on the industry competitiveness. However, most countries in Asia-Pacific have not invested adequately in training and skill development. There is, however, no need to reinvent the wheel by creating training institutes afresh. In some countries such institutions already exit, and it is necessary only to add some facilities to make them functional.

Should such a centre be created, it would be wise to subsume the activities of the training centre under this new institution. Similarly, in Nepal the virtually defunct Textile Training Centre, under the Department of Cottage and Small Scale Industries, can be revived. The major question however, is where the resource requirements for establishment and operation of a training and/or productivity centre come from. While Government support is warranted by the public-good nature of investment in this area (World Bank, 2006: 16), the private sector can and should contribute to the costs of operating such institutions. This is an area where there is wide scope for public-private partnership. Indeed, the organisation of training institutes in these areas in developing countries ranges from private institutions launched by industry associations (Thailand, Mexico), to public education institutions (India, Hong Kong). Combination models of public-private partnerships include the Malaysian Textile and Apparel Centre (MATAC) in Malaysia and Sector Education and Training Authorities (SETAs) in South Africa (USAID, 2005b: 32). 22 23 Other institutions have been established as autonomous bodies with donor support. One such example is the establishment of twin institutions in Sri Lanka \u2013 the Textile Training and Services Centre and the Clothing Industry Training Institute, both with technical support from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). These institutions, which are to be merged into a single entity named the Sri Lanka Institute of Textiles and Clothing, not only provide short-term training for workers and managers, but also offer long-term certificate and diploma courses for those pursuing careers in this sector. Moreover, the institutions have full-fledged consultancy, testing and accreditation services, which provide additional income to sustain their activities and reduce dependence on donor support.9 This type of model also is suggested for Cambodia (USAID, 2005b). This is an area that has huge potential for South-South/regional cooperation. For example, existing training institutions in Nepal and Bangladesh could benefit by establishing partnerships with institutions in India; institutions in Cambodia and Lao PDR (existing or proposed), Indonesia, the Philippines and Viet Nam could benefit from partnerships with Thai and Malaysian institutions and so on. Productivity of labour tends to be higher where the general level of workers\u2019 education is high. This is evident when comparing labour productivity in East Asia vis-\u00e0-vis South Asia. Most East Asian countries vigorously pursued investments in overall education, during their economic transformation. Similarly, workers\u2019 productivity is directly correlated with their health and nutrition. Frequent ill health resulting in absences could cause huge losses in productivity and adjustment problems. The issue of nutrition is equally important because of the effect it has on worker\u2019s productivity. As study by Wanjek (2005) indicated a poor diet on the job is costing countries around the world up to 20 percent in lost productivity. According to the same report, in South East Asia, iron deficiency alone accounts for a US$5 billion loss in productivity; in India, the cost of lost productivity, illness and death due to malnutrition is US$10 billion to US$28 billion, or 3 to 9 percent of gross domestic product. This underscores the need for investing in human capital, not only to enhance productivity of the T&C sector, but of the entire economy. This also will contribute positively toward achieving better human development outcomes. Technological Upgradation T&C in general is considered a technologically humble sector, and RMG in particular a low- tech sector. Even so, competitiveness of RMG enterprises in most LDCs and low-income countries is hampered by their inability to invest in latest technologies. For example, technologies such as computer aided designing (CAD) and computer aided manufacturing (CAM) not only help enterprises increase their efficiency but also enhance the quality of exportable products, thereby responding to buyers\u2019 requirements. These technologies are common in middle-income countries, and larger exporters in Bangladesh have installed them as well. However, in other LDCs and low-income countries, such facilities may not be feasible 9 See http://www.lanka.net/slitac/, accessed on 20 April 2006. because of a lack of business volume and high costs of installation.

Similarly, Pakistan\u2019s imports of textile machinery increased from US$211 million in 1999-2000 to US$532 million in 2002-03 (Din, 2005). For its part, the Government of India established a Technology Upgradation Fund (TUF) to support investment upgradation of textile machinery. Textiles firms borrowed from commercial banks at lower-than-market rates, the difference being refinanced from TUF (World Bank, 2006: 33). Having recognised and identified the growth potential of the textile industry, especially cotton textiles, the India\u2019s Government during the 2006-7 budget speech proposed to enhance the allocation for TUF from Rs.435 crore to Rs.535 crore.11 These examples showcase countries that are among the best performers within Asia-Pacific. However, there is limited information available in the public domain on whether countries that have lost out in the post-ATC era also made such investments. It is nonetheless necessary to understand that the use of new machines does not guarantee overall increase in productivity if maintenance is weak. This is evident from the example of Cambodia (USAID, 2005b). If a government cannot spend resources on technological upgradation because of resource constraints, the private sector should come forward, as suggested above, by forming a consortium. Another option would be to make use of FDI \u2013 mainly in the form of joint ventures \u2013 to ensure technology transfer. In this context, South-South cooperation, which is easier to obtain, could bring immense benefits to T&C exporters. Reduced Time for and Costs of Procuring Inputs Most Asia-Pacific countries maintain high tariffs on T&C products, reflecting the political economy of protection. Moreover, Governments are keen to maintain high tariffs in these sectors so as to shield local industry and employment, as well as government revenue.12 This raises the cost of production of T&C exporters, at least to the extent that they lack vertical integration. Vertical integration signifies the existence of an integrated supply chain from the stage of, cotton production, for example, to yarn production, to fabric production, to the clothing industry, to packing, to transportation and other trade support facilities. In the 10 See Shakya, 2005: 21. 11 See fibre2fashion.com (2006) 12 This measure is inimical to South-South trade, not least because tariffs are very high on these products, where developing countries have comparative advantages. For example, tariffs imposed on T&C products in Bangladesh (WTO, 2005a), India, Malaysia, Pakistan and Thailand are much higher than their average industrial tariffs (Adhikari and Yamamoto, 2005). 24 25 context of T&C, the existence of vertical integration tends to confer an advantage to exporting firms. Countries like China, India, Thailand, Indonesia, Pakistan and Viet Nam have an integrated supply chain of textiles as well as clothing and are able to source a significant portion of raw materials from within the country. This helps them not only lower the costs of production because of reduced transportation costs of raw materials, but also reduces the lead time. Reduction in lead time provides the twin advantages of being able to meet the delivery order \u2013 thereby enhancing credibility as a reliable source \u2013 and reducing the working capital requirement, which also means reduced bank interest for some. It also is necessary to understand that not all countries have the capacity and resources to integrate their supply chain vertically. For example, most West African countries, which grow cotton in abundance, do not have a strong textile industry. Because of the textile industry is highly capital-intensive (machines), skilled-labour-intensive (to operate them) and resource-intensive (especially water and electricity), smaller Asian-Pacific countries lack these prerequisites for the establishing such an industry. Therefore, countries such as Cambodia, Lao PDR, Maldives, Mongolia, Nepal, Sri Lanka and all the small island developing countries in the Pacific do not have textile industries worth the name. This evident is not only from the profile of their exports, but also from country-level information. For example, in Sri Lanka the contribution of the clothing (apparel) sector to overall production and exports is more than 90 percent (Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, 2005). Virtually all fabrics and accessories used in Cambodia are imported because of the near-absence of upstream industries in the country (USAID, 2005b: 13). In Nepal, the use of locally made fabrics by the export-oriented garment industry is hardly 2 percent (Shakya, 2005: 28).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e493f6ac-7745-4601-810a-ea7a832fb633": {"__data__": {"id_": "e493f6ac-7745-4601-810a-ea7a832fb633", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sewing-thoughts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sewing Thoughts", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sewing-thoughts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "982adbc4b9533d242eb246932aec1e8a26e698738df0176c7f2c3f23a5a80f14"}, "2": {"node_id": "e543b335-fd07-4587-bd52-3376a6cdaba9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sewing-thoughts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "90ea721fd317eff018322b4f94bc7a666649b9224717328e8c435f00e072b432"}}, "hash": "7f518568435ae6f2651c24e83cba40369378499e56e2de2353885b4b35bab45b", "text": "As the example of developing countries such as Hong Kong SAR, South Korea or Taiwan shows, the lack of domestic inputs does not necessarily translate into competitive disadvantages.

In a market-dynamic sector such as T&C, a lesson from Pakistan and China is that states should allow garment exporters an undistorted choice between using local and imported fabrics. China, which produces both cotton and textiles, uses only 45 percent of domestic fabric for clothing exports (UNDP RCC, 2005). In 2004, while the total exports of T&C products of China were US$61.12 billion, its import of fabrics and other raw materials was close to $20 billion (ILO, 2005). Establishment of a textile industry to promote backward linkages with the rest of the economy is not a bad idea per se. However, considering the investment required,13 this is not an area in which Governments should spend scarce resources. This should instead be provided for by the market itself. However, Governments can play the role of facilitator by 13 For example, in Bangladesh estimates show that investment for backward integration would be in the range of US$ 2.5-5 billion. See Razzaque (2005): 121. creating conducive policy environments and providing fiscal incentives, if needed. If the local private sector alone does not find it worthwhile to invest, FDI can be invited. For example, an investment zone in Sri Lanka that is specifically targeting exports to the EU is apparently attracting Pakistani investment in textiles. Consequently, large textile mills have begun to be built in Sri Lanka by Pakistani firms.14 Rather than investing public resource for the creation of textiles factories and creating double distortions in the economy by protecting industry through high tariffs, Governments should utilise resources on trade facilitation measures as we discuss later. These measures not only will benefit the T&C sector, but also the entire trading activities of the economy \u2013 international as well as domestic \u2013 and will provide spillover benefits to other sectors of the economy. In the countries where textile and other accessory manufacturing industries are absent and there is no vested interest to protect, Government ideally should eliminate tariffs on all inputs across the board. This would allow RMG exporters to stock up raw materials based on their own projected requirements. This would help them eliminate the lead time associated with imports of raw materials. However, where the elimination of tariffs might not be a desirable option because of revenue implications, other facilities need to be devised. One model that has been tried in many countries, but is not popular, is the system of duty drawback. Under this, the duty paid on imported inputs exclusively utilised in manufacturing exportables, is refunded after proof of shipment of the final product is produced. However, this facility has two major disadvantages. First, the duty paid is blocked, thus straining the working capital position of the firm for the period until the refund is received. Second, the refund is often considerably delayed and is subject to red tape and corruption.15 Because of the problems associated with the duty drawback scheme, another variant has been introduced in some countries. This scheme, which does not completely block the entire duty amount until refunded, is known as a bonded warehouse facility. RMG exporters are allowed to import raw materials duty-free, but are required to provide a bank guarantee as a commitment to use these items for export purposes only. When the goods are exported and proof is provided, a bank guarantee is released. Even so, this scheme too is being criticised as being bureaucratic and cumbersome. To remedy these problems, a seemingly superior option proposed by World Bank (2006) in the context of Bangladesh is the operation of a Central Bonded Warehouse (CBW). The CBW operates as an enterprise responsible for importing and stocking up inputs required by RMG firms, depending on expected demand. Firms are not required to pay customs duty on inputs and can sell them to RMG manufacturers duty-free, thus mimicking locally based suppliers. 14 As per information received from All Pakistan Mills Association (APTMA), the Sri Lankan Government has launched a package to attract investment in the country. Such incentives include a 10-year tax-free period on income for investments over US$10 million. See EmergingTextiles.Com (2006). 15 For example, in Bangladesh, it takes on an average 58 days and 6 percent in additional expenditures for exporters to obtain a refund cheque from the Duty Exemption and Drawback Office (DEDO). See WTO (2005a: 81). 26 In order to allay Government fears that such a facility could be misused by entrepreneurs, two conditions may be attached. First, the CBW should be located inside", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "25d3ef70-98d5-4908-9dea-25ba344d51a4": {"__data__": {"id_": "25d3ef70-98d5-4908-9dea-25ba344d51a4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sewing-thoughts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sewing Thoughts", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sewing-thoughts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "548fdafd98f39c9a9c05536ccb12baba861322bfb4e10f46a6ea0239a6f99935"}}, "hash": "548fdafd98f39c9a9c05536ccb12baba861322bfb4e10f46a6ea0239a6f99935", "text": "the EPZ and RMG exporters can purchase the raw materials only against confirmed export orders or back-to- back letters of credit. Further, it also may be necessary to impose certain restrictions on the import of items based on local availability of the products in question. The World Bank (2006) estimates that operation of the CBW can reduce the lead time for sourcing raw materials by 35-45 days, which is significant. Another advantage of this approach is the economies of scale, which not only allows the CBW to make bulk purchases and save costs, but also to negotiate better terms with suppliers of inputs as well as auxiliary services (shipping, banking and insurance). All this leads to reduced costs of sourcing. A significant portion of cost savings can be passed on the RMG exporter; thus enabling them to become more competitive globally. While it may be easier to make such an arrangement in countries where input industries are virtually non-existent, this could encounter serious problems in countries like Bangladesh, Indonesia, Viet Nam and Pakistan, where textile industries have been clamoring for protection and Government has provided it to some extent. 16 Two additional disadvantages are associated with this system. First, it is difficult for this scheme to work effectively when buyers\u2019 or rules of origin requirements restricts inputs to be resourced from a particular location. Second, investments to stock up inputs would be huge and double trucking and clearance requirements would raise the cost of supplying inputs (World Bank, 2006: 34). However, it is assumed that these costs are more than offset by economies of scale and superior bargaining power. Further, assuming that Government cannot and should not fund this initiative, it has to look sufficiently profitable for the private sector to be attracted. One way to attract the private sector is to provide a monopoly position to the CBW (one per EPZ), which is the most likely scenario. However, the monopoly over the supply of inputs means that it may very well squeeze RMG exporters and charge higher prices than a competitive market would allow. The above proposal, despite all its shortcomings, may be suitable for large-scale exporters like Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Cambodia, but may not suit Nepal, Lao PDR, Mongolia, Maldives and Fiji, where such ventures may not be economically feasible because of the low volume of business. For the countries with lower volume, regional trade integration and removal of tariff barriers on products imported from within the region could provide the benefit of the lowest purchase price for inputs. For example, a bilateral trade agreement between Nepal and India has helped Nepal obtain raw materials from India at a cheaper price. However, the time taken for import remains a concern. With the inclusion of trade facilitation measures within the ambit of a regional economic cooperation discipline, the lead time of the import of raw materials also can be considerably reduced. 16 For example, the effective rate of protection provided to the textile industry in Bangladesh is 47 percent. See World Bank (2006: 35). 27 Establishment and Operation of Export Processing Zones As noted above, one of the major supply-side constraints faced by most least developed and low-income countries is lack of ability to enhance competitiveness, resulting, among others, from poor infrastructure, inability to obtain inputs at international prices with the shortest possible lead time, inability to meet the deadline for orders because of frequent interruptions in operation from labour unrest or political disturbances, high taxes imposed by the Government, and other regulatory barriers. Because these barriers severely constrain the ability of the private sector to earn an attractive return on investment, the private sector in turn is reluctant to invest in sectors like light manufacturing (such as T&C) and electronics, despite their export potential. Foreign investors are even more reluctant. Therefore, in order to attract investments17 in these sectors, most Governments in developing countries have established various Export Processing Zones (EPZs). Within EPZs, Governments provide incentives to enterprises that mimic \u2013 and goes beyond \u2013 the free trade scenario. For example, enterprises within the EPZ receive inputs such as equipment and raw materials duty-free; a certain level of regulatory relief is assured18, foreign exchange control is not applied, profit repatriation is guaranteed, strikes and other forms of disobedience are prohibited and, in some cases, freedom of trade unions is also restricted (See Box 1). Moreover, trade services and infrastructure facilities available within an EPZ are higher than national average standards. However, certain conditions also are imposed on EPZ enterprises; they are, for example, either not allowed or severely restricted from making domestic sales.

They also can contribute to building human capital, through their demonstration and catalyst effects on the country entrepreneur pool. Finally, an efficient, competitive zone is an industrial infrastructure that many countries lack (Madani, 1999). On the flip side, concerns exist regarding a possible race to the bottom in terms of labour and environmental standards. However, the pressure from buyers to ensure minimum compliance with core labour standards, as well as environmental standards, can counterbalance such abuses. A substantial majority of countries studied in this Report have established some variant of EPZs. The T&C sector figures prominently in the industrial composition within such zones. A database prepared by Boyenge (2003) showed countries like Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Philippines and Viet Nam had either textile enterprises or clothing enterprises, or both, located within an EPZ. While countries like Cambodia and Mongolia 17 In several countries, foreign investors are the main beneficiary of the positive environment created by EPZ, whereas Governments could provide incentives to local investors to benefit equally from the favourable setting. See WTO (2005a). 18 For example, in Sri Lanka the Board of Investment (BOI) encourages investors to locate their factories in BOI-managed industrial processing zones to avoid land allocation problems. See USTR (2004). 28 29 also are listed as having EPZs, there is no mention of the sectors encompassed within such zones. In Fiji, the only EPZ within the country hosts garment as well as textile factories.

Relief from double taxation subject to bilateral agreement Source: Export Processing Zones Authority, Board of Investment, Government of Pakistan http://www.pakboi.gov.pk/Biz_guide/export_processing_zones_author.html Although EPZs have attracted considerable attention in the empirical literature, studies focusing on efficiency of the T&C sector within an EPZ are rare. According to one analysis conducted by the WTO (2005a), which focused exclusively on LDCs, EPZs in some cases not only offered beneficial business to domestic and foreign firms, but also boosted economic development by helping countries enhance their competitiveness. However, that report cautions: \u201cIn the majority of cases, success of EPZ was limited and contributed only to a minor extent to an improvement of LDC competitiveness in the T&C sector.\u201d One reason for this could be the disconnect between the EPZ and the local economy, as well as very limited backward or forward linkage. Because of the incentive structure, along with the quality and reliability of inputs supplied by foreign companies, most exporting firms do not prefer to purchase inputs from local industries. This acts as a barrier for creation of a reliable backward linkage. Moreover, because firms located in the EPZ are prevented from making domestic sales, their forward linkage with the local economy is severely constrained. Another important consideration is whether the incremental net value of the expected benefits justifies the huge investment to be made, at least initially, by the public", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4c2355cf-4c38-4e4e-a67b-7f44ee7db2d0": {"__data__": {"id_": "4c2355cf-4c38-4e4e-a67b-7f44ee7db2d0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sewing-thoughts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sewing Thoughts", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sewing-thoughts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e4bd8b8e2f5d26733dc0b1b7d3a4d3429fa546700cf9fea265873df615362d90"}}, "hash": "e4bd8b8e2f5d26733dc0b1b7d3a4d3429fa546700cf9fea265873df615362d90", "text": "sector,19 as well as costs to be incurred in the form of forgone revenue. Jayanthakumaran\u2019s (2003) research on the performance of EPZs, using a benefit\u2013cost analytical framework, finds that zones in South Korea, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, China and Indonesia are economically efficient and generate returns well above estimated opportunity costs. On the other hand, the heavy infrastructure costs involved in setting up the zone in the Philippines resulted in a negative net present value. EPZ are clearly the second-based solution, which is useful for a limited time period. As an economy opens toward a more liberal trade regime, the value of the EPZ tends to fade. As a result of ongoing negotiations in the WTO,20 at least the tariff part of the benefits is likely to less relevant. Moreover, it has to be noted that the some incentives provided to export- oriented enterprises could be considered export subsidies, which are prohibited by the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM). While LDCs and developing countries with less than US$1,000 per capita Gross National Product (GNP) are exempted from this Agreement, other countries may have to examine the nature of incentives carefully and check their compatibility with the ASCM before making policy decisions. Improved Trade Facilitation Trade facilitation may be defined as the simplification and harmonisation of international trade procedures, with such procedures encompassing the activities, practices and formalities involved in collecting, presenting, communicating and processing data required for the movement of goods in international trade. This definition relates to a wide range of activities such as import and export procedures (e.g., customs or licensing procedures), transport formalities, and payments, insurance and other financial requirements (Federal Trust, 2003). It is being increasingly realised, both by developed and developing countries, that trade facilitation could be instrumental in saving traders a great deal of difficulties and wastage of resources, collectively known as trade transaction costs. The objective of trade facilitation is to reduce the cost of doing business for all parties by eliminating unnecessary administrative burdens associated with bringing goods and services across borders. The means of achieving this objective are the modernisation and automation of import procedures to match established international standards (Staples, 2002). Because trade facilitation is instrumental 19 The assumption is that the private sector also will be made to participate in the EPZ both by contributing financial as well as managerial inputs. 20 A decision made at the WTO Hong Kong Ministerial Conference envisages use of a \u201cSwiss Formula,\u201d with a view to securing deeper cuts in higher tariffs. See WTO (2005b): Paragraph 14. 30 31 in removing bottlenecks in import and export, it also has been referred to as the \u201cplumbing\u201d of international trade. Box 2: Some Real-Life Examples of Improved Trade Facilitation Chilean Customs estimated that the introduction of their Electronic Data Interchange system, which decreased processing time, resulted in business savings of more than US$1 million per month, for a system cost of only US$5 million. Meanwhile, after the five-year reform of the Peruvian Customs, the cargo release time has been reduced from an average of 30 days to a maximum of one day for green channel cargo (one or two days for goods chosen for inspection), while at the same time quadrupling the revenue collection. At 12 percent interest, and considering the value of Peruvian imports in 2000, this constituted a maximum gain to the involved companies of some US$71,997,000. Source: Swedish Trade Procedure Council and National Board of Trade (2002): 19. Several studies have highlighted the importance of trade facilitation in the context of the multilateral trade regime, where industrial tariff barriers are becoming less and less important because they are already low, and are being reduced under NAMA in the WTO, as noted above. For example, Wilson et al. (2003) assert that the overall gains to trade from investment in trade facilitation would exceed those in tariff cuts on manufactured goods. Improved trade facilitation is even more critical for the survival of the Asia-Pacific T&C sector in the post-ATC era, not least because this is one industry that involves both imports of inputs as well as exports of finished products.21 Given the move toward vertical specialisation and slicing up the value chain, each day saved could provide enormous benefits in terms of enhancing the industry\u2019s competitiveness. This is more so in the case of time-sensitive products like RMG, where fashion changes rapidly and delayed consignment could lead to cancellation of orders. An empirical study by Hummels (2001) estimates that each day saved in shipping time is worth 0.8 percent ad valorem duty for manufactured goods.

This cost disadvantage arises from delays and inefficiencies in Indian ports. The work highlights the importance of efficient port infrastructure, reliable and competitive modes of transport and efficient customs procedures for maintaining an edge in the competitive, time-sensitive and fashion-oriented textile and clothing markets. Similarly, an Asian Development Bank technical assistance study in 2003 found that clothing producers in Bangladesh might earn 30 percent more if inefficiencies were removed at Chittagong port (ADB, 2006). 21 Except for India, where a substantial portion of the value addition of T&C takes place within the country. See UNDP RCC (2005). Trade facilitation also improves Government revenue as well as promotes good governance, through transparency, reduction in corruption, better regulation, due process and public- private sector cooperation. A study by Engman (2005), which uses 12 countries case studies to evaluate the impact of customs reform on government revenue, concludes that customs modernisation programmes can have a marked positive effect on the collection of trade taxes, if effectively implemented. The study further mentions that several countries have more than doubled their customs revenue after the introduction of comprehensive reform programmes and that country experiences also indicate that even relatively modest modernisation programmes have brought quantifiable increases in customs revenue. This finding is consistent with those of DTI (2003), which concludes that rationalised and efficient customs procedures boost customs duty collection. Since the majority of developing countries depend substantially on customs duties for financing public expenditure, improved trade facilitation would enhance their ability to augment their revenue. Another compelling reason for developing countries to adopt measures to improve trade facilitation is that because inefficient procedures represent a \u201cfixed overhead,\u201d the burden is likely to fall disproportionately heavily on developing countries in general and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) of these countries in particular. SMEs are often unable to employ dedicated personnel in charge of logistics because of resource constraints. Since most of the RMG industries in Asia\u2013Pacific developing countries are SMEs, they will suffer most if inadequate attention is paid to trade facilitation measures. The convincing benefits of improved trade facilitation measures notwithstanding, developing countries are reluctant to undertake binding obligations at the multilateral level, mainly because of the dearth of public funds to make hugely demanding investments. It is certainly not advisable for resource-strapped governments to divert resources from social sectors such as health and education to invest in improved trade facilitation measures. This is part of the reason for the opposition of these countries to agree to any binding negotiations on trade facilitation at the WTO. However, after they were assured of technical assistance to overcome this problem, they agreed to multilateral negotiations on this issue and finalised the text for initiating such negotiations in the July Package.22 Negotiations are advancing in this area, as can be seen from the report of the Negotiating Group on Trade Facilitation (NGTF), set up on 12 October 2004, which was submitted to the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference (WTO, 2005b). While the text on technical assistance is still binding and valid, the modalities for the delivery of the same are far from clear. It is likely that this issue would be linked to the issue of aid for trade, to which we turn now. 22 July Package was agreed by WTO member countries on 1 August 2004 with the objective of reviving global trade talks in the aftermath of the failure of the Cancun Ministerial Conference. July Package mandates, \u201cNegotiations shall aim to clarify and improve relevant aspects of Articles V, VIII and X of the GATT 1994, with a view to further expediting the movement, release and clearance of goods, including goods in transit.\u201d Moreover, the trade facilitation text contains relatively strongly worded technical assistance language that provides leeway to developing countries not to implement their part of the commitments in the absence of technical assistance. See WTO (2004). 32 33 Optimising Benefits of Aid for Trade Current discussions on aid for trade focus both on the demand as well as the supply side of the trade integration process. Though there are differences of opinion, the aid for trade debate is gaining prominence largely because of the inadequacy of measures put in place to help developing countries (particularly low-income and least developed) to benefit from the international trading system. As per these discussions, existing proposals for aid for trade can be divided into two categories: a) adjustment-oriented", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4c4b6bd9-b038-419c-92be-74d2839454c7": {"__data__": {"id_": "4c4b6bd9-b038-419c-92be-74d2839454c7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sewing-thoughts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sewing Thoughts", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sewing-thoughts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "662a611e958a38323e05a1500f2d7e4e4dc34a47da9564d93b3857668b830d7f"}}, "hash": "662a611e958a38323e05a1500f2d7e4e4dc34a47da9564d93b3857668b830d7f", "text": "and b) trade-enhancing. Adjustment-oriented assistance is needed for those countries that have encountered problems with their balance of payments (BOPs) or suffered revenue losses due to trade liberalisation. One example of the former is the Trade Integration Mechanism introduced by International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2004, which is meant to provide financial assistance to members facing BOP pressures resulting from multilateral trade reforms. Another form of adjustment- oriented aid can be to provide assistance to countries that have suffered terms of trade losses due to trade liberalisation (IMF and World Bank, 2005). Yet another category of adjustment-related assistance is to address the issue of preference erosion, which is likely to occur as a result of the ongoing WTO negotiations. Adjustment assistance also may be required to help developing countries implement commitments they have undertaken during multilateral trade negotiations. The costs of implementing multilateral trade agreements such as those on customs valuation, technical and health- related standards and intellectual property \u2013 all of which require hard investments \u2013 represent an example of this. Trade-enhancing aid for trade can be divided into two categories \u2013 demand side and supply side. Demand-side assistance includes investment in enhancing the negotiating capacity of developing countries\u2019 trade officials to enable them obtain better market access through trade negotiations at multilateral, regional or bilateral level. This may involve training officials and providing necessary technical backstopping, such as rigorous studies to examine the impacts of trade liberalisation scenarios and their implications for growth, poverty and human development. Supply-side assistance, which is the most critical element in the entire debate on aid for trade, relates to investments needed to build physical infrastructural capacity that includes creation of better road and communications networks as well as information technology facilities, enhanced and uninterrupted power supply, better storage facilities, and transformation of ports and customs so as to meet standards needed for facilitating trade. Similarly, investments in creating and sustaining institutional infrastructural capacity and human capacity involve establishing institutions for testing of qualities, as well as technical training institutes.23 23 See also Johnson (2006). The conventional thinking of aid not trade embraces the notion that if developing countries\u2019 trade barriers were removed, they would be able to export their way out of poverty \u2013 and their reliance on development assistance would accordingly decline. However, four decades of GSP, which allows developed countries to provide unilateral and non-reciprocal trade preferences to LDCs, have shown that converting \u201cmarket access\u201d into \u201cmarket entry\u201d can be an elusive goal without investment to overcome supply-side constraints and enhance competitiveness. Although some existing mechanisms aim at putting into practice the idea of aid for trade, they are clearly not sufficient. For example, Trade Integrated Mechanism of IMF is limited to countries suffering from Balance of Payment crises. World Bank too is currently engaged in the following areas that may fall under the broad rubric of aid for trade: a) technical assistance; b) capacity building; c) institutional reform; d) investment in trade-related infrastructure; e) assistance to offset adjustment costs. Although World Bank resources in these five areas have been significantly increased (IMF and World Bank, 2005), the fact that most of this assistance is in the form of loans makes them unattractive to recipient countries. A potentially useful mechanisms that can be considered as a variant of aid for trade, at least from the perspective of LDCs, is the Integrated Framework for Trade Related Technical Assistance (IF) launched in 1997. Six international agencies \u2013 IMF, International Trade Centre (ITC), United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), UNDP, World Bank and WTO \u2013 participate in this initiative. The objectives of IF are: 1) to integrate or mainstream trade into national development plans of the LDCs; and 2) to assist in coordinated delivery of the needs identified by LDCs. Country ownership and partnership are the twin pillars of the IF programme. The implementation of the IF comprises three broad stages. First are preparatory activities, which would typically include an official request from the country to participate, a technical review of the request, the establishment of a national IF steering committee and, to the extent possible, the identification of a lead donor. Second, once the request has been approved, the process moves on to its diagnostic phase, resulting in the elaboration of a Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS). Finally, follow-up activities start with the translation of the diagnostic phase\u2019s findings into the elaboration and validation of an action plan, which serves as the basis for trade-related technical assistance delivery (Adhikari and Dahal, 2004). However, because of the lack of inter-agency coordination, paucity of resources and failure to address the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "adacf68f-4898-41c5-8b91-c8932bbfae94": {"__data__": {"id_": "adacf68f-4898-41c5-8b91-c8932bbfae94", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sewing-thoughts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sewing Thoughts", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sewing-thoughts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cf5f1af9d74518b88e43aee12ed4d9028e8401d3178fbb344d0de0a2ca2d70ef"}, "3": {"node_id": "9c8bb17e-a5b1-4c0f-87f5-09b5f0c69551", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sewing-thoughts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "54f1f642eb998fb2595ab52e77261c08da6157658b6ffcc88665927979668bf0"}}, "hash": "e74373a9d80e46194b4aa76dae91cfbf1e25a0dfbd0986197af5aafc0b8ee889", "text": "disconnect between WTO obligations and national development priorities of LDCs, this scheme has not been able to deliver what was originally expected (Hoekman and Kostecki, 2001: 399). These criticisms notwithstanding, during the Doha Ministerial Conference trade Ministers endorsed the IF as a viable model for LDCs\u2019 trade development (WTO, 2001: Paragraph 43). Following this, on 15 July 2003, the heads of the six IF agencies and their representatives issued a joint communiqu\u00e9 underscoring the commitment of the agencies to the IF model. 34 35 Support for the IF also is reflected in the form of increased contributions to the IF Trust Fund, which stood at US$19.3 million as of 3 July 2003 (Puri, 2005). Because lack of funding was identified as the single major problem, debates on upscaling the initiative gathered momentum in the run-up to the WTO Hong Kong Ministerial Conference held in December 2005. The Development Committee of the World Bank and IMF endorsed an \u201cenhanced IF\u201d at its autumn 2005 meeting. This paved the way for the Ministerial Conference to adopt a decision to make enhanced IF operational by 31 December 2006 (WTO, 2005b: Paragraph 49). Since the IF is a rather general programme to facilitate trade integration, with limited funding, it has had a very limited role in helping LDCs enhance their competitiveness in a distinct sector like T&C. Nevertheless, some DTIS have highlighted the T&C sector as one in which investments need to be made. Analytical work represents a great deal of Trade Related Technical Assistance/Capacity Building related to T&C. In particular, sectoral studies constitute a valuable and necessary step toward sound, coherent sectoral development strategy and, ultimately, enhancement of competitiveness (WTO 2005a, 24). As per the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) Trade Capacity Building Database, jointly managed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the WTO, Asian-Pacific LDCs were among the significant recipients of such support, with Bangladesh alone receiving more than half the support provided to all LDCs. However, two major problems are associated with such analytical work. First, follow-up activities, leading to policy changes are very rare. Second, funding support for the so-called \u201chardware\u201d \u2013 such as infrastructure building, installation of testing laboratories \u2013 is never guaranteed. Developing countries are obliged to wait until funds are tied up, which may take any form, including loans with severe conditionalities attached. The discussion on aid for trade gained heightened prominence during the WTO Hong Kong Ministerial Conference, with major economic powers including the EU, Japan and United States announcing concrete figures of what they wanted to deliver. This shows a growing realisation among developed-country Governments and multilateral/inter-governmental agencies of the need to scale up resources in the form of aid for trade. This also is reflected in the Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration, which decided to \u201cinvite the Director-General to create a task force that shall provide recommendations on how to operationalise \u201caid for trade.\u201d It was decided that the \u201cTask Force would provide recommendations to the General Council by July 2006 on how Aid for Trade might contribute most effectively to the development dimension of the DDA (WTO, 2005b: Paragraph 57).\u201d In line with this mandate, the WTO Director General already has constituted the Task Force on 8 February 2006 (ICTSD, 2006). What is clear from the above analysis is that aid for trade, though a necessary condition for enabling developing countries to integrate into the global economy, is rife with controversy. Therefore, a need exist for developing countries to follow a cautious approach lest they be taken for a ride. In order to make aid for trade meaningful, there is a clear need to address the following concerns, some of which are highlighted in Puri (2005: 40-1). First, aid for trade should be genuinely additional and complementary resources and should not merely be the repositioning of existing technical assistance. Second, aid for trade should only be used to support various trade-related components of nationally owned economic development and/or poverty reduction strategies agreed by Governments. Third, the initial amount of aid for trade should be substantial and credible, and the mechanism should assure the recipient country of a predictable stream of assistance so that it can plan and execute eligible projects efficiently and sustainably Fourth, the form of funding should preferably be grants and concessional loans; easy accessibility, user-friendliness and non-debt-creating aspects are vital for success.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c8bb17e-a5b1-4c0f-87f5-09b5f0c69551": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c8bb17e-a5b1-4c0f-87f5-09b5f0c69551", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sewing-thoughts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sewing Thoughts", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sewing-thoughts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cf5f1af9d74518b88e43aee12ed4d9028e8401d3178fbb344d0de0a2ca2d70ef"}, "2": {"node_id": "adacf68f-4898-41c5-8b91-c8932bbfae94", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sewing-thoughts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e74373a9d80e46194b4aa76dae91cfbf1e25a0dfbd0986197af5aafc0b8ee889"}}, "hash": "54f1f642eb998fb2595ab52e77261c08da6157658b6ffcc88665927979668bf0", "text": "Fifth, the target areas of intervention by an aid for trade fund should be clearly defined, with a well-defined ratio between \u201csoftware\u201d (studies, seminars, training, exposure visits) and \u201chardware\u201d (trade facilitation and infrastructural support).

Enhanced Access to Finance Equity financing and reinvested earnings are important sources of financing business enterprises, including those belonging to the T&C sector, but support from financial institutions is indispensable to finance their growth and expansion. As noted above, due to the high capital intensity, loan component in overall financing is more important in the case of the textile industry than the clothing industry. The clothing industry also needs easy access to medium- to long-term loans (to invest in land, buildings and machinery); short-term financing (for financing working capital requirements); and other banking facilities (letter of credit, remittances). Banking systems in most of Asia-Pacific developing countries, particularly LDCs are rudimentary and tend to charge unreasonably high interest. To further complicate matters, the majority of banks ask for a high level of collateral or personal guarantees, especially for 36 financing term loans. Both factors limit the access of small and medium enterprises to credit. Such responses by banks and financial institutions reflect their risk perception, may be coloured by their inability to analyse creditworthiness as much as by the country\u2019s overall business environment. More importantly, the legal system is often too weak to guarantee a credible enforcement mechanism to recover money in case of defaults.24 Limited access to credit impedes the ability of the T&C industry to expand its operations or start new ventures. Even for short-term loans, often the preferred form of bank financing in most LDCs and low-income countries, access to credit is extremely limited. For example, in Cambodia the local commercial banks provide only 1 percent of working capital (WTO, 2005a: 84). In Bangladesh, despite the introduction of micro-credit and several other successful schemes, small entrepreneurs\u2019 access to credit remains highly restricted. A study conducted for Bangladeshi Ministry of Commerce (2003: 19) showed a large number of knitwear garment exporters having capital of Taka (Tk.) 10 million to Tk.20 million, with a workforce of 150-300, forced to borrow from local moneylenders at a monthly interest of Tk.10,000 plus brokerage of Tk.1,000 on a loan of Tk.100,000.25 Exporters are compelled to take such loans when they fail to get urgent bank financing. Sometimes they also borrow from the traders-cum-moneylenders who sell yarn and other on credit at market price and charge interest of 4 to 5 percent per month (International Business and Technical Consultants, 2003) \u2013 which translates into 48 to 60 percent annual interest. Even in Indonesia obtaining working capital loan is considered as a major problem, as noted earlier. In the case of Nepal, the story is slightly different. While the access of small entrepreneurs to credit as well as other banking facilities is severely restricted by discriminatory interest rates and the need for collateral, exporters are facing new problems after the phase-out of quotas. Notes Shakya (2005: 25), \u201cNepalese commercial banks are increasingly becoming reluctant to make new investment in this sector and initiating stricter actions against debtors.\u201d26 Contrast this with the period when RMG used to be one of the most lucrative businesses in Nepal. During the heyday of quotas, banks provided financing to garment exporters simply on the basis of export letter of credit, without requiring any collateral. In high- and middle-income countries with highly developed capital markets, financing is not a major constraint. However, in low-income countries, where the capital market is not well developed, entrepreneurs are not able to exercise this option. FDI may be another option worth pursuing by developing countries in general and low- income countries and LDCs in particular, because such investment can provide necessary resources to enterprises reeling under financial constraints. Foreign investment also can become a catalyst for technological upgradation; first, because enterprises have the resources 24 See WTO (2005). 25 The exchange rate is US$1=Tk.67. 26 Garment entrepreneurs and their associations are in part to be blamed for this state of affairs. They have blown the problems out of proportion in order to pressure the Governments to take concrete remedial measures. Financial institutions, conservative as they are, have overreacted and virtually stopped providing financial support to RMG firms. 38 to invest in the latest technology, and second, because FDI is considered a window for the transfer of technology to the developing countries. Moreover, because of superior managerial skills and a tendency to investment in human resource development, FDI can be an instrument to increase total factor productivity at the enterprise level.

In addition, the survey showed positive and significant productivity spillovers. For every 10 percent increase in the productivity level of FDI in the industry, the productivity of domestic firms increased by 1.4 percent. While the analysis of all factors affecting FDI is beyond the scope of this report, it is well known that some basic elements could help provide much-needed triggers to boost the flow of FDI. These include overall stability of the business environment, a well-functioning property rights regime, guarantee of profit repatriation and a well-developed legal system that guarantees enforcement of contracts. Enterprises in low-income and least developed countries tend to focus only on the possibility of attracting foreign investment from developed countries. This has a clear advantage not only because developed countries are more likely to exploit the opportunities available in their respective markets but also because they bring with them much-needed skills and technology. However, developing countries do not seem to have explored the option for South-South investment flow, despite the fact that the latter can have several beneficial effects. Besides helping the local enterprises fill the resource gap, South-South FDI would create limited adjustment problems given the cultural similarities. T&C is one such sector in which South-South investment flows are already quite sizeable. Examples include Indian investment in Nepal, investment from Hong Kong and mainland China in Cambodia, Sri Lankan investment in Maldives, and Chinese investment in Mongolia. Similarly, there are signs that Pakistani enterprises are moving their investments to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka (EmergingTextiles.com, 2006). Likewise, Malaysian companies are planning to invest in Bangladeshi EPZs (The Financial Express, 2006). However, one of the major disadvantages of FDI in garment manufacturing is that such investments are often footloose in nature, and there is a risk that foreign investors may rapidly pull out should a negative trend become visible. For example, Sri Lankan investors pulled out of Maldives, India investors left Nepal and Chinese investors abandoned Mongolia by the end of 2004, when they realised that the garment industries in these countries had a limited possibility of surviving in the post-ATC era. 39 IV. Conclusion and the Way Forward The impressive growth in T&C exports that Asia-Pacific has been able to achieve during the first year of the post-ATC era is testimony to the huge potential the region holds in this sector. However, the benefits of the phasing out of T&C quotas are unevenly distributed, with the most competitive countries, like China and India, pushing smaller players to the brink of collapse. Although the \u201cChina factor\u201d had entered the global trade lexicon ever since China joined the WTO in 2001, the sheer market power of this country has become visible only in the post-ATC era. The survival of the weak and marginal players in the region \u2013 Fiji, Maldives, Mongolia and Nepal \u2013 is threatened. Those countries that have been able to hold onto past gains despite their apparent lack of competitiveness like Bangladesh, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Sri Lanka and are not too sure about their prospects post-2008, when the safeguards imposed on Chinese exports of T&C products will be lifted. Among the several perverse incentives created by the MFA regime, an important one involved the considerable South-South movement of capital to \u201cjump\u201d the quota restrictions imposed on the most competitive countries. Not only bigger countries like China and India invested heavily in smaller countries less restricted by quotas but even a relatively smaller economy like Sri Lanka invested on RMG manufacturing in neighbouring Maldives. However, when quotas were about to be lifted, and opportunities for increased market access in the developed countries were assured, foreign investors moved their resources back to their own countries \u2013 little realising the devastating impact their decisions could have on employment, poverty and human development in the host countries. Because of limited capital and technology intensity of the sector as well as limited linkages with the host economy, investments in RMG are considered \u201cfootloose,\u201d signifying their opportunistic tendency. There may be no better testimony to this harsh reality than the Chinese investors, who had virtually uprooted their investments in Mongolia after the quota phase out only to return after one year because of the imposition of safeguards by major importers on Chinese apparels. It is hoped that these investments will now create lasting impact on the Mongolian economy and the Chinese government too provides a policy framework to ease the flow of private investments to the neighbouring countries on a sustained basis.

However, lack of alternate employment opportunities is a serious problem, not only for the small and marginal economies, but also for countries like India where some segments of the industry are losing out because of intense competition. A similar, interrelated factor is responsible for the plight of thousands of workers who are going to lose jobs in a country like Indonesia, where layoffs are imminent even in the face of the overall increase in the country\u2019s exports of T&C products. It is necessary to move beyond averages, because disaggregated data available even from relatively competitive countries like India, Indonesia and Pakistan suggest that people have either lost or are likely to lose their jobs in some sub-sectors within T&C and are in dire need of alternate sources of employment. Disaggregated analysis also provides evidence of the burden of adjustment falling disproportionately on unskilled and female workers, rather than skilled and male workers. Asia-Pacific countries that have been worst hit by the phasing out of the quota system are either landlocked countries (Mongolia, Nepal), or LDCs (Maldives and Nepal) or small island vulnerable countries (Fiji, Maldives). Five factors that are common to the loss of their exports are: 1) lack of strong linkages with other economic activities in the country; 2) low level of human capital; 3) high transportation and transaction costs; 4) high level of concentration, in the same product categories as well as export destinations where competition is intense; and 5) discrimination within the global trading system. This is not to suggest that all is well with another set of countries unsure of their prospects post-2008, as noted above. These countries too suffer from some of the problems mentioned above, even though they are relatively better positioned to face global competition. Out of the problems identified above, the last is related to the issue of seeking and obtaining incremental market access in a predictable manner. While this is important for all Asia- Pacific countries, it is particularly important for LDCs. However, as noted above, the focus of this report has been on addressing behind-the-border, supply-side problems, which are not only related to discussions or negotiations at the international level, but also are part of the domestic reform agenda. One critical strategy to avoid vulnerability associated with overdependence on a limited market or product categories, as highlighted in Adhikari and Yamamoto (2006), is the diversification of markets as well as products. The report highlighted a case study of Thailand as an impressive success worth emulating. Further review of literature, media reports and other sources of information suggests that countries like Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam too seem to be following a similar strategy of market diversification, mainly to other developing countries. Although their success has not been as striking as that of Thailand, they seem to be doing their best. Nonetheless, efforts have been limited on the part of those countries that should have done most. Human development gains can be achieved not only by improving the social indicators of the people at large, but also by increasing and sustaining employment opportunities, particularly for the poor and vulnerable. Employment is not only the means for sustaining livelihoods of the people, but also a means of empowering them. T&C is undoubtedly a sector with high employment potential. Within this the highly labour-intensive RMG sub-sector is a priority area requiring additional support and protection. Efforts by some governments, private sector and donor community are steps in the right direction, they are clearly not sufficient. Given the fact that long term survival depends on enhancing competitiveness by overcoming supply side constraints, the following seven policy pointers, including two cross-cutting ones are worth taking note of: 40 41 1. Investment in human capital Increased productivity is a major tool to improve competitiveness at the enterprise level. However, in order to enhance the productivity of the country as a whole investments in health and nutrition are as important as investments in education and skills development. Concerns have been raised about the resource-intensive nature of such investments, but a combination of public-private partnership and mobilisation of donor support could be an effective way to create better human capital critical for survival in the post-quota world. 2. Improved trade facilitation While the problem of high transportation costs may not be something that can be addressed immediately, transaction costs can certainly be reduced by investing in improved trade facilitation measures. Such effort not only will help improve competitiveness of the T&C sector, but also will provide economy wide effects. Despite the convincing benefits, developing countries in general \u2013", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "31215861-07ad-4729-887a-2e7f9ab72780": {"__data__": {"id_": "31215861-07ad-4729-887a-2e7f9ab72780", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sewing-thoughts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sewing Thoughts", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sewing-thoughts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1fd2fac6d0f87a38225f5ae6eede1c38c0e1bb9a3c580c58ba6e7e74ce7d02dd"}}, "hash": "1fd2fac6d0f87a38225f5ae6eede1c38c0e1bb9a3c580c58ba6e7e74ce7d02dd", "text": "and those of the Asia Pacific region in particular \u2013 find it difficult to generate resources to achieve this objective. However, they can and should be able to make use of enhanced IF or the anticipated global package on aid for trade, provided these are made available to support country-specific priorities and are provided on a lasting basis without conditions attached. 3. Adopting innovative sourcing strategies For countries lacking a vertically integrated industrial structure, high costs and time taken for sourcing of inputs remain a major problem. The first best option is to dismantle tariff barriers so as to make inputs available to T&C manufacturers at world prices. However, this may not be a feasible option to pursue in many countries, which are chiefly dependent on trade taxes for the major portion of their revenue. Therefore, various mechanisms have been followed in the past, with different degrees of success. One innovative approach proposed in the case of Bangladesh is to establish a CBW, which can stock up the inputs imported duty-free and sell them to T&C exporters against confirmed export orders or letter of credits. Although this approach is worth exploring by other countries having mass production potential, smaller countries may have to rely on regional or bilateral trading arrangements and trade facilitation to reduce costs and time. 4. Strategic management of EPZ Many countries in the region have used EPZ to enhance efficiency of their exporting ventures as well as to create incentives for attracting FDI. Based on the mixed evidence from the success of EPZs and the gradual reduction in tariff barriers taking place globally, these can be considered a short-to medium-term policy instrument to help provide breathing space for the T&C industry. However, if policy makers are careful in designing the incentives and ensuring the participation of the private sector in establishing EPZs and removing bureaucratic red tape, EPZs can produce several benefits not only to the T&C sector, but also to the entire economy. 5. Enhancing access to credit Because of the virtual absence of capital markets in many small and marginal Asia-Pacific countries, enterprises are reliant on banks and other financial institutions to meet their financial requirements. However, given the tendency of the banks to charge high interest and/or ask for excessive collateral reflecting their risk perceptions, small and medium textiles and/or RMG exporters find their access to credit highly restricted. Some are even forced to borrow from the informal market paying higher interest, which in turn reduces their global competitiveness. Reforms aimed at infusing more competition, including encouraging FDI and joint ventures, can help unlock the potential of the financial sector. Moreover, legal reform to improve the loan recovery system could go a long way towards building the confidence of the banking system and providing it incentives to treat SMEs more or less at par with other borrowers. There might even be a need for the Central Banks to make selective intervention in the market to provide subsidised credit and/or resort to directed lending practice on the ground of the holy trinity \u2013 employment opportunity, export potential and gender balance \u2013 the T&C sector promotes. 6. Harnessing the potential of public-private partnership The first cross-cutting issue relates to public-private partnership, a relatively under- appreciated issue in the context of Asia-Pacific. With a severe resource crunch in countries devastated by the phasing out of quotas, neither the public nor private sector alone can make investments for example, for the creation of a training institute or productivity centre, for the establishment of EPZ and CBW, or for the installation of new and costly technology. Emulating the successful model of public-private partnership in other countries, these initiatives can and should be undertaken jointly by both actors. 7. Extended use of South-South cooperation The second issue relates to harnessing the potential of South-South cooperation beyond trade. Areas of South-South cooperation for the development of the T&C sector may include the flow of investment not only in the rather \u201cfootloose\u201d RMG sector, but also in helping create vertically integrated facilities by making investments in textiles or accessories industries and the south-south transfer of technology. Countries like China and India should take lead in these initiatives. Another possible area of cooperation could be to encourage training institutions in relatively better-off developing countries to partner with such institutions in countries with limited capacities. Despite several challenges, small and marginal players from the region have the potential to use T&C sector to make significant gains in terms of achieving human development objectives.

countries/territories, 2005 87 v International trade has assumed a central role in economic growth and poverty reduction efforts in developing countries. Since its establishment in 2002, the Asia-Pacific Trade and Investment Initiative (APTII) at the UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo has contributed to developing approaches and strategies which help align trade dynamics with the objectives of poverty reduction and human development in the Asia-Pacific region. The APTII has promoted innovative research and policy advice that seek to clearly define the substantive linkages between trade and human development and is consistent with the objective of supporting the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Striving to build on its previous work and achievements, in its third and current phase of the work programme (2008-2011), the APTII aspires to make a significant contribution to policy dialogues by fostering regional trade and investment regimes that are consistent with human development goals in the region. A central challenge facing policy-makers in the region is to facilitate patterns of inclusive regional integra- tion that enable them to address specific development priorities and goals, particularly with reference to the development needs of least developed countries (LDCs), landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS). The focus, for APTII\u2019s current work programme therefore, will be on 1) enhanc- ing trade competitiveness and capacity development to formulate employment- and gender-responsive trade policies; and 2) capacity strengthening to implement pro-poor regional integration strategies, including through key regional processes and/or mechanisms. In line with this focus, APTII will publish a series of studies and discussion papers which shall highlight the policy implications of the multifaceted dimensions of the current trade trends and patterns and their human development impacts in the Asia-Pacific region. South-South trade and investment flows are becoming a key factor behind the growth processes in the Asia-Pacific region. The current study, South-South Regionalism and Trade Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region, by Mehdi Shafaeddin, offers a well rounded perspective on the economic rationale for South-South trade cooperation and regional integration while bringing out its nature and pattern in the Asia-Pacific region and its underlying main drivers.

The main conclusion of the study is that, while the rapid expansion of trade among ESSEA countries has been mainly the result of industrialization and industrial collaboration in the form of production sharing, it has not been driven through the operation of market forces alone. South-South trade can also be used as a policy-driven vehicle for industrialization in lower-income countries, and is linked to the principle of dynamic comparative advantage. The resultant expansion of supply capabilities and diversification of the structure of production and trade, in turn, potentially leads to further expansion of S-S trade and to the geographical diversification of trade for the countries involved, with a positive impact on their bargaining power. However, enhancing S-S trade requires proactive policy measures for cooperation that go beyond tariff reduction and trade agreements. The paper begins by providing a rationale for S-S trade as a vehicle for promoting industrialization and development. It goes on to show that regional trade has expanded rapidly in ESSEA mainly through intra-industry trade in the form of production sharing in electrical and electronic products. The region has become not only the most dynamic area for S-S trade, but also a major force in international trade in general. Nevertheless, intraregional trade among ESSEA countries has led to three main developments that these countries need to consider collectively and address through joint policy initiatives in order to further promote industrialization and development. These developments are: (i) The concentration of intraregional trade among the relatively more advanced countries of the region, which suggests the need for better integration of the lower-income countries; (ii) The dominance of production sharing in a limited number of parts and components (P&C) in trade among the second-tier NIEs, and the need for their technological upgrading; and (iii) The increased vulnerability of the countries involved in production sharing (stemming from their dependence on external markets and on their own interdependence).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0acc2ebd-bd9c-443c-99b1-3a4ed443e39d": {"__data__": {"id_": "0acc2ebd-bd9c-443c-99b1-3a4ed443e39d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-South Regionalism and Trade Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7e7d2bbb9ee6e6d5bd6c2d5622329309221b964b11bb93a727217eb59e6d4c04"}, "2": {"node_id": "2bdf8bbe-2ff1-474a-bdb9-71f2011d4037", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "031671f159f0d1ec19f5414ed4c273af2dc58e4754f267877bfc73daa5577ab4"}}, "hash": "6aae50137ebb54ac48b66dbff593a272739d3a8b74b9f53372fbe3854ef8dc78", "text": "This development suggests the need for countries to protect themselves against risks related to unforeseen events, external shocks and instability in the international financial markets, particularly because most countries in the region depend heavily on exports.

Yet opponents of this argument so far have not been able to provide a strong economic rationale in favour of proactive expansion of S-S trade. Developing-country policy-makers have paid lip services in support of S-S trade in various international forums, while scholars discussing the issue in the literature have often taken a defensive approach. S-S trade is favoured, for example, due to problems of, or limits to, trade with the North; weakness and asymmetries in the international trading system; or due to lopsided North-South (N-S) trade agreements. Geographical diversification to reduce risks of dependence of developing countries on markets in developed countries, and the resultant improvement in their bargaining power and terms of trade, are cited in the literature as some of the benefits of S-S trade. While such benefits are undeniable, tariff reductions and the operation of market forces alone are not sufficient instruments for promoting S-S trade; there is also a need for a dynamic mechanism for enhancing industrialization and development, which, in turn, would further boost such trade. This study regards trade as a means to development, defines development as an \u201cupward movement of the whole social system,\u201d and considers industrialization as an important requisite. Within this framework, it considers S-S trade as additional to N-S trade, and as a dynamic component of trade and industrial policy for enhancing industrialization, upgrading of the industrial structure and development through fuller utilization of unemployed and underutilized resources in developing countries. Such a rationale is based on a combina- tion of three main elements: the theory of \u201cvent for surplus\u201d; the resource scarcity problem of developing countries; and division of labour and specialization. By arranging industrial collaboration and/or cooperation on research and development (R&D) through division of labour and specialization, developing countries could remedy their problem of scarcity of the complementary factors of production needed for the expansion of supply capacity and/or upgrading of their industrial structure. By sharing the additional markets created, they would also benefit from larger markets and internal and external economies of scale (i.e. increasing returns). The expansion of supply capabilities and S-S trade would in turn improve their bargaining position vis-\u00e0-vis developed countries in multilateral forums as well as in their bilateral trade relations. Furthermore, to achieve such objectives, S-S cooperation for trade expansion should follow the princi- ple of dynamic comparative advantage. This requires government intervention to correct and remedy market failures and deficiencies, as well as cooperation beyond international trade, covering not only industrial col- laboration and R&D, as mentioned above, but also such areas as back-up services and adjustment assistance to lower-income countries, for instance in training and skills development. Regarding the experience of S-S trade in ESSEA, it is shown that the region has increasingly become a dynamic source of S-S trade, and of supply and demand in international trade in general. The rates of growth of exports and imports of ESSEA well exceed those of S-S trade and world trade, particularly for manufactured goods. However, trade agreements and tariff reductions are not the main contributory factor. While it is true that trade agreements have increased trade among members of each regional trade bloc, particularly that of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), some other factors seem to have been more important in expanding regional trade in ESSEA. The share of intraregional trade of each regional group is not in all cases greater than its trade share with a different group or groups. Demand and supply dynamism, policies of governments and transnational corporations (TNCs) for industrial collaboration through production sharing, as well as measures taken by some \u201cdemand dynamic countries\u201d for the expansion of supply capabilities in lower-income countries are among the important contributory factors. To explain further, the countries with strong industrial supply capabilities (indicated by the ratio of manufacture value added to gross domestic product \u2013 MVA/GDP ratio) are among the most dynamic in regional trade. This would imply that industrial capacity is an important factor in the expansion of regional trade. At the country level, China and India, as the most dynamic countries in terms of GDP growth, have also been the most dynamic sources of supply, thus boosting regional trade. Their rates of growth of exports, and particularly imports, well exceed the average for ESSEA, and they highlight trade deficits with the region. x By contrast, generally speaking, with the exception of Nepal, and to some extent Sri Lanka, the lower the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f94ea9ac-426d-4381-962a-3795daa481fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "f94ea9ac-426d-4381-962a-3795daa481fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-South Regionalism and Trade Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2ebf8fc66110d72ecef9838c70c278bbc2928891cbd4851f868134a1051c65fd"}, "3": {"node_id": "da2c5aa0-2c31-4223-a84e-197cb6593630", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e02baeece27cb113cc14ee9db652954c82a5250c5ac6a8c3709c4687dccd9a94"}}, "hash": "d3997d5d30d36a24dff2efb7187a74a966ab0facc7b201d491d2d6b0884ff4bd", "text": "per capita income, the lower is the average growth rate of exports to the region. While the lower-income countries of the region have acted as a market for exports of other countries, they have not benefited much from the market opportunities provided by the demand dynamic countries. The value of regional imports of non-fuel products from these countries has not been significant and the value of manufactured goods has been low. Some countries (e.g. Bangladesh and Pakistan, both of which are members of the South Asian As- sociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)) and Cambodia (a member of ASEAN) exhibit no signs of growth in their regional exports. Indeed, the growth rates of exports of Bangladesh and Cambodia to the region have been negative. Further, for most of the lower-income countries, the rates of growth of exports to the region were negative or lower than the rates of growth of their total exports. In other words, despite the fact that, generally speaking, tariffs and non-tariff barriers are lower in the newly industrializing economies (NIEs) and the second-tier NIEs than in the lower-income countries of the region, regional agreements have not been able to provide a significant impetus to regional exports of the lower-income countries of the region. Various factors may be responsible for such discrepancies in the performance of the two groups of countries, but the lower-income countries\u2019 lack of supply capabilities in manufactured goods is definitely a crucial factor. The exceptional case of trade between India, on the one hand, and Nepal and Sri Lanka on the other, reflects India\u2019s deliberate policy aimed at the expansion of supply capabilities in these countries rather than being the outcome of the operation of market forces alone. Generally speaking, India is not only the largest and most dynamic importer of non-fuel products, including manufactured goods, from the lower-income countries in the Asia-Pacific region, but also the structure of its imports of manufactured goods is diverse. Indeed, India\u2019s imports from the lower-income/small countries in the region are larger than the imports of the whole of ASEAN from those countries. India\u2019s manufactured imports consist of such diverse items as chemicals, textiles, processed ores and metals, paper and cement. Twenty-four items account for 24.2 per cent of its total non-fuel imports and for over 75 per cent of its imports of manufactured goods from these countries. Two neighbouring countries, Nepal and particularly Sri Lanka, enjoy important trade relations with India. They are the source of nearly 31 per cent and over 20 per cent, respectively, of India\u2019s imports from lower-income/small countries. India received over 60 per cent of Nepal\u2019s exports in 2004/05 compared to about 10 per cent in 1991/92. Apart from their membership in SAARC (a plurilateral trade agreement), these two countries also benefit from close proximity, cultural and political ties, as well as bilateral trade relations with India. Most importantly, India has actively contributed to the expansion of the supply capacity of its partners, inter alia, through FDI. By contrast, Bangladesh, Bhutan and other SAARC members have neither similar bilateral trade agreements with India nor do they receive similar levels of foreign direct investment (FDI) from that country. Contrasting the case of India with the Republic of Korea is also an indication of the inefficacy of market forces alone in the expansion of S-S trade. The growth rate of imports of the Republic of Korea from low-income countries was negative during the period 1995\u20132005. Similarly, ASEAN\u2019s growth of imports of manufactured goods from these countries has also been negligible in the absence of production sharing. The low industrial and skills capabilities of the lower-income countries, in particular, have prevented them from participating in the rapid expansion of intra-industry trade and production sharing in the region. Yet it was this rapid expansion of intra-industry trade and production sharing in a limited number of electrical and electronic products that was a particularly dynamic force behind the expansion of regional trade, which was concentrated among the first-tier Asian NIEs, and subsequently the second-tier Asian NIEs. For example, seven such products accounted for nearly 58 per cent of non-fuel imports and for about 66 per cent of imports of manufactured goods of China from six ASEAN countries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da2c5aa0-2c31-4223-a84e-197cb6593630": {"__data__": {"id_": "da2c5aa0-2c31-4223-a84e-197cb6593630", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-South Regionalism and Trade Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2ebf8fc66110d72ecef9838c70c278bbc2928891cbd4851f868134a1051c65fd"}, "2": {"node_id": "f94ea9ac-426d-4381-962a-3795daa481fa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d3997d5d30d36a24dff2efb7187a74a966ab0facc7b201d491d2d6b0884ff4bd"}}, "hash": "e02baeece27cb113cc14ee9db652954c82a5250c5ac6a8c3709c4687dccd9a94", "text": "More importantly, only two categories of electrical and electronic products (thermion, cold and photo-cathode valves; and automatic data processing machines) accounted for over 50 per cent of total non-fuel imports and for about 60 per cent of manufactured imports by China from those countries.

China, as the largest and most dynamic regional market, imports some xi sophisticated electrical and electronic products from the NIEs. It is also a major regional market for parts and components used for the assembly of products that are exported mainly to Europe and the United States. Indeed, industrialized countries account for over half of China\u2019s exports. There is a common misconception about the role of market forces in the rapid expansion of regional trade in ESSEA. Some believe such trade is driven by market forces. This paper argues that the main driving force has been production sharing, which is basically an inter-firm operation that was initially prompted by changes in the government policies of Japan and by Japanese TNCs, as well as by the governments of the participating East Asian countries themselves. The integration of lower-income countries in regional trade through intra-industry trade and/or production sharing has to be policy-driven, which requires regional cooperation, not only in trade but also in other areas. The reliance on a limited number of products, the interdependence of the countries of the region and their heavy dependence on the markets of developed countries entail a number of risks. Such risks have increased over the last two decades because of the growing tendency of boom and bust cycles in developed countries, and an increase in the correlation of business cycles between economies across the ESSEA region since the mid-1980s. Sources of risk include bottlenecks in production, or the emergence of financial shocks in one country and their transmission to other countries, resulting in slow growth. In particular, the dependence of other countries on China increases their vulnerability to external shocks and business cycles. The contagion effects of the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998 is a reminder of weaknesses in the international financial architecture, and thus of the need for strengthening regional financial cooperation in order to reduce the risk of socio-economic losses. The sub-prime problem in the United States, leading to a crisis in the financial markets, is another reminder of this effect. Moreover, not only do trade and industrial policies pursued in one country affect prospects for trade and development in other countries of the region, but also other policies, such as the exchange rate, financial and macroeconomic policies, in one country may have an impact on the economies of others. Therefore, this study suggests the need to enhance and strengthen regional cooperation in four ar- eas. The first is industrial collaboration through division of labour and specialization for building the supply capacity of the lower-income countries. As the countries concerned have common production and export structures, they currently have little prospect for regional trade expansion. The idea is for them to develop complementarity through the division of labour and specialization in different products with the aim of creat- ing supply capabilities based on the principle of dynamic comparative advantage. The cooperation experi- ence of India with Nepal and Sri Lanka shows not only the importance but also the feasibility of industrial collaboration among lower-income countries. Second, regional arrangements should also include establishing a facility for providing adjustment assistance to lower-income countries for building supply capacity and back-up services, as well as for training and skills development. The NIEs in particular, which are interested in seeking new markets, should contribute to such a facility, as the development of lower-income countries would provide them with additional market opportunities in the region. The third area for cooperation is in technological capacity building and R&D among the second-tier NIEs. Finally, there is a need for enhancing financial cooperation and control of capital movements to reduce the risks arising from interdependence and vulnerability to external factors. The paper proposes, inter alia, the establishment of a regional bank for the South, which could also incorporate the existing Asian bond market schemes of the Chiang Mai Initiative. Although not discussed in this study, the countries of the region may seriously consider development of a strategic energy reserve facility to reduce their vulnerability to possible interruptions in petroleum supplies.

Introduction Over the past 25 years, South-South (S-S) trade has been expanding faster than international trade. For ex- ample, the average annual growth rate of exports of developing countries to other developing countries during the period 1995\u20132005 was more than 11 per cent, compared to 6.6 per cent for the world a whole2. Furthermore, intraregional trade in the East, South and South-East Asian region (ESSEA) has increased more rapidly than S-S trade as a whole (table 1). However, trade growth has been concentrated among countries with relatively better developed industrial capabilities. Therefore, the paper argues that this cannot be ex- plained by regional trade agreements (RTAs) alone. Rapid trade growth in ESSEA has been due largely to the expansion of intra-industry trade, particularly production sharing in electrical and electronic industries. South-South trade has thus contributed to the development of the region through its positive cumulative effects. Nevertheless, it has had certain drawbacks as well. First, intraregional trade has been concentrated mainly among China, the first-tier NIEs and the four second-tier NIEs3. The low-income countries have not benefited from intraregional trade as much as other countries in the region; indeed, some of them have benefited very little. An intensification of regionalism among the more advanced developing countries of the region as well as with developed countries may result in a further concentration of regional trade against low-income countries. Therefore, the dynamism behind the rapid expansion of regional trade in ESSEA, its concentration in certain countries/areas and the reasons for the sluggish performance of some of the regional blocs in Asia need to be explored more closely. Which factors explain the divergences in their performance? Is the expansion of S-S regional trade the result of devel- opment, or vice-versa? Does it take place sufficiently through the operation of market forces alone? Can it be used also as a tool for the development and industrialization of the lower-income countries? What measures need to be taken for this purpose? What policies/measures could be taken by the lower-income countries themselves? What could the more advanced country members of S-S regional agreements do to assist the low-income countries to enhance their regional trade as a means of development? Second, the increased interdependence among the countries of the region that are heavily involved in intraregional trade has increased the vulnerability of each of them to economic and policy changes in the other countries of the region. What could be done to cushion this? Finally, countries of the region are not homogeneous: They have different economic structures as well as different issues to tackle. While they have some common interests in intensifying regional cooperation, the main interests of different groups of countries vary. For the first-tier NIEs, market expansion and developing frontier technologies seem to be the main concerns; for the second-tier NIEs, on the other hand, the burning 2 For non-fuel exports, the corresponding figures were over 10 per cent and 5.9 per cent, respectively (table 2 and its sources). 3 The first-tier NIEs are Hong Kong (SAR, China), the Republic of Korea, Singapore and Taiwan (Province of China). The second-tier NIEs are Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Most of these countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand) are also members of ASEAN. 2 issue is upgrading their industrial structure; and the main preoccupation of the low-income countries is the expansion of supply capacity. What measures can be taken to respond to the needs and interests of each group? The governments involved in regional cooperation in ESSEA need to address all of the questions that have been raised above. The study attempts to shed some light on these issues while presenting information about the expansion of regional trade in ESSEA.

Background to regionalism and S-S trade cooperation in the ESSEA region South-South cooperation was first formally introduced in 1958 with the agreement for the establishment of a Central American Common Market. Such cooperation was given further impetus by the success of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in the early 1970s. Subsequently, with the begin- ning of negotiations for a North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in early 1990s (following approval of the United States Tariff and Trade Act of 1984, which authorized the Government to enter into regional trade agreements (RTAs)), RTAs became more fashionable in general. During the first half of 1990s, 19 new notifications on RTAs were received by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), as compared with 25 for the entire period 1948\u20131989. There was a veritable explosion in the number of RTAs concluded after the Uruguay Round: during the second half of 1990s, the number of notifications received by the World Trade Organization (WTO) and remaining in force was 37, followed by 106 for the period between early 2000 and 24 September 20074. According to the WTO, all member countries are party to one RTA or more (in some cases 20 RTAs), resulting in what is referred to as a \u201cspaghetti- bowl\u201d of RTAs. Developing countries are involved in RTAs with other developing countries as well as with developed countries and transition economies. One impor- tant difference between S-S trade agreements and N-S trade agreements is that the latter are dominated by free trade agreements (FTAs), while S-S agreements are mostly preferential, although FTAs among developing countries are also increasing5. In Asia, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates that there are about 192 bilateral and subregional FTAs signed or under negotiation6. In East Asia, as on June 2007, out of 102 FTAs, 26 were plurilateral and 75 bilateral, 21 were intra-East Asian and another 80 were extra-East Asian (Kawai and Wignaraja, 2007: table 5). The main reasons for the rapid expansion of RTAs in East Asia include trade liberalization, growth of inward FDI and vertical production networks, development of logistic support services and the rapid economic growth of large emerging markets (ibid: 4-5). Baldwin (2006) argues that East Asian regionalism is fragile because of the interdependence of these countries through intraregional trade, and a lack of discipline and of a mechanism for dispute settlement in the absence of bound preferential tariff cuts in their regional agreements. He proposes a binding of the region\u2019s tariff cuts in the WTO and an arrangement for \u201cmanagement effort\u201d to discipline the member coun- tries in implementing the regional agreements concerned. However, binding of tariff cuts in WTO may not be 4 The data cover RTAs that were in force and active as on 24 September 2007. Otherwise, there were 256 new notifications for the period 1995 to 24 September 2007 (www.wto.org/). 5 Out of 41 N-S agreements (on trade in goods), 40 are FTAs, as compared with 22 out of 45 S-S agreements. In the latter, another 18 are preferential agreements (based on Rollo, 2007, table 1). 6 ADB in Brief, Regional Cooperation and Integration, available at: www.adb.org/Media/Articles. 4 in the interest of the countries of the region as it would limit their policy space and their room for manoeuvre vis-\u00e0-vis all other countries. While the debate on whether RTAs are \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d or \u201cstumbling blocks\u201d for multilateralism and for global free trade continues, the \u201cspaghetti bowl\u201d is becoming bigger and bigger. A discussion of whether or not RTAs are building blocks for achieving global free trade is not within the scope of this study. Those involved in this debate advocate universal free trade. However, neither universal free trade nor the expansion of trade, per se, should be an objective of development. We consider trade as a \u201cmeans\u201d to development \u2013 not an end.

But how are the lower-income countries of the region affected by this process? Most of the bilateral trade agreements in the region are those concluded between the more advanced developing countries, or between these countries and developed countries (UNDP, 2005a; Hufbauer and Schott 2007: 2-16). There are also attempts to intensify regional integration among the more advanced countries of the region. For example, ASEAN already has an FTA with China, Japan and the Republic of Korea (ASEAN+3); further ASEAN+3 is involved in a trade agree- ment with Australia, New Zealand and India (Kawai and Wignaraja, 2007). According to a study by Kawai and Wignaraja (2007) based on a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, such a development will benefit the more advanced countries of the region, but will have less beneficial income effects on the lower-income members of ASEAN that have little to offer. It will also have detrimental (i.e. discriminatory) effects on lower- income countries that are not covered by the ASEAN agreement, such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and countries of central Asia (Kawai and Wignaraja, 2007: table 11). Trade liberalization is regarded as the solution for the expansion of S-S trade (Kowaski and Shepherd, 2006; DAFT, 2004). However, tariffs alone do not necessarily explain the lack of participation in S-S trade by low-income countries. For example, even though the exports of low-income countries to upper-middle-in- come (developing) countries of the ESSEA region face more or less the same average tariff rates as imports from other groups (high- and middle-income countries) (Kowaski and Shepherd, 2006: table 14), they do not benefit from the same rate of growth of exports as those other groups (ibid: tables 10). It seems that low supply capacity is, inter alia, one of the major factors impeding regional trade expansion by the low-income countries. Developing countries have collectively expressed their political will and desire for the expansion of S-S trade and cooperation in different forums, such as at meetings of the G-77 and non-aligned movement (NAM), particularly since the adoption of the Mexico City Programme of Action (1976). Yet, to the author\u2019s knowledge, they have not always provided a clear economic justification and rationale for S-S trade as against N-S trade, as explained in the following section. 5 3. The economic rationale for S-S trade 3.1 The controversy Cooperation among developing countries for the expansion of S-S trade in general has been at the centre of controversy between neoclassical/neo-liberal economists and their opponents, as have RTAs. However, neither of the groups has been able to present a valid or strong argument to support their respective stands. The proponents of universal free trade have argued against discriminatory trade agreements, in general, and FTAs among developing countries for the expansion of S-S trade, in particular. For example, Viner (1950) argues that regional integration would result in diversion of some trade from low-cost producers (non-members of RTAs) to high-cost producers (members of RTAs). Even if some trade were to be created as a result of RTAs, the welfare costs of trade diversion would be higher than the benefits of trade creation. In some recent literature, RTAs are, in fact, considered to be undesirable. Greenaway and Milner (1990:1) argue that: The case for specific policies to promote South-South trade is not convincing\u2026The expansion of South-South trade can be expected to continue in the context of multilateral trade expansion and the potential gains are likely to be greater if this process is allowed to evolve freely in a multilateral setting. Corden (1993: 457, 459) goes even further, arguing that developing countries will be far better off if they liberalize their trade regime \u201cunilaterally in a non-discriminatory fashion\u201d rather than targeting markets in the South. According to him, for developing countries \u201c\u2026there is only the option of multilateral free or freer trade, i.e.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee27b5ca-bcc0-4d40-8dab-9c620c19ce7c": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee27b5ca-bcc0-4d40-8dab-9c620c19ce7c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-South Regionalism and Trade Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7458e3dac55ad5245da92b02e805989757b03d3d172fb16ad3ed4ee83a261ad5"}, "2": {"node_id": "62e77593-25db-4cbf-801b-13821805aca4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b7046e2e9d009039df82afe846042a6589ccd174461d90370351677617fd7e17"}}, "hash": "857b6e637c267b195e73d0d801ee253f49a861c50e79ad03d8576ef67c54302a", "text": "GATT\u2026\u201d7 According to the World Bank (2000) and Moen (1998), RTAs between the South and North are more advantageous than RTAs among developing countries themselves (see also Subramanian and Tamirisa, 2001).

The neo-liberal views against S-S trade are based on their ideological bias in favour of universal free trade, which is influenced by the static version of the theory of comparative cost advantage. This theory 7 For a critique of this view, see Shafaeddin, 1997. 6 is, in turn, based on hypothetical and unrealistic assumptions. They are ideologically biased because they argue in favour of the expansion of trade for maximizing global welfare rather than for the development of developing countries. The theory of cost comparative advantage is based on a number of assumptions, in- cluding full employment of resources, availability of the same technology to all countries, independence of present and future costs of production, as well as the lack of influence of experience on the production cost, the lack of external economies, atomistic units of production, constant returns to scale and the lack of risk and influence of power in trade. They do not take into account the characteristics of developing countries, such as underemployment of resources, their lack of technological capabilities, existence of scale economies in many manufacturing industries, and the interdependence of present and future costs (i.e. the fact that present production may reduce future costs by gaining experience as well as reaping internal and external scale economies). List (1856) was among the first to challenge the classical \u201ctheory of exchangeable value\u201d (universal free international trade). While arguing that free trade could be an ultimate aim, he introduced his theory of \u201cproductive power\u201d (which in modern economic terminology amounts to development or building of supply capacity). To him, trade was a means to enhancing \u201cproductive power\u201d \u2013 not an aim per se. Kaldor (1972) sug- gested that developing countries should be concerned mainly with promoting \u201ccreative efficiency\u201d (growth and development) rather than allocative efficiency (i.e. allocation of given and \u201cfully employed\u201d resources among different activities efficiently as argued in neo-classical theory). In other words, while allocative ef- ficiency is the concern of the static theory of cost comparative advantage, developing countries are to be concerned with attaining dynamic comparative advantage for the sake of promoting \u201ccreative efficiency\u201d. However, dynamic comparative advantage will not be attained automatically through the operation of mar- ket forces alone; to attain it requires actions by the government (Cline, 1983; Amsden 1989; Shafaeddin, 2005a and 2005b). List also introduced, inter alia, the idea of regional integration in his proposal for German unification and cooperation among European countries, which eventually led to the signature of the Treaty of Rome in 19578. In the early 1950s, Raul Prebisch provided the strongest dynamic argument for regional integration in developing countries in the context of his theory, advocating import substitution and \u201ccollective import substitution\u201d for a transitory period during the course of industrialization and development (ECLA, 1950; Prebisch, 1984). However, his theory is often misinterpreted. It is true that he took a \u201cdefensive\u201d approach, but his vision was based on the internal conditions of developing countries and the international economic situation that prevailed in the early 1950s. It was a defensive approach in the sense that at the time he did not see significant prospects for the expansion of exports of manufactured goods from developing to developed countries. Developing countries did not have the necessary industrial infrastructure for producing goods for the markets of the North. Moreover, the protectionist policies of the governments of the \u201ccentre\u201d and the strat- egies of their industrial firms were not conducive to industrial exports from developing countries. Therefore, preferential regional trade agreements, and eventually common markets, were seen as means for facilitating intraregional trade in order to promote industrialization. Prebisch modified his theory later on, first in 1958. At that time, he regarded both import substitution and export expansion as parts of a long-term dynamic trade policy (Prebisch, 1984; Shafaeddin, 2005a: 151\u2013153). Yet he saw a place for regional integration for upgrading of the industrial structure, which required a larger market than the internal market of a single country.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a3c0bede-05d0-4fba-95b1-0e71ecbe9a98": {"__data__": {"id_": "a3c0bede-05d0-4fba-95b1-0e71ecbe9a98", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-South Regionalism and Trade Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "094aa3930a82e6ed0bdca165b753edcaacbb22c24c74666fe7ff72507a7e122b"}, "2": {"node_id": "ec84570e-f6cc-4daf-9258-3f4a0ba90afa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "894fccd1ec493af66abf21c98a028e18d3facf95afb7639e05add4c9e1f7b84f"}}, "hash": "26e86aa8eaa6b62d6f18b71676718ce28a071eb80513f07c9eec08f7c1f7293a", "text": "For many years, following the initial ideas of Prebisch, arguments in favour of S-S trade centred mainly on the issues of small size of the domestic market, economies of scale, problems of access to developed- country markets (see, for example, UNCTAD, 1986:10\u201311 and Agatiello, 2007) or a slowdown in growth rates of developed-country economies and growing potential for S-S trade expansion (South Centre 1996: ix-xiii).

The Regional Cooperation Agreement for Development between Iran, Pakistan and Turkey is an example in Asia. Scholars have provided other \u201cdefensive\u201d arguments in favour of S-S trade. One is that trade among equal partners will have a positive influence on net barter terms of trade (Sarkar and Singer, 1991)9. Another is that too much reliance on trade with the North will increase vulnerability and risks of dependence on trade (Hirschman, 1968). Hence, there is a need for geographical diversification to reduce the related risks. Of course, geographical diversification would be possible to the extent that alternative sources of supply are available in the South. While both arguments seem reasonable, the question is \u201chow\u201d alternative sources of supply can be developed. In other words, what is the dynamic vehicle for the expansion of S-S trade as a means of promoting industrialization and development? The \u201cdefensive\u201d approach in favour of regionalization and S-S trade has not vanished in the recent era of globalization, although the arguments provided are different. Some have attributed the revival of regionalism in the 1990s to disappointment by the United States at slow progress in Uruguay Round negotiations (e.g. Bhagwati, 1993), and, more recently in the Doha Round, to the lack of development dimensions in multilateral institutions and to weaknesses in the international trading system (UNCTAD, 2007a: 40-45, and ch. VI; Kowai and Wingaraja, 2007: 8). Others regard regionalization as a possible option for countries that risk exclusion, or marginalization, from the growth dynamics of globalization (Oman, 1994). Further, N-S plurilateral and bilateral agreements, it is argued, can limit policy space of developing countries by including clauses covering aspects that go beyond those imposed on them through multilateral trade rules. This is done by the inclusion of \u201cWTO-plus\u201d conditions and \u201cSingapore issues\u201d10 in these agreements in areas such as tariffs, subsidies, trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights (TRIPS), government procurement, rules of origin,11 performance clauses, trade-related investment measures (TRIMs)12 and even competition policy. In fact, it has been noted that, although N-S trade agreements have put in place many policy-stabilizing mechanisms, they are unevenly applied, and \u201cpost-modern\u201d hidden protectionist \u201cbackslid- ings such as antidumping practices are still present even in advanced North-South or East-West RTAs\u201d (Cernant and Laird, 2007). Imposition of commitments to forgo performance requirements in investment agreements beyond the TRIMs Agreement is a clear example of \u201cWTO-plus\u201d conditions imposed on developing countries. Eleven developing countries have agreed to forgo such conditions in FTAs and bilateral agreements; among them eight have committed never to use them against any foreign investor. Another 27 developing and transition economies have made similar commitments in their investment agreements with the United States and 8 countries in their agreements with Canada (Baldwin et al., 2007: tables 1 and 2 and figure 6). S-S trade agreements are therefore preferred to N-S agreements because they do not limit policy space of the partners (UNCTAD, 2007a: 54\u201364 and chap. IX). 9 Note, however, that products traded among developing countries are different from those traded between developed and developing countries. Exports of technology-intensive products by developed countries, in particular, are subject to patent and monopoly rights or oligopoly of the exporting firms, which, thus, carry premium prices. 10 WTO-plus conditions are those included in bilateral or regional agreements in addition to, or more severe than, conditions covered in Uruguay Round (WTO) agreements.

TRIPS and TRIMs are two multilateral agreements that were signed by the WTO\u2019s contracting parties at the end of Uruguay Round of Trade Negotia- tions. 8 Unfulfilled expectations from N-S RTAs, is another reason provided. In this respect, the example of NAFTA is often cited because it did not enhance Mexico\u2019s industrialization and development. Some regard the maquiladora sector, which expanded fast due to its ease of access to the United States market, as an enclave with limited contribution to the internal development of the country (Gallagher and Zarsky, 2007; Shafaeddin and Pizarro, 2007)13. Although the points raised by those using the defensive approach about the existence of problems with the multilateral trading system and N-S RTAs are valid, they are not an argument in favour of S-S re- gionalism or S-S trade. Even if S-S trade is proved desirable theoretically, the question is what conditions and what kind of dynamic mechanism should be envisaged that would be beneficial to industrialization and development of the partner countries? It is true that developing countries that are at early stages of industrial development have benefited less from regional integration than those with a more diversified production structure (UNCTAD, 2007a: 41; xxi). Nevertheless, two points are worth emphasizing in this regard. First of all, this may not necessarily be the case, as is indicated by the example of the European Union (EU). Economies with relatively lower levels of development (e.g. Cyprus, Greece, Portugal and Spain) than other members of the EU benefited a lot more than their partners when they integrated into the EU. Much depends on the integration mechanism employed. Secondly, if economic development is the key objective, in order to benefit from regionalism and S-S trade should a country develop first before integrating regionally, rather than using regional integration and S-S trade as a vehicle for industrialization and development? Some argue that when conditions for South-South intra-industry trade exist, it could offer opportu- nities for learning-by-doing, and external economies or economies of scale (Otsubo, 1998). However, it is not clear how such opportunities could be developed in lower-income countries that are at early stages of industrialization. Should they wait until they are developed and conditions for intra-industry trade prevail? Hence, the \u201cnormative\u201d aspect of S-S regionalism for the expansion of S-S trade as a means of indus- trialization and development should be based on more solid ground than on the analysis of the \u201cpositive economics\u201d of S-S regionalism and trade. 3.2 An alternative conceptual framework and mechanisms for S-S trade The paper\u2019s starting point is that trade is a means to development. Following Myrdal (1971), development is defined as a movement upwards of the whole social system, which includes, inter alia, the need for expansion of income, employment and social services and human development, which are also among the objectives of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The experience of almost every developed country and NIE is that industrialization is an essential part of a strategy that aims at rapid development. \u201c\u2026 [F]or the Asian Pacific region\u2026.a major rational for strategic and selective government intervention in the industrial policy context is to fashion a national trade policy which actively prioritizes both domestic industrialization and increasing the value [sic] of higher value added manufactured and services exports\u201d (Malhotra, 2006:11; UNDP, 2003). Within such a policy framework, addressing supply-side capacity constraints for expansion of productive capacity and/or upgrading of the industrial structure play a key role (Malhotra, 2006: 9). So does market expansion. Why and how can S-S trade and regional integration work as a vehicle for industrialization and develop- ment? The paper shows that expansion of S-S trade is needed to supplement N-S trade for a fuller utilization of unemployed resources of developing countries and for the expansion of their productive capacity and upgrading of their industrial structure.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "28db36d4-f03c-4bac-80f2-4823474a3f85": {"__data__": {"id_": "28db36d4-f03c-4bac-80f2-4823474a3f85", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-South Regionalism and Trade Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8d4aacd0300205ca9ec8c23374b5c7ed71adb090ca90c7edc1410ad378568167"}, "2": {"node_id": "3db33c90-babf-470c-85cf-36a31b1f32db", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9ffa77921cbb0be0fc5094271150713bce93559d190380ecdf51e950a8b5e476"}}, "hash": "33a711b098da7ec49d80f99d9c60730c240a221f8363a21023e050b92187a7ba", "text": "For achieving such objectives, S-S cooperation for trade expansion should follow the principle of dynamic comparative advantage, rather than static comparative advantage.

The paper postpones until section 6 the discussion on the modalities and a mechanism for the promotion of S-S cooperation for the expansion of supply capacity \u2013 particularly in low-income countries \u2013 and for the upgrading of the industrial structure. To begin with, contrary to the neoclassical theory of international trade, resources of developing countries are not fully employed, production of agricultural goods and manufactured products are subject to diminishing and increasing returns, respectively, and resources are not fully mobile and flexible to be easily transferable from the production of one good to another. In technical terms, in comparative cost advantage theory, movement can take place along a static \u201cproduction possibility curve\u201d. As resources are fully employed, any expansion of exports will be at the cost of production for the domestic market. The theory is concerned with reallocation of resources. Further, any adjustment from production for the domestic market to produc- tion for export, takes place easily as resources are assumed to be mobile and flexible. In developing countries, resources are not, in fact, fully employed and the economy is below the pro- duction possibility curve, particularly at early stages of development. Labour, land and/or natural resources are often unemployed or underemployed. In addition, in many instances there is an army of unemployed labour. Even when land is fully cultivated, it may not be used efficiently if the yield is low; therefore the contribution of land does not realize its full potential. Primary commodities are also generally exported before process- ing, for increasing value added, or for use in the process of industrialization through \u201clateral diversification\u201d14. In other words, a developing country possesses some potential surplus productive capacity, which can be mobilized for producing additional goods for export without shifting resources away from production for the domestic market (Myint, 1958). By providing effective demand, in theory, trade can provide opportunities for a fuller utilization of resources for the production of goods for which sufficient domestic effective demand is lacking. This is the essence of the \u201cvent for surplus theory\u201d (ibid). The argument can be extended by saying that production of goods for \u201cadditional\u201d exports can take place without shifting resources away from production for domestic consumption and/or for exports to the North. Nevertheless, in practice, this potential capacity cannot be realized unless two conditions are met: additional effective demand through international trade, and the existence of the complementary resources needed for production. In neoclassical theory, trade liberalization, in addition to trade with the North, could provide the necessary effective demand leading to specialization and division of labour. This is because the structure of production is assumed to be flexible and resources can easily move from one activity to another. Yet the experience of the last quarter century indicates that even when trade liberalization has led to export expansion in lower-income countries, it has often resulted in deindustrialization, unemployment and spe- cialization based on natural-resource-based industries and/or assembly operations, rather than in industrial development and upgrading (and a shift upwards of the production possibility curve). This is because N-S trade is governed by the principle of static comparative cost advantage. A developing country can export to the North what it can produce cheaply. The North will not provide effective demand for high-cost new products of a developing country that is at the early stages of industrialization. The experience of successful industrializers indicates that creating supply capabilities is a prerequisite for export expansion and intra-in- dustry and inter-industry trade (Amsden, 1989; Malhotra, 2006; and Shafaeddin, 2006). Even if the markets in the North were to provide the necessary effective demand for new industrial products of lower-income countries, the potential surplus capacity of the latter countries would not be turned into actual production capacity. This is because of their scarcity of the complementary resources necessary for 14 Lateral diversification (as distinct from horizontal and vertical diversification) is the process of combining various resources for production of a product \u2013 or products \u2013 based mainly, but not exclusively, on domestic inputs together with imported inputs. 10 production and the inflexibility of an unskilled labour force that prevents it from moving to new activities that require some skills.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "81983b86-50d4-4c01-8614-a36a89322ebf": {"__data__": {"id_": "81983b86-50d4-4c01-8614-a36a89322ebf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-South Regionalism and Trade Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca64aa17a6e893418e51a135d1e4078c4f84df20c8cfb3bcb264ac4c1cf03314"}, "2": {"node_id": "3aee0706-c346-4b5f-80bb-3258343be650", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e9c4f0a0686bd4e5d41c8b6490f559db291032926452ffea8e023f3090dfc81b"}}, "hash": "7b54f7894c395c07a135bfcfc604d8717e391c378d15a57c4ad173df8cc0f0a5", "text": "Complementary resources are scarce in the areas of finance, skills, technology, organiza- tion, entrepreneurship, \u201csupply determined\u201d factors such as some natural resources, and, more importantly, decision-making capabilities of the government", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f0e33516-788e-4a0c-a103-6b54be8a8114": {"__data__": {"id_": "f0e33516-788e-4a0c-a103-6b54be8a8114", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-South Regionalism and Trade Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0c1ca1846a6c6bfe2a196f84f9d4bae8ba6d81cbd743d2a7b9674345f3048633"}, "3": {"node_id": "5ce81395-55ce-42f4-aaaf-b3342c48abd4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3f968ff2317bd7571e120bae55fa03e15fbb8f3ed759b841fad6367b1412ce02"}}, "hash": "6d11b296fd367f02f1f0da2683c7ef28d7188ba08073c8c6c3e6270bf0b7b5d0", "text": "machinery (Hirschman, 1958). This scarcity limits the realiza- tion of potential productive capacity for export and accelerated growth. Further, the lower-income economies lack the necessary flexibility to adjust their methods and factors of production easily. Can TNCs contribute significantly to the process of expansion of productive capacity and upgrading to enable an increase in exports to the North? In this age of globalization, the power of TNCs in international trade, production and other economic activities is growing. By the turn of the twenty-first century, 1,000 com- panies accounted for 80 per cent of industrial production and 500 firms for 70 per cent of world trade. Since then, mergers and acquisition have accelerated, contributing to further concentration of economic activities in these companies. During the period 2000\u20132006, the number of cross-border mergers and acquisitions with values of over US$1 billion had reached over 813 with values amounting to nearly US$3 trillion (UNCTAD, 2007b: table 1.1)15. The large TNCs enjoy economies of scale not only in production, but also in marketing and distribution, and, more importantly, in R&D. In such a world, independent and newcomer firms to a particular field of production in developing countries are in a disadvantageous comparative position. The combination of the problem of scarcity and international market concentration renders their penetration into the world market, initiation of new competitive industries and/or upgrading of their existing industrial structure difficult. Foreign direct investment by TNCs of the industrial countries can remedy some of the scarcity problems and act as a channel for exports to developed countries. However, the interests of TNCs \u2013 which is to earn prof- its - are different from those of a host developing country. Even when they contribute to export expansion, it is basically in assembly operations and resource-based activities that are governed by static comparative advantage of the host country (Lall, 2004). Their contribution to upgrading of the industrial structure of the host country is often limited. Further, FDI increases the vulnerability of the host country to external factors. Again, the experience of Mexico is telling. Despite extensive involvement of TNCs and the NAFTA Agreement, Mexico has had little success in upgrading its maquila industries. Further, in recent years, following the world economic recession, its average annual rate of growth of manufactured exports fell from 19.8 per cent during the 1990s to 5.7 per cent in the period 2000\u20132006 (UN COMTRADE database). In contrast to the interests of TNCs, the interests of a host developing country are, or are supposed to be, industrialization and develop- ment. Hence, TNCs\u2019 contribution to development of the host country would depend on the extent to which these firms are managed and regulated by the government of the host country. East Asian NIEs have managed to harness FDI to some extent. However, similar tools for controlling and regulating FDI are no longer easily available to developing countries due to the fact that their policy space has become limited by international trade and investment rules and bilateral trade agreements and arrangements. Moreover, the experience of the last quarter century demonstrates that lower-income countries in particular encounter difficulties in at- tracting FDI. How can S-S trade contribute to remedying the scarcity problem? What is required in the context of lower-income countries is that, instead of trade leading to division of labour and specialization, it should be the other way round. That is, division of labour and specialization in production, along with provision of back-up services for S-S trade should help trade expansion. FTAs, or preferential tariff agreements, can facilitate, inter alia, the S-S flow of trade in products that are already being produced, provided the necessary back-up services and infrastructure are available. Yet preferential tariffs are insufficient because of similarities in the production structure of the lower-income countries, their lack of complementarities and scarcity of back-up services, infrastructure and institutions necessary for S-S trade. The operation of market forces and 15 This is 55 per cent higher than the total number of mergers and acquisitions for the previous 13 years (i.e. 1987\u20131999) (based on UNCTAD, 2007b: table 1.1). 11 their contribution to remedying the scarcity problem for production of new products is limited, especially in countries at early stages of industrialization and development.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5ce81395-55ce-42f4-aaaf-b3342c48abd4": {"__data__": {"id_": "5ce81395-55ce-42f4-aaaf-b3342c48abd4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-South Regionalism and Trade Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0c1ca1846a6c6bfe2a196f84f9d4bae8ba6d81cbd743d2a7b9674345f3048633"}, "2": {"node_id": "f0e33516-788e-4a0c-a103-6b54be8a8114", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6d11b296fd367f02f1f0da2683c7ef28d7188ba08073c8c6c3e6270bf0b7b5d0"}}, "hash": "3f968ff2317bd7571e120bae55fa03e15fbb8f3ed759b841fad6367b1412ce02", "text": "To overcome the scarcity problem for expansion of supply capacities, concerted policy measures for extending S-S regional cooperation to other areas than preferential trade agreements are needed.

Division of labour and specialization in this case means that each country would be allocated the production of a particular manufacturing product, and parts and components for production of another product, the output of which would be exchanged with other countries or would be sent to another country for assembly. At the same time, each country may be engaged in assembly operations, or production of a product, and production of parts of that product or other products. The choice of products would have to be determined for the specific countries involved. In this way, both the scarcity problem and the \u201ceffective demand\u201d constraint would be remedied. Although for a while high cost products would be exchanged, this would be only an accounting issue as long as bilateral trade or the trade balance of each country with its partners is balanced. The result would be the creation of employment and income. As industrialization pro- ceeds, the cost of production would decline gradually due to learning-by-doing, experience, internal and external economies of scale and increasing return, which are characteristics of manufacturing (Young, 1928). Of course, in the meantime lower cost alternatives would be available on the international market, but the necessary purchasing power for acquiring the extra imports would be missing in this case. The type and spe- cific arrangement needed would depend on the level of development and industrial capacity of the countries concerned, as explained in section 6. The second requirement is cooperation in the provision of producer services, training and skills devel- opment, back-up services, including trade facilitation, export credit, insurance and infrastructure necessary for the expansion of regional trade and supply capacity and R&D, among others. The third requirement is government intervention and a clear industrial policy, both by individual countries and collectively. As the market fails to provide the necessary skills, infrastructure, back-up services and institutions, collective arrangements are essential in these respects. Further, all countries should follow a dynamic industrial policy, with performance requirements in exchange for facilities and a collective market, provided that over time they improve their competitiveness in the international market. The advantage of this scheme over traditional import substitution, where protection was provided across the board to all industries, is selectivity in the use of scarce resources as well as benefiting from the larger size of the collective market. Its advantage over selective infant industry protection is the benefit of the larger market provided by the member countries. Geographical diversification to reduce risks of dependence on markets in developed countries, and the resultant enhancement of bargaining power by developing countries in international forums and in their bilateral trade relations with developed countries are among additional benefits of such S-S cooperation ar- rangements. The achievements and weaknesses of the ESSEA region in S-S trade provides clues as to the potential and possibilities for enhancing and strengthening S-S cooperation in the region, particularly through produc- tion sharing, which is a form of industrial collaboration. The paper follows with these issues below. 12 Developing countries of ESSEA, constitute a major and growing source of supply as well as a market in world trade, and account for the bulk of international trade of developing countries. Furthermore, ESSEA intraregional trade accounts for the lion\u2019s share of their total trade and of S-S trade. The region encompasses a number of RTAs, but they are not the only force behind regional trade dynamism. Moreover, the low-income countries do not benefit from regional trade as much as the other countries of the region. 4.1 ESSEA in world trade and S-S trade Table 1 provides data on the shares of developing countries and the main Asian regional trade groups in world trade in 2005. As only a limited number of countries export petroleum, fuel is put as a separate item and our analysis focuses on trade in non-fuel products. Further, SITC 9 (mainly armaments and special items) is excluded from non-fuel exports in order to concentrate on trade in commercial products. The trade data of Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of China (hereafter referred to as Hong Kong [SAR, China]) and Singapore include re-exports16. Unfortunately, it is not easy to exclude the figures on re-exports from various product groups because of the lack of comprehensive data for all countries. Hence, the data slightly overes- timate the role of the region as a source of supply and a market.

ESSEA also accounts for the bulk of both exports (over 80 per cent) and imports (67 per cent) of manufactured goods of developing countries. By contrast, for food and raw materials it is more of a market than a source of supply. The ESSEA region encompasses a number of regional trade groups in which lower-income countries also have membership (as shown in the note to table 1).

ESSEA is also a major source of growth of international trade. During the period 1995\u20132005, the average annual growth rates of both exports and imports of manufactured goods and minerals of ESSEA exceeded those of the world as a whole (table 2). However, for agricultural goods, the region is more of a dynamic market than a dynamic source of supply. China, in particular, stands out in terms of the size and growth rate of its trade in various product groups, particularly its exports of manufactured goods and imports of primary products. If China, India and the Republic of Korea are excluded from their respective regional blocs, the rates of growth of trade in non-fuel products, particularly manufactured goods, of the remaining countries in the regional blocs lag behind those of China as well as of ESSEA as a whole. The relatively high growth rate of exports and imports of the Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement (APTA), excluding China, is due to the Republic of Korea (table 9). Once again low-income country members of the trade blocs SAARC and APTA exhibit lower growth rates of both exports and imports than the average for the ESSEA as a group. In other words, involve- ment in RTAs does not necessarily lead to regional trade expansion. 4.2 Regional trade of ESSEA The ESSEA region is the main sources of supply and the main market for S-S trade, particularly for non-fuel products, and manufactured goods dominate such trade (table 3). Therefore, this study examines the evo- lution of the regional trade of ESSEA in relation to S-S trade in manufactured goods and non-fuel primary products separately (tables 4 and 5). In 2005, the magnitude of South-South trade in manufactured goods was more than 6 times higher than that of non-fuel primary commodities as a whole, while", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "13764e27-fc72-4edd-ba54-5f82484b09fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "13764e27-fc72-4edd-ba54-5f82484b09fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-South Regionalism and Trade Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3a725db854fb54a4c53cbcc19b63549d93b8635f623b2f8b2c5751765345f00d"}, "3": {"node_id": "18d47dd9-d57f-4a95-9b24-d31c7a6f89e8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6c4060f87b46c3c0ea202497a7dceca0478b13aaee0113d71afaed819f33a147"}}, "hash": "50a8872b379c9982e0ea8916519f8c77848ba6303b1bfc582267f21559643c69", "text": "it was 7.5 times higher in ESSEA-South trade. Moreover, while growth of S-S trade exceeded that of world trade for both manufactured goods and primary products, manufactured goods were more dynamic in the expansion of S-S trade, to the extent that the share of S-S trade in manufactured exports of developing countries reached almost 47 per cent, approaching that of non-fuel primary products (which was over 47 per cent in 2005). 18 If China and the Republic of Korea are excluded from APTA, the share of the group in world exports and imports falls to 2.2 and 1.2, respectively (sources same as table 1). 17 Table 3: S-S trade and the role of ESSEA, 2005* (% Share) Items Total trade Share of non-fuel items Share of S-S trade in total trade of the South: Exports 44.4 51 Imports 51 54.8 Share of manufactures in S-S trade: Exports 68.9 84.5 Imports 69 83 Share of ESSEA in S-S trade: Exports 75 67.9 Imports 72.1 69.3 Sources: Based on UNCTAD, 2007c, table 2.2.D. *Only merchandise goods. Regarding trade in manufactures, the rapid growth of intra-ESSEA trade, has made it a major market for S-S trade. The ESSEA region accounted for the lion\u2019s share of S-S trade (nearly 36 per cent of over 46 per cent), and intra-ESSEA trade accounted for over 42 per cent of the market for its total exports of manufactured goods in 2005 (table 4). By contrast, the rest of the developing countries received less than 8 per cent of manufactured exports of the ESSEA region. Moreover, the growth of exports of ESSEA to China significantly exceeded that of its intraregional trade for the group, let alone South-South trade. This indicates once again the importance of China as a large, dynamic market for exports of manufactured goods from the region. In other words, China alone has been the most dynamic market for ESSEA exports. Of course, China is involved in APTA and has a bilateral trade agreement with ASEAN as well as with various individual countries in the region, but so have many other countries (UNDP, 2005). As expected, the shares of intra-ESSEA non-fuel primary exports in total exports of ESSEA in 1995 and 2005 were considerably smaller than the corresponding figures for manufactured goods (tables 4 and 5). Furthermore, non-fuel primary exports experienced a lower growth rate over this period. The share of China as a market for exports of primary products of ESSEA was also smaller than its share of manufactured goods. While over half of China\u2019s imports of non-fuel primary products originated from developing countries in 2005, over 20 per cent of these imports originated from ESSEA, as compared to about 60 per cent for manufactured goods. In other words, primary products, which are the main export items of lower-income countries of the region, benefited less from dynamism in regional trade than from S-S trade in general. These countries\u2019 trade in primary products was sluggish, both with China and with the ESSEA as a whole. 18 Table 4: Matrix of South-South trade in manufactured goods, 1995 and 2005 Destination ESSEA China ESSEA (excl.

Hence intrabloc trade refers to trade among members of the same trade group within ESSEA, while intraregional trade refers to trade among countries of the ESSEA region. It is not easy to separate the impact of regional trade agreements from other factors on the expansion of trade among members of such agreements. Further, members of each trade bloc are also involved in bilateral trade agreements, sometimes even with other members of the same bloc (UNDP, 2005)19. Nevertheless, one may still examine the trade among members of a regional trade bloc and the intraregional trade of individual countries located in the ESSEA region as a whole. To do so, first this section examines the data on intrabloc trade of members of the main Asian regional trade blocs and then the trade between those blocs, or interbloc trade. This is followed by an examination of the intraregional trade of individual countries located in ESSEA. Table 6 provides data on the evolution of intrabloc trade of the main Asian trade blocs. As comprehen- sive data on the direction of trade for the different SITC product groups are not readily available, the table covers all SITC groups based on IMF Direction of Trade Database. It exemplifies that, first of all, in all cases the share of intraregional exports in total exports has increased over time. Secondly, ASEAN is the most success- ful trading bloc in terms of its intrabloc trade, and SAARC (an agreement between low- and middle-income countries), is the least successful in the ESSEA region20, perhaps partly because of political differences within the region. However, regional politics cannot be the only reason, as trade between India and Bangladesh is not particularly buoyant either. ASEAN is also the most successful among all the regional trade blocs of developing countries in terms of the intrabloc trade ratio: The share of intrabloc exports in total exports of the group was more than 26 per cent in 2005. The closest group to ASEAN was the Central American Common Market with a corresponding share of 18.9 per cent (UNCTAD, 2007c, table 1.4). The low intrabloc trade of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is mainly due to extreme similarities in the export structure of the member countries, all of which focuses mainly on oil exporting.

Table 7 shows the shares of intrabloc and interbloc exports of each of the main trading blocs in ESSEA, while table 8 highlights the growth rates of such exports during the period 1990\u20132005. China\u2019s exports to the various blocs are discussed separately because of its important weight in the region\u2019s trade. First of all, the share of intrabloc exports of each group has not always been greater than its share of exports with a different group or groups. For example, in 2005 the intrabloc exports of SAARC countries accounted for 5.5 per cent of their total exports, while ASEAN and APTA received 8.2 per cent and 10.9 per cent, respectively, of the total exports of SAARC (table 7). By contrast, in the case of ASEAN, the share of intrabloc exports in its total exports was greater than the shares of its interbloc exports. Yet its interbloc trade is expanding faster than its intrabloc trade, and the growth rate of its trade with other blocs and with China far exceeds the growth rate of its intrabloc trade (table 8). As for APTA, its exceptionally high intrabloc trade is basically due to the involvement of China, which accounted for over half of APTA\u2019s intrabloc trade in 2005 (table 7). Nevertheless, China\u2019s performance cannot be attributed to its trade agreements through APTA alone, or even to its bilateral agreements with other members of APTA. It has also developed exceptional trade relations with some other countries, both as an exporter and importer, particularly with ASEAN, as a result of its intra-industry trade and production sharing (see below). Exports of SAARC to China increased by an average annual rate of nearly 29 per cent during the period 1990\u20132005. Over the same period, exports of China to SAARC increased by 18 per cent (table 8). In other words, although the growth rates are high in both cases, as expected China\u2019s market for SAARC\u2019s exports was more dynamic than the market of SAARC for the exports of its own members. In the event the agreement on the Global System of Trade Preferences among Developing Countries (GSTP) becomes operational, it is very likely that interbloc and intrabloc trade in ESSEA will expand further, at least among countries that are contracting parties to GSTP (Annex 3). 21 Table 7: Share of intra- and inter-bloc trade in total exports of selected Asian economic blocs, 1990 and 2005 (%) Exporter Destination ASEAN-10 SAARC-7 APTA-6 Total of the 3 groups China Developing Asia excl.

To help determine this, table 9 provides data on regional trade in non-fuel products of individual countries of the region. It also includes data on per capita income and MVA/GDP ratios as rough indicators of the level of development and industrial capacity of the countries concerned. All the economies, except Hong Kong (SAR, China), Mongolia and Taiwan (Province of China), are included in an overall group denoted by \u201cA\u201d. Hence, in the following paragraph, the regional trade of a country means its trade with \u201cA\u201d. The three economies that are not part of \u201cA\u201d are included separately, as they do not participate in many trade agree- ments. Furthermore, the trade of Hong Kong (SAR, China) includes considerable re-export, the inclusion of which would distort the picture. Accordingly, the most important point emerging from the table is that the countries with industrial supply capabilities (indicated by MVA/GDP ratios) are among the most dynamic in regional trade. This implies that industrial capacity is a significant factor in the expansion of regional trade. The table indicates different categories. One category comprises the large and relatively high GDP growth dynamic countries of China and India, which are also dynamic in their regional trade.

Nevertheless, all of them, particu- larly the most industrialized (i.e. the Republic of Korea and Taiwan (Province of China) are regional exporters (sources of supply and market seekers) more than importers (markets), and they run a considerable trade surplus with \u201cA\u201d. They seek markets in other countries, and are also involved in production sharing and FDI, mainly with NIEs. The third group consists mainly of low-income countries. These are more of a regional market for other countries than sources of supply because of their limited productive capacity. They include (in reverse order of their share of exports to group A) Bangladesh, Cambodia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Myanmar. For these countries, particularly the first four, the share of their imports from group A in their total imports is considerably higher than their corresponding share of exports, and they run a significant trade deficit with \u201cA\u201d. Even a GDP growth dynamic low-income country such as Viet Nam (a member of ASEAN), which also displays dynamic regional trade relations, is more of a growing market than a source of supply for the region. Moreover, in most low-income countries of the region, the rates of growth of exports to group A are also lower than the rates of growth of their total exports. In some countries (Bangladesh and Pakistan - members of SAARC, and Cambodia - a member of ASEAN) there is no sign of an increase in their regional exports. In fact, for Bangladesh and Cambodia the growth rate of exports to group A has been negative. By contrast, Myanmar, Nepal and Sri Lanka, relatively speaking, are more dynamic regional exporters. Nevertheless, in these exceptional cases, their source of trade dynamism is probably their special bilateral trade relations with, and, to some extent, their close proximity to, a large and relatively dynamic neighbouring country (e.g. Nepal and Sri Lanka with India, and Myanmar with China) (UNDP, 2005a), rather than their membership of a plurilateral trade agreement. For example, India received over 60 per cent of Nepal\u2019s exports in 2004/05 as against about 10 per cent in 1991/92 (Koirala, 2007: table 6.1). In the particular case of India, the country\u2019s outward FDI to its low-income trading partners has been a very important factor in the expansion of trade with them. In other words, India has contributed to the expansion of the supply capacity of its partners. Otherwise, generally speaking, with the exception of Nepal, the lower the per capita income, the lower is their average growth rate of exports to group A. In short, despite the fact that, in general, tariffs and non-tariff barriers are lower in the first- and second- tier NIEs than in the low-income countries of the region, regional agreements have been associated with the expansion of exports of the former to the latter group, rather than the other way round. Various factors may be responsible for such discrepancies in the performance of the two groups of countries. Nevertheless, the lack of supply capabilities in manufactured goods, as indicated by the low MVA/GDP ratios in table 9, is definitely an important factor. Indeed, in all lower-income countries, the growth rates of GDP and MVA have also been lower than the average for group A. As market and supply dynamism is a very important factor in the expansion of regional trade, for the ease of reference, this paper summarizes the characteristics of the most dynamic regional market countries and the sluggish suppliers of regional exports (tables 10a and 10b). Market dynamic countries are those whose average annual growth rates of imports from group A exceeded 10 per cent during the period 1995-2005. Sluggish exporters are those with the corresponding average annual growth rates of exports of less than 10 per cent. The countries are ranked according to the degree of regional market dynamism (table 10a). China and India stand out in terms of the size of their trade and the degree of their market and supply dynamism, at both regional and world levels. In fact, China ranks first in all respects, far ahead of India not only in terms of its market dynamism but also because of the magnitude of its imports that is over five times greater than that of India. India exemplifies both a lower per capita income and a lower MVA/GDP ratio. Viet Nam is also a dynamic market, but is relatively smaller in size.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c74a79bb-891b-4d6c-b23c-bf3336117b43": {"__data__": {"id_": "c74a79bb-891b-4d6c-b23c-bf3336117b43", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-South Regionalism and Trade Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b6dd9272dade55a18566a9309ef9eec89f11d9604fa5e806df65bbeea9f8a42a"}, "2": {"node_id": "3e189425-84dd-4057-85e4-2ef8a1a9c77d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aad3838b2e431e643d4f6d67b11ac6eff7ab409c4607195a314d6220bbbcc3f9"}}, "hash": "b0414c70bdbe393060d7fed5b635c41df74a9e59734e3c15b8563bb85249b379", "text": "Viet Nam is also a dynamic market, but is relatively smaller in size.

Notes: See above. 26 In table 10b, countries are ranked according to ascending rate of growth of their regional exports. Except for Cambodia and Bangladesh, the growth rates of regional imports exceed those of their total im- ports. However, the situation of the lower-income countries differs from the others, because they are basically markets for others without enjoying the dynamism of the regional market for their exports. The growth rates of their regional exports are lower than those of their total exports. By contrast, other countries enjoy greater market dynamism for their export products than the lower-income countries. 27 This section discusses that intra-industry trade through production sharing, particularly in electrical and elec- tronic products, is the main source of dynamism in the expansion of regional trade in ESSEA. However, such trade has a number of drawbacks. Regional trade in these products is concentrated in the first-tier NIEs and, to some extent, in the second-tier NIEs, and China is the most dynamic market in this respect; India and other lower-income countries have not been integrated. India, unlike China, has focused on the software industry rather than hardware production and exports in the information technology (IT) sector. Further, the countries of the region have become vulnerable to the risks of interdependence and exposure to external shocks and international business cycles. Moreover, the second-tier NIEs need to upgrade their technological capabilities. Neither the integration of lower-income countries nor the technological upgrading of the second-tier NIEs is feasible through the operation of market forces alone. There is a need for policy initiatives by the govern- ments of the region in order to enhance regional cooperation for these purposes. Production sharing is a form of industrial collaboration and intra-industry trade whereby the process of production is fragmented into various parts and components that are produced in different countries, crossing borders to another country for assembly. Such a vertical production chain is facilitated by trade and investment liberalization and a reduction of transaction costs due to reduced costs of transportation and communication (Arndt, 2002). According to a World Bank study for the 1985\u20132001 period (Ng and Yeats, 2003), the sharp increase in intraregional trade in the East Asia region has been largely due to the expansion of intra-industry trade, which is characteristic of industrialized countries. Their intra-industry trade has expanded particularly in skill-, capital- and/or technology-intensive goods such as electronic products and other machinery and transport equipment (SITC 7)21.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ff382865-fe0a-4f11-86f0-59364c5fd815": {"__data__": {"id_": "ff382865-fe0a-4f11-86f0-59364c5fd815", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-South Regionalism and Trade Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cd6a55bf2e88ad96ea59b6f25be0bef3a6fef363f2d751597160735f5a4950e7"}, "2": {"node_id": "89609858-5ce0-42e3-805c-8c319fbf5419", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7f1c7733f1da07f4af16ae3cad822ae8aaae5834378b79f1766c9e2ae4c0d691"}}, "hash": "983c74b3fde81cc9110b2a7db29e013b84ae3671b1350caff5bf16d608217491", "text": "The first-tier NIEs (Hong Kong (SAR, China), the Republic of Korea, Singapore and Taiwan (Province of China)) undertook more intraregional trade than other countries, followed by the second-tier NIEs (e.g. Malaysia and Thailand).

The Ng and Yeats study (2003) also make note that the growth of demand from the East Asian region, also improved competitiveness and contributed to diversification of the export structure of the exporting countries by providing them with a larger market, thus scale economies, and this enabled them to enter into new lines of production. Growth, competitiveness and diversification contributed to the growing market share of East Asia in international trade in general (Ng and Yeats, 2003: 27 and table 10.2). However, these factors have been less present in the intraregional trade and competitiveness of the lower-income countries of ESSEA, regardless of whether or not they were members of a regional trade group such as ASEAN (ibid: table 5. Intra-industry trade, production sharing and regional trade 21 Machinery and equipment accounted for 19 of the 30 largest four-digit SITC products in intraregional exports, and another 8 items were in the category of light manufactured goods (Ng and Yeats, 2003: table12.1). 28 9.1). Capital-and technology-intensive goods (SITC 7 items) constituted the bulk of items (16 out of 23 items) in which East Asia increased its market share in intraregional trade. In 2001, production sharing through trade in P&C accounted for over 26 per cent of the intraregional trade in manufactured goods, excluding chemicals. Further, P&C of SITC 7 accounted for half of the growth of East Asian trade during the period 1990-2001, and electronic products constituted the bulk of such trade (Kozo, Sazanami and Yu Ching, 2006: 4-5). Apart from Japan, China, Taiwan (Province of China), Malaysia, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Hong Kong (SAR, China) the Philippines and Indonesia, were (in that order of importance) among the main exporters of P&C. Nevertheless, only China, Indonesia the Republic of Korea and Taiwan (Province of China) showed a positive trade balance in P&C (ibid: table 18.1). Others were net importers engaged in assembly operations. 5.1 Composition of imports of main dynamic markets and ASEAN This section examines the evolution of imports of non-fuel products in general, and the main imports of the most dynamic and largest markets of the region (i.e. China and India, and the Republic of Korea in ASEAN) and from the lower-income countries of the region. The lower-income countries include members of SAARC (ex- cluding India), together with Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Myanmar. As well, two small countries are included in this category: Maldives and Brunei Darussalam; although they are not low-income countries, they have low industrial capacity. Further, the section examines the main items of intra-ASEAN trade as well as main imports of China and ASEAN from India. The import items selected are those which account for at least 0.5 per cent of non-fuel imports of that country/group. 29 Table 11: Imports of non-fuel products of various countries and ASEAN-6 from ASEAN-6, 1995\u20132005* Non-fuel Average annual growth rate (1995\u20132005) Share Main electrical & electronic goods Share of various countries in imports of SITC 7 items of the country/group (%) Reporters Value (US$ million) Non- fuel Manf.

Except for ASEAN itself, SITC 7 items as a whole are the most dynamic products among the manufactured imports of various member countries. Further, they also account for the bulk of their imports of manufactured goods, particularly for China and ASEAN. More importantly, a limited number of electrical and electronic products - both finished and P&C (11 items) - feature in intra-industry trade. In fact, three items (SITCs 776, 752 and 759)22 figure among the main imports of all countries and the bloc included in the table; and five items (754, 772, 778, 741 and 716) are among the main import items of three countries and the ASEAN bloc. Finally, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines are the major sources of supply of these imports. Such a heavy dependence on a limited number of products and on China, is cause for concern. As men- tioned earlier, China heavily depends on third markets (especially Europe and the United States) for exports of its finished products (see below). Therefore, it is vulnerable to business cycles in these countries as well as to other external shocks. To explain further, only seven electrical and electronic products accounted for 58.3 per cent of imports of manufactured goods of China from ASEAN in 2005, amounting to nearly US$60 billion dollars. Moreover, two items (SITC 776 and 752 \u2013 thermionic & photo-cathode valves, and automatic data processing machines, respectively) accounted for over 38 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively, of total non- fuel imports of China from ASEAN in 2005 (table A.2). These two items together amounted to nearly US$34 billion, and their imports grew at an average annual rate of about 63 per cent during the period 1995-2005. Malaysia is the most vulnerable country in this respect as it accounts for nearly 56 per cent of China\u2019s imports of these two products (based on table A.2). Table 12 provides data on imports of dynamic countries and ASEAN from the lower-income/smaller countries of ESSEA. It also includes data on imports of China and ASEAN from India, and imports of non-fuel primary products.

As expected, the value of imports of non-fuel products from lower-income countries is not significant, and few manufactured products are imported from these countries. While their share of manufac- tured goods in the imports of the Republic of Korea was the largest, their growth rate was negative during the period 1995\u20132005. ASEAN\u2019s growth of imports of these products was also negligible. In other words, again, lower-income countries have not benefited from dynamism in the regional trade in manufactured goods in general, let alone in the market for IT products. Secondly, Pakistan, as the most industrialized country among the lower-income countries (see table 9), is a source of imports by China, the Republic of Korea and ASEAN, followed by Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. As the other lower-income countries have limited industrial capacity, they benefit little from the dynamic markets of the region. Even in the case of Bangladesh and Pakistan, imports have not been expanding rapidly, as mentioned in the previous section. Thirdly, the list of manufactured products imported from the lower-income/small countries covers very low-technology-intensive, light manufactured goods. For example, textile yarn and cotton fabrics account for over 45 per cent of China\u2019s imports of non-fuel products from lower-income countries. The picture for ASEAN and the Republic of Korea is not much different (tables A.6 and A.8). Even with regard to Pakistan, textile yarn constitutes nearly 70 per cent of China\u2019s imports from that country. 33 Fourthly, the performance of India stands out, as it is exceptional in certain respects. India is the largest and most dynamic importer of non-fuel products, including manufactured goods, from the lower-income countries. Indeed, not only are its imports larger than the imports of the whole of ASEAN from these countries, but also its structure of imports of manufactured goods is more diverse. Its imports include chemicals, textiles, processed ores and metals, paper and cement. Twenty-four items account for 24.2 per cent of its non-fuel imports and for over 75 per cent of its imports of manufactured good from the lower-income/small countries. Two neighbouring countries, Nepal and particularly Sri Lanka, enjoy important trade relations with India. They are the source of nearly 31 per cent and over 20 per cent, respectively, of imports of India from the lower- income/small countries (see table A.9) Proximity, cultural and political ties are important for such exceptional relations. However, they are not the only reason. Apart from wide product coverage of their bilateral trade agreements, India\u2019s outward FDI to these countries is an important factor in the expansion of trade of its trade with these countries, as mentioned before. By contrast, Bangladesh and Bhutan, among others, have neither similar bilateral trade agreements nor do they receive as much FDI from India. The S-S cooperation experience of Sri Lanka and Nepal would indicate not only the importance but also the feasibility of industrial collabora- tion among lower -income countries (discussed further in section 6 below). Fifthly, regional imports of two commodity items \u2013 ores and metals \u2013 from lower-income/small coun- tries have been expanding relatively fast in all cases, particularly in China\u2019s imports. Such an expansion has been due mainly to the growth in import volume, as prices of minerals and metals increased by an average annual rate of only about 3 per cent during the period 1995-2005 (based on UNCTAD, 2007c: table 6.1). There- fore, one area to be considered for industrial collaboration is in the processing of raw materials for increasing domestic value added (discussed further in section 6 below). Finally, the import structure of China and ASEAN from India is close to the pattern of imports of other countries/groups from lower-income/small countries, with a couple of differences. One difference is that the manufactured goods imported from India are slightly more sophisticated technologically. Another is that chemical products figure among the main import items from India: Five main chemical items accounted for about 7 per cent of the non-fuel imports and 15 per cent of the imports of manufactured goods from India in 2005.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "798b4e7f-ca5b-46f6-9add-0d43c767cdd6": {"__data__": {"id_": "798b4e7f-ca5b-46f6-9add-0d43c767cdd6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-South Regionalism and Trade Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8c1f3ac7f1585678fbc4623316d542c932c1472eef1444b6680f6c29becea411"}, "2": {"node_id": "1d31b6c5-54a9-4032-b57d-f3498f7c6667", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e39f5b46a3abfbc1c071fc250d336351bc7d3730db9c293257c7da63fa408f1b"}}, "hash": "9e50c46df00ab0eb529502e5252057a9389a7c787e43c4385460db9c92f79c33", "text": "By contrast, for reasons explained earlier, India does not seem to have entered into the network of production sharing in electrical and electronics goods, which have been important for the expansion of intraregional trade in East Asia, as discussed later in this study. 5.2 The role of China in regional production sharing China is regarded in the literature, as the leading country in terms of deepening of vertical intra-industry", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eeba8946-fd17-4972-90dc-0717d33728cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "eeba8946-fd17-4972-90dc-0717d33728cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-South Regionalism and Trade Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2dca32e26fe6f7c6456bffb28adabd9e2ac5257a5c0c6dc0807cb9b4c0de9d92"}, "3": {"node_id": "991f3399-3e01-4c20-b7e0-5d8423ee47e2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1fc2ea9c39be2d3a6c1e299648b6d1650bfc8d9591fa87ddc8c9ee423f02224b"}}, "hash": "64bf86b43de9b808bf0a109674d018c7a3af5145bebde563d559cbc1bd40f365", "text": "trade specialization (i.e. production sharing), and as the engine of export growth of the East Asian region (e.g. Kozo, Sazanami and Yu Ching, 2006; Lall and Albaladejo, 2004; Haltmaier et al., 2007). Trade in P&C, particu- larly electrical and electronic P&C, has been one of the most dynamic elements of China\u2019s trade in general23, including its regional trade with ESSEA. Exports and imports of P&C, necessary for the production of items covered by SITC 7, increased at average annual rates of 29.6 per cent and 18.5 per cent, respectively, over the period 1992/93\u20132004/05 (table 13). Such rates far exceeded the corresponding growth rate for exports of manufactured goods as a whole, which was about 20 per cent. The share of P&C in exports and imports of manufactured products was more than13.2 per cent and 20.5 per cent, respectively, in 2004/05.

China has become a net exporter of these main products. 23 For example, according to one estimate, in 2005, trade in P&C accounted for about 30 per cent of China\u2019s total exports and 41 per cent of its exports of machinery and equipment (Haltmaier et al., 2007: table 2; see also Shafaeddin, 2004). 34 Table 13: China\u2019s trade in parts and components of SITC 7, 1992\u20132005 Exports Imports Growth rate (%)* 1992/93 2004/05 1992/93 2004/05 X M Total : Value (US$ million) 3 458 77 950 10 243 79 317 29.6 18.5 Share in total manufactures (%) 5.3 13.2 15.6 20.5 Ten main items: Value (US$ million) 2 757 68 71 6 746 66 746 30.7 21.1 Share in parts and components (%) 79.7 88.1 65.8 84.1 Source: Author\u2019s calculations based on UNCOMTRADE database. * Average annual growth rate for the period 1992/93\u20132004/05. X = exports; M= imports. Data for the regional trade of China in P&C and their corresponding finished products are exhibited in table 14. In the table, the developing economies/regions are ranked according to the value of imports of P&C in 2006. The data also illustrates the total trade of China with ESSEA, excluding Hong Kong (SAR, China), because of its special situation as a major re-exporter. Even when Hong Kong (SAR, China) is excluded, China is not only a large market, but also a net importer of P&C and finished products from the region. Yet it is a net exporter to the rest of the world. Therefore, it acts as an export hub for the region. Secondly, such a large market does not benefit all countries to the same extent. Three groups of econo- mies can be distinguished in order of their importance as providers of the selected products. The first group is the Republic of Korea and Taiwan (Province of China) (NIEs). China\u2019s trade balance with these economies is significantly negative for both P&C as well as finished products. This is because they are major regional suppli- ers to China of sophisticated P&C that it does not produce domestically and requires for assembly of finished products, mostly for export. They also export some sophisticated finished consumer goods and capital equip- ment to China for its own domestic consumption. The second group consists of four ASEAN members: Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand (ASEAN-4). China is a net exporter of P&C to these countries, except to Singapore, and a net importer of finished products, mainly from Singapore. In 2005, imports of six electronic products (SITCs 776,752, 764, 771, 716 and 751 in this order of importance) accounted for 77 per cent of China\u2019s imports from the \u201crest of ASEAN\u201d of which SITC 776 accounted for over 60 per cent.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "991f3399-3e01-4c20-b7e0-5d8423ee47e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "991f3399-3e01-4c20-b7e0-5d8423ee47e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-South Regionalism and Trade Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2dca32e26fe6f7c6456bffb28adabd9e2ac5257a5c0c6dc0807cb9b4c0de9d92"}, "2": {"node_id": "eeba8946-fd17-4972-90dc-0717d33728cf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "64bf86b43de9b808bf0a109674d018c7a3af5145bebde563d559cbc1bd40f365"}}, "hash": "1fc2ea9c39be2d3a6c1e299648b6d1650bfc8d9591fa87ddc8c9ee423f02224b", "text": "The trade relations of China with the rest of ASEAN are dominated by trade in electronics with the Philippines, rather than with lower-income members of that regional group (table A.6).

Three characteristics of the country have attracted FDI: its proximity to other East Asian countries involved in the vertical production system, its ease of regional transport due to its vast coastal areas, and its low-wage and skilled human-power. Japan and the United States have been its main markets, but its exports of high-tech products to China have also increased significantly, from 1.3 per cent of its total exports in 2000 to 13 per cent in 2005 (Haltmaier et al., 2005: 32-36). Whether such a rapid expansion is due to the involvement of China\u2019s FDI or not requires further investiga- tion. The third group consists of lower-income country members of SAARC and India, from which China imports only a small amount. Finally, even when Hong Kong (SAR, China) is excluded, over 60 per cent of China\u2019s exports go to developed countries: Japan (7 per cent) and mainly the United States and other countries (57 per cent)24. In other words, China could be vulnerable to changes in the market situation in developed countries for exports of its finished products, and risks transmitting these changes to other countries of the ESSEA region through its demand for P&C and finished goods, which amount to nearly US$30 billion and US$100 billion, respec- tively. The study turns to this issue after explaining the role of the market and government in the expansion of production sharing below. 5.3 Misconception about the role of market forces Has production sharing developed through the operation of market forces? Can market forces alone provide the necessary impetus for the expansion of regional trade of lower-income countries through expansion of intra-industry trade, or are proactive policies required? There is a common misconception about the role of the market in the expansion of regional trade and production sharing in East Asia. It is maintained that the expansion of regional trade in East Asia has been market-driven (e.g. Kawai and Wignaraja, 2007: 3-4). Two points should be emphasized in this regard. First, while currently some arm\u2019s length intra-industry trade does take place among the countries of the region, the bulk of it is intra-firm trade that does not go through the market (Isoga, Morishita and Ruffer, 2002: 52). Second, such trade was mostly policy-driven; that is, it was initially a result of changes in FDI policies of the East Asian governments and the Government of Japan. The combination of these two resulted in the development of fragmented vertical production and distribution chains and production sharing mainly among the first- and second-tier NIEs and Japanese companies (Ando and Kimura: 2003). The Japanese firms initially played an important role in integrating the East Asian region. While US-owned firms based in the region produced mostly for export to the United States, Japanese firms produced mainly for export to other countries, including within region (Isoga, Morishita and Ruffer, 2002).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "411ff7ef-ec7d-4dab-9d82-1bd7f071ee22": {"__data__": {"id_": "411ff7ef-ec7d-4dab-9d82-1bd7f071ee22", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-South Regionalism and Trade Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8cb6c46dc0485c634ab0c85eb84240839a4eb4f0f86bd7c611af203fe350f18f"}, "2": {"node_id": "d389aeb5-225f-4f92-a3bb-074ba3721a64", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4c7bcc22ed9fcb5aba5caca802c13b6930e8e89e90d3ebc2745e013548202c09"}}, "hash": "23ff75121b0de2766ba0f3ce84e9d2b9a839053437a4c84cd9f73a5640bc0963", "text": "Furthermore, since the mid-1980s most governments of the region have been pursuing a new development strategy for efficient and beneficial use of FDI in the process of their economic development and industrialization.

Throughout the period, capacity- building of the local firms was emphasized (Lall and Albaladejo, 2004). 24 It is not easy to judge with certainty the impact on the direction of trade of re-exports of goods imported from China by Hong Kong (SAR, China), as there is a large discrepancy between the data on exports of the relevant items from China to Hong Kong (SAR, China) and the corresponding data on imports of Hong Kong (SAR, China) from China. Such discrepancy cannot be explained by differences in prices of cost, insurance and freight (c.i.f.) and free on board (f.o.b.) of the related products. On the basis of published data, however, the picture of the \u201ceffective\u201d direction of exports of China does not seem to change much. 37 Subsequently, China adopted fairly similar policies to other countries. However, the differences are that the initial, significant contributions of inward FDI came from ethnic Chinese investors of foreign origin or investors from Chinese territories (mainly Hong Kong, (SAR, China) and Taiwan (Province of China)) and Singapore (Huang, 2002). Even after the country\u2019s accession to WTO, resource allocation has largely been governed by government policies (Haltmaier et al., 2007: 24). To explain further, the fragmented vertical production chain25 required, inter alia, specialization to ben- efit from the economies of scale and firm-specific assets of the local or affiliated firms in different countries. Initially, the Japanese Government and firms played an important role in the development of the chain and the network. The appreciation of the Japanese yen after the Plaza Accord in 1985 was influential in changing the Japanese Government\u2019s policy towards outward FDI26. This change of policy, by coincidence, took place more or less around the same time as East Asian governments changed their policies towards inward FDI. Japanese firms created affiliates in East Asia in order to relocate their labour-intensive industries in the region and benefit from availability of low-wage, semi-skilled labour, with the added advantage of geographical proximity. According to Gaulier, Lemoine and Unal-Kesenci (2005: 13-15), \u201cIn 2000, 3,773 out of 27,655 firms located in Japan\u2026 have [a total of] 18,943 foreign affiliates. Among them 2,994 firms have 10,224 affiliates in East Asia.\u201d Seventy five per cent of these affiliates were in the manufacturing sector, but there were also non-manufacturing affiliates (ibid: 13-15). The important point, however, is that, influenced partly by policies of the host governments, particularly on local content requirements and joint ventures (Amsden, 1989), the Japanese affiliates in East Asia purchased the bulk of their inputs \u2013 both goods and services \u2013 from the local markets and local firms (over 41 per cent) and from other East Asian countries (about 21 per cent) (ibid: 16). This process contributed to intraregional trade, an increase in local value added and the development of the capabilities of local firms. Similarly, although their production was export oriented, the regional market also absorbed a significant proportion of goods. The development of the regional pattern of industrialization in East Asia resembled the flying geese model initially seen in Japan\u2019s domestic development (Akamatsu, 1961; Kasahara, 2004). However, the geese did not fly automatically, either in Japan or at the regional level. Government investment in areas such as education, training, technological infrastructure and R&D played an important role in the development of domestic capabilities in Japan and in other East Asian NIEs as well as China (Malhotra, 2006: 4-8; Fan and Watanabe, 2006; Lall, 2004: 14\u201324). The trickle-down effects of the process have since reached the second-tier NIEs (Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, and, to some extent, the Philippines), but so far not enough to up- grade their industrial structure significantly. In other words, the trickle-down effects have not had a sufficient impact on their technological capabilities. Second, the lower-income countries of the region were not part of this flying geese process before the recent wave of trade and investment liberalization and changes in international rules.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0563799b-5940-41cc-b9f1-8c833455c831": {"__data__": {"id_": "0563799b-5940-41cc-b9f1-8c833455c831", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-South Regionalism and Trade Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "80451267e7c37c27d94e09b011446cc9094af1fd77ac1b8c90860f6bd67c5150"}, "2": {"node_id": "e2c98260-0e4a-4d6e-b4af-555ecdc6e8d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9151fe9dd5f2af1efe3e2f049b2cdb8062dcdfc9e9a9e2564c3581266d821138"}}, "hash": "73e7fb2657b4beddf36a6803e49157dd04f58a706e4d80a198f2ec56569da0f2", "text": "Since the early 1980s, these changes have considerably limited the policy space available to these countries to follow the kind of government interventions that had enabled industrial upgrading in Japan and the NIEs.

Nevertheless, Chinese firms still play an important role in exports of manufactured goods. For example, in 2002 about a quarter of firms involved were Chinese and anther 29 per cent were in the form of joint ventures (Gaulier, Lemoine and Unal-Kesenci, 2005: table 8). Further, the Chinese Govern- ment pursued a policy of expanding supply dynamic and demand dynamic products, such as IT products, in addition to its export of labour-intensive items. Supply dynamic products are those with high productivity and important externalities, while demand dynamic products are those that enjoy high income elasticity of demand in international trade (Shafaeddin and Pizarro, 2007: sections IV.a and IV.b; Rodrik, 2006). The strategy followed by China and other East Asian economies has contrasted with, for example, Mexico and most other Latin American countries that have relied on market forces and regional trade ar- rangements alone. Mexico, for instance, imports P&C from the United States and exports the assembled goods mainly back to the United States. However, it is not part of a production sharing network and does not follow similar policies to those of East Asian governments (Gallagher et al., 2008). 5.4 Vulnerability and risks of interdependence The third problem related to the emerging vertical production system in East Asia is the increased interdepen- dence of the countries of the region and thus their vulnerability to the risks of transmission of the boom and bust cycles, particularly from a large trading partner such as China, to other countries. As mentioned earlier, China depends on the markets of developed countries in Europe and the United States for exports of its finished IT products and for over half of its exports. Thus, it is subject to the risks of business cycles in these countries. Moreover, the experience of the Asian financial crisis of 1997\u20131998 proved that an economic crisis in one country can easily spread to other countries, leading to a slowdown of economic growth. The financial problem, which started in Thailand, led to the Asian currency crisis that affected most of the East Asian countries. A shortage of foreign exchange and large-scale and abrupt outward movements of capital and currency had an adverse im- pact on the real sectors of the region\u2019s economies. The high degree of interdependence of countries in the ESSEA region, except for most countries of the Indian subcontinent (table A.17) is cause for concern, as the frequency and intensity of boom and bust cycles in the world economy has increased over the past three decades (Aky\u00fcz, forthcoming)28.

In addition, exchange rate, financial and macroeconomic policies, inter alia, of one country may have important effects on the economies 28 Some argue that a certain decoupling of the emerging markets is taking place led by China and the United States (see, for example, \u201cThe Decoupling Debate\u201d, The Economist, 6 March 2008). It is true that S-S trade expansion has reduced the share of the United States and other industrialized countries as markets for developing-country exports. However, it is too soon to speak of decoupling. For example, in the case of China, the share of industrialized countries in China\u2019s exports declined, from 56.3 per cent in 2000 to 51.6 per cent in 2006, although the share of the United States, which is facing an economic slowdown, in fact increased slightly, from 20.9 per cent to 21 per cent (based on IMF, 2007: 924). Further, the export/GDP ratio of China increased from 25.9 to 33 per cent during the period 2000\u20132005, and is likely to have increased further since then. According to The Economist (ibid.), China\u2019s exports to the United States account for 8 per cent of China\u2019s GDP. Therefore, every 10 per cent decline in its exports to the United States alone will lead directly to a reduction of its GDP by 0.8 per cent. Also, the contagion effects of the United States recession on the world economy will essentially have further indirect effects. Exports to industrialized countries alone account for nearly 20 per cent of China\u2019s GDP, and the worldwide recession potentially would have an impact on China\u2019s exports to other regions. After all, the intraregional trade of the EU accounts for over 60 per cent of its exports. Yet the last time around (during the global recession of the early 2000s), it was not immune to the United States\u2019 recession. Moreover, if the financial crisis caused by the sub-prime problem persists and spreads to other industrialized countries and developing regions, it would further affect trade through its impact on global economic activities. 39 of other countries of the ESSEA region. In fact, there has been an increase in the correlation of business cycles between economies across the East Asian region since the mid-1980s (Zebregs, 2004: 14). Secondly, an important factor affecting the stability of their economic activities is change in the currency and exchange rate system. Currently, most countries of the region have floating exchange rates pegged to the United States dollar. China still pursues a fixed exchange rate pegged to the dollar with a band. One issue is the impact on exports of agricultural products and raw materials of low-income countries if China were to switch from a fixed exchange rate system to a floating rate. These countries are more vulnerable to changes in prices of primary commodities due to their low level of development and dependence on exports of these products. Another issue is the effect of shifting from a currency system pegged to the dollar to a system pegged to a basket of currencies. There are suggestions that a currency basket pegged to the currencies of East Asian economies or adoption of a single regional currency may have a stabilizing effect on the economies of the countries in the region. However, the result of one study (Kamada and Takagawa, 2005) demonstrates that the impact of pegging to a basket of currencies would be ambiguous, depending on the type of economic instability or shock. The ambiguity also applies to the impact of a switch to a floating exchange rate of the Chinese currency. Yet another risk is the possibility of protectionism by the United States due to its growing trade imbalance with China. It could have negative effects on exports and production in China with adverse knock-on effects on the exports of other countries in the region (Kozo, Sazanami and Yu Ching, 2006:12). In the literature, reference is also made to another source of risk facing the exporters of P&C to China: The substitution of imported intermediate products by domestic production as the country increases value added in its exports (see, for example, Lall, 2004; Humphrey and Schmitz, 2006). In fact, China, unlike Mexico, has been rapidly increasing the value added in its assembly operations (Shafaeddin and Pizarro, 2007). Yet perhaps this risk is overstated.

In fact, China has been improving its \u201crevealed comparative advantage\u201d, not only in exports but also in the production of technology-intensive products in relation to labour-intensive goods. Nevertheless, it remains a massive producer of labour-intensive products (Shafaeddin and Pizarro, 2007) and may take a long time before shifting to production of higher technological products sufficiently to leave their production to the lower-in- come countries. Additional research is needed to study the impact of the dynamics of economic changes in China on export opportunities for lower-income countries29. In any case, international trade and investment rules have changed. Therefore, as mentioned before, lower-income countries of the region may no longer be able to benefit from the flying geese pattern, as did the Republic of Korea, Taiwan (Province of China) and the second-tier NIEs. In short, regional trade has expanded rapidly in ESSEA mainly through intra-industry trade in the form of production sharing in electrical and electronic products. Such expansion has led to three evolving issues which require close attention by the countries concerned: the lack of integration of lower-income countries; the need for technological upgrading of the second-tier NIEs; and the necessity for insurance against risks of vulner- ability of the countries involved in production sharing due to their dependence on external markets for finished products and on their own interdependence on trade in P&C. These issues need to be dealt with by proactive policies, including expanding the scope of regional cooperation beyond trade agreements, as explained in the next section. 29 Some observers also refer to the fragility of regionalism in East Asia because of the lack of disciplines in bilateral trade relations and the absence of a mechanism for dispute settlement. As mentioned before, they, therefore, recommend binding unilateral tariff cuts in the WTO (Baldwin, 2006). Experience shows that this risk is also overstated, and that binding tariff cuts in WTO would result in the loss of policy space vis-\u00e0-vis third parties. 40 Strengthening regional cooperation should cover, inter alia, four main areas: industrial collaboration among lower-income countries for developing their productive supply capabilities; provision of necessary assistance to these countries by more advanced member countries of the region; cooperation among second-tier NIEs, China and India on R&D for upgrading their technological capacities; and enhancing financial cooperation in the region in order to reduce their vulnerability, possibly by establishing a regional South Bank. Furthermore, although not within the scope of this paper, the region should seriously consider extending cooperation in trade in services. To elaborate on these points, the characteristics of the countries of the region need to be taken into account. 6.1 Industrial and technological collaboration Three main categories of economies can be distinguished in the ESSEA region, based on their different levels of development and technological capabilities. The first group comprises the first-tier NIEs: the Republic of Korea, Taiwan (Province of China), and to some extent Singapore. The first two economies are at the frontiers of technology, especially in electrical and electronic industries. The second group consists of the second-tier NIEs and other emerging economies with dynamic industrial supply capacity such as the ASEAN-4, China, and, to some extent, India and the Philippines. The third group consists of lower-income countries, whose economies are based on production and export of primary commodities, with low manufacturing capacity. Some countries, such as Bangladesh, have only a limited capacity to export a few light manufactured goods. Most members of SAARC and low-income members of ASEAN fall in this group. The first group has significant industrial and technological capabilities, but depends on imports of raw materials. The economies in this group provide opportunities for the expansion of trade amongst themselves. They are also interested in seeking markets in the other countries of the region and in assuring security of the supply of raw materials. They are involved in production sharing through FDI, and particularly in exports of technology-intensive P&C to the second group. This second group uses P&Cs for assembly operations to produce final products for sale in the regional market and/or for export to other countries. As market seekers, they are interested in the development of the regional market, therefore, it is in their own interest to pay attention to the development needs of the lower-income countries, by providing them with adjustment as- sistance for development of their industrial supply capabilities, as explained later.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "380e3231-a22c-4ea2-932c-9c03f6e71bb2": {"__data__": {"id_": "380e3231-a22c-4ea2-932c-9c03f6e71bb2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-South Regionalism and Trade Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5d9354902767e667d7f9d83fd5cc279d89bf6df220a3d3cb5bd042aa31684389"}, "2": {"node_id": "788d3962-14db-4d50-a23e-34cb94b1ffb5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e3609fe00ba99e116dcd5fa79deb6178a32204b8517a42d84fcf3ce94be7d23e"}}, "hash": "220724e9c277bc5b14ec18fee19fe388058876863f6013f55fa6030af562f1ec", "text": "The second group\u2019s crucial need is for the development of the technological and skills capabilities neces- sary for upgrading of their industrial structure, which requires", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "23e41f32-7039-4a1b-9ce7-c00bfbc7b9fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "23e41f32-7039-4a1b-9ce7-c00bfbc7b9fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-South Regionalism and Trade Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b893b2235aef5905fc9e9d0ad65788a377ea9740ba14d7675b99698d0b966cf3"}, "3": {"node_id": "a9868c48-cd8d-4598-a776-5669b9f81d1f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c0295f71c26b1663278e89a4b1045f1f97e0b52d3cc4a432710e3ae46b39dba6"}}, "hash": "da6d62675f9d9727f841f2494a315175260e831bf2a86341b1664168e7dc6c7c", "text": "R&D, among other things. Regional cooperation can help them attain their objective through division of labour and specialization in R&D and in skills-based industrial collaboration. Further, the countries of this group need to coordinate their policies for intensifying the technological spillover of FDI by the developed countries and by the first group. Attempts have been made by ASEAN and China to cooperate in research on information and communication technology (ICT) activities for which they have envisaged the establishment of an R&D centre for telecommunications equip- 6. Policy initiatives for enhanced regional cooperation in ESSEA 41 ment. Nevertheless, with the exception of the Republic of Korea, Singapore and to some extent China, R&D expenditure in ESSEA countries is small, not only in lower-income countries, but also in the second-tier NIEs (table 15). If those countries are excluded, Hong Kong (SAR, China) ranks higher among the ESSEA economies, as demonstrated in the table in terms of the ratio of R&D expenditure to GDP and per capita R&D expenditure. Yet these figures are lower than those of Italy and Spain, which note the lowest figures among developed countries (table 15). The lack of skills and financial and technical resources prevents individual countries from undertaking research in a large number of areas separately at the same time. Large countries, such as China and India, are in a better position than others to develop their technological capabilities independently. For example, India has succeeded to some extent in the particular case of pharmaceuticals. Nevertheless, even for these countries the R&D/GDP ratios are far below those of developed countries, partly because of a lack of requisite skills. Therefore, division of labour and specialization among the countries concerned could help all countries of the group in advancing their common technological capabilities.

The third group has scarcity problems, including in finance, skills, infrastructure, organization and en- trepreneurship. Its crucial problem is the expansion of industrial supply capacity. The first and second groups of countries mentioned above could constitute sources of supply for exports to lower-income countries. They may also absorb their exports of primary products through trade arrangements. However, market forces alone 42 will not be of much help in providing them with opportunities for trade expansion in industrial products because they lack the necessary supply capacity. As for FDI, outward investment by NIEs is directed mainly to China and the ASEAN-4, rather than to lower-income countries (Isoga and Shibanuma, 2000). Policies of regional investors do not favour low-income countries30. In the case of the third group, therefore, more concerted efforts and proactive policies are required for exploiting the benefits of division of labour and specialization through industrial collaboration among the countries concerned. The rationale behind this proposal is that individual countries do not have sufficient resources to produce a large number of products. They can enter into an agreement for industrial collabora- tion whereby each of the countries allocates scarce resources in a way that enables each of them to specialize in the production of a limited number of finished goods and/or P&C and exchange them with each other.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a9868c48-cd8d-4598-a776-5669b9f81d1f": {"__data__": {"id_": "a9868c48-cd8d-4598-a776-5669b9f81d1f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-South Regionalism and Trade Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b893b2235aef5905fc9e9d0ad65788a377ea9740ba14d7675b99698d0b966cf3"}, "2": {"node_id": "23e41f32-7039-4a1b-9ce7-c00bfbc7b9fd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "da6d62675f9d9727f841f2494a315175260e831bf2a86341b1664168e7dc6c7c"}}, "hash": "c0295f71c26b1663278e89a4b1045f1f97e0b52d3cc4a432710e3ae46b39dba6", "text": "Initially, trade among the countries involved could take place through the exchange of the new products produced even though they entail high production costs.

It is worth mentioning that UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo has studied prospects for diversification of the export structure of a number of LDCs in the region (UNDP, 2007). To organize industrial collaboration schemes among those countries as well as other lower-income countries, the UNDP may consider linking these schemes to the diversification strate- gies of individual countries. In such a programme, regional FDI by countries like China, India, the ASEAN-4 and Asian NIEs may also be involved. The processing of raw materials before exporting to the importing countries of the region could be one possibility, as mentioned before, but it is not the only one. The essential point is that for the development of the industrial capacity of individual countries, specialization and division of labour are crucial. Division of labour here means not only sharing the market, but also specializing in production of dif- ferent products, as mentioned before. For this purpose, and to be able to target FDI, individual lower-income countries need to adopt industrial strategies as well as coordinate their strategies. The feasibility, modalities and choice of products for industrial collaboration and diversification require further research by considering specific countries for case studies. The experiences of SAARC, the South Asian Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA) and other low-income coun- tries indicate that rules of origin are also an impediment to the expansion of intraregional trade (Kawai and Wignaraja, 2007: 15; UNDP, 2005a: 58-62)31. Different trade agreements contain different rules of origin clauses that can create confusion for exporters and producers. In the particular case of SAARC, the cumbersome rules of origin are not conducive to increased production and trade. Such rules need to be changed and harmo- nized. If the GSTP Agreement became operational, it could contribute to the harmonization of rules of origin among the member countries of SAARC, which are contracting parties to the GSTP Agreement (Annex 3). Often, there are political problems in securing agreements among the member countries of a trade or economic group concerning the division of labour (i.e. production of different products or undertaking different research). Each country may have its own individual interest as against the common interest of the group32. Understanding by the partners of the ultimate benefits of such arrangements for individual countries 30 There are indications that when government policies favour regional cooperation (e.g. through investment), the lower-income countries benefit considerably. For example, in the case of India, S-S trade expansion has been influenced by investment cooperation with the partner countries in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly low-income countries such as Nepal and Sri Lanka (Wishwanath, 2007: 2). 31 See also www.centad.org/events_15.asp:p.7. 32 The experience of the D-8 countries in industrial collaboration is telling. D-8 is a loose arrangement for economic collaboration between eight Asian and North African Muslim countries: Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan and Turkey. 43 requires dialogue and the dissemination of information and knowledge. The EU has extensive experience not only in industrial collaboration (e.g. aerospace), but also in many areas of research (e.g. nuclear). Drawing on its experiences would be useful. The geographical proximity and existence of large coastal areas in many South and South-East Asian countries enable the provision of easier and cheaper transport infrastructure than in many other developing countries. Note that distance-related trade cost is a major impediment to S-S trade. For example, it is estimated that a \u201c10% increase in distance tends to reduce North-North trade by about 10%, [but] the comparable figure for South-South trade is 17%...\u201d (Kowaski and Shepherd, 2006: 6). Further, the distance effect is stronger for trade among low-income countries (ibid: 7). 6.2 Adjustment assistance While helpful, proximity, trade agreements and industrial collaboration alone are not sufficient. Arrangements have to be made for the division of labour in required back-up services (see below), export credit, information and the development of the necessary infrastructure, training and skills development, and business coopera- tion through chambers of commerce.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "75b1401a-fd12-47af-b2dd-b33d881d58b9": {"__data__": {"id_": "75b1401a-fd12-47af-b2dd-b33d881d58b9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-South Regionalism and Trade Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b9d4fdfc54ac7675b71165edece37bf130aa00b37bc185e952ada3124c43a283"}, "2": {"node_id": "6202d3c4-33bb-4e9a-a123-d70cc056c333", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e4eb4059d37cd02201757f34f98b9f05b2cf18ea16ebd78b74d960edbd072dcf"}}, "hash": "f05b74846c125c2c064ba9732a136ca16b5f202493c9f70f9aade64b9e16901f", "text": "Moreover, as lower-income countries suffer from resource scarcity, there is a need for the provision of adjustment assistance by the more advanced countries of the ESSEA region to the lower-income countries, particularly through ASEAN+3.

Such assistance is, in particular, more relevant for ASEAN and for ASEAN+3 than for SAARC, as the members of ASEAN are more heterogeneous than the members of SAARC. SAARC has a compensation scheme for LDCs for the loss of revenues from reduced import duties resulting from trade liberalization. Such a scheme is helpful from a financial point of view, but the resources provided to the LDCs may not necessarily be used for the development of new production capacity as they are intended to compensate for the loss of general government revenues. The adjustment assistance should be designed in such a way as to contribute to the supply capacity of the country. Further research is required on the modalities and mechanism of such assistance. Perhaps a pilot project could be considered for implementation by ASEAN for its lower-income country members. 6.3 Cooperation in services Although discussion of services is beyond the scope and terms of reference of this study, it needs to be touched upon briefly. Services can affect the expansion of South-South trade directly or indirectly in a num- ber of ways. Three kinds of services may be distinguished: producer services, back-up services and services which enter international trade directly. Producer services are those used in the production of other goods or services, such as engineering, quality management, general management, training, finance and banking, internal transport, procurement and R&D. Therefore, they contribute indirectly to the productive capacity of an exporting country. Back-up services, or trade-related services are those that facilitate trade in goods and/or other services, such as insurance, export credit and trade facilitation. Finally, certain services enter into international trade directly, such as travel-related services, insurances, financial services, commercial presence and movements of natural persons. These three types of services often overlap, and S-S cooperation in the services sector should operate in such a way that it contributes to the development of productive capacity as well as the facilitation of S-S regional trade. More often, however, liberalization of trade in services \u2013 the third category \u2013 is the focus of attention, rather than S-S cooperation in the services sector for the expansion of productive supply capacity and trade in general. 44 Unfortunately, data on different types of services are not available, nor are data on intraregional trade in services. Rough estimates of regional trade in services and data on trade in services of the countries in the ESSEA region indicate that not only is existing intraregional trade in services relatively significant, but also that there is room for further expansion. The share of regional trade in services in total trade in services of develop- ing countries in the Asia-Pacific is substantially higher than that of other developing regions (table 16). The region is also responsible for the bulk of S-S trade in services. Nevertheless, significant potential for further expansion of trade in services seems to exist in the ESSEA region as indicated in table 17. Again, China and India exhibit large and significant growth rates in trade in services. India, in particular, also shows a larger ratio of services exports/GDP than China33 with a growing surplus in its trade in services. China, a number of NIEs (Indonesia, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan (Province of China) and Thailand), and especially most lower-income countries (Bangladesh, Brunei Darussalam, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka)34, show a significant negative trade balance in their trade in services. This implies that perhaps they rely on third parties for their imports of services. Liberalization of trade in services, particularly mode 3 (mainly through commercial presence), is recommended for the expansion of trade in services (OECD, 2006). While liberaliza- tion of trade in services could help expand trade among countries in the region that have adequate supply capacities, it would not be sufficient for the development of supply capacity in the lower-income countries. ASEAN and SAFTA embarked on liberalization of trade in services in 1995 and 2006, respectively. ASEAN has also envisaged certain cooperation schemes for strengthening infrastructure in transport, energy and tele- communications (UNCTAD, 2007d: 9, 15). Further cooperation for development of supply capacity in producer services and trade-related services, particularly among lower-income countries is also required.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5adc064c-8ba2-4be5-9765-79031fcc45c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "5adc064c-8ba2-4be5-9765-79031fcc45c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-South Regionalism and Trade Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a6de23ae0022baf1364b78f271ca9821375dcee9fdc7473a9c210ac5df6b132f"}, "2": {"node_id": "11efbe25-a552-45f6-87bd-25f20abd9854", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b0cd0a77ae357adf5933626ce8d4d87b37b719969234dc19d0ef56bf76303b58"}}, "hash": "f8f1a6273704691739b3657ee728214f2b92c970b922d4bd1fc20c7016da5548", "text": "Table 16: Estimated share of regional trade in services of developing regions, 2002 (%) Asia-Pacific Africa Latin America Intraregional/total trade 50 17 12 Intraregional/S-S trade 94 57 71 Source: UNCTAD, 2007d, based on OECD sources. 33 Note that while the export/GDP ratio of China is significantly higher than that of India, for services the opposite is true. 34 Although", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ed9ef22b-b2f5-4bff-87be-ba72fa9f37ae": {"__data__": {"id_": "ed9ef22b-b2f5-4bff-87be-ba72fa9f37ae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-South Regionalism and Trade Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1c796c7f1746d5a2dd21d6ebf3e04db111ff15ca29b76a63fa20be257de85978"}, "3": {"node_id": "225f5714-f00f-43fa-a8bc-c804157104da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "efe114c7834b58f3ec6b9a63af495f8159e995591148904d21af31b12d90ea03"}}, "hash": "763fca9e0476faef6c643aa6deec3b6d0d35a749f358e59a25744d8a205894b3", "text": "data are not readily available to permit an analysis, the surplus trade of Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Mal- dives is most probably due to the contribution of travel services. 45 Table 17: Trade in services of selected countries/economies in ESSEA, 2006 Economy Total value of trade, 2006 Average growth rate, 1995-2006 (%) Service exports/ GDP ratio (%)7 (US$ million) Exports Imports Balance Exports Imports China 91 999 100 833 -8 834 15 14 4.6 India 76 645 63 427 13 218 23 17 9.6 Hong Kong (SAR, China) 4 72 733 36 560 36 173 10 5 42.1 Singapore 59 020 61 892 -2 872 8 11 60.4 Republic of Korea 51 873 70 636 -18 763 7 9 6.6 Taiwan (Province of China) 29 272 33 661 -4 389 6 3 8.5 Thailand 24 129 32 052 -7 923 3 5 13.7 Malaysia 21 266 23 268 -2 003 4 3 16.3 Indonesia 12 784 25 362 -12 578 8 6 4.5 Philippines 5 403 6 072 -

However, this was opposed by the international financial institutions and some developed countries. Subsequently, ASEAN+3 agreed to two financial initiatives35. One was the Chiang Mai Initiative, (a kind of \u201cASEAN, swap arrangement\u201d), and a network of bilateral financial swap arrangements among ASEAN+3 countries. The aim of this scheme, which has been in operation since 2000, is to provide liquidity to member countries in the event of short-term bal- ance of payments deficits. Another scheme is the Asian Bond Market Initiative launched in 2003, which aims at strengthening the Asian bond market to enable investors to raise long-term capital without currency and maturity risks. The member countries have also created an Economic Review Policy Dialogue mechanism and 35 See UNCTAD, 2007a, chapter V for a summary. 46 a Technical Working Group and Research Group for Economic and Financial Monitoring. Their objective is to strengthen regional capacity for surveillance of capital markets in East Asia to monitor short-term capital flows and enhance financial cooperation with the aim of promoting financial stability in the region. These initiatives are useful but not sufficient. Despite various proposals for reform of the international financial architecture since the Asian financial crisis, no significant progress has been made in this respect by developed countries. Furthermore, the risk of spread of the United States sub-prime crisis to other countries is another reminder of the weakness of the international financial system.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) correctly recommends the need for \u201cstronger regional cooperation in monitoring and regulating financial markets\u201d (ADB Newsletter, 22 November)36. The successful experience of Malaysia in adopting capital controls during the Asian financial crisis sig- nals the need for the harmonization of policies relating to the degree and modalities of capital controls in the region. Further research is required on this issue. For instance, Malaysia introduced a complex capital control system that involved not only movement of capital and exchange rate policies, but also efficient monetary and fiscal policies aimed at reflating the economy. Strong State and administrative support, dynamism in policy implementation as well as public support were among the factors contributing to its success; so was consider- ation of Malaysia\u2019s specific situation (Epstein, Grabel and Jomo, 2003: Rodrik, 1998 and 2002). Another area for further research concerns a proposal to establish a regional South Bank, possibly with two windows for short- and long-term lending, as well as for consolidating the Chiang Mai and Asian Bond initiatives within this institution. In an internal study for UNCTAD in the early 1980s, Avramovic proposed the establishment of a South Bank by developing countries as a group, but it was never implemented. More recently, in early December 2007, a number of Latin American countries established a regional bank for Latin America. Drawing on their experience, the ESSEA countries might wish to study the feasibility and modalities of a similar regional bank. Finally, although not discussed in this paper, the region should guard against its vulnerability to a pos- sible energy crisis. Cooperation on energy issues could include development of facilities for a strategic energy reserve to reduce risk associated with the interruption of energy supplies. 36 See http://www.adb.org/media. 47 This paper has examined regional South-South trade and cooperation in East, South and South-East Asian countries (ESSEA) with the aim of: providing an economic rationale for South-South trade; shedding some light on the extent and pattern of South-South trade in the ESSEA region; examining the dynamic forces behind the expansion of such trade; explaining its vulnerabilities; and proposing policies for enhancing and strengthening regional cooperation in ESSEA. It has shown how regional trade has expanded rapidly in ESSEA, to the extent that the region has become not only the most dynamic area in S-S trade, but also a major force in international trade in gen- eral. Nevertheless, S-S trade in ESSEA highlights three main characteristics that point to the need for policy initiatives for enhancing and strengthening regional cooperation in order to further enhance economic development of the region. First, the expansion of intraregional trade has been concentrated among the relatively more advanced developing countries of ESSEA, and the lower-income countries have benefited less. Second, the nature of regional trade expansion in ESSEA is such that it has increased the vulnerability of ESSEA countries to external factors, particularly those countries that are involved in production sharing. Third, the countries of the region are not homogeneous. Hence, although they have some common interests, their individual situations diverge: Lower-income countries have supply capacity problem, while others that have relatively larger supply capacity are market seekers. Although an arrangement for industrial collaboration among lower-income countries is needed, they also need to be assisted by market seekers to adjust and develop their supply capabilities. More specifically, the study has sought to prove that while the neo-liberal argument against S-S trade is not justified, critics of this argument have not so far provided a strong economic rationale in favour of active expansion of such trade. Developing-country policy-makers have paid lip service to the need for promoting S-S trade in various international forums, and scholars who have discussed the issue in the literature have taken a defensive approach. S-S trade is favoured, for example, because of problems of, or limits to, trade with the North, or because of weaknesses and asymmetries in the international trading system and lopsided N-S trade agreements. These agreements are considered not conducive to industrial development of developing countries. This paper has proposed an alternative economic rationale for S-S trade based on a combination of three elements: theory of \u201cvent for surplus\u201d, the resource scarcity problem of developing countries and the need for division of labour and specialization. Accordingly, S-S trade is viewed as being additional to N-S trade, and as a vehicle for enhancing industrialization, upgrading of the industrial structure and general economic development through fuller utilization of unemployed resources of developing countries.

Concluding remarks, and areas for future research 48 on markets of developed countries and improve their bargaining position in multilateral forums as well as in their bilateral trade relations with the developed countries. ESSEA has increasingly become a dynamic source of supply and demand in international trade as well as S-S regional trade. The rate of growth of exports and imports of ESSEA well exceeds that of world trade as well as S-S trade in general, such as for manufactured goods. The paper has also demonstrated that trade agreements have contributed to increased trade among members of each regional trade group, particularly ASEAN. Nevertheless, other factors seem to have been more important than trade agreements in expanding regional trade in ESSEA. The share of intrabloc trade of the various groups in ESSEA is not in all cases greater than their trade share with a different bloc or blocs. Demand and supply dynamism as well as policies of governments and TNCs are among important contribu- tory factors. At the country level, China and India have been the most dynamic sources of supply and markets in the region. By contrast, while the lower-income countries of the region have acted as a market for exports of other countries, they have not benefited much from the market opportunities provided by the demand dynamic countries. In other words, despite the fact that, generally speaking, tariffs and non-tariff barriers are lower in the first- and second-tier NIEs than in the lower-income countries of the region, regional agreements have not been able to provide a significant impetus to regional exports of all these lower-income countries. While SAARC displays the lowest ratio of intrabloc trade/total trade among the various trade blocs in ESSEA, this ratio is nevertheless higher than that of all African regional trade blocs, except those of the Southern Af- rican Development Community (SADC), which benefits from extensive trade with South Africa, and the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA). Further, a number of countries (e.g. Nepal and Sri Lanka, and to some extent Viet Nam) benefit from bilateral trade agreements and/or trade with demand dynamic countries of the region such as India and China. However, the low-income/small countries of ESSEA have not been regionally integrated as much as other countries of the region. Various factors may be responsible for such discrepancies in the performance of the more advanced ESSEA countries and the lower-income countries. The lack of supply capabilities in manufactured goods is a very important factor. Primary products, which are the main export items of the lower-income countries in the region, have benefited less than the manufactured goods from dynamism in regional trade. Further, for most of the lower-income countries, the rates of growth of exports to the region have been negative or lower than their rates of growth of total exports. In particular, the low industrial and skills capabilities of the lower-income countries have prevented them from getting involved in the rapid expansion of intra-industry trade and production sharing in the region, which have been particularly dynamic factors in the expansion of regional trade. These factors have been widespread among the first- and second-tier NIEs in a limited number of electrical and electronic prod- ucts, which have accounted for the bulk of their intraregional trade in non-fuel products. For example, seven such products accounted for nearly 58 per cent of non-fuel imports and for about 66 per cent of imports of manufactured goods of China from a few ASEAN countries. More importantly, only two electrical and elec- tronic items accounted for over 50 per cent of total non-fuel imports and for about 60 per cent of imports of manufactured goods of China from those countries. In value terms, they amounted to US$34 billion in 2005 and increased at an average annual rate of 63 per cent over the period 1995\u20132005. China, as the largest and most dynamic market, imports some sophisticated electrical and electronic products from the NIEs. At the same time, it is a major regional market for P&C used for assembly operations, the products of which are exported largely to developed countries. Such a heavy dependence on a limited number of products and the high degree of interdependence of the exporting countries in the region is cause for concern. In particular, the dependence of other countries on China increases their vulnerability to external shocks and business", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ddc01650-0cdd-4785-8f58-c06eb26c22ce": {"__data__": {"id_": "ddc01650-0cdd-4785-8f58-c06eb26c22ce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-South Regionalism and Trade Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0fe108ba2b74531cf5da5cdecc79eaa8c0793e6ce4ee9af9febd89cd7b1969f3"}}, "hash": "0fe108ba2b74531cf5da5cdecc79eaa8c0793e6ce4ee9af9febd89cd7b1969f3", "text": "cycles. The contagion effects of the Asian financial crisis of 1997\u20131998 serve as a reminder of the need for strengthening regional financial cooperation in order to reduce the adverse socio-economic effects of such crises. The sub-prime difficulties in the financial markets of the United States are another reminder of weaknesses in the international financial architecture. 49 There is a common misconception about what has driven the rapid expansion of regional trade and production sharing in ESSEA. Some observers believe it has been driven by market forces; this paper has argued that production sharing is basically an inter-firm operation, initially driven by changes in the policies of the Government of Japan, the Japanese TNCs and the governments of the East Asian countries themselves. Similarly, the involvement of lower-income countries in intra-industry trade and/or product sharing needs to be policy-driven through active cooperation of the countries in the region, including the lower-income countries themselves. Having examined the pattern of regional trade and the characteristics and main development inter- ests of the countries in the region, the study proposes the need for enhancing and strengthening regional cooperation in four areas. The first is for industrial collaboration among the lower-income countries, through an arrangement for the division of labour and specialization for building their supply capacity. As the coun- tries concerned have a common production and export structure, they have little prospects for expanding intraregional trade. The idea is to develop complementarity through the division of labour and specialization in different products and industries. However, this cannot take place by relying on the operation of market forces alone. There is need for cooperation, coordination and harmonization of development and industrial policies in the lower-income countries with a view to helping them achieve dynamic comparative advantage. Second, regional agreements and arrangements should also consider establishing a facility for the provision of adjustment assistance to lower-income countries for building up their supply capacity, and for training, skills development and back-up services, among others. The NIEs, in particular, which are interested in enlarg- ing their markets, should contribute to such a facility, as development of the lower-income countries could provide them with additional market opportunities in the region. Further research is required to identify the modalities of such assistance. Perhaps a pilot project could be implemented by ASEAN for its lower-income country members. The third area for enhanced cooperation should be in technological capacity building and R&D by the second-tier NIEs for upgrading their industrial structure. Finally, there is a need to enhance financial cooperation and control of movements of capital in order to reduce the risks of interdependence and vulnerability of the ESSEA countries to external factors. Need for further research The following issues may be considered for further research in the future: l The impact of the dynamics of economic changes in China and India on export opportunities and industrialization of the lower-income/small countries of the region, drawing on the experience of trade and investment cooperation between India and its two neighbours, Nepal and Sri Lanka. l The evolution of the relations between FDI and regional trade cooperation and production sharing in the ESSEA region. l The modalities of adjustment assistance to lower-income countries for development of such aspects as productive capacity, skills development, education, training, back-up services and infrastructure, as against \u201caid for trade\u201d in the narrow sense of the term. l Building the trade supply capabilities of the lower-income countries of the region, for targeting the Chinese and Indian markets in particular, including needs assessment, identification of the necessary back-up services, bottlenecks and skills and training requirements. l The feasibility of industrial collaboration by lower-income countries, identifying areas for such col- laboration, and the prospect for processing of the raw materials needed for industrial production in China, India and the ASEAN-4. l Areas and modalities of cooperation in R&D among the second-tier NIEs, China and India. l Regional cooperation in the services sector, particularly back-up services for trade expansion, such as export financing and insurance. l In the field of finance, (i) The feasibility and modalities of establishing a regional South Bank which could also incorporate the existing schemes of the Chiang Mai and Asian Bond Market Initiatives; and (ii) The possibilities and modalities of capital control and harmonization of policies of various coun- tries in the region, in this respect. l Regional cooperation by the governments in the region in the field of energy, and development of a strategic energy reserve to reduce risks related to the interruption of energy supply. 50 Agatiello, O.

Annex 2 58 The Agreement on the Global System of Trade Preferences among developing countries: Its implications for regional trade A separate study is required on the interrelationship between the GSTP Agreement and regional trade agreements. Nevertheless, a few points are worth mentioning. First of all, the scheme is limited in its scope and membership. It is mainly a preferential scheme for trade in goods aimed at provision of preferential tariffs and non-tariffs concessions on a reciprocal basis to contracting parties. Only LDCs are supposed to be provided with concessional preferences. It can also provide possibilities for harmonization of rules of origin. However, it is, neither a forum for negotiation with developed countries, nor a platform for designing trade or industrial policies. Further, the system is by no means \u201cgeneral\u201d. Only 42 developing countries and one trading bloc (MERCOSUR) are contracting parties to the GSTP Agreement. China is not yet the contracting party, although it participates in the third round of negotiations. The member countries account for only about half of S-S trade (Puri, 2007: 4). Moreover, despite the fact that LDCs are supposed to enjoy concessional preferences, only seven LDCs have so far signed the agreement and few others have applied (see table A.16). Secondly, the idea of a GSTP Agreement was initiated in 1976 and two rounds of negotiations have taken place with another in the process, but so far the scheme has not become operational. The first round began in 1986 and led to the establishment of the GSTP Agreement in 1988, which came into force in 1989. The second round took place during the period 1992\u20131998, when 24 countries exchanged preferential tariff concessions for about 900 products. However, the concessions did not take effect, as less than the required 15 members ratified the related protocol. Hence, when the third round started in 2004, the participating countries were back to square one, as no concessions had been exchanged (Agatiello, 207:10). This was mainly because the trade policies of the member countries had changed considerably in the meantime. The third round was supposed to conclude by November 2006, and the deadline for its conclusion was extended to the end of 2007 (UNCTAD, 2007e:11). Thus far little has been achieved in terms of exchanging concessions. Thirdly, as far as the relationship between GSTP and regional trade agreements are concerned, as mentioned before, trade liberalization is not the most significant factor in the expansion of S-S regional trade. To the extent that trade liberalization contributes to the expansion of S-S regional trade, it is most unlikely that preferences given through GSTP would exceed those offered through regional agreements.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ac57c2f5-973f-4be1-bb03-19dcf3a4df01": {"__data__": {"id_": "ac57c2f5-973f-4be1-bb03-19dcf3a4df01", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-South Regionalism and Trade Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e73317b2ef2062b7a00a91aa7cbb83518bf84804f5a9efae83ea23a16cc2bffb"}, "2": {"node_id": "6cc14d9c-cf27-458e-b501-ee50eef29c8a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-south-regionalism-and-trade-cooperation-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cb79c46f01251dd4b0e40d3c0a50811b24b5f54c2e0eb8fdebf909191644e7b1"}}, "hash": "bec3e05252960fec1226fc2b3d4504a633a83ce986997d8680e3a10370fa133d", "text": "Fourthly, if more countries and trading blocs were to participate in the GSTP scheme, it could contribute to the reduction of trade barriers among the various trading blocs in the ESSEA region and elsewhere and act as a building bloc for S-S trade liberalization. Provided it is supplemented by other cooperative and collaboration mea- sures at the regional level, it could become an important vehicle for further expansion of S-S trade. The alternative markets of the developing countries could provide them with greater bargaining power in their trade relations with industrialized countries, provided the developing countries also improve their bargaining skills, enhance their necessary knowledge and information and clarify their own trade and industrial policies before they enter into negotiations in multilateral forums or in bilateral trade agreements (Shafaeddin, 1984).

It brings new opportunities and challenges for sustainable and inclusive development. This strategy paper was commissioned by UNDP to inform the organization\u2019s current and future policy and programming work in Asia Pacific. It argues the case for greater UNDP involvement in urban issues in the region and sets out a framework to guide this involvement. The Asia Pacific region is rapidly transforming from a predominantly rural to an urban society. Over the next 40 years to 2050, it is estimated the Asia Pacific urban population will increase from around 1.9 to 3.2 billion people. Asia Pacific was 45% urban in 2010; this is projected to increase to 56% urban in 2030 and to 64% urban in 2050.1 The growth of cities in the region has been driven by and underpins economic growth. It is estimated cities account for as much as 80% of the region\u2019s economic output.2 With projected future economic growth, the region could account for more than half of global GDP, trade and investment by 2050. 3 Asia Pacific cities are the primary location of this rapid economic growth. Their efficiency is an important determinant of the extent to which agglomeration economies and rising productivity can be achieved; they provide the environment and social milieu in which more and more people live their lives. While urban areas are centres for economic growth, businesses and employment opportunities, increased urbanization does not necessarily lead to improved livelihoods for the poor. In Asia-\u00ad\u2010Pacific, the urban population has been growing faster than the capacity of cities to accommodate them, resulting in the expansion of the informal sector with low-\u00ad\u2010quality unsafe employment. As poverty and inequalities in cities are growing, it is now widely recognized that urban areas are central to increasing productivity and incomes, and reducing overall levels of poverty. Conversely, their success also strengthens rural development and rural productivity. Urbanization trends and patterns continue to drive rural development in many ways, such as through increased demand for labour and remittances. In Viet Nam, domestic demand from rapidly expanding urban centres stimulates food production more than export markets. In China, in 2004, remittances by migrant urban workers overtook earnings from farming in rural households\u2019 budgets. 4 Urbanization has been occurring for millennia. What is unique in Asia Pacific is the speed and scale of urbanization. This has linkages to productivity gains enabled by new technologies, the globalization of information and technology and to the liberalization of world trade and capital markets (and increasingly labor markets). Domestic policies of Asia Pacific governments and investments in education, health, and infrastructure have also played an important role. Unsurprisingly, the outcomes of the urbanization process have been a complex mix. They vary widely from country to country in Asia Pacific with countries at very different stages of their urban transitions, and between regions and cities within countries. Projecting the future for particular cities, nations and globally is fraught with difficulties. What is clear is that, barring some unforeseen disaster or return to global protectionism, the growth of cities will continue. Within this trend, there is an increasing concentration of the urban population in larger cities, and cities have increasingly come to merge together to form mega-\u00ad\u2010regions, urban corridors and city-\u00ad\u2010regions. In general, the larger \u2018primary\u2019 cities have national and global linkages and have fared better in accommodating growing urban populations. However, over half the urban population in Asia Pacific lives in cities and towns with fewer than 1 million people. These smaller, \u2018secondary\u2019 cities are facing the greatest difficulties. They often have less developed linkages to markets, weak local governments and poor infrastructure.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8f4ef22-8fbd-480a-a6bb-3f1fc3d80972": {"__data__": {"id_": "f8f4ef22-8fbd-480a-a6bb-3f1fc3d80972", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategy-paper-sustainable-and-inclusive-urbanization-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strategy Paper: Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategy-paper-sustainable-and-inclusive-urbanization-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "90a3f29aac8591124163b1045a86c4d0d69dfe6af8fb1b88d21e625cc469825f"}, "2": {"node_id": "1113d75d-4010-4dc7-bb7a-8fe08cbfcbc8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategy-paper-sustainable-and-inclusive-urbanization-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4b96b7a52e00d1267c6ed9427a9bdbbb6b232e90da573b52e40fbd590dedd6b3"}}, "hash": "2d63b3b41dcf737e5d530b5711e05ceb71707672b9478cbef75bc1f4cada82f6", "text": "They often have less developed linkages to markets, weak local governments and poor infrastructure.

New York, January 2008. vi Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific generally fewer financial and skilled human resources to plan and manage growth. It is becoming increasingly difficult for these cities to compete economically \u2013 the business environment is unattractive to all but locally based service industries, there is slow employment growth in the formal economy, poor access to infrastructure services, growing poverty and slum settlements. A paradox of this rush to urbanize in Asia Pacific is that standards of living are increasing while aspects of the physical and social environment at both local and global levels are degrading. Water availability and quality, prime agricultural land, fish stocks, forests, and biodiversity are all declining, and air and water pollution, slum housing, traffic congestion, and greenhouse gas levels increasing. This cannot continue indefinitely. The pace of urban growth has caught many governments and communities in Asia Pacific unprepared. The demand for land, shelter, transport, energy supplies and social and environmental services has outstripped supply. City governments have struggled to plan and manage urban growth, finance and provide necessary services, and facilitate broad community involvement in decision making. Land management -\u00ad\u2010 land release and development -\u00ad\u2010 in peri-\u00ad\u2010urban areas is a particular challenge with confusion between urban and rural responsibilities and the growth of slums and other informal settlements on the periphery of cities. These problems are compounded by policies in some countries that have decentralized the provision of services from central government but have not been accompanied by necessary fiscal equalization arrangements. The result is cities, and particularly secondary cities, with weak revenues, large infrastructure and service shortfalls, and growing urban poverty, slum settlements and inequalities. Cronyism and corruption further stifle development in many Asia Pacific cities making inequality worse and undermining social mobility and cohesion. Rising crime and social dislocation in some urban areas is also a threat to human security and the rule of law. The safety and opportunities of women and youth require specific interventions to protect them and to provide opportunities for their meaningful participation. While people are generally better-\u00ad\u2010off in cities, governments in Asia Pacific now face a changed social context with new development challenges. As societies become more affluent and people concentrate in cities, national and local governments are starting to have to contemplate the design and implementation of social safety net policies to ameliorate growing poverty and income and service inequalities within and between urban areas and between urban areas and rural areas; policies in areas such as housing, minimum service levels, basic health insurance, pensions, minimum wages and public-\u00ad\u2010work schemes for the poorest. This is complicated where employment and job creation is heavily centred in the informal economy where productivity is lower and any government controls of employment conditions for health and safety or minimum wages are not applied or enforced. The size of the informal economy also makes it difficult to implement effective, broad based income taxation or property taxation further restricting the ability to provide services. The future prospects for cities in Asia Pacific will be determined by the management of three closely interrelated aspects of their sustainability: (i) economic sustainability -\u00ad\u2010 the ability of cities to attract profitable businesses and grow as centres of production -\u00ad\u2010 to attract investment, create jobs, facilitate efficient communications and linkages, and enable continuing improvements in productivity and standards of living; (ii) environmental sustainability -\u00ad\u2010 the ability of cities to provide resilient habitat \u2013 shelter, safe water, air quality, waste management, energy efficiencies, climate change adaptation and mitigation measures -\u00ad\u2010 necessary for healthy, productive, satisfying lives for their citizens now and into the future; and (iii) social sustainability -\u00ad\u2010 the ability of cities to provide a safe, vibrant community where the opportunities and benefits of economic growth are equitably shared, broad community views are incorporated in decision-\u00ad\u2010making, community leaders are accountable, laws are applied impartially and which is inclusive of women, marginalized, vulnerable and diverse ethnic and religious groups. Cities must create opportunities and vertically bridge different sectors of the population, enabling individuals and groups to interact, thereby strengthening social cohesion. Building sustainable cities in this period of rapid economic and population growth will always be a work in transition.

Urban governance comprises the formal national, regional and local government jurisdictions and arrangements with responsibilities for city management and services, and the formal and informal arrangements for community, business and non government organization (NGO) engagement in decision-\u00ad\u2010making. The structure, effectiveness and inclusiveness of urban governance vary greatly between countries and cities across the Asia Pacific region. Frequently, effectiveness and coordination is dependent on the drive and vision of particular city leaders. Inaction, poor planning and prevarication are costly as urban growth inexorably continues. Haphazard development including the development of flood prone or otherwise unsuitable land and occupation of potential infrastructure corridors can have legacy costs for decades. The analysis in this strategy paper canvasses issues and \u2018best practices\u2019 that have been adopted by countries and cities in the Asia Pacific region grouped under five headings: urban governance, urban economics and finance, urban development and management, social development, and environmental systems. While there is considerable variation across the region, there are core problems with the planning, financing and management of urban systems and the delivery of efficient, sustainable outcomes. These problems are complex and have resulted from the interplay of governance and resource issues; they are not easily resolved; and their impacts are exacerbated by the speed of change. \u2022 At the central government level, national urban policies and strategies, if they exist, are often ambiguous about urban growth; national urban planning systems and laws are antiquated with urban planning delinked from both budgeting and long term financial planning; decentralization and devolution policies are frequently not aligned with the tax bases of different levels of government and do not create sufficient incentives for cities to improve their own revenues; property rights are often unclear with limited control over corruption and manipulation of public land assets. \u2022 At the city level, planning, management and financial skills are in short supply; participatory governance is often weak with limited community and business involvement in setting priorities; land management and administration is also often inadequate and compounded by confusion over responsibility on the urban periphery; this in-\u00ad\u2010turn can lead to uncertainty, forced evictions, speculation and inflation in local land markets which in the absence of planning for growth, constrains the supply of both housing and infrastructure and results in the continued growth of slums. UNDP ASIA PACIFIC URBAN STRATEGY Managing the growth of cities in Asia Pacific is proving a daunting task for all levels of government. The stakes are high \u2013 job creation and poverty reduction, climate change and environmental sustainability, disaster risk reduction, community development, social inclusion and stable, safe societies. The next forty years will see a massive transition to urban living involving physical, economic and social change, and local and global environmental consequences. What is clear is that the growth of cities will continue and successfully managing city growth will be critical to development outcomes. The importance of cities to inclusive development and poverty reduction provides a compelling case for a greater and more strategic UNDP involvement in urban issues in the Asia Pacific region. This is supported by UNDP being increasingly sought out by partner governments and communities in the region for assistance with urban projects and strategic partnerships on urban issues. The argument for a greater UNDP focus on cities also reflects the UNDP development interventions in poverty reduction, democratic governance, crisis prevention and recovery, and energy and the environment. \u2022 Limited institutional governance is one of the most significant barriers to improving the sustainability of cities in the region. Lack of local capacity in secondary cities is of special concern and is particularly relevant for local authorities\u2019 capture by elites and vested interests. \u2022 Reducing the growth of urban poverty and income, gender and horizontal inequalities is critical to sustaining economic growth, as well as to maintaining social stability in the region. \u2022 Crisis prevention and recovery is increasingly focusing on Asia Pacific cities and their vulnerabilities to natural disasters and climate change. viii Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific \u2022 Opportunities for improved energy efficiency and demand reduction in cities are often not being realized in the region and there are major problems with urban emissions, congestion and waste on productivity and health and well being. While cities now occupy centre stage in Asia\u2019s economic growth and development, the opportunities and challenges posed by rapid urbanization are not yet reflected in most national policies and plans, or in the development priorities or strategies of UNDP.

This observation was born out by feedback from UNDP\u2019s country offices in Asia and the Pacific that uniformly welcomed this initiative. Almost all country offices expressed the need for a more strategic partnership with cities and local governments, since cities are where economic growth, poverty reduction, social inclusion, participatory governance and environmental impacts can all be acted upon with immediate impacts. While some country offices in the region have important programs in place either with ministries responsible for local government, or with one or more urban local authorities, most expressed a need for a more strategic approach to build on UNDP\u2019s cross-\u00ad\u2010sectoral programming capacity. Moreover, in most countries in the region poverty is still seen as a rural issue, notwithstanding the fact that across the region all growth of poverty is now taking place in cities. The aim of the UNDP Asia Pacific urban strategy is to assist national and local partner governments and local communities achieve inclusive, resilient and sustainable cities. There is a very wide range of activities that UNDP could become engaged in the urban sector. Details of specific objectives, programs and arrangements will need to be tailored to country priorities and contexts and to specific cities or groups of cities within countries. They will also be limited by UNDP\u2019s resources. This UNDP Asia Pacific urban strategy has been conceived as a framework to help inspire and guide the process of developing national urban strategies and strategic urban program interventions by UNDP country offices in Asia and the Pacific. The strategy focuses on: sustaining economic growth by promoting the growth of cities which are inclusive, resilient and sustainable; on what UNDP can do to address this challenge; and on how UNDP can best use and build upon its existing strengths, and where it does not have capacity and competencies, to leverage its resources to respond to the challenges and opportunities of rapid urbanization. UNDP has particular strengths for work on cities. Its in-\u00ad\u2010country representation and strong leadership role as an impartial multilateral partner provide it with a unique ability to facilitate policy dialogue and reforms at the regional, national and sub-\u00ad\u2010national levels, to develop strategic partnerships on urban issues and to leverage resources to achieve objectives. A further strength derives from its crosscutting programming capacity to align resources and engage partners across sectors, including the talents of women and young people, into well integrated support programs. This potential to work with cities as urban systems rather than on a sectoral basis provides the opportunity for significant development benefits. Ownership of the strategy development and implementation process clearly needs to be at the country level with UNDP country offices. While urbanization is occurring across the region, countries are at very different stages of their urban transformation. Moreover the challenges faced by cities are often uniquely local \u2013 as cities have their own topography, governance, economic structure and opportunities, and relationships with other levels of government. To be effective, a UNDP Asia Pacific urban strategy must be both bold and sharply focused: bold in scale by targeting citywide and nationwide impacts; and sharply focused on cities -\u00ad\u2010 listening and learning from cities and their citizens in the development of national policies and in improvements in local governance, and helping cities to sustain and improve the quality of their growth. UNDP\u2019s urban strategy in Asia Pacific should be based on a framework of individual country strategies. In implementation, the urban strategy is a set of individual country strategies based on a common objective and broad guidelines. These country strategies should aim to achieve impacts at scale by facilitating and strengthening partnerships and strategic alliances.

COUNTRY STRATEGY FRAMEWORK The analysis of the challenges facing cities in Asia Pacific suggests UNDP country strategies be developed following the framework shown in the figure. The strategies would have a broad focus on managing urban growth and should be developed working with both national and local authorities, civil society, as well as with other development agencies investing in urban infrastructure and services. While they will need to be guided by particular country circumstances, in many countries in Asia Pacific secondary cities and issues at the urban periphery are likely to be areas of greatest need. At the national level UNDP country strategies should focus on facilitating the urban policy dialogue and on mainstreaming urban issues into national policies and plans, budgeting processes and regulatory reforms. Priorities will vary between countries but might include national policies for decentralization and fiscal equalization arrangements, increasing energy efficiency, the appropriateness and effectiveness of city-\u00ad\u2010wide governance and planning arrangements to anticipate and plan for urban growth, and strengthening property rights and the management of public land assets. At the local level, the analysis suggests UNDP country strategies focus on the distinct development challenges faced by secondary cities and in peri-\u00ad\u2010urban areas. Improvements might be sought in four strategic areas: urban governance; land administration and management; quality job growth; and city inclusion strategies. City inclusion strategies would target the city\u2019s most vulnerable communities with improvements in infrastructure, social services, environmental improvements and risk reduction with gender equality being a cross cutting issue across all focus areas. UNDP would seek to: facilitate policy dialogue in these areas; help strengthen coordination arrangements; x Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific undertake technical assistance; and support activities for research and development, learning, knowledge and information dissemination. IMPLEMENTATION Cities in Asia Pacific are at the forefront of innovation. Many are engaged in organized networks and forged partnerships that sustain innovations as well as competition. In virtually every country in the region there are mayors and civic leaders who are local champions for more inclusive urban growth. Strategy implementation in the region needs to be anchored at the local level working closely with and learning from these local champions and political advocates. While it is important to leverage the vertical role of UNDP in mobilizing the support of national government, embracing change by working directly with cities, drawing on the experience and expertise of mayors and other local leaders and helping to inspire their innovation should be the cornerstone of implementation. This also implies UNDP develop a flexible capacity to respond to local innovations and to invest in strengthening local knowledge-\u00ad\u2010based partners and their networks to support capacity building, replication and monitoring. Implementation pathways will vary in countries across the region. What is critical is that UNDP mainstream sustaining economic growth by promoting the growth of cities that are more inclusive, resilient and sustainable in its policy dialogue with government and its development agency partners. Where there is a local constituency this should be reflected as a priority in the UNDAF, and where the constituency is less clear UNDP should become an effective advocate in facilitating the urban policy dialogue and reforms at the national and sub-\u00ad\u2010national level. Of equal importance UNDP should fully deploy its crosscutting programming capacity to align resources and engage partners across sectors targeting the outcomes outlined in this strategy. Encouraging national and local research, analysis and discussion of urban issues to help build consensus on how best to respond to the specific challenges and opportunities of urbanization in the country may well prove useful. While the strategy focuses on implementation through strengthened partnerships and will operate though the UNDP four focus areas, taking a city perspective to enhance development effectiveness and coherence across sectors will be a big step for UNDP. It adds complexity and will require leadership at the country level with technical advisory and knowledge brokering services, policy and programme support from a multidisciplinary urban development team at the Asia-\u00ad\u2010Pacific Regional Centre. While there is no doubt that UNDP will be able to leverage considerable resources in implementing this strategy, at the outset it will need to build the research and professional capacity to guide and inform implementation as a high priority. Success with this strategy will depend on the ability at the country level to establish clear priorities, which are consistent with available staff and financial resources. 1 Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific 1 INTRODUCTION Urbanization in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "17895108-a6b6-4a03-8f3e-bd9dfb3d6d6d": {"__data__": {"id_": "17895108-a6b6-4a03-8f3e-bd9dfb3d6d6d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategy-paper-sustainable-and-inclusive-urbanization-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strategy Paper: Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategy-paper-sustainable-and-inclusive-urbanization-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "89dfe8f7f3e355102ba1226ba34bcc7835535dc917e8beee2949d92b7382faa7"}}, "hash": "89dfe8f7f3e355102ba1226ba34bcc7835535dc917e8beee2949d92b7382faa7", "text": "Asia Pacific is proceeding at a scale and speed unprecedented in human history. It took Latin America over 210 years for urbanization rates to rise from 10% to 50%. In Asia and the Pacific it will take 95 years. For some countries in the region it will be less than 60 years5. While the growth of cities in Asia Pacific has been driven by and underpins economic growth, this continued rapid urban growth is creating many challenges \u2013 especially how to improve the quality of life in cities as they accommodate an additional 1.3 billion people projected to be living in the region\u2019s cities by 2050.6 There are many challenges to be overcome in the development of towns and cities in the region. In a number of countries, there is still a strong anti-\u00ad\u2010urban bias towards the growth of cities. Notwithstanding overwhelming evidence to the contrary, urbanization is still seen by many as a problem rather than a positive force in development. However, as country populations become more urbanized, the pressures to manage urbanization so as to take better advantage of its positive impacts should make promoting sustainable and inclusive urban growth a development priority. The battle for sustainable economic growth in the Asia Pacific region will be won or lost in its cities. The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) has had a long involvement in urban development activities. During the 1980s, most of these activities were developed in partnership with UN-\u00ad\u2010Habitat, the United Nations principal agency concerned with the development of human settlements. By the mid-\u00ad\u20101990s UNDP diversified its program of activities and scaled back many of its urban activities while continuing to support some sector projects in water, sanitation, waste management and energy in urban areas. Support for urban development programs by international development agencies has also gone through several cycles. Recently, given the recognition of the direct linkage between urbanization and economic growth, a number of international development agencies have developed strategies and programs that focus on addressing urban poverty, social inclusion and the environmental challenges posed by rapid urbanization. This strategy paper was commissioned by UNDP to inform the organization\u2019s current and future policy and programming work in Asia Pacific. It argues the case for greater UNDP involvement in urban issues in the region and sets out a framework to guide this involvement. The paper is divided into 6 sections. Following this introduction, Section 2 outlines and analyses some of the key urban development challenges in the region, including the importance of cities to achieving sustainable development and poverty reduction. Section 3 analyses the challenges posed by rapid urbanization and includes examples of best practices of cities and countries striving to meet these challenges. Section 4 summarizes feedback received from UNDP country offices in the region and makes the case for a more strategic approach. Section 5 outlines the parameters of a strategic approach, including how UNDP might best impact at scale and achieve a much greater coherence of effort across the many development partners working with cities. Section 6 proposes a UNDP Asia Pacific Urban Strategy that builds on the organization\u2019s strengthens and proposes where and how to focus on clearly defined strategic points of entry at the country level in developing UNDP urban strategies that will achieve the greatest development impacts. 5 World Bank, Cities and Climate Change: an Urgent Agenda. 2010 6 United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division: World Urbanization Prospects, the 2011 Revision. New York, 2012. 2 Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific 2 ANALYSIS OF URBANIZATION AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES Since the end of World War II and the creation of the modern economic order, the role of cities in development has been largely ignored. While the World Bank and Asian Development Bank initiated some modest urban lending in the early 1970s and UN-\u00ad\u2010Habitat was established in 1978, it was not until the late-\u00ad\u20101990s that the central role of cities in economic development and poverty reduction gained a prominent place on a crowded international development agenda. The reasons for this are complex. Many developing country governments were suspicious of the growth of cities; they were seen as places of political activism and social unrest. Development theory and international development institutions tended to focus on capital creation and sectoral issues while ignoring their spatial dimension. Most international development agencies and non government organizations (NGOs) saw direct assistance to the poor which were predominantly located in rural areas as their priority, rather than focusing on the potential for productivity growth, increased employment and poverty reduction through economic development in cities.

Three important cautions: First, the data on cities is often broad and imprecise. It is not the product of generally accepted international accounting conventions, which underpin, say, a country\u2019s National Accounts. Often data, such as city GDP information, is not collected at the city level but rather inferred from national statistics with \u2018adjustments\u2019 for a city\u2019s characteristics. Second, comparisons between cities are difficult. Cities are uniquely local \u2013 they have their own topography, governance, economic structure, relationships with more central levels of government and the like. Moreover, definitions of a \u2018city\u2019 or \u2018urban area\u2019 vary greatly between countries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c16a856b-548c-483e-8b91-520fdb8f9d69": {"__data__": {"id_": "c16a856b-548c-483e-8b91-520fdb8f9d69", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategy-paper-sustainable-and-inclusive-urbanization-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strategy Paper: Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategy-paper-sustainable-and-inclusive-urbanization-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a8657c1c11ebee3bc0a39fabb565a009a8cdbc455d1df4939c4ec4e2d20c5431"}, "2": {"node_id": "95032c3c-7ec8-44a1-a192-54f1151809c9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategy-paper-sustainable-and-inclusive-urbanization-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "543d45afc6bcf3acbead769c11835544d8e93180d43facd58e3e4abdb753e65e"}}, "hash": "b2d5a0c96aeedd8072eb1a8e773a99f33930a05fee854aa5ddc541a074b81bf0", "text": "An urban area might be a mega city region encompassing all built areas and associated peri-\u00ad\u2010urban areas such as greater Jakarta, Bangkok or Shanghai, or a small administrative area defined by central government.

As the 2009 World Development Report points out \u201cspatial transformations -\u00ad\u2010 the growth of cities and leading areas \u2013 are linked closely to changes in the economy, especially the sectoral transformations that accompany growth and the opening of an economy to foreign trade and investment.

Projected Changes in urban and rural population by major regions between 2011 and 2050 (millions) Source: UN World Urbanization Prospects, the 2011 revision, Press Release, NY, 5 April 2012, p. 2. Population projections to 2050 and some other urban data by country and sub-\u00ad\u2010region in Asia Pacific are at Attachment 1. This data indicates: \u2022 Asia Pacific is transforming from a predominantly rural to an urban society. Asia Pacific was 45% urban in 2010; it is projected to increase to 56% urban in the 20 years to 2030, and to 64% urban in 2050. \u2022 While urbanization has been occurring around the world for centuries, the scale and absolute numbers of this transformation are unprecedented. The number of urban dwellers is estimated to increase by 43% from 1.9 billion in 2010, to 2.7 billion in 2030; urban dwellers are projected to increase by a further 21% to 3.2 billion in 2050. \u2022 In the 20 years to 2030, the urban population will increase by over 800 million people and by another 550 million in the next 20 years to 2050. \u2022 The immediate challenge is to sustainably feed, water, shelter and generate employment for the around 3.3 million people who will be added every month to the urban population in Asia Pacific to 2030. While urbanization is occurring across the region, sub-\u00ad\u2010regions and countries are at very different stages of their urban transformation. \u2022 Most countries of the East and North-\u00ad\u2010East Asia sub-\u00ad\u2010region are already highly urbanised. The main exception is China, which is in the middle of its urban transformation. China\u2019s urban population is estimated to increase by 297 million to 958 million by 2030, from 49% to 69% of China\u2019s total population. \u2022 South-\u00ad\u2010East Asia is urbanising rapidly \u2013 it is projected to increase from 44% urban in 2010 to 56% in 2030 and 66% in 2050. However, a number of countries such as Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Timor-\u00ad\u2010Leste are at a very early stage of the urbanization process. Major issues include secure land tenure, the provision of affordable housing, and urban environment and disaster risk management. \u2022 South and South-\u00ad\u2010West Asia is the least urbanised sub-\u00ad\u2010region in Asia Pacific (34% urban), and one of the least urbanised 5 Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific regions in the world. Only two countries Turkey (71% urban) and Iran (69% urban) are highly urbanised. This sub-\u00ad\u2010region, which includes India (31% urban), Pakistan (36% urban) and Bangladesh (28% urban), is poised for a major urban transition and the numbers of people involved are very large.

Urban Density Asian Cities are the most densely populated in the world. There are significant differences in density of cities between regions. Angel et al (2005) estimated the built-\u00ad\u2010up area urban density of Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh in 2000 at 55,500 persons per km2, 8 Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific followed by Hong Kong at 53,000 persons per km2. This compares with cities like Tacoma and Washington in the US at around 1,570 persons per km2. In many of the larger cities, population densities ranged from 10,000-\u00ad\u201016,000 persons per km2. In the Pacific, densities of 12,700 people per km2 have been recorded for some pacific island urban settlements17. Secondary cities often have densities between 50 and 70% of primary cities, which tends to be a reflection of land markets and the lower building height of development. Angel et al (2012) estimated that the total built up urban area in Asia in 2010 was 150,000 sq km18. In both developing and industrialized countries of the region, average densities of cities have been declining quickly which Angel estimates at an annual rate of -\u00ad\u20101.7% over the last decade in developing countries, and of -\u00ad\u20102.2% in industrialized countries (Angel and others, 2012, pp. 1-\u00ad\u20102). Urban density is falling at more than 3% per year in some Asian countries19. The continuation of this form of development is unsustainable and will have a significant impact on the logistics and economic efficiencies and cost of running cities in the future.

The growth of cities is a social and economic transformation founded on productivity gains from: \u2022 innovation -\u00ad\u2010 ongoing scientific and technological advances; \u2022 trade and market liberalization; \u2022 the globalization of information, technology, capital and, to a lesser extent, labour; \u2022 tax and regulatory reform in both developed and developing countries; \u2022 the growth of industrial and service industries whose productivity is enhanced by agglomeration economies found only in a concentrated spatial environment; \u2022 increasing agricultural productivity that has reduced the need for rural labour; and \u2022 investments in skills and education, health and infrastructure that enable increased productivity and rising wages and standards of living. GDP data and rankings, and projections by city are not routinely or systematically produced by government agencies or international institutions. As commented upon earlier, this is a problem as the growth of cities, their relative performance compared to each other and their spatial structure are closely related to the performance and changing structure of their economy. Reflecting the demand for this type of information by global businesses for product marketing and investment decisions, it is not surprising that the sources of such data are often private sector organisations. Recent examples include: \u2022 PricewaterhouseCoopers, \u201cWhich are the largest city economies in the world and how might this change by 2025?\u201d21, \u2022 McKinsey Global Institute, \u201cUrban world: Mapping the economic power of cities\u201d22, and \u2022 Economist Intelligence Unit, \u201cHot Spots: Benchmarking global city competitiveness23\u201d. PricewaterhouseCoopers city GDP rankings for 2008 and 2025 for 150 cities are at Attachment 3 and projected city GDP growth rates at Attachment 4. This data for selected cities is at Tables 2.4 and 2.5 below. Four points are apparent. First, unlike rankings by population size, city rankings by economic size are dominated by developed country cities and will remain so for the foreseeable future (compare Tables 2.2 and 2.4). Second, city GDP growth rates are highest in developing countries and are concentrated in cities in the Asia Pacific region (Table 2.5). Third, the fastest overall growth is in mid-\u00ad\u2010sized cities of around 2-\u00ad\u20105 million population. Fourth, at these growth rates all the cities in Table 2.5 would around triple their economic size by 2025. 20 Asian Development Bank, Asia 2050: Realizing the Asian Century.

Obviously, if Asia Pacific continues to grow on this trajectory it will be a relatively affluent, urbanised society by mid-\u00ad\u2010century. As the ADB report \u201cAsia 2050: Realizing the Asian Century\u201d24 concludes: \u2022 The region could account for more than half of global Gross Domestic Product (GDP), trade and investment by 2050 -\u00ad\u2010 doubling its share of global GDP (at market exchange rates) from 27% in 2010 to 51% by 2050 and increasing per capita income sixfold to reach the global average. \u2022 This rise would be led by China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand. In 2010 these seven economies had a GDP of $14.2 trillion (87% of Asia). By 2050 their share of Asia\u2019s GDP will rise to 90% and they will account for 45% of global GDP. 24 Asian Development Bank, Asia 2050: Realizing the Asian Century. Manila, 2011. 13 Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific \u2022 The breadth and depth of this transformation in the region will depend on the extent to which the region\u2019s lower income countries (generally the least urbanised) can raise economic growth to join their more successful neighbours. On a more sanguine note, the Asia 2050 report also observes that none of this is preordained. Long-\u00ad\u2010term projections of Asia through 2050 cannot rule out the possibility of major setbacks with opportunities foregone. Reasons might include a reversion to protectionism in the developed economies, bad macro-\u00ad\u2010policies, poor financial sector supervision, inadequate investments in infrastructure, education and social safety-\u00ad\u2010nets, the breakdown of social cohesion, conflicts, natural disaster/climate change risks, and weak governance and corruption. The development of more robust, inclusive and accountable governance structures in the countries across Asia Pacific can both foster economic growth and increase the resilience of their societies to inevitable shocks. An important aspect is the representation of woman and marginalized groups in policy formulation and decision-\u00ad\u2010making. THE CHALLENGES TO CONTINUING URBAN DEVELOPMENT Cities are at the centre of economic growth. They are the main location where this growth is occurring; their efficiency determines the extent to which agglomeration economies and rising productivity can be achieved; they provide the environment and social milieu in which more and more people live their lives. The development challenge of this century will be won or lost in cities \u2013 job creation and poverty reduction, climate change and environmental sustainability, community development and social inclusion. The next forty years will see massive physical, economic and social change, major geopolitical shifts, and local and global environmental consequences. What is clear is that, barring some unforeseen disaster, the growth of cities will continue and successfully managing city growth will be critical to development outcomes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "135f3445-3374-436c-af09-a72d9d796ffb": {"__data__": {"id_": "135f3445-3374-436c-af09-a72d9d796ffb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategy-paper-sustainable-and-inclusive-urbanization-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strategy Paper: Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategy-paper-sustainable-and-inclusive-urbanization-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0729258e6fe9ba34c4ea1862d9b1f384e39564259fb3c94bc75078d46d22af8f"}, "2": {"node_id": "b5c03f72-e6df-419e-8a1b-58df62b35a6a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategy-paper-sustainable-and-inclusive-urbanization-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f8a0ce15ae10fcde84d84f327f080dfd19675f2d8f46dd59ac3a58e0068a4fa0"}}, "hash": "c29121bcfb77c4b2cf3d2e9d0474fdcd3ae94172f4f1aa5754c5e7a12eda185e", "text": "The future prospects for cities in Asia Pacific will be determined by the management of three closely interrelated aspects of their sustainability: (i) economic sustainability -\u00ad\u2010 the ability of cities to attract profitable businesses and grow as centres of production -\u00ad\u2010 to attract investment, create jobs, facilitate efficient communications and linkages, and enable continuing improvements in productivity and standards of living; (ii) environmental sustainability -\u00ad\u2010 the ability of cities to provide the resilient habitat \u2013 shelter, safe water, air quality, waste management, energy efficiencies, climate change adaptation and mitigation measures -\u00ad\u2010 necessary for healthy, productive, satisfying lives for their citizens now and into the future; and (iii) social sustainability -\u00ad\u2010 the ability of cities to provide a safe, vibrant community where the opportunities and benefits of economic growth are equitably shared, broad community views are incorporated in decision-\u00ad\u2010making, community leaders are accountable, laws are applied impartially and which is inclusive of women, marginalized, vulnerable and diverse ethnic and religious groups.

For business to grow and be successful, cities must provide the opportunity for growing productivity through efficient markets for trade, land, labour and capital and through the provision of necessary infrastructure and services such as water and sanitation, communications and transport, and solid waste management.

The role of city governments in economic development shifts over time from a narrow focus on regulating development and infrastructure and service delivery, to delivering the competitive environment for development business needs for growing investment, production and 14 Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific employment. Cities in Asia Pacific vary greatly in their ability to meet these challenges, and in their competitiveness in attracting investment, business and people. Whilst many primary cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Singapore and Bangkok have dominant natural advantages, such as nodal point locations on transport routes or natural harbours which provide trade advantages and easy integration into the global economy, many other secondary cities of less than one million people have not developed global or even national linkages and are struggling to foster economic development and accommodate growing populations. In general in Asia Pacific, it is the primary cities and cities with natural advantages which have been best placed to take advantage of globalisation, and trade and capital market liberalisation; smaller cities and cities in the small island states of the Pacific region are having the most difficulty in raising productivity levels and income and this is reflected in the data above, noting accelerated urban concentration. Smaller cities have no unique geographic or external advantages and no particular city level advantages in areas such as infrastructure, city management, skills or entrepreneurship. The pace of urban development has caught many governments in Asia Pacific unprepared. The demand for land, shelter, transport, employment, energy supplies and social and environmental services has outstripped supply. The business environment in many smaller cities is unattractive to all but locally based service industries. A result is that slow economic growth and growing populations is undermining economic sustainability in these smaller cities. The consequence is slow employment growth particularly in the formal economy, weak city government revenues, growing urban poverty and slum settlements, and diseconomies of agglomeration with growing traffic congestion, water and air pollution, and watershed mismanagement. Land management -\u00ad\u2010 land release and development -\u00ad\u2010 in peri-\u00ad\u2010urban areas is a particular problem with confusion between urban and rural responsibilities and the growth of slums and other informal settlements on the periphery of cities. These problems are compounded by policies in some countries which have decentralised the provision of services from central government but have not been accompanied by necessary fiscal equalisation arrangements. The result is cities with large infrastructure and service shortfalls, poor economic growth opportunities and growing urban poverty. Environmental Sustainability A paradox of the rush to urbanization is that standards of living are increasing while the environment is degrading. Water availability and quality, the availability of prime agricultural land, fish stocks, forests, and biodiversity are all declining, and air pollution and greenhouse gas levels increasing. This cannot continue indefinitely. Environmental issues threaten to undermine economic sustainability and social sustainability, with the poor most exposed to environmental hazards and with the least resources for adaptation. The environmental concerns facing Asian cities are related to three major issues; (i) poverty; (ii) industrial production (air and water pollution); and (iii) increasing consumption (higher carbon dioxide emissions, water pollution and land degradation)25. While virtually all cities in Asia Pacific face these issues to a greater or lesser extent, it is the smaller cities that have the least resources to address them. Amelioration requires policies, skills, and institutional and financial resources, which are difficult for the governments of smaller cities to develop and mobilise, particularly in areas facing relatively slow economic growth and rising populations. A World Bank Report estimates as much as 80% of greenhouse gas emissions may come from cities and that more than 80% of energy is consumed in cities. Potential impacts from climate change include an increase in extreme weather events; sea level rise, storm surges and flooding; hotter temperatures; and public health concerns. Cities are proving particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change because they are unable to move as local ecosystems change, they are vulnerable to even modest disruptions in food and energy supplies, and they are", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "550f769b-3524-4a9e-96e9-bbe4c0d1c3b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "550f769b-3524-4a9e-96e9-bbe4c0d1c3b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategy-paper-sustainable-and-inclusive-urbanization-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strategy Paper: Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategy-paper-sustainable-and-inclusive-urbanization-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1e2468b2e2a3a2a532b1aee8ff6286a7bd0497a4a115907d7279ca40712c58e7"}, "3": {"node_id": "ebfff6e0-ef25-4e10-aabb-9ae9cad956ba", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategy-paper-sustainable-and-inclusive-urbanization-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4cbdd6a2e80bac4acb6cd7747ecb08c785d89eff559461190ec9ff6c124f534a"}}, "hash": "ca21071998a0b4713506caee1e2b3bd4ba239fba5ba99d213bc231b1d5dda2ad", "text": "frequently located on low-\u00ad\u2010lying coastal zones and river flood plains.

Examples may include problems with food security \u2013 agriculture is one of the most sensitive economic sectors affected by climate change and is an important sector in most Asian countries26, water supplies and quality, and energy supplies caused by higher temperatures and changing and more severe drought patterns. The prospect also exists for greater migration of displaced people (for example due to flooding), which may take the form of greater in-\u00ad\u2010migration to cities. Cities are where climate change mitigation and adaptation converge at the community level. The ability of city governments to embrace climate change, plan and institute appropriate mitigation and adaptation measures and achieve equitable broad-\u00ad\u2010based community involvement and support will be a major determinant of the environmental sustainability of cities. In Asia Pacific, cities are seriously exposed to the likely impacts of climate change27 and, as cities grow, urban expansion is often unplanned with unsuitable land use change. A particular problem is coastal floodplain development in areas susceptible to flooding, changing sea levels and storm surges (Graph 2.3). Graph 2.3: Countries with Highest Urban Populations Living in the Low-\u00ad\u2010elevation Coastal Zones, 2000 Source: World Bank, Cities and Climate Change: an Urgent Agenda, 2010. Social Sustainability It is important to reflect on urbanization as more than a technological or economic process. It is also a social transformation. Migration to cities reflects economic disparities among regions and countless separate decisions by individuals and families to take action to change their way of life to better their position through broader labour markets, often higher and more reliable wages even in the informal sector, and greater access to education, health care, water supply and sanitation, and entertainment. This is reflected in usually higher life expectancy and lower infant mortality in cities. Even the urban poor often have more opportunity and less risk than their rural cousins. 26 Asian Development Bank, Asia 2050: Realizing the Asian Century. Manila, 2011. pp. 77-\u00ad\u201078. 27 UN-\u00ad\u2010HABITAT/ESCAP, The State of Asian Cities 2010/11. 2010. p. 169. 16 Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific Adjustments for individuals and families have been immense: migration, new labour market and skills requirements, problems in accessing shelter, on occasion new language requirements and the need to adapt to culturally foreign and more liberal religious customs, and the ongoing rapid evolution of the social and cultural milieu. While overall and over time the welfare impacts for most individuals and households have been overwhelmingly positive, Asia Pacific remains a region of enormous disparity in income levels, living standards, and socioeconomic conditions.28 An important factor undermining the social sustainability of some cities in Asia Pacific is the extent of cronyism and corruption, which stifles development, deepens inequality, and undermines social mobility and cohesion. Rising crime and social dislocation is also a threat to human security and the rule of law in some urban areas. The safety and opportunities of women and youth require specific interventions to protect them and to provide opportunities for their meaningful participation. Poverty Growing GDP, growing GDP per capita and growing cities have resulted in major inroads into the incidence of poverty in Asia Pacific, though it is still home to nearly half of the world\u2019s absolute poor (with per capita incomes of less than US$1.25 a day).

Moreover, in South Asia the absolute number of urban poor is increasing. The share of the urban poor as a proportion of all urban residents is highest in South Asia and Sub Saharan Africa at an astounding 70%. It is overly simplistic to view urban and rural poverty as separate problems or in competition for resources. Urbanization has underpinned economic growth and poverty reduction but affected rural poverty more than urban poverty.29 Much rural poverty becomes urban poverty through migration; remittances from urban areas can reduce rural poverty as can urban residents returning to their families to assist with labour during the harvest or other labour intensive periods in rural areas. Rural development can both reduce overall poverty and increase urban poverty, as increased productivity frees labour from rural pursuits. Rural poverty is characterised by issues of access to land and to markets and services; urban poverty is characterised by poor education and labour market skills and unemployment.

Income Inequality Also of concern in Asia Pacific are the high and increasing levels of income inequality (Table 2.6). Social cohesion can break down when disparities get too high. In China and India, urban inequality has been trending upwards over the past three decades.30 For example, in India inequality in earnings has doubled over the past two decades. The top 10% of wage earners now make 12 times more than the bottom 10%. India's per capita income has tripled from about 19,000 rupees in 2002-\u00ad\u201003 to 53,000 rupees in 2010-\u00ad\u201011, with an average growth of around 14% over this period.

Estimating the burden of road traffic injuries among children and adolescents in South Asia. Health Policy. 77, p. 129-\u00ad\u2010139. 19 Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific Urban lifestyles subject residents to various health risks such as smoking, alcohol intoxication, and sedentary habits,33 34 35 36 which constitute major risk factors for non-\u00ad\u2010communicable diseases. Poor migrants are often highly exposed to health inequity under rapid urbanization. In China, for example, rural-\u00ad\u2010urban migrants now constitute about 40% of the urban population. Studies show that rural-\u00ad\u2010urban migrants in China are exposed to greater health risks as compared to non-\u00ad\u2010migrant residents.37 38 39 These include alcohol abuse, risky sexual behaviour, sexually transmitted infections, smoking, tuberculosis and low health insurance coverage. A study in Shenzhen, China, revealed that 55% of the migrant workers surveyed (N=4,634) were not covered by health insurance. Of those who reported illness in the past two weeks (n=1,136), 62% did not seek medical help. Younger, less-\u00ad\u2010educated, and low-\u00ad\u2010paid female migrants were particularly more likely to have been uninsured. These circumstances may impose serious public health implications, particularly in the management of infectious diseases such as influenza, tuberculosis and HIV. These health consequences associated with urbanization could reinforce, perpetuate and exacerbate enormous pre-\u00ad\u2010existing public health challenges and further strain already fragile and overstretched health systems40 in Asia with tremendous human development and financial implications. And they must be approached from social justice and human rights perspectives, placing people, particularly the most marginalized and vulnerable at the centre of the response. Slums Around one third of the urban population in developing countries \u2013 nearly one billion people \u2013 are living in slums. A slum is an informal settlement generally on insecure land with poor quality housing and limited access to services. With the rapid growth of cities in Asia Pacific and increases in the value of land, the location of slums has tended to move from the centre of cities near to employment opportunities, to the peri-\u00ad\u2010urban on the fringes of cities where residents are more isolated. In Asia Pacific, the proportion of the urban population living in slums is highest in South Asia 35% and above 24% in all sub-\u00ad\u2010regions (Attachment 5). Whilst significant progress has been made in some countries such as India and Indonesia, in most countries the absolute number of slum dwellers has increased over the last twenty years (Table 2.7). Urban land markets, housing construction and the provision of urban services have been swamped by the speed of urban growth. An increase in people living in slums associated with rapid urban expansion often causes public health concerns. Data41 reveals wide-\u00ad\u2010 ranging health inequities between slums and better off areas of cities. In New Delhi, for example, the infant mortality rate for slum residents was 54.1 per 1,000 live births, while the overall city average was 40.6 for 2005-\u00ad\u20106. Only 58.4% of pregnant women from slum areas visited antenatal clinics three or more times, while the corresponding overall city figure was 75.1%. The TB rate per 100,000 60+ population was about 1.7 times higher for slums, or 885 for slums and 524 for the city. These health inequities could reverse gains towards MDGs 1, 4, 5, and 6 and need to be addressed as part of sustainable and equitable urban development efforts. Growing income inequality, poverty and the growth of slum populations in Asia Pacific has the potential, if left unaddressed, to threaten social sustainability. While reductions in the numbers in absolute poverty are a major achievement, the challenge for Asia Pacific governments is to continue economic development in an environmentally sustainable manner, with the benefits of growth more widely and equitably shared. There is a growing middle class in many developing countries in the region. However many of the countries with a growing middle class are those with the greatest persistence of mass absolute poverty and with growing income inequality. The relatively wealthy can often privately provide services such as clean water, security and reliable electricity, 33 Mutatkar, R.K.

The majority of the world\u2019s poor are now living in middle-\u00ad\u2010income developing countries and increasingly in slums in urban and peri-\u00ad\u2010urban areas. Table 2.7: Proportion of urban population living in slums and urban slum population by country 1990-\u00ad\u20102009 Source: UN-\u00ad\u2010HABITAT, The State of the World\u2019s Cities 2012/2013: Prosperity of Cities, 2012. pp. 124-\u00ad\u2010125. Assisting these poor requires a different response to the more familiar issue of rural poverty in the poorest developing countries. Whilst an oversimplification, urban poverty usually reflects the inability of people to find work in the formal economy, inadequate health and education services, and major infrastructure shortfalls in the provision of shelter, clean water and sanitation services. Community development and social inclusion are also important including consideration of the needs of particular groups such as the poor, women, the aged and disabled, and children. Governance in cities in Asia Pacific is in evolution, coming to grips with the need for broad community involvement in decision-\u00ad\u2010making with local representation and participation often poorly developed. DEVELOPING DYNAMIC, SUSTAINABLE CITIES These issues of economic, environmental and social sustainability need to be aggressively addressed to develop dynamic sustainable cities. Most of the problems in these areas have well known solutions and effective action is within the remit of \u2018city governance\u2019 at both central and city government levels. For example, UN-\u00ad\u2010HABITAT, the World Bank and Asian Development Bank have developed tool kits, examples and data bases of best practices that can be used and adapted by cities to improve sustainability. The quality of city governance is one of the most important barriers to improving the sustainability of cities in Asia Pacific. At the central government level, national urban strategies are often unclear and national decentralisation policies are not aligned with the tax bases of different levels of government. Issues of income inequality remain unaddressed by the national tax systems. At the city 21 Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific level, there is confusion over responsibility for the urban fringe and the functional responsibilities for city-\u00ad\u2010wide and more local services can be sub-\u00ad\u2010economic. Skilled, experienced urban professionals are in short supply. Community and business involvement in city government is at an early stage of development. Equity in access to land, housing and urban services is worsening. There are policy failings, inadequate city management, ineffective planning for urban growth, infrastructure and service shortfalls, and a complexity of resource and capacity constraints. City governments are having difficulty moving from a regulatory to a developmental role. These problems threaten to retard economic growth, lead to more informal settlements and poverty, and hamper the development of inclusive, equitable, liveable cities. Without major improvement in approaches to city governance in Asia Pacific, the problems and negative externalities of today will be magnified by the large scale of projected urban population growth over the next forty years. 22 Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific 3 OVERCOMING THE CHALLENGES OF URBANIZATION The previous section discussed trends, as well as the positive impacts and key challenges of urbanization in the region.

Successfully managing city growth is therefore central to improving development outcomes.

The issues of economic, environmental and social sustainability need to be aggressively addressed to develop dynamic sustainable cities. Most of the problems in these areas have well known solutions and effective action is within the remit of \u2018urban governance\u2019 at both central and city government levels. The following discussion aims to set out what needs to be done to overcome some of the challenges of urbanization facing the region. The discussion on this is presented under five urban systems headings and includes examples of best practices43 applied successfully in the region, which illustrate how some countries and cities have addressed these specific challenges. The final part of the discussion seeks to identify how UNDP, might help address these challenges within the framework of its four focus areas -\u00ad\u2010 Poverty Reduction, Democratic Governance, Crisis Prevention and Recovery, and Environment and Energy. CONCEPTUALIZING THE CHALLENGES OF URBANIZATION The challenges of urbanization across countries in the region occur at enormously different scales, scope, geography and levels of impact. The biggest challenge, as is illustrated below, is that its causes and effects are multi-\u00ad\u2010dimensional. Figure 3.1 shows a problem tree analysis of the challenges of urbanization and poverty reduction in the region. The core problem is that the management of urban systems in all their dimensions is failing to deliver sustainable development outcomes for cities. The consequences of these failures manifest themselves in many ways in the dysfunctions and inefficiencies of urban systems. The analysis in the figure (which could be expanded greatly) is indicative of some of the primary causes and effects of the failure in managing urbanization within the five principal urban systems that operate in cities and towns. In formulating country program strategies for UNDP to engage in urban sector activities, problem tree analysis provides a useful tool for identifying primary areas of focus for intervention and support. 42 UN-\u00ad\u2010HABITAT 2011.

The magnitude and variation of these across the countries of the region is significant, and each country will need to address these challenges in their own way.

Figure 3.2: UN-\u00ad\u2010Habitat Urban Governance Index47 Source: UN-\u00ad\u2010Habitat 2005. Policy Reforms There are three important policy reform agendas that require change if the challenges of urbanization in the region are to be addressed more effectively. Changing the Anti-\u00ad\u2010urbanization Policies of Governments: Many governments in the region still have strong anti-\u00ad\u2010urban policies. For example, several South Asian countries have only recently embraced the positive benefits of urbanization. Urbanization is often seen by policymakers as a problem rather than the solution to the development of a country. This perspective has also often been reinforced by the anti-\u00ad\u2010urban rhetoric of many international development agencies. Unfortunately, this has held back the development of nations and sub national regions. This strong anti-\u00ad\u2010urban bias is often expressed by rural and regional politicians, conscious of their political power base being eroded as constituents leave for a better future in cities. Winning recognition of urbanization as a positive force in development is still a significant policy challenge in many countries particularly in the Pacific and South Asia. 46 Auclair, C. and A.

Better information and knowledge programs are needed to inform politicians and policy makers of the benefits of urbanization in supporting the development of countries, national sub regions and, cities. Several countries like China48, Viet Nam49 and Indonesia have adopted urbanization strategies which are having an impact on shaping spatial, finance and economic policies for the development of the country. China\u2019s 12th Five Year Plan identifies urbanization as one of the most pressing challenges for the country and provides a strategy to address this. Decentralization and Devolution are important to developing strong local governments which are capable of operating under competitive and open market conditions. Many countries in the region have introduced policies to encourage decentralization; however, a major failure is that administrative decentralization has not been followed by financial decentralization and devolution. UNDP could assist countries in identifying and adapting best practices to achieve greater fiscal decentralization, especially at the sub-\u00ad\u2010provincial level. Unfortunately, there are few case studies that demonstrate good practice of devolution in the region, particularly at the sub-\u00ad\u2010national or sub-\u00ad\u2010provincial level. There are good examples of administrative devolution in countries like Malaysia and India, but there has been a general failure in the devolution in fiscal arrangements and subsidiarity between levels of government. The importance of devolution in achieving better governance has been demonstrated in Battambang as part of the decentralization program in Cambodia50. An important lesson in clarifying arrangements between governments is to ensure administrative powers are commensurate with levels of responsibility. This was the cause of failure of the decentralization policy in Indonesia in 1999. The initial laws granted equal powers between the provincial and local governments, which led to significant confusion. The laws were changed in 2004 to clarify the power sharing arrangements. In China, Malaysia and Australia, these powers are clearly defined, resulting in much more efficient urban governance systems operating in towns and cities. Corporate Governance Reforms Local governments throughout the region are struggling to carry out the responsibilities invested in them by various laws. Many are struggling to deal with democratic processes of government and governance. Key areas where urban governance reforms could help significantly to overcome some of these challenges include: Corporate Governance: With few exceptions, local government administrative systems across the region are weak, inefficient and generally inflexible. Many systems are still entrenched in colonial or outdated \u2018central planning\u2019 administrative and labour practices which are in need of reform. Few local governments have adopted corporate plans that set out public policies for urban development and the organizational and institutional arrangements for implementing them. Even less are engaged in participatory budgeting, allowing communities to have a greater say in how local governments spend public funds on infrastructure and providing essential urban services. Local governments in New Zealand and Australia have well-\u00ad\u2010established good practices in the development and implementation of corporate plans, which could be adopted more widely across the region. Reform of corporate governance practice is critical to the establishment of strong enabling environments to make cities attractive and competitive places for investment and doing business. Ahmadabad, in India, is one city that has significantly led urban governance reform practice in the South Asia region51. Naga, in the Philippines, is an example of a municipality that has undergone significant corporate governance reforms to improve its efficiency in the delivery of urban services52. 48 China Development Research Foundation, China's New Urbanization Strategy. 2013, Oxford: Routledge.

Nepotism, collusion and corruption are endemic in many national and local governments and are an anathema to the practices of transparency and accountability. Changing the institutional culture to more open governance is difficult. It requires a process of truth and trust building which can take many years to achieve. Two examples of good practice in transparency and accountability include Andhra Pradesh Reform of Property Taxation program53, India, and the Sleman (part of Yogyakarta)54 involving the introduction of a Performance Based Budgeting and Urban Management system. Sleman set a precedent for Indonesia for performance based budgeting, which has since been adopted elsewhere in the country. Participatory Governance: Unfortunately few urban governance processes in the region are transparent and accountable. Rent seeking and corruption are significant problems, undermining business and investor confidence, certainty and competitiveness, and the stability of urban finance, land and property markets. These challenges can be overcome by adopting more open and transparent governance and decision making processes. Essential measures that need to be introduced into provincial and local government include: participatory planning and budgeting; publishing of annual accounts; asset-\u00ad\u2010based accounting systems; independent auditor general reports and introduction of ethical standards and practices of public sector accounting. Change Management: Structural reforms to government processes and practices are often met with institutional resistance by public officials as they are perceived as threatening job security and their hold on power, and exposing unethical work practices. The failure to change the institutional governance systems leaves weaker local governments lagging far behind in competing for trade and investment; it results in a decline in the quality of urban services, and a further loss of confidence and trust in government. The introduction of new systems, work place practices, and technologies in public institutions requires care and must be preceded by programs of change management to build trust, confidence, and the willingness by management and employees of institutions to embrace change. However, the need for change management goes beyond public institutions. It needs to include businesses, public utilities, professional and community-\u00ad\u2010based organizations. Improved Planning and Management of Urban Development There are very few examples of effective planning and management of urbanization in the region. There are many reasons for this, but there is a need for a much stronger commitment by all levels of government to reforming planning systems and introducing more relevant plans to manage urbanization and development, fund plan implementation and enforce development control provisions. Key good practices that need to be introduced into the planning system across the region include: Integrated Strategic Development Planning: Many planning laws, regulations and systems for planning have changed little since the colonial or central planning era ended. Most of the region\u2019s urban planning practices are still orientated towards the use of master plans. Few countries have advanced towards strategic development planning, which is much more responsive to demand side needs of development and markets. Even fewer countries in the region have adopted integrated development planning and linked the development of infrastructure and land development to budgets and long-\u00ad\u2010term financial plans. New Zealand is one of the few countries in the region to have done this. The introduction of integrated spatial development planning and budgeting is an important challenge for urban management in the region if precious resources are not to be wasted and urban systems are to be made much more efficient. The importance of integrated planning for urban development is good practice and a vital element of managing the development of cities.

A good example of this is currently underway in Viet Nam, building upon work initiated by the Asian Coalition of Housing Rights (ACHR) and a UNDP/UN-\u00ad\u2010Habitat project to initiate a Community Development Fund (CDF) approach to urban poverty reduction and pro-\u00ad\u2010poor city planning in partnership with local government and other stakeholders in five secondary cities. With the support of ACHR in partnership with the Association of Cities of Viet Nam (ACVN), this approach is now being replicated in 16 cities in Viet Nam, a CDF network has been established (including 30 cities) and the ACVN has recently published an operations manual for community development funds57. The Cities Alliance is now supporting community-\u00ad\u2010based City Development Strategies with some of these cities, as well as strategic urban planning and management training for city authorities with the national Academy of Managers for Construction and Cities (AMCC). Development Control and Regulation Enforcement: Most large cities in the region have a range of detailed development control plans for urban areas. However, the failure to enforce the provisions of these plans and regulations, has led to significant illegal developments, which many public officials are unwilling to act upon. This lack of enforcement of development control provisions is undermining confidence in planning processes. It also leads to significant inefficiencies in urban land markets and exorbitant compensation costs for the acquisition of utility corridors when these have been illegally occupied. Getting governments to commit to enforcing the provisions of plans, development control instruments and adequately funding them is a major challenge to urban governance reform. Management of Peri-\u00ad\u2010urban Land: urban densities across the region are falling because of the poor management of land on the urban fringe in what is commonly referred to as the peri-\u00ad\u2010urban zone. Peri-\u00ad\u2010urban areas include expanded villages and towns, which constitute parts of cities and urban metropolises. Many of these high density peri-\u00ad\u2010urban areas in the region show characteristics that are similar to those of urban areas. Housing quality, labour force characteristics, educational attainment, and the travel behaviour of the inhabitants of such \u201crural\u201d areas are similar to those of low to middle income communities in designated urban areas. Characterizing such areas as rural serves only to maintain the administrative and political status quo. http://www.citiesalliance.org/ca/sites/citiesalliance.org/files/cds-\u00ad\u2010me-\u00ad\u2010guidance-\u00ad\u2010framework-\u00ad\u2010august-\u00ad\u201011-\u00ad\u20102005[1].pdf [Accessed 21 November 2010].

Canberra: AusAID. 29 Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific Developing and Transitional Economies61 are examples of best practices demonstrating the importance of well-\u00ad\u2010maintained land registries for the orderly operation of urban land markets. There are good examples of land administration and management best practice in the Asia Pacific62. An AusAID study provides examples of some of the difficulties with land administration in the Pacific63. The Mama Graon -\u00ad\u2010 Vanuatu Land Program, a strategic initiative of the Government of Vanuatu, is a long term initiative aimed at improving decision making, making land dealings more transparent, improving land management procedures and practices in land management. This program should greatly reduce the potential for land conflict in the future and is a good example of developing and applying best practice in land administration and management to the leasing of land64. This program has particular relevance to dealing with customary land, which is an important issue affecting peri-\u00ad\u2010urban development in all Pacific island states. Leveraging Official Development Assistance Official Development Assistance (ODA) involving bilateral and multilateral development agencies and the international development banks plays an important role in supporting the development of many Asian countries. Foundations and NGOs also play an increasingly important role in supporting many projects. Without ODA assistance, many countries in the region would lag behind in their development. With the exception of the region\u2019s megacities, most local governments in the region have very limited knowledge and experience of working with international development agencies, particularly in knowing how to leverage public resources with ODA assistance. The success of leveraging is dependent on several factors: continuation of strong local leadership, a commitment to planning and plan implementation, creation of an enabling environment that provides investor confidence, an engaged community and good governance. A common factor in ODA assisted projects in urban areas that demonstrate good practice is designs which are flexible, have integrating frameworks, and involve multi sector activities. Agencies tend to steer away from these as they are more difficult to manage and have higher risk. Ironically, such projects have been shown in case studies to generate better outcomes than those which are confined to a narrow range of project activities. Another important factor particularly in terms of sustainability is projects that are supporting/strengthening government programs and where the financing is preferably on-\u00ad\u2010budget. Much of the success of these more integrated projects has to do with the quality and autonomy of local project management. Critical to the success of projects is the ability to build networks quickly, which enables the leveraging of local resources and connection to external sources of information and assistance. Naga City has been very successful in tapping into and leveraging international development assistance support to fund ongoing programs for institutional capacity building. Another good example was the Environmental Improvement of Nhieu Loc-\u00ad\u2010Thi Nghe Basin, Ho Chi Minh City, involving the Government of Viet Nam, HCMC Peoples committee and the World Bank in levering support for canal improvements to increase land values to pay for resettlement of dwellers along the canals. ISSUES OF URBAN ECONOMICS AND FINANCE The capacity to provide urban services and manage the development of cities is dependent on good urban economics and financial planning and management. Most local governments in the region have a heavy reliance on grants and subsidies from central government, either because they are restricted by central government from raising local revenues or underutilize their own capacity to do so. Significant changes are needed in urban economics and financial planning and management arrangements across the region to develop the capacity of cities to finance and provide essential infrastructure and services.

International investors look for investment opportunities in cities with less complicated regulations and with investor-\u00ad\u2010friendly enabling environments. The role of urban governance is shifting from a total focus on service delivery to strengthening location competitiveness by seeking to build competitive advantage in strategic infrastructure, human capital, liveability, creativity and innovation. Urban regions that offer the greatest competitive advantage develop faster, increasing in size and wealth. They have evolved into often very large conurbations and attract the greatest share of national and foreign investments. The less competitive cities have been left struggling to catch up, especially in more remote secondary city regions that have generally poor infrastructure and limited skilled persons and resources. An important focus for cities seeking to enhance their competitive advantage is to strengthen the drivers of competitiveness, especially the enabling environment created by institutions and the administrative processes and laws. Strengthening local education institutions and their civic engagement is also mutually beneficial and helps target both skill development and higher quality employment opportunities. Another important initiative in fostering the competitiveness of cities is the development of industry clusters. Industry clusters seek to encourage the development of agglomeration economies where transaction costs between firms can be reduced by having access to common services, infrastructure and logistics systems. Clusters also stimulate competition encouraging innovation and creativity, and levels of specialization in different parts of industry supply chains. There are many examples of best practice industry cluster development to be found in the region65. Local Economic Development Planning One of the difficult challenges associated with urbanization is how to create opportunities for investment and jobs. Facilitating local economic development (LED) activities is particularly important in creating enabling environments that are attractive to investment, development and the revitalization of cities. This is a particularly difficult challenge for secondary cities and in the countries of the Pacific region. Job creation is the focus of the World Bank\u2019s 2012 World Development Report66, which outlines a number of important initiatives cities can take to strengthen and develop their economies. Preparation of local economic development plans provides a framework for guiding public and private sector investment in cities. However, an important good practice is to link city development strategies, with corporate, strategic land use and investment development plans. There are examples of good practice local economic development to be found across the region. The Lioadong Peninsular Revitalization and Nanjing Inner-\u00ad\u2010City Redevelopment projects67 provide good examples of how governments can play a strategic or catalytic role in redevelopment leading to the revitalization of city economies. Cyberjaya, New Town satellite city development South of Kuala Lumpur has been successful in attracting significant IT business investment, but has involved substantial Malaysian Government support68. Bangalore, India, is an example of a business-\u00ad\u2010led investment growth pole; however, it provides a lesson on the failure of the city to fund the construction of infrastructure in advance of development. As a result, the city is losing its competitiveness to other Indian cities. There are many publications outlining examples of good practice LED69. 65 Choe, K.-\u00ad\u2010A. and B.H. Roberts, eds.

Fiscal Arrangements between levels of government: Many national governments are reluctant to cede taxation powers to local authorities commensurate with their service-\u00ad\u2010delivery functions. They also restrict the borrowing authority for local authorities, forcing them to be reliant on both general and specific-\u00ad\u2010purpose fiscal transfers from the national level. National governments, particularly ministries responsible for local government, often see this as an issue of maintaining \u201ccontrol\u201d. Increasingly ministries of finance and planning are recognizing that there are more efficient ways to align the impacts of local government expenditures and borrowings with national economic policy and priorities, and that there are big advantages in creating incentives for local governments to develop as more independent, financially viable institutions. Central controls need to be balanced with real local-\u00ad\u2010level decision-\u00ad\u2010making responsibilities and appropriate resources provided if the benefits of decentralization are to be achieved. These issues have all played a role in weak fragmented governance arrangements of most cities in Asia Pacific. The renegotiation of fiscal arrangements is essential as part of policies to introduce decentralization and devolution within countries. This must become a key focus of policy reform for urban governance across the region. Municipalities\u2019 Engaging in Capital Markets: Robust domestic resource mobilization is a key for sustainable urban development and in most countries there are markets and sufficient domestic resources to meet the needs of infrastructure financing. Local governments should be given incentives to improve their revenue collection, capital planning and financial management capacities, linked to policy reforms designed to give them greater powers and responsibilities to engage in capital markets through the issuing of bonds and access to loans and other financial instruments to fund infrastructure and provide essential urban services. Development bank lending for this purpose can in some cases bridge the gap for a while but cannot substitute for well-\u00ad\u2010established mechanisms to mobilize domestic capital. Increasing Property Tax and Revenue Collection: Very few local governments make an effort to collect the full property tax owing to them. Properties and land are not taxed at market value. Millions of land and property owners are behind in their tax payments or simply do not pay tax. Most local governments do not have a proper record of property tax collection. The need to reform local government taxation valuation systems is essential if local governments are to become more financially self-\u00ad\u2010sufficient and take up loans to fund the provision of infrastructure and other basic urban services. Several cities across the region, for example, Ahmadabad in India, and municipalities in the Philippines have established a market valuation system for land and property and have computerized their revenue collection system resulting in more than a doubling of income over a two-\u00ad\u2010year period from local taxes. Improved Financial Management Systems: Most local governments in Asia and the Pacific have not adopted modern public sector financial management practices, such as performance-\u00ad\u2010based budgeting and accrual accounting methods. Consequently, cash flow and financial mismanagement problems are a common occurrence. Many projects and programs undergo delays because of poor cash flow management, which increase the overall costs of government. These problems are compounded by the problems of lack of transparency and accountability in public sector financial management, which provide opportunities for corruption and rent seeking. The performance-\u00ad\u2010based budgeting and sound financial management introduced to the municipality of Sleman, part of Jogjakarta in Indonesia, is an excellent example of good financial management70. This municipality led the way for improved financial management for local governments in Indonesia. Another early example of a city in the region that established a credit rating to strengthen its capacity to raise capital from the financial markets is Ahmadabad in India. Since then, many other cities in the region have done so. The reforms needed for cities to become creditworthy are well known and not complicated. Creating incentives for this process in national policies and building local capacities is the hard part. Choe, K.-\u00ad\u2010A. and B.H. Roberts, eds.

While issues of community affordability have to be addressed, loss-\u00ad\u2010making public utilities erode the capital and financial base of cities, leading to the neglect or underfunding of other public services. Also, in many cases, poor government accounting has led to limited understanding of the financial performance of public utilities. A case study which provides a good example of cost recovery methods, especially in dealing with the urban poor is the Phnom Penh community development project funded by the ADB which involved a 50-\u00ad\u201050 infrastructure contribution between local government and the community demonstrating the willingness of poor communities to invest in improved urban services71. Ensuring utility cost recovery from user fees is a best practice advocated by the World Bank to cover a utility\u2019s costs in financing urban infrastructure projects72. Leveraging and Capitalizing of Public Assets Many cities have substantial land, fixed assets and infrastructure needed to provide essential urban services. However, poor planning and management has led to significant underutilization of these assets. Most cities do maintain a register of public land and assets. Many local governments have no idea of the value of their assets and what it costs to maintain them. Moreover, if public assets are not registered or appropriately valued, they cannot be collateralized as security for loan funds to finance infrastructure and other public utilities. There are four areas of opportunity to improve the management of urban assets: Maintenance of Urban Assets and Utilities: Many valuable assets, especially publicly owned land, property, buildings and transport systems and corridors are under-\u00ad\u2010utilized and/or under-\u00ad\u2010performing. Many assets are poorly maintained leading to inefficiencies and loss of revenue to local governments and utility agencies. A significant challenge for the region is to improve the utilization of urban assets and utilities. There is also a need to introduce more market-\u00ad\u2010based systems to curb an excess of demand and to enhance revenues. The introduction of asset management systems, management information systems and maintenance programming are important to achieving improved utilization of urban assets and utilities. Capitalization of Public Land: Local governments in most Asian countries own substantial public property and land, which can be sold or used as security to raise capital to fund public works projects. The Nhieu Loc-\u00ad\u2010Hie Nghe canal rehabilitation project in Ho Chi Minh City used land for leveraging capital through the sale of public housing to raise capital for major infrastructure improvement works to the city's canal and waste water management system. The sale of public housing provided the working capital to start the project and attract investment from the World Bank for ongoing stages of the canal rehabilitation and waste water management project. Private Sector Management of Public Assets: Efforts to increase private sector involvement in the provision of urban infrastructure and services is recognition, in part, of the failure of central and local governments to fund the demand for infrastructure and serviced land. Local governments will need to engage in public private sector partnerships (PPP), BOOT and BOT projects to be able to meet public funding shortages for the provision of basic infrastructure and services. Value capture: the inefficient operation of urban land markets has led to a situation where profiteering on property and land has become rampant. Local governments capture little value from these gains and often end up subsidizing infrastructure to new land 71 Khemero, B.H.S., Urbanization and Sustainability in Cambodia, in Urbanization and Sustainability in Asia: Case Studies of Good Practice B.H.

Land developers are reluctant to cover the cost of off-\u00ad\u2010site works and provide a full range of infrastructure to service houses and other buildings constructed in new land development areas. There is a need for governments to introduce policies and regulations that enable local governments to benefit from value capture from the granting of development rights or through market-\u00ad\u2010increased taxes where land values rise substantially. Reform of property transfer and land taxes is also needed to avoid the double payment system prevalent throughout Asia. The system involves reporting only a small proportion of the sale of property to land Registry offices and private payment of the balance to substantially reduce the obligation to pay taxes.

Micro Finance Micro finance is vital to the development of small business enterprises and home building in cities. Many small and medium scale enterprises have to access capital through the private money market at extortion rates of interest. The Grameen Bank founded in Bangladesh is a very successful model for micro finance developed for rural communities. The Women\u2019s Bank in Sri Lanka and Shakli Foundation in Pakistan also present good examples of best practices in mobilizing community savings and responding to the community members\u2019 through the wide variety and levels of loans being offered (from consumption goods to housing)73. The foundation banking network now operates in several cities of the country. Similar micro financing initiatives can be found in other developing countries of Asia. ISSUES OF URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS Reducing the backlog of infrastructure, land and housing is a big challenge. Asian cities have a backlog of infrastructure amounting to many hundreds of billions of dollars. Without substantial investment in public transport systems, water supply, waste management and flood mitigation works, many Asian cities will struggle with serious environmental problems for years to come. It is not just the backlog of hard infrastructure projects that is creating problems for urban development. Soft infrastructure shortfalls involving the provision of research and development, education and learning facilities, technology and communications and improved security pose significant challenges for the development of cities across the region. Infrastructure Backlog In many instances, infrastructure in cities across the region is in very poor condition or overloaded. The backlog in infrastructure is the biggest barrier in attracting investment into the countries of the region. The problems of electricity supply, poor and inadequate road networks, grossly inefficient seaports and airports have made the costs of logistics in a country like Indonesia among the highest in Asia74. There are several critical areas for attention to address this backlog. Infrastructure Finance: Critical to the delivery of infrastructure in urban areas across the region is improving the level and access to infrastructure finance. Joint-\u00ad\u2010ventures, PPP, private sector capital and public financial instruments need to be developed to provide funds for infrastructure. In some cases capital markets have to be developed by tapping into insurance and pension funds. Part of the success of the development of Singapore has been the ability of its government to raise capital for infrastructure and housing through contributions from pension funds. Cost recovery is an essential requirement in the funding of infrastructure, with provision for subsidies only where these can be justified. Opportunities for funding infrastructure through CDM and other greenhouse gas offset mechanisms should also be made available to local governments to ensure that externalized environmental costs are accounted for in all infrastructure projects. The City Development Initiative for Asia (CDIA) and toolkit for Urban Infrastructure and Investment75 have best practice approaches to infrastructure delivery including finance, public private sector partnerships and management. The ESCAP CITYNET publication on 73 Haider, M., Pakistan, in Urbanization and Sustainability in Asia: Good Practice Approaches in Urban Regional Development, B. Roberts and T.

The ADB publication Developing Best Practices for Promoting Private Sector Investment in Infrastructure cites many good examples of best practice approaches to delivery of infrastructure services in cities77. Protection of Utility Corridors and Sites: the cost of providing basic infrastructure and services in many cities across the region is greatly increased by the failure to protect utility corridors and sites from illegal development. More than 50% of project budgets for inner-\u00ad\u2010city roads are often spent on land acquisition, demolition and resettlement costs. Local governments for political and other reasons are often reluctant to take action to remove illegal constructions on utility corridors and sites, so that the clearance of these areas can take many years causing long delays to the delivery of infrastructure.

Many utilities end up costing more than the revenues they collect, resulting in significant subsidies from central government to maintain basic levels of service. The need for reform of utilities is essential to improving their efficiency and effectiveness. Local governments need to identify opportunities to change the ownership and management model of utilities as part of their urban governance reform agenda to improve infrastructure delivery and quality. Improved Technologies: The use of old, often labour-\u00ad\u2010intensive, technologies greatly reduces the performance of urban infrastructure, undermining competitiveness and increasing the cost of services. The need for new technologies to improve the efficiency of urban infrastructure is a high priority in many countries. Electricity and telecommunication services in most cities across the region could be improved substantially by the introduction of new switching gear and replacement cabling. Broadband internet is a high priority for investment in business areas associated with information technology and financial services. Improved technologies can also greatly improve the management of water supply and waste treatment systems by reducing energy consumption. Politics of Infrastructure: Urban governments usually focus on infrastructure and other construction projects during their term of office in order to get re-\u00ad\u2010elected. Many governments instead of continuing the previous government\u2019s plans and programs develop another in opposition and end up cancelling previous plans and projects. This results in the disjointed and inefficient delivery of infrastructure. Political negotiations at times can also lead to redirection of planned projects towards the desire of the ruling government. There is a need to remove decisions about the provision of infrastructure outside the political cycle as much as possible. This is easier said than done; however, there are mechanisms (independent regional utility authorities, private sector franchise management of infrastructure and long-\u00ad\u2010term loan funds agreement conditions) that can help depoliticize infrastructure investment programs. One successful way of depoliticizing urban infrastructure is through the introduction of community based budgeting, where it is left to the community to provide inputs into the formulation of capital works program for cities. This was a very successful innovation in the city of Naga in the Philippines, where taxes were raised on the condition that the community would have an input into the formulation of the city\u2019s infrastructure and capital works program. Development of Integrated Public Transport Asia Pacific region countries are failing to build sufficient road network capacity to accommodate the expansion of private vehicle use. Even where cities are managing to keep up with the pace of development, existing networks accommodating private vehicle use are becoming overloaded. Traffic congestion is adding greatly to transaction costs in cities. Local governments have no choice but to plan for increasing the level of patronage on public transport if traffic congestion is to be reduced. In order for them to do so 76 UNESCAP & CITYNET, Sustainable Urban Transportation Systems -\u00ad\u2010 An Overview. 2012, United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific and CITYNET: Bangkok. 77 ADB, Developing Best Practices for Promoting Private Sector Investment in Infrastructure: Airports and Air Traffic Control. 2001, Asian Development Bank: Manila. 35 Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific there is a need for a massive program of investment in the management and delivery of public transport services. There is also need to introduce other measures such as road pricing, better land use planning and penalties to persuade urban communities to use public transport. There is also need for developing better integrated systems between different modes of transport in cities. Despite the problems of increased traffic congestion, there are many good examples of best practice traffic management which have been introduced in countries in the region. The importance of Integrated Transportation Systems servicing the local and national economies is illustrated by the approach taken in Singapore. Singapore is a global inter-\u00ad\u2010modal transportation hub. The approach take to plan and develop its transportation system is an example that provides a model for other Asian, but less so Pacific Island cities. While few cities in Asia, have the resources to develop a transportation system the standard of Singapore and Hong Kong, the approach taken to protecting corridors and road pricing for private use of motor vehicles are practices that will need to be introduced in larger cities across the region to reduce traffic congestion, accidents and vehicle pollution. Public transport is also vital for social participation and community integration of persons with disabilities, critical factors for realizing their basic human rights.

Land Development As much as 10-\u00ad\u201012 km\u00b2 of mostly rural land is converted to urban use every day in the Asia Pacific region80. Much of this development is poorly planned with urban utilities and services taking many years to be provided. There is mass speculation in land, so that land prices have become affordable to an increasingly smaller proportion of the population. In several Asian cities, land prices per square meter significantly exceed those in many developed world cities. Few local governments in Asia have attempted to become engaged in land banking to provide a reserve of land to be made available for low-\u00ad\u2010income housing and to stabilize land markets. Speculation results in the transfer of wealth to private individuals with little value capture occurring to government. Australian cities have many examples of land development agencies that hold a substantial portfolio of land, which it tenders to the private sector to develop a mix of public and social housing. The need for government to engage in the land market is important to ensuring that adequate provision can be made for housing the low income and disadvantaged and for the resettlement of squatters in areas that are not subject to environmental hazards and potential impacts of climate change. The establishment of land development authorities to be engaged in legitimate land banking activities is an important step in rationalizing the management and use of land\u2014especially in the peri-\u00ad\u2010urban areas. Urban Redevelopment and Revitalization Many larger cities in Asia are undergoing revitalization and redevelopment. This is not the case in Pacific Island nations, which are mostly at the primary stage of urbanization. Revitalization or redevelopment is particularly problematic because of very high land values. In most cases, strategic interventions and laws are needed by governments to acquire or assemble parcels of land to enable redevelopment to take place. Urban revitalization is essential to reducing severe environmental problems, especially along waterway systems. Some of the best examples of revitalization have been undertaken by redevelopment authorities. Urban redevelopment and revitalization offers particular opportunities for value capture by local government. Two good examples of 78 International Forum for Rural Transport and Development.

Urban Upgrading Slum Improvement Slum improvement programs are amongst the most challenging issues facing the management of cities in the region. In some Asian cities as much as 40% of the population is living in slum areas. At its most basic level, urban upgrading involves partnerships between slum communities and local authorities to improve the physical environment of slums. Urban upgrading programs are likely to include activities involving improving and/or installing basic infrastructure like water, sanitation, waste collection, access roads and footpaths, storm drainage, lighting, public telephones, etc. Upgrading also deals with regularizing security of land tenure and housing improvements, as well as improving access to social support programs (e.g., health, education) and municipal services (e.g., water, sanitation, waste collection, storm drainage, street lighting, paved footpaths, roads for emergency access). Several publications provide excellent case studies and methodologies for upgrading urban areas and improving slum housing.83 Affordable Housing Shelter remains one of the greatest challenges to improving the well-\u00ad\u2010being of people living in cities across the region.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "993a498c-924e-4802-8aa1-517d8372ef02": {"__data__": {"id_": "993a498c-924e-4802-8aa1-517d8372ef02", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategy-paper-sustainable-and-inclusive-urbanization-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strategy Paper: Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategy-paper-sustainable-and-inclusive-urbanization-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c9b37d7e113f9f880d31aeb2a59e525bd7d051c7e7c91ff4b110f50f365bafd4"}, "2": {"node_id": "0ba7f964-b774-4a5e-8b0d-e7b9477821c0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategy-paper-sustainable-and-inclusive-urbanization-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "679a617b1ce245863f654762425f0d53564ba9f0ac60fd46bbcbc7a82eac1d89"}}, "hash": "31194d31279a67f9aabe13dbf218fafbde2c602a96b9e01f4c156f3161cf8c4e", "text": "Housing is a social good which been recognized as a universal human right under international law84.

Lack of tenure security renders many people into a state of homelessness at very short notice. The key to housing provision is for governments to be proactive in keeping land affordable by guiding urban expansion rather than trying to restrict it. The UN-\u00ad\u2010Habitat publication Affordable Land and Housing in Asia86 provides a useful framework for a best practice approach to land and housing delivery. Best practices in land and housing delivery are those where government has a well developed land policy for the release of land, with housing and infrastructure provided by the private and NGO sectors87. Unfortunately, there are few examples of best practice approaches to housing delivery in Asia which demonstrate sustainability and affordability. Even in countries like Japan, the quality of housing for many remains poor. Until there are significant improvements to land administration and management systems and the stabilization of land markets through effective planning, affordable housing will remain a very significant challenge. Aside from keeping land affordable, another key element is for the government/city to guide and advocate with public and private sector lenders to develop loan packages and mechanisms that are appropriate and affordable to the urban poor. Since low-\u00ad\u2010income housing is a large market, it makes good business sense for the public and private sector to work together in developing sound and feasible lending packages that are demand-\u00ad\u2010oriented and capacity-\u00ad\u2010based. The IMPACT/DPUCSP case in the Philippines where the Development Bank of the Philippines was convinced to create a window for the urban poor is an example with some good lessons.

There are many challenges to overcome in developing the social systems for cities in the region.

Human capital development is not only required to strengthen the capacity and capability of local government and businesses but also community associations and NGOs.

Leadership: leadership is a significant factor in the weakness of good governance practice. Leadership can be individual, i.e. led by a mayor or it can be collective, such as a local government, or in partnership with community-\u00ad\u2010based organizations. One good example of collective leadership was the issue of infrastructure bonds by the Ahmadabad Municipal Corporation in India88. Another good example is the participatory budgeting and land tax reforms led by the Naga Metropolitan Development Council in the Philippines. This is an outstanding example of political leadership by the former Mayor, the late Jesse Robredo89. Without strong political and community leadership it is very difficult to develop trust and effect change, encourage innovation and introduce new ideas into urban communities. Strengthening Administrative Capacity in Local Governments and Urban Services Agencies: Local government is the weakest link in the public service delivery system. Adoption of computer-\u00ad\u2010based information management systems and new technologies have been slow and often resisted because it increases transparency, reduces opportunities for rent seeking, and often results in job losses. City governments often have weak capacity and competencies to design, finance, and implement policies and programs. There are also major capacity problems in special-\u00ad\u2010purpose authorities, such as electricity supply and water supply utilities. Too many capacity building initiatives are focused upon reform of departments, rather than improving systems related to finance, delivery of public services, provision of housing and infrastructure. Programs to build capacity which are more integrated, holistic, and action-\u00ad\u2010 orientated in approaches to institutional capacity building and learning are required to improve the collection and delivery systems of local governments. Innovation and change are important to the modernization of urban management systems. Urban systems are dynamic and are continuously undergoing changes driven by external and internal factors. For cities to maintain their competitiveness, the enabling environment must continue to support innovation, creativity and adaptive processes to urban management, urban design and technology. Much of the contemporary thinking behind innovation comes from the ideas of Richard Florida. These need to be considered carefully in the context of Asian Pacific cities, which do not have the same wealth, infrastructure and strength of 88 Mathur, O.P., India, in Urbanization and Sustainability in Asia: Good Practice Approaches in Urban Regional Development, B.

Networks and Community Engagement Networks and Partnerships are important to knowledge development, business development and good governance. There are good examples of network and partnership development to be found in local government across the region. The Iloilo Metropolitan Development Council initiative in the Philippines uses networking and partnerships for an integrated development planning of urban infrastructure projects91. The Jembrana Community Development Project92, Bali, is an example of a best practice in an integrated approach to the improvement of health and education services. The network of over 150 cities in Asia Pacific working on citywide upgrading and supported by the Asian Coalition for Community Action Program (ACCA) of ACHR is another good example. Building networks takes time. It is a learning process, involving the development of trust, information sharing and cooperation between communities, individuals, businesses and public institutions. The advantage of local governments developing strong learning and information sharing networks is that they can help to leverage resources, improve the sharing of knowledge and foster opportunities for collaboration and cost savings. The Pacific Cities Sustainability Initiative (PCSI) is a good example of a collaborative forum that harnesses the expertise of Pacific Rim cities in sustainable development to facilitate collaboration and sharing of best practices among businesses, governments, academia, and the public93.

A project undertaken in 2003 involving the delivery of a program of health care services in Chittagong, Bangladesh, demonstrated the importance of engaging communities to win trust in adopting a preventative and integrated approach to health care management for the urban poor (Islam, 2006:60). The Jembrana community development program citied above was successful in reducing the costs and the delivery effectiveness of drugs leading improvements in local health care services. The engagement of communities in audits of the quality and quantity health care, environmental conditions, infrastructure and housing enables local governments to make a better assessment of deficiencies in the provision and delivery of urban services, infrastructure, and housing. Poverty Reduction Urbanization has impacted greatly on reducing poverty in countries across the region. However, poverty is becoming increasingly urbanized. Gini coefficients in many Asian countries are higher in cities than rural areas when cost of living adjustments are taken into account94. The causes of poverty are well known and documented, and the solutions require substantial investment in job creation activities, a better educated workforce, a governance system supportive of creativity, innovation and micro-\u00ad\u2010enterprise development; and education programs focused on reducing illiteracy, discrimination and ignorance. The World Bank Development Report (2012) notes many causes of poverty; however, the fundamental reason is the lack of jobs and underutilization of labour capacity. Given that there will be no net gain in employment in rural areas in Asia after 2020, the battle against poverty will only be won in cities.

Mobile telephone networks have bypassed a generation of technology based on copper wires, greatly improving the level of access people have to information in communities across the region. Other forms of knowledge dissemination; however, are still limited through low reading and computer technology literacy rates, ignorance and discrimination by class, culture and religion. This results in inequities in access to employment, finance, legal and education services, condemning many in cities to living a life in poverty. Programs to enhance knowledge dissemination in cities, particularly through improved literacy and community education programs, are important to overcome the widening knowledge gap occurring in many urban communities across the region. This is a particular problem in the Pacific island states, which will require significant capacity building of hard and soft infrastructure to lift literacy and education levels. Integrated Urban Systems Management and Information and Data Sharing: The development of integrated management information systems for the whole of government approach to city management is being adopted in many large cities. A good example of this is the Operations Centre of the City of Rio de Janeiro. This system was designed by IBM at the request of Rio\u2019s mayor to build a citywide system integrating data from some 30 agencies, all under a single roof. It is the handiwork of an IBM unit called Smarter Cities95. The integrated data management centre has laid the groundwork for multibillion-\u00ad\u2010dollar business expansion of Rio, with the system streaming operations of agencies and reducing duplication. The effect is the reduction of transaction costs for business. The system is also being used for emergency management, so that authorities can advise vulnerable communities of potential disasters that may result for heavy rains and flooding in the city. ISSUES OF URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS The propensity for governments across the region to allow urban and economic development at the cost of the destruction and pollution of the environment, believing environmental issues can be resolved once a nation has achieved a certain level of development, was first identified by Kuznets96 almost 6 decades ago. The environmental costs of development \u2013 pollution, congestion, wastes, flooding, loss of biodiversity \u2013 have been large and a significant drag on productivity, public health and well-\u00ad\u2010 95 Vieira, A., Mission Control Built for Cities. 2012, The New York Times: New York. 96 Kuznets, S., Toward a theory of economic growth, in National Policy for Economic Welfare at Home and Abroad, R.

The following outlines some of the important issues in improving the management of urban environmental systems. Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation The Asia Pacific region\u2019s exposure and sensitivity to climate change has the potential to have significant adverse impacts on the economic, social, natural and built environment of Asian cities98. Asian cities are likely to be among the most affected by climate change: their size, geographic location and elevation make them especially vulnerable to the impacts of climate change in the form of frequent extreme events such as droughts, floods, cyclones and heat waves99 . Climate change will increase the risk of storm and flood damage in many cities in the region. An OECD report100 found, for example, that Kolkata, Mumbai, Dhaka, Guangzhou, Ho Chi Minh City, Shanghai, Jakarta, Bangkok, Rangoon and Hai Phong \u2013 all situated in the tropics \u2013 are the world\u2019s most exposed cities to increased flooding due to climate change. More than 238 million people live in the low elevation coastal zone below 10 meters elevation101. Many of these cities will require substantial engineering works to reduce potential impacts of climate change events. Many millions, most living in poor housing in coastal slum settlements, will need to be relocated to provide greater protection from the more severe impacts of climate change. The increasing frequency and intensity of disasters is bringing about greater awareness by governments in the region of the need to adopt more sustainable climate risk management policies. Cities are not only prone to hydro-\u00ad\u2010meteorological disasters but also to seismic hazards. Much of New Delhi, for example, has grown over the last few decades in a highly seismic hazard zone. These extensive risks are in addition to the intensive risks (characterized by high intensity and low frequency disaster events) faced by cities.

Mitigation (reducing the causes) and adaptation (responding to impacts) strategies are needed to address the problem. The larger GHG-\u00ad\u2010producing nations and cities will need to give greater priority to mitigation measures \u2013 especially in reducing per capita demand for energy. The poorer, lower emitting nations will need to concentrate on adaptation. Appropriate mechanisms for developed economies to off-\u00ad\u2010set the costs of mitigation and adaptation in developing countries will need to be implemented urgently in the new framework negotiated to replace the Kyoto protocol on climate change. The UNEP, World Bank, UN-\u00ad\u2010Habitat joint working group on Cities and Climate Change has created a Knowledge Centre on Cities and Climate Change, as well as a standardized protocol for measuring greenhouse gas emissions in cities, a guide to adaptation in cities, and an Urban Risk Assessment Tool. Green City Development Many cities are moving towards the introduction of sustainable development policies which focus on the use of cleaner energy, cleaner production, industrial ecology, recycling, increasing the density of cities and city tree planting schemes. If cities are to become more sustainable, then they must become greener in the way they approach the use of resources, urban design, building materials and building design, and the amount of energy, water and other non-\u00ad\u2010renewable resources they use. Designing liveable spaces in this way can also be a great source of civic pride, better quality urban lifestyles and social cohesion. Local governments can benefit from committing to these policy changes and practices and provide incentives to the private sector to move away from less sustainable forms of urban development.

Studies of best practice environmental improvement and management projects, such as the Liaodong Peninsular Revitalizing Rustbelt Industries, in North East China, demonstrate the value of environmental restoration works leading to substantial reduction in pollution and improvement in water quality. Integrated decision making, sharing information between agencies and a strong political commitment to environmental management were key factors in the improvements to the Pra Sae River in Muang Klaeng, Thailand103. The Putrajaya lake restoration project in Kuala Lumpur is perhaps one of Asia\u2019s best practice examples of the reconstruction of urban wetlands and has resulted in substantial improvements to water-\u00ad\u2010quality and recreation space104. The case of Cheonggyecheon Stream Restoration in Seoul, Korea, is a good example of water quality restoration of a heavily polluted stream, which has been restored as an urban green space105. Provision of Basic Infrastructure and Services to Urban Poor Communities By far the most vulnerable urban residents to negative environmental impacts, natural disasters and climate change impacts are the urban poor who live in communities without access to clean water, basic sanitation, storm water drainage and solid waste management. Many of these communities are on the urban periphery and they are more likely to be in areas of higher risk to flooding or landslides, etc. These residents are already suffering from negative environmental impacts on their health, safety and well being that the provision of basic infrastructure and services would substantially ameliorate.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9125e66e-b5e8-4292-bfe0-3fb42b8b676a": {"__data__": {"id_": "9125e66e-b5e8-4292-bfe0-3fb42b8b676a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategy-paper-sustainable-and-inclusive-urbanization-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strategy Paper: Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategy-paper-sustainable-and-inclusive-urbanization-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "75c263da9d8aa761b919892a77bf709b78dfc0c0c78aa5f80d9f418d41a3575f"}, "2": {"node_id": "99a8d883-9a0a-4d55-b667-a9f0a6ceb533", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategy-paper-sustainable-and-inclusive-urbanization-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c64b821dd2172f11efe56686fbe45b964d6906f3515293046152f38563784110"}}, "hash": "a249c7f1c733968837ac79f8f85f6e6043bd7ec2dc5d0e66adb520e733d93dd0", "text": "While cities across the region are replete with multiple, often aid-\u00ad\u2010donor driven, projects focused on climate change and carbon emissions, and while many of these give lip service to the urban poor being the most vulnerable, precious few address the obvious remedy which is to provide these communities with basic infrastructure and services.

Based upon consultations with UNDP\u2019s Country Offices in the region107 there also appear to be strong constituencies at the country-\u00ad\u2010level for this focus and for a UNDP strategy to help countries in the region sustain their economic growth by more fully realizing the potential benefits of urbanization in promoting the growth of cities which are inclusive, resilient and sustainable. BACKGROUND UNDP has a long history of involvement in urban projects in the Asia and Pacific region spanning over three decades. In the 1980s these projects ranged from the National Urban Development Strategy and Integrated Urban Development Planning projects in Indonesia, which paved the way for the decentralized planning of urban infrastructure investments in the country, to a series of housing and urban development projects in Bangladesh which helped prepare the first urban development investments in Dhaka by both the World Bank and the ADB. Most of these projects were implemented in partnership with UN-\u00ad\u2010Habitat.108 While the 1980s was still a time when many developing country governments and most of their donor partners continued to focus on misguided and uniformly failed efforts to stop urban growth, in 1986, the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD held its first ever meeting focused on urban development. Significantly, the meeting\u2019s background papers were prepared jointly by UNDP, The World Bank and UNCHS (UN-\u00ad\u2010Habitat). That same year these three agencies, again working together, but this time with a number of bilateral partners (including the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Germany), launched the Urban Management Program (UMP) designed \u201cto improve the contribution which cities and towns make to sustainable development in the fields of participatory governance, reduction of urban poverty and urban environmental management.\u201d109 In addition to supporting regional and country based urban management initiatives, the UMP published a series of excellent guidelines and working papers most of which remain to this day both relevant and useful for local authorities and their development partners.110 In the early 1990s the UMP decentralized its management structure setting up a regional office for Asia and the Pacific in Kuala Lumpur which then also helped spawn the Urban Management Programme for Asia and the Pacific (UMPAP) including partnerships with the UN\u2019s Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT) in Bangkok and 15 countries in the region. In the meantime ESCAP had helped establish CITYNET to enhance cooperation among local authorities in the region. During this period UNDP\u2019s policy bureau also had a small urban unit in its governance division which published UNDP\u2019s first urban strategy paper entitled \u201cCities, People and Poverty: Urban Development Cooperation for the 1990s\u201d. 106 UNDP Administrator\u2019s forward to UNDP\u2019s Annual Report 2011/2012. 107 Conference calls with UNDP\u2019s country offices in Malaysia, India, China, Fiji, Iran, Samoa, Mongolia, Bhutan, Viet Nam, Philippines and a field visit to Bangladesh, as well as consultations with UNDP\u2019s Asia-\u00ad\u2010Pacific Regional Centre (APRC) teams on Poverty Reduction, Democratic Governance, Environment and Energy, Crisis Prevention and Recovery, Gender and HIV, Health and Development. 108 During the 1980s, UNDP financed over 90% of UN-\u00ad\u2010Habitat\u2019s technical cooperation activities in the region, when the then called United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat) in effect served as UNDP\u2019s technical cooperation arm for housing and urban development.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}",

"text": "by the sharing of information among the key agencies focused on urban development, as well as collaborative support to policy dialogues and strategic partnerships in urban program design, implementation and capital investment follow-\u00ad\u2010up in cities across the region. Unfortunately UNDP\u2019s engagement in urban programmes appears to have peaked by the mid-\u00ad\u20101990s, when it began to diversify its program activities in the region. While there are a few notable exceptions at the country level there is also no question that UNDP\u2019s partnerships with development agencies focused on urban issues have weakened, in particular UNDP\u2019s formerly strong and strategic urban programming partnerships with the World Bank and UN-\u00ad\u2010Habitat112. In the meantime the stakes have become much higher since Asia\u2019s growing economies have forcefully demonstrated the direct link between urbanization and economic growth. In nations across the region economic growth is being driven by the growth and productivity of their cities. While poverty is also rapidly urbanizing and inequality growing, it is now widely recognized that cities are the prime generators of employment and that their economic activities also strengthen rural development and rural productivity. Indeed there is no doubt that urbanization in Asia has helped lift several hundred million people out of poverty with positive impacts in both urban and rural areas. As is well documented in the State of Asian Cities 2010/2011 report, 113 cities are not only hubs of innovation and places for economic development but they provide unique opportunities for social mobility, for breaking-\u00ad\u2010down traditional gender roles, for achieving social justice, and for the creation of a large and rapidly growing educated middle class that is information savvy and globally connected. RESPONDING TO THE OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES OF RAPID URBANIZATION While cities now occupy centre stage in Asia\u2019s economic growth and development, the opportunities and challenges posed by rapid urbanization are not yet reflected in most national policies and plans114, or in the development priorities or strategies of UNDP. This was born out by feedback from UNDP\u2019s country offices that uniformly welcomed this initiative for UNDP to possibly re-\u00ad\u2010engage in urban activities under its four focus areas. Almost all country offices expressed the need for a more strategic partnership with cities and local governments recognizing, as is noted above, that they are on the front line of delivering results in UNDP\u2019s core focus areas. While some country offices in the region have important programs in place either with ministries responsible for local government, or with one or more urban local authorities, most expressed a need for a more strategic approach to build on UNDP\u2019s cross-\u00ad\u2010sectoral programming capacity. Moreover, in most countries in the region poverty is still seen as a rural issue, notwithstanding that across the region all growth of poverty is now taking place in cities and that gini coefficients for major cities in the region are higher than the national average when cost of living factors in cities is taken into account115. The issues raised by UNDP\u2019s country offices as quoted below can be broadly grouped into four categories \u2013 Policies and Strategies, Governance and Empowerment, Poverty and Vulnerability, and Environment and Energy: (i) Policies & Strategies: \u2022 The rural bias is still strong with urban growth still seen as a problem by many government officials and policy makers; \u2022 National government does not have an urban policy; 111 Participation, rule of law, transparency, responsiveness, consensus orientation, equity, effectiveness and efficiency, accountability, strategic vision, subsidiarity and security (ref the TGUI Institutional Profile in Environment & Urbanization Vol 15 No 1 April 2003). 112 As a partial reflection of this, as of 2011, less than 10% of UN-\u00ad\u2010Habitat\u2019s technical cooperation activities were financed by UNDP (ref UN-\u00ad\u2010Habitat 2011 Country Activities Report). 113 The State of Asian Cities Report 2010/11 was a collaborative effort between UN-\u00ad\u2010HABITAT, UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), UN Environment Programme (UNEP), and the United Cities and Local Governments \u2013 Asia-\u00ad\u2010Pacific Regional Section (UCLG-\u00ad\u2010ASPAC). 114 With a few important exceptions, including China, Bangladesh and Bhutan where urbanization is a priority issue in their national development plans. 115 ADB (2012).

(ii) Governance & Empowerment: \u2022 Urban governance and capacity is weak and there is no real visioning particularly in secondary cities; \u2022 Legal framework for devolution and strengthening urban governance, including local participation and voting rights is weak; \u2022 Disconnect between national and local level in planning and budgeting; \u2022 Decentralization has only been at the rhetorical level; \u2022 Fiscal decentralization is limited and local authorities have little authority and even fewer resources; \u2022 No public engagement in decision making; \u2022 Limited opportunities for meaningful participation of women and youth; \u2022 Urban growth is outpacing the plan; \u2022 Governance on periphery is unclear or prevue of district government; \u2022 Developments on urban periphery taking place in haphazard manner increasing risks and vulnerabilities; \u2022 Enthusiasm level of many secondary city leaders is high; and \u2022 Land tenure and customary land issues are met with extreme caution by politicians.

(iv) Environment & Energy: \u2022 Environmental agenda is disconnected from priorities of urban poor; \u2022 Urbanization links to environmental sustainability yet opportunities for energy efficiency and demand reduction are not realized; \u2022 GEF and the other major environmental funding sources rarely fund local initiatives; \u2022 Rapid motorization and overcrowding associated with urbanization brings serious health consequences; \u2022 Growing impacts of urban emissions and waste on the health of people are not well understood and communicated; \u2022 We need to listen more carefully to cities and poor urban communities about their environmental priorities; \u2022 Peri-\u00ad\u2010urban areas and secondary cities are often most vulnerable to natural disasters; and \u2022 The urban poor are most vulnerable to climate change impacts as they often live in environmentally vulnerable sites. While countries across the Asia Pacific region are obviously unique and very diverse in the scale and pace of their urbanization, the above-\u00ad\u2010cited issues are broadly consistent with the analysis of urban development challenges outlined in the first part of this report. At the same time, as is described below, there are several good examples of UNDP initiatives at the country level that are responding to these challenges. However, with urban development priorities still missing or marginalized in most UNDAFs and UNDP country programmes, it is clear that to assist governments to respond to the challenges and opportunities of rapid urbanization, UNDP does indeed require a more strategic approach. 46 Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific 5 DEVELOPING A UNDP ASIA PACIFIC URBAN STRATEGY Focusing on cities in the Asia Pacific region would greatly strengthen UNDP\u2019s ability to achieve each of these development outcomes since cities are where economic growth, poverty reduction, social inclusion, participatory governance, risk reduction and environmental impacts and social determinants of health can all be acted upon with immediate impacts on citizenry. This is also in line with UNDP\u2019s \u201cagenda for organizational change\u201d which the Administrator launched in 2011, to strengthen UNDP\u2019s role and capacity to help developing countries make transformational change and to channel the strengths of the entire UN development system to that end. Since this change agenda recognizes that UNDP has to be more focused on what services are most needed and where, the case to focus on sustainable and inclusive economic growth in the cities in Asia & the Pacific could not be more timely and compelling.

STRENGTHENING PARTNERSHIPS TO SCALE-\u00ad\u2010UP IMPACTS Achieving impact at scale requires UNDP to facilitate and strengthen strategic urban partnerships to: (i) build on existing initiatives at both the country and city level to achieve much greater coherence of effort among the many development partners supporting cities; (ii) integrate urban issues into national development policies and plans and the UNDAF; (iii) strengthen linkages between technical cooperation and the planning and implementation of capital investments in infrastructure and services that are being made in the region\u2019s cities; and (iv) increase support for research and knowledge dissemination to bring about changes in the policies and practices used in managing the growth and development of cities. This will require strengthening partnerships at four levels: (i) With community based organizations and their networks, helping to empower them to engage in local development in 116 UNDP Draft Strategic Plan Narrative and RRF. Third Draft, 17 July 2013. 47 Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific partnership with local authorities117 UNDP needs to establish strategic alliances with local organizations of urban poor communities and their federations. CBOs have networks within cities, at the national level and across the region to promote a community driven approach to poverty reduction and pro-\u00ad\u2010poor urban development in partnership with local authorities. Most of these networks also have well developed processes to share their experience and promote learning. Many of these are supported by the Asian Coalition for Housing Rights (ACHR) -\u00ad\u2010 a regional network of community organizations, NGOs and professionals actively involved with urban poor development processes in Asian cities, as well as by the global platform of Slum Dwellers International (SDI) \u2013 a global network of organizations of the urban poor. ACHR has been supporting this process in cities across the region for several decades and has a well-\u00ad\u2010developed methodology that strategically targets citywide actions and partnerships with local authorities. Over the last several years this work has been further scaled-\u00ad\u2010up with grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation which helped ACHR launch the Asian Coalition for Community Action Program (ACCA). The ACCA program is currently supporting citywide upgrading initiatives in well over 150 cities over 15 countries across the region. Community savings groups (almost all of which are managed by women) in these cities have generated over $15 million in savings, leveraging over $35 million in local government investments in community infrastructure. UNDP\u2019s engagement in support of these and similar initiatives at the country level (see box 7 on Bangladesh) could provide huge value added, particularly in collaboration with UN-\u00ad\u2010Habitat, to help strengthen the vertical linkages between these community based initiatives and national policies and programs, and to help institutionalize support mechanisms at the national level to facilitate and sustain a structural change in the relationship between urban poor communities and their cities.118 The potential scale of the impacts of this structural change could well be on a par with that of the Grameen Bank on the world of micro-\u00ad\u2010finance. (ii) With civic leaders in the business community and local financial and education institutions, to align efforts with local authorities around local economic development and job creation Aligning the efforts of local civic leaders in the private and educational sectors around the goal of quality job growth can drive the city\u2019s future economic growth. These leaders have a shared interest in their city\u2019s ability to deliver the competitive environment that both businesses and the city need for growing investment, production and employment.

Job creation is a local process that must be nurtured by civic leadership with incentives and public-\u00ad\u2010private partnerships that are sharply focused on this goal. Particular areas of focus for such partnerships should be on reducing unnecessary regulations and barriers to entry, particularly for the informal sector, as well as on taking into account efficiency gains from timely, complementary infrastructure that can reduce costs and increase business efficiency in both the formal and informal sectors. Including both educators and students in this dialogue is also critical. Engaging them in thinking about their potential present and future roles in this process can both sharpen skill development, help inspire entrepreneurial aspirations and expand opportunities for internships. (iii) With mayors and local government associations, to strengthen their dialogue with regional and national authorities Cities learn best from each other and this \u2018peer\u2019 learning promotes innovation119, as well as competition. In almost all countries of the region there are national associations of cities and local government that facilitate a dialogue among city leaders that positions them both to learn from each other, as well as to have a stronger voice in the policy making that affects them at the national level. The Association of Cities in Viet Nam, the League of Cities of the Philippines and the Municipal Association of Bangladesh among others also actively support their respective National Urban Forums, which institutionalize a platform to promote the dialogue among cities, government agencies, the private sector, NGOs/CBOs, academics, professionals and donor agencies with the aim of improving national urban development policies and urban management120. As has been demonstrated in Bangladesh, UNDP\u2019s active 117 Note: As per the Evaluation of UNDP\u2019s Contribution to Strengthening Local Governance (UNDP, 2010) \u2013 \u201cUNDP has not played a sufficiently pro-\u00ad\u2010active role in engaging with civil society, thus distracting from efforts to strengthen local governance. Strengthening these partnerships is also consistent with UNDP\u2019s change agenda that calls for the organization to establish \u201cstronger collaboration with existing partners and a step change in partnerships with the global South and other stakeholders\u201d. 118 The Community Organization Development Institute (CODI) in Thailand is a model for this type of support mechanism. 119 UNDP\u2019s crisis prevention and recovery team has ongoing \u2018peer\u2019 learning with local governments in the region. 120 Pakistan and Nepal also have national urban forums. 48 Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific engagement and support to these organizations and urban forums at the country level can be both strategically important and mutually beneficial, not only to give cities a stronger voice in the formulation of more effective national urban policies, but also in producing national economic development plans and UNDAFs that explicitly support inclusive and sustainable urban growth. (iv) With development organizations supporting cities in the region, to strengthen partnerships and enhance alignment across sectors towards shared objectives The Asian Development Bank, the World Bank and UN-\u00ad\u2010Habitat121 each have considerable urban development expertise, technical capacities and decades of experience in working with cities in the Asia Pacific region. They also each have clear corporate urban strategies that are up-\u00ad\u2010to-\u00ad\u2010date and instructive as to their priorities (see Boxes 1-\u00ad\u20103). These three organizations, as well as ESCAP, also produce a whole range of knowledge products analysing policy options to address the specific challenges of urbanization in the Asia Pacific region.122 Working together with other multilateral and bilateral development agencies, they have developed a number of alliances and partnerships focused on urban issues, including The Cities Alliance (see Box 4), CITYNET, The Cities Development Initiative for Asia (CIDA), the Pacific Region Infrastructure Facility (PRIF), etc. The regional secretariats of United Cities and Local Governments Asia-\u00ad\u2010Pacific (UCLG-\u00ad\u2010ASPAC), as well as ICLEI Oceania, also serve as important knowledge management hubs for local governments in the region. In addition most UN agencies and many bilateral development agencies have projects in cities across the region. However, the multiplicity of urban projects seldom results either in citywide let alone in nationwide impacts (indeed, the projectization of cities is part of the problem not the solution).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a47b38f-3710-420f-ae84-c9d2cf836090": {"__data__": {"id_": "7a47b38f-3710-420f-ae84-c9d2cf836090", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategy-paper-sustainable-and-inclusive-urbanization-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strategy Paper: Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategy-paper-sustainable-and-inclusive-urbanization-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "079968e71b16224189a70c067097ce5b0505be8288c15c7a12cf3bf6fc644194"}, "2": {"node_id": "834f4c09-5f58-4aff-a460-5eae06968e76", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategy-paper-sustainable-and-inclusive-urbanization-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0348af49f823c4d9c9314f89c1978336fc613d9bad0dc4172937dbde9314665a"}}, "hash": "0d96a366a4318532174c9d410269773550e0f5cee64b3277c037cc67ba080f6f", "text": "Given its multi-\u00ad\u2010sectoral mandate, the breadth of its country presence and government respect for its neutrality in facilitating policy dialogue at the national level, once UNDP makes a strategic engagement with these partners to focus on urban and local government issues it has the potential ability to facilitate a steep change in the coordination and cross-\u00ad\u2010sectoral integration that are prerequisite to achieve both citywide and nationwide impacts (as an example, see Box 5 \u2018UNDP Leadership to Scale-\u00ad\u2010up Meeting the Urban Challenge in Bangladesh\u2019).

FINANCIAL LEVERAGING AND LINKING TO CAPITAL INVESTMENT FOLLOW-\u00ad\u2010UP UNDP has considerable experience working with most of these agencies, but strengthening these partnerships at the country and city level and capitalizing on the synergies across their respective urban strategies is critical to realizing UNDP\u2019s strategic objectives in the urban sector. While it makes sense to work with partners where potentials for synergy are strongest, it is also important to note that this is not a \u2018zero-\u00ad\u2010sum\u2019 game. ADB and the World Bank together invest close to $5 billion annually in urban lending in the Asia Pacific region. Yet this figure is dwarfed by what governments and domestic banks invest in infrastructure in the region. A recent analysis by McKinsey & Company125 of infrastructure investments in Asia estimates that \u201caround $8 trillion will need to be committed to infrastructure projects over the next decade to remedy historical underinvestment and accommodate the explosion in demand\u201d (80% of this for energy and transport). With a clearly defined urban strategy at the country level including an explicit focus on linking its technical cooperation activities to the planning and implementation of capital investments being made in urban infrastructure UNDP will position itself to influence both the development impacts of these investments as well as to potentially play a strategic role in the local capacity building that is critical to their successful implementation. Even if UNDP were able to influence a tiny fraction of these infrastructure investments to contribute to urban growth with greater equity, this figure could easily be larger than current ODA budgets in the region. 124 CITIES ALLIANCE 2001. Cities without Slums: Action Plan for Moving Slum Upgrading to Scale.

The same report also notes that Asia may leapfrog developed economies in its adoption of clean-\u00ad\u2010energy technologies, thanks to falling costs and improving effectiveness. 51 Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific 6 UNDP ASIA PACIFIC URBAN STRATEGY The UNDP Asia Pacific urban strategy is focused on sustaining economic growth by promoting the growth of cities which are inclusive, resilient and sustainable; on what the organization does to address this challenge; and on how it can use and build upon its existing strengths, and where it does not have capacity and competencies, to leverage its resources to respond to the challenges and opportunities of rapid urbanization. The UNDP Asia Pacific urban strategy builds on the organization\u2019s strengths, particularly at the country level, and proposes where and how to focus on clearly defined strategic points of entry to achieve the greatest development impacts. The strategy has been conceived as a framework to help inspire and guide a process at the country level to develop national urban strategies and strategic urban programme partnerships by UNDP country offices in Asia and the Pacific. To respond to the specific challenges and opportunities faced by cities and systems of cities, ownership of the strategy development and implementation processes clearly needs to be with UNDP country offices. While urbanization is occurring across the region, countries are at very different stages of their urban transformation. Moreover the challenges faced by cities are often uniquely local \u2013 as cities have their own topography, governance, economic structure and opportunities and relationships with other levels of government. This section presents a framework and parameters to guide the strategy development process at the country level. VISION FOR URBAN IN ASIA PACIFIC Drawing upon consultations with UNDP country offices and thematic teams in the region, and taking into account potential partners, and the opportunities and challenges faced by Asia Pacific cities, the following vision is proposed to underpin the strategy development process: An Asia Pacific in which urbanization is managed in a more sustainable way resulting in continuous improvements to economic prosperity, equity, quality of life", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0f037f0b-6161-4b29-adc7-49cab4da940e": {"__data__": {"id_": "0f037f0b-6161-4b29-adc7-49cab4da940e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategy-paper-sustainable-and-inclusive-urbanization-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strategy Paper: Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategy-paper-sustainable-and-inclusive-urbanization-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "25ff9d0e179254c6186e1dd9f7bcd176a17b959d8434e54e22e807a0371668ed"}, "3": {"node_id": "492059e4-dec6-4bef-8747-b71b5d03cbc4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategy-paper-sustainable-and-inclusive-urbanization-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d56993d549b32614e9e59fad71c5a7d6c599163cb2a51d7484ef82de64548172"}}, "hash": "65b75d898eb4da0a933c661129e2a6bb63fb45d3db6bd04451f4b05994550c97", "text": "and well-\u00ad\u2010being for people living and working in towns and cities. This vision provides an outcome, a basis for targeted activities, which are responsive to critical needs, and performance criteria that can be measured and evaluated. STRATEGIC INTENT The intent of the strategy is to clearly focus on how UNDP will play a significant role in supporting the realization of this vision. It will do this by: Building on UNDP strengths The strategy builds upon the UNDP mandated focus areas of democratic governance, poverty reduction, crisis prevention and recovery, and energy and the environment which are each central to addressing the key challenges posed by rapid urbanization: \u2022 Weak governance is one of the most important barriers to improving the sustainability of cities in the region; \u2022 Reducing the growth of urban poverty and income, gender and horizontal inequalities is critical to sustaining economic growth, as well as to maintaining social stability in the region; \u2022 Crisis prevention and recovery is increasingly focusing on Asia Pacific cities and their vulnerabilities to natural disasters and climate change; and 52 Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific \u2022 Impacts of urban emissions and waste on health and well being are growing, particularly among marginalized groups, while the opportunities for urban energy efficiency and demand reduction are not being realized. The greatest potential strengths and comparative advantages of UNDP to help cities in the region meet these challenges, derive from its crosscutting programming capacity to align resources and engage partners across sectors, including the talents of women and young people, into well integrated support programmes, combined with its strong leadership role as an impartial multilateral partner in facilitating policy dialogue and reforms at the regional, national and sub-\u00ad\u2010national level. There are lessons to be learned from good examples in the region where UNDP is already capitalizing on these strengths and deploying its principal programming instruments to focus on meeting the urban challenge. For example, in Bangladesh, the objective of securing more equitable urban development has been mainstreamed in both national development plans and the UNDAF (see Box 5); and, in China, the National Human Development Report launched in August focuses on China\u2019s urban transformation, including an analysis of improved and innovative urban governance strategies and models, urbanization as part of the solution to education, as well as the challenges of addressing the social and environmental impacts of rapid urbanization including social integration for China\u2019s hundreds of millions of \u2018floating population\u2019 in urban areas and shifting to a lower consumption, lower emission, higher efficiency development model. Box 5: UNDP Leadership to Scale-\u00ad\u2010up Meeting the Urban Challenge in Bangladesh UNDP\u2019s activities focused on the challenges of rapid urbanization in Bangladesh illustrate the potential of these engagements to achieve citywide and nationwide impacts. The Urban Partnerships for Poverty Reduction (UPPR) programme (2007-\u00ad\u20102014) is a community-\u00ad\u2010based effort to improve the livelihoods and living conditions of over 3 million people, especially women and children, living in some of the country\u2019s most challenged urban communities. The program is currently operating in 24 cities and towns and focuses on empowering community based organizations to analyse their priorities, to develop actions plans, and then to resource and implement these plans in partnership with the local authorities. Financed by DFID and implemented by UNDP in collaboration with UN-\u00ad\u2010Habitat, ILO and UNICEF, UPPR has drawn on the experience of the earlier UN-\u00ad\u2010Habitat project \u201cLocal Partnerships for Urban Poverty Reduction\u201d which had initiated the process of introducing at scale in Bangladesh ACHR and SDI methodologies to support and network community savings groups, community enumerations and the city-\u00ad\u2010wide mapping of urban poor communities (so far in 29 cities). The challenge now is how to sustain this process and institutionalize a funding support mechanism (which could be modelled after CODI in Thailand). UNDP\u2019s engagement with UPPR and the country team\u2019s recognition that \u201curbanization is putting human capital to work at an unprecedented scale\u201d has also had significant impacts on the urban policy environment in Bangladesh, as well as on the UN development system\u2019s response. The Government\u2019s 6th Five Year Plan (2011-\u00ad\u20102015) has, for the first time, a chapter on \u2018meeting the urban challenge\u2019, as does its Outline Perspective Plan \u2013 Vision 2020.

Source: Authors and UNDP Bangladesh 2012. 53 Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific There are several other important examples in the region where UNDP has effectively used human development analysis applied to urban issues both at the regional and country level. The Asia Pacific Human Development Report 2012 focuses on cities and climate change and has a chapter on \u201cBuilding Greener Cities\u201d. UNDP in partnership with the Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty in India supported the preparation of a Mumbai Human Development Report that helped both government and citizen groups look at human development issues across the different wards and review the impacts of government and private sector investments and policies. Indeed deploying UNDPs highly regarded human development (HDR) analytical framework is not only useful as an urban analytical tool, but can also serve a powerful advocacy function in bringing different levels of government, the private sector and citizens on a common platform Leveraging UNDP Resources To achieve impacts at scale UNDP will need to leverage its resources. The strategy provides for this in a number of basic ways: by concentrating UNDP core resources around strategic urban goals linked to its four focus areas; by integrating priority urban issues into national development plans, the UNDAF and the HDR analytical framework; by helping to align the efforts of civic leaders in the business and local financial institutions around corporate social responsibility support for making cities more inclusive; by systematically linking UNDP supported technical cooperation activities to the planning and implementation of the capital investments being made in urban infrastructure to influence both the development impacts of these investments, as well as to position UNDP to play a strategic role in the local capacity building that is critical to their successful implementation; and by helping motivated cities become creditworthy and access domestic capital markets to fund pro-\u00ad\u2010poor infrastructure investments at scale. The focus of leveraging resources should be on the development of partnerships, networks, strategic alliances and collaborative ventures with local and national governments, local business leaders, development agencies, international development banks, professional organizations, associations of cities, non-\u00ad\u2010government and community based organizations, and universities and other knowledge based institutions. Resource leveraging should involve pulling together finance, human capital, technology, research and development, information and knowledge sharing. Strategic Points of Entry There is a very wide range of activities that UNDP could become engaged in the urban sector. However, the complexity of the issues and the scale of the challenge require a strategy that focuses on where UNDP has the greatest comparative advantage and the ability to impact at scale. Geographic focus: The strategic framework outlined below focuses at the national level on national urban policies and strategies that enable cities and the nation\u2019s system of cities to support and sustain growth, job creation and more inclusive urban societies; and at the local level on secondary cities and the urban periphery. The focus on national policies and strategies is an obvious comparative advantage for UNDP, given the broad based respect for its neutrality and its proven capacity to facilitate policy dialogue at the national level, as is the focus on secondary cities and urban periphery, since these are the urban areas with the highest levels of vulnerability and in greatest need of UNDP crosscutting programming support: \u2022 Over 60% of the region\u2019s urban population lives in urban areas with populations of less than 1 million and secondary cities are also experiencing the highest growth rates. They act as local economic growth centres, markets and processing centres for rural products, and bridges between rural areas and large urban centres and yet most often lack basic infrastructure and services,126 as well as urban management capacity. Most have not developed global or even national linkages and are struggling to accommodate growing populations with weak local governments, poor infrastructure and services, lagging job creation and weak revenue bases. \u2022 The urban periphery is where the urban and rural come together and where development is most often haphazard: where the most vulnerable urban poor usually reside; where infrastructure and services are weak", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fad723c8-7acf-4892-abe5-176391961c5b": {"__data__": {"id_": "fad723c8-7acf-4892-abe5-176391961c5b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategy-paper-sustainable-and-inclusive-urbanization-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strategy Paper: Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategy-paper-sustainable-and-inclusive-urbanization-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3a9815479e7799de8cc35068c2515f5defdac9c609f16ba46800e584a37373cf"}}, "hash": "3a9815479e7799de8cc35068c2515f5defdac9c609f16ba46800e584a37373cf", "text": "or totally non-\u00ad\u2010existent; where 126 The State of Asian Cities 2010/11, p. 8. 54 Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific land grabbing, unplanned developments and environmental degradation are often rampant; and where urban governance arrangements and authority are weakest. Scope of Activities: As is described in more detail below the scope of activities in UNDP country urban strategies at the national level should focus on facilitating the urban policy dialogue and on mainstreaming into national plans, budgeting processes and regulatory reforms, policies and implementation structures and systems that will help cities anticipate, plan for and manage urban growth by creating incentives for local authorities to become more accountable and to raise revenues for improved infrastructure and service delivery, and that will clarify property rights and require the efficient and transparent management of public land assets. At the local level, focused on secondary cities and the urban periphery, UNDP country strategies should target improvements in four strategic areas: urban governance, land administration and management, poverty reduction through quality job growth, and city inclusion strategies targeting the city\u2019s most vulnerable communities with improvements in infrastructure, social services, environmental improvements and risk reduction. UNDP should play a lead role in facilitating the national urban policy dialogue and in helping to strengthen the capacity of both central and local government to improve intra and inter-\u00ad\u2010governmental coordination and urban resource management arrangements, as well as donor coordination by providing a framework to align activities and financing around these four objectives. UNDP should also support related activities involving research and development, learning, knowledge and information dissemination, as well as monitoring and evaluation. Scale of Activities: At the national level, country urban strategies should target nationwide impacts on the nation\u2019s system of cities, on improving their economic connectivity, their competitiveness, encouraging local innovations, and on knowledge-\u00ad\u2010sharing to support adaptation and replication. At the local level, strategies should target citywide impacts, including the more efficient functioning of the local land market, strengthening the local government\u2019s capacity to raise revenues, creating partnerships with the private sector and educational institutions to stimulate job creation and developing citywide inclusion strategies that target the most vulnerable communities. STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK AND OBJECTIVES The figure opposite illustrates a framework to guide the country based urban strategy development process. The objectives, activities and potential impacts are described in more detail below under five strategic outcomes. 55 Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific National Urban Policies National urban policies that encourage decentralization empower local authorities to promote sustainable urbanization and reinforce the importance of active community participation in planning, setting budgetary priorities and supporting implementation. Activities at the national level should include support for national urban policy dialogues such as national urban forums to help articulate and promulgate national urban policies and strategies including: policies on fiscal arrangements for revenue sharing between levels of governments, policies that clarify property rights and require the efficient and transparent management of public land assets (often owned by ministries or parastatals), reform of national planning laws, social determinants of urban health inequities, and measures to mitigate the impacts of climate change. National policies that increase city autonomy and hold local authorities accountable to taxpayers and voters also encourage local innovation, local resource mobilization and ultimately creditworthy cities. The challenge in many countries in the region is to mainstream policies that anticipate and plan for urban growth in national plans and budgeting processes, as China has done with such notable results.127 (see Box 6) Box 6: \u201cChina Daily\u201d \u2013 Building Sustainable Cities At the beginning of 2012, for the first time in China's history, urban residents outnumbered those in the countryside. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, in January 2012, the number of urban dwellers was 690.8 million, nearly 51.3% of China's total population. And although China is still less urbanized than most developed nations, it already has the world's largest urban population. Rapid urbanization has been a major driver in boosting China's economic growth and reform. It has been a key element in the last two five-\u00ad\u2010year plans, with the general strategy being to expedite the process while also promoting a more coordinated and balanced approach to narrow the rural-\u00ad\u2010urban divide and reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. During the 11th Five-\u00ad\u2010Year Plan (2006-\u00ad\u201010), the majority of urbanization targets were achieved, with a higher concentration of the population in China's prefecture-\u00ad\u2010level cities generating more than two-\u00ad\u2010thirds of the country's total GDP in 2009. The overall competitiveness and urban economic strengths were improved through the coordinated development of large metropolitan regions through the clustering of cities. Urbanization is also a main feature of the 12th Five-\u00ad\u2010Year", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ec5bddf4-177a-40a8-b859-b186bdcf423d": {"__data__": {"id_": "ec5bddf4-177a-40a8-b859-b186bdcf423d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategy-paper-sustainable-and-inclusive-urbanization-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strategy Paper: Sustainable and Inclusive Urbanization in Asia Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategy-paper-sustainable-and-inclusive-urbanization-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "859bf0279e82e9275324555c03e02d46f08b6b2574c65ab87892ac26f9a73225"}, "3": {"node_id": "1ca0a5ca-dad5-4c87-bbe8-84ddfeb9fadb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strategy-paper-sustainable-and-inclusive-urbanization-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "549c97872d533a12a833ab81dec92fbeb093dc278ac7155200cec2d0d52ed1e9"}}, "hash": "e27034915890763873b94793b46d5d669d91e431369833c852e7226bffc4cfe8", "text": "Plan (2011-\u00ad\u201015) with an emphasis on higher quality and inclusive growth.
