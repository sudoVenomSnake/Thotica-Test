Comparing regular and irregular migrant work experiences from the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic to Thailand. This research and its recommendations were made possible due to the cooperation of various government departments and officials, non-government partners, United Nations agencies and other international organizations, and, most importantly, the many Lao workers who were interviewed and willing to share their experiences. Thanks are extended to the National COMMIT Task Force of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the continuous support to this and other research projects in the past. More specifically, UNDP and ILO are grateful for the assistance provided by the Lao Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, particularly the Department of Skills Development and Employment, and the Lao Ministry of Public Security, chiefly the Anti-Human Trafficking Department. Thanks are due to World Vision in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for their support in identifying respondents. Our sincere gratitude is extended to Dr Simon Baker, consultant, for his support to the analysis of the collected data and the writing of the research report. Our thanks also go to Ms Viphasavanh Phoummasack, consultant, and Mr Vongtavanh Sayavong, formerly UN-ACT National Project Officer, for all their work in setting up and conducting interviews, and to Ms Salome Blum, United Nations Volunteer, for her organizational and technical help to the project including data cleaning, entry and analysis.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a156fa7-4aec-4605-8f5f-89773bbda208": {"__data__": {"id_": "7a156fa7-4aec-4605-8f5f-89773bbda208", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whats-incentive", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "What's the Incentive?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whats-incentive", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "68627fc5e9881a982a2c84ca5bda10d8d13536c5bcf2e9da1efb5d7bc2a84d10"}, "2": {"node_id": "bcfe7908-af88-4344-8816-5b5ba03e4f8a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whats-incentive", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8f1e025060b3d11ce147b95ffff6a499babf9ed88673266bdb525f213eaff90b"}}, "hash": "1abdebf65d1521c90b047c4daac95f71c3ed5cea75d12ffa55564480a2bba4a5", "text": "Our appreciation goes to Dr Apiradee Thienthong, Deputy Chief of Party, CTIP Thailand Program, Winrock International; Ms Sally Barber, Regional Program Coordinator for Migration, UNWOMEN Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific; and Dr Xoukiet Panyanouvong, Chief of Party, CTIP Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic Programme, Winrock International for their valuable feedback and comments on the initial drafts of the report.

Little empirical work, however, has been conducted comparing the experiences of regular and irregular migrant workers, and assessing the outcomes of these different migration models. The report contributes to filling this gap in the study of migrant work, with a focus on the migration corridor between the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Thailand. The analysis is informed by two surveys; the main survey captures the voices of 131 returned migrant workers from Luang Prabang and Champassack in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \u2013 76 men and 56 women \u2013 that enlisted the services of recruitment agencies to take up work in Thailand, in line with a Memorandum of Understanding on Employment Cooperation between the two countries. This data was collected between July-August 2015. Where feasible and relevant, their experiences are compared to those of 128 irregular Lao migrant workers \u2013 67 men and 61 women, and mostly from Champassack and Saravan \u2013 who were deported from Thailand across the Wang Tao-Chong Mek international border, with interviews conducted from March-July 2013. The report provides a synthesised outline of the regulatory framework for labour migration between the two countries, evaluates that against the recruitment, work and life experiences reported by regular migrant workers, and compares these with the conditions faced by irregular migrant workers. It is divided into four sections, covering respondents\u2019 background information and pre-departure conditions; the recruitment process; the working and living conditions in Thailand; and the end of their work and the return to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. The study concludes that, overall, regular labour migration has yielded more positive migrant work outcomes than irregular channels in the sample. For instance, whilst monthly average salaries in Thailand were between 6,600 and 6,900 Thai Baht (THB) across both cohorts \u2013 almost four times higher than the regular migrant workers\u2019 mean income in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic prior to migrating \u2013 irregular migrant workers had to work significantly more for similar wages. Indeed, whereas 95 per cent of the regular migrants reported working eight hours per day and 99 per cent six days per week, more than 60 per cent of their irregular counterparts suggested to have worked nine or more hours, every day of the week. Further, regular migrant workers, on a scale from 1 \u2018very bad\u2019 (or equivalent) to 5 \u2018very good\u2019 (or equivalent), scored all of seven employment-related conditions included in both surveys better than the irregular migrant workers. These covered assessments of weekly working time, treatment by boss/supervisor, freedom of movement, physical violence at the workplace, food/water supplies, safety at work and holiday/sick leave provision. In addition, regular migrant workers rated their quality of life in Thailand better than their irregular counterparts, and both classified their quality of life in Thailand better than in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. Finally, a higher proportion of regular compared to irregular migrant workers (94 as against 78 per cent) reported sending remittances back to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. Among the former, average amounts per person and year ranked at THB45,666, more than twice what they were able to earn back home. Coupled with longer average stays in Thailand than for irregular migrant workers (23 months compared to 11 months), the economic argument for regular labour migration was evident, although other factors including migration costs need further consideration. Still, both regular and irregular migrant workers reported various challenges as part of their migrant work experiences in Thailand. For example, 96 per cent of the regular migrant workers had their passports confiscated by their employers/supervisors, and 35 per cent indicated that they had no access to their documents even if wanted. In addition, 15 per cent of the regular migrant workers, in fact, noted that they felt constrained or unable to quit their jobs. Document retention is considered an important indicator of forced labour and human trafficking. Further, for many employment-related variables, 10 per cent or more of the respondents, irrespective of their immigration status, described negative or very negative conditions. Some of these relate to fundamental human rights enshrined in international law (for example, freedom of movement); others including", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "27dd957b-69f0-4144-8b9c-125df2ea75b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "27dd957b-69f0-4144-8b9c-125df2ea75b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whats-incentive", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "What's the Incentive?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whats-incentive", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "482cf4d0964ac66acb51e163f337590a1c3c31bbfd94138a934cf9ca899c1066"}}, "hash": "482cf4d0964ac66acb51e163f337590a1c3c31bbfd94138a934cf9ca899c1066", "text": "payment terms, working time, physical violence or forms of harassment, where experienced very negatively, may be indicators of coercion or exploitation in the context of human trafficking and forced labour. What\u2019s the incentive? Comparing regular and irregular migrant work experiences from the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic to Thailand x Whilst 63 per cent of the regular migrant workers noted that there were opportunities to raise concerns about employment conditions if wanted, more than a third either did not have access to complaints mechanisms or were not aware of their existence (comparable data was not available for irregular migrant workers). Moreover, almost all opportunities provided were through staff representatives or directly with supervisors and/or employers. Labour inspectors, other authorities, trade unions, civil society organizations or recruitment agencies played no significant role in this context. At the recruitment stage, the regular migrant workers reported diverse experiences with the services and practices of recruitment agencies. For example, 41 per cent had to make payments directly to their recruitment companies, ranging from THB600 to 30,000, and covering various items such as passports, visas and/or work permits, pre- departure training packages, transport costs to destination, and others. The costing and payment terms, at least partially, were in contradiction to regulations in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic as well as the ILO\u2019s Private Employment Agencies Convention, 1997 (No. 181). Moreover, 89 per cent of the regular migrant workers stated that they signed a contract with their recruitment agency, and two-thirds among these did not fully or at all understand that agreement. Respondents provided various reasons for the lack of comprehension, the two most important ones being the complicated terminology (43 per cent) and that they did not read the contract (36 per cent). The latter may, in some cases, point to literacy challenges but also raises important questions about the perceived and/or actual importance of written contracts in the Lao and possibly Thai contexts. Further, only 40 per cent of the regular migrant workers who had contracts with their recruitment agency received a copy, and none signed an agreement with their employer upon arriving in Thailand. Whilst, at the time, this was not in contradiction to national legislation in the two countries or their bilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Employment Cooperation, the enforceability of working conditions in the destination country as agreed in the country of origin remains questionable under current regulations. The mean standby time among regular migrant workers for the journey to Thailand to begin following an agreement with their recruitment agency was four months (122 days), but there were noteworthy variations at an individual level. 20 per cent reported waiting six months or longer \u2013 in seven cases from one to almost two years. These periods were significantly longer than the official estimates of 55 days for the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic-Thailand migration corridor, and are likely to be an important factor in undermining wider use of regular channels. Wherever feasible and relevant, the analysis of regular migrant work is disaggregated by gender, province of residence in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and the two most predominant sectors of employment in Thailand (wood factories or food, including seafood, factories), providing a nuanced picture of migrant work experiences across various variables. The report concludes with 11 key recommendations geared towards strengthening regular labour migration systems and providing incentives for more migrant workers to choose regular channels. What\u2019s the incentive? Comparing regular and irregular migrant work experiences from the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic to Thailand 1 1. Introduction The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Thailand share a long history of cross-border labour migration due to geographical proximity, cultural and linguistic similarities, and significant differences in socio-economic development including salary levels1 and employment opportunities. Complicated, costly and time-consuming procedures for regular labour migration, as outlined by a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the two countries, however, have resulted in such movement occurring predominately through irregular channels. Thai authorities have on several occasions offered opportunities to regularise the status of many irregular Lao \u2013 and indeed other \u2013 migrant workers in Thailand through a process known as Nationality Verification (NV). In 2017, the Thai Ministry of Labour reported that there were 182,462 documented Lao people in the country,2 with some remaining Pink Card3 holders who enjoy only temporary permissions to stay and work in Thailand.4 Moreover, the number of Lao people registered through regular migration channels for work in Thailand has increased modestly in recent years reaching 44,677 by January 2017.5 They had all been recruited by one of currently 21 recruitment agencies in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic.6 1 The current monthly minimum", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1ec57f0a-8933-4c4b-a370-30d9bae2776f": {"__data__": {"id_": "1ec57f0a-8933-4c4b-a370-30d9bae2776f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whats-incentive", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "What's the Incentive?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whats-incentive", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "60406466e42c3bf1d39e3d43c11f7405aa99109a7b69702cd19ae46c5b3135cf"}, "3": {"node_id": "e7c69d50-77a0-4bdc-9a10-5a7526ee326c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whats-incentive", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "53f8ed9d12a7dfabb9563895ac8377149b4f681ac6f55ed897a748791c187598"}}, "hash": "5a566aeb4bd30cdb2bb7f4763b6b57aefde84da184d9132192f7d49fda57fd3c", "text": "wage in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic is about US$110, or 900,000 Lao Kip, with the Thai equivalent ranking at approximately twice the amount (International Labour Organization (ILO): TRIANGLE in ASEAN Quarterly Briefing Note: Lao PDR (Oct.-Dec. 2017) (Bangkok, 2017)). 2 Ministry of Labour (MOL): Operation on tackling labour trafficking issues (Bangkok, 2017). 3 The Pink Card was introduced by Thailand\u2019s current military Government as an interim measure to grant irregular migrant workers in the country time to apply for regular documents including passports, work permits and visas. Pink Card holders are not entitled to the same benefits as regular migrant workers in Thailand (Nyan Lynn Aung: \u2018Workers in Thailand told to re-register for pink card\u2019 Myanmar Times (Yangon, 01 March 2016) <https://www.mmtimes.com/national-news/19233-workers-in-thailand-told-to-re-register-for-pink-cards.html> [accessed 20 Oct. 2016]. 4 International Organization for Migration (IOM): Thailand migration profile (Bangkok, 2016). 5 Ministry of Labour (MOL): Operation on tackling labour trafficking issues (Bangkok, 2017). 6 Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare (MLSW): List of oversea employment enterprises in Laos (Vientiane, 2017). At the time of data collection, there were only 16 recruitment agencies in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; 14 recruited workers for both the domestic and the Thai labour market, whereas the remaining two were only licensed to operate domestically. Thailand remains the only destination country for officially sanctioned labour migration from the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. Limited numbers of Lao migrants are also sent to Japan and the Republic of South Korea every year, but these programmes do not work through recruitment agencies and generally have somewhat different purposes. 2 It is usually assumed that implementing such formal recruitment procedures is beneficial to migrant workers in various ways, including by reducing vulnerabilities to exploitation and human trafficking. In practice, however, little is known about Lao migrants formally recruited to work in Thailand, in terms of how policies, procedures and costs unfold in reality, or about their experiences working and staying abroad. This study offers insights into the lives of these migrant workers (whose data was collected from July-August 2015) and draws comparisons with the experiences of irregular workers from the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic in Thailand (with their data collected from March-July 2013). It is structured around four key sections, covering: (1) background information and pre-departure conditions of respondents; (2) the recruitment and migration process; (3) living and working conditions at destination; and (4) termination of work and the return to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. The objectives of the report are to: 1. provide a synthesised outline of the legal and policy framework for regular labour migration from the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic to Thailand; 2. analyse the expected as well as actual recruitment, work and life experiences of regular Lao workers in Thailand; and 3. compare these with the conditions faced by irregular migrant workers. The Lao and the Thai Government are members of the Coordinated Mekong Ministerial Initiative against Trafficking (COMMIT) and collaborate with the ILO\u2019s TRIANGLE in ASEAN programme. COMMIT brings together the six countries of the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS: Cambodia, China, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand and Viet Nam) in a formal alliance to jointly counter human trafficking. This is done by implementing a Subregional Plan of Action (SPA) and associated National Plans of Action (NPAs). The current, fourth SPA (SPA IV) encompasses a commitment to strengthening \u201cmigrant workers\u2019 recruitment systems \u2026 to protect those vulnerable to trafficking in persons\u201d including by developing recruitment guidelines; introducing complaints mechanisms for workers; and monitoring workplaces employing migrant workers.7 Further, within the TRIANGLE in ASEAN programme, strengthening the capacity of governments and recruitment agencies to protect migrant workers travelling through regular channels is a key outcome. TRIANGLE in ASEAN has also engaged with the Lao Government on ways to regulate recruitment agencies and to provide pre-departure training.

It concludes with a series of recommendations designed to address the shortcomings identified in the regular labour migration procedures between the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Thailand, and hence to make the experiences of migrant workers safer and more beneficial to the social and economic development of their communities. 7 Coordinated Mekong Ministerial", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2972f190-5e1c-40c5-996c-bfecb3d54adb": {"__data__": {"id_": "2972f190-5e1c-40c5-996c-bfecb3d54adb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whats-incentive", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "What's the Incentive?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whats-incentive", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "267b11a8745094ab68923fb50a1f2ba6bd4a5edfc5039f20f49a0d321dfab938"}, "3": {"node_id": "6e085d86-9e54-4df8-8bf2-f6db69351022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whats-incentive", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8ad72c686ba50c1d97c07751f55acd940b0cdd513b5b01e626c8576969e2de3d"}}, "hash": "e3491a8ef8e21849ed6f256f034002fbe1ecbd270865d8586021156b7deb09f3", "text": "Initiative against Trafficking (COMMIT): COMMIT 4th Sub-Regional Plan of Action (COMMIT SPA IV 2015- 2018) (Bangkok, 2015). 8 This includes SDG 5 on gender quality; SDG 8 on decent work and economic growth; SDG 10 on reduced inequalities; SDG 16 on peace, justice and strong institutions; and SDG 17 on partnerships for the goals.

Legal\ufffdframework In 2002, the Governments of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Thailand signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Employment Cooperation,9 hereafter referred to as the 2002 MOU. In the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, this is supplemented by further policy documents, including the Decree on Export of Lao Workers Working Abroad No. 68/Prime Minister\u2019s Office (PMO) (2002), henceforth called the PMO Decree, and the Guideline on Implementation of Decree on Export of Lao Workers Working Abroad No. 2417/Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare (MLSW) (2002), hereafter referred to as the MLSW Guideline. The latter elaborates on the content of the PMO Decree with respect to the rights and duties of regular migrant workers as well as the recruitment agencies hiring them (summarised in table 1). In addition, Regulation No. 3824/MLSW (2002) sets various limitations for the kinds of jobs that Lao workers may be recruited for, banning those that it defines as unskilled (including cleaner, domestic worker or porter); vocations that are considered inappropriate and incompatible with Lao traditions, culture and law (for example, work in the sex sector and with narcotics, or certain political activities); and jobs that are seen as dangerous (such as open sea fishing or work involving exposure to radioactive radiation).10 In Thailand, the 1978 Employment of Aliens Law and later the 2008 Working of Alien Act laid out broad conditions, under which migrant workers were permitted to take up work in the country, including the requirement of a work permit. The latter upheld a 1979 Royal Decree on 39 professions that foreigners were prohibited to engage in, although there was some flexibility for authorities to grant exceptions.11 Further, the 1998 Labour Protection Act (LPA) stipulated the rights and entitlements of workers including migrant workers, with exceptions from protections made for some sectors such as agriculture, sea fisheries and domestic work. Following the signings of bilateral MOUs on employment cooperation with neighbouring countries in the early 2000s, Thailand introduced various regulations to operationalise the agreements.12 The process for labour migration along the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic- Thailand corridor is outlined in figure 1. 9 Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare (MLSW) (Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic) and Ministry of Labour (MOL) (Thailand): MOU between the Government of Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and the Government of the Kingdom of Thailand on labour co-operation (Vientiane, 2002). 10 International Labour Organisation (ILO): The Mekong challenge - An honest broker - Improving cross-border recruitment practices for the benefit of Government. Workers and Employers (Bangkok, 2008). 11 Ibid. 12 Ibid. 4 According to these procedures, the recruitment process begins when the Thai employer requests a certain number of migrant workers from the Lao MLSW through a Thai Provincial Employment Office (PEO).

Comparing regular and irregular migrant work experiences from the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic to Thailand 5 As per the MLSW Guideline, the costs for recruiting migrant workers are initially to be advanced by the Lao recruitment agencies, which may then charge up to 15 per cent of the workers\u2019 monthly base wage over the period of their employment in Thailand to recover such expenses. This is contrary to the ILO Convention on Private Employment Agencies, 1997 (No. 181),15 which prohibits worker-borne recruitment fees. Further, Lao migrant workers are required to sign a contract with the recruitment agency for their employment in Thailand, stipulating key working conditions such as wages.16 The MLSW Guideline does not require, however, that the contract be supplemented by a contract with the employer in Thailand, raising questions about the enforceability of the migrant workers\u2019 agreed working conditions in the destination country. In 2016, the two sides signed a revised MOU17 with a mandatory employment contract for use in Thailand annexed, although the new bilateral agreement is arguably less comprehensive with respect to the procedures governing labour migration as well as the rights and entitlements of migrant workers than its predecessor. In the same year, the Thai Government also established Post-Arrival and Reintegration Centres at borders with Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Myanmar providing trainings and information to regular migrant workers, and opened several Migrant Worker Assistance Centers across the country to support those facing problems related to their employment.18 Further, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Thailand have introduced various relevant regulatory changes, including amended Labour Laws in 2014 (Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic) and 2017 (Thailand), and a Royal Ordinance on the Management of Employment of Migrant Workers in 2017 (Thailand; revised in 2018). Given that the data for this study was collected in 2015, however, the report is not in a position to analyse to what extent such amendments have influenced the experiences of Lao migrant workers in Thailand.

Comparing regular and irregular migrant work experiences from the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic to Thailand 7 3. Methodology The main survey for this study was conducted between July-August 2015 to determine recruitment practices and employment conditions experienced by migrant workers from the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic who enlisted the services of recruitment agencies to move to Thailand for employment (hereafter called the regular-migrant survey), and to contextualise these within the legal and regulatory framework governing labour migration between the two countries. It included a total of 131 returned migrant workers - 76 men and 56 women, of whom 45 resided in Luang Prabang and 86 in Champassack.19 Interviews took place in their province of residence in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. As neither MLSW nor the recruitment agencies were able to make available comprehensive records of regular migrants who had moved to Thailand for work through the bilateral MOU process, sampling was conducted through a mixture of respondent-driven and purposive methods with support from the PDLSWs. Interviews were based on a structured instrument developed by UN-ACT and the ILO, covering background information and pre-departure conditions; the recruitment and the migration stage; conditions at destination; end of work and return to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. UN-ACT recruited two data collectors, one woman and one man, who were trained for interviewing including by completing UN-ACT\u2019s standard ethics review process20. Each interview was conducted in private and began with a consent procedure, whereby respondents were informed about the purpose of the project; what themes would be covered in the interview; how their data was going to be used including levels of guaranteed anonymity; their rights during the interview, such as skipping questions or terminating the conversation at any time; and how long it was likely to take.

Comparing regular and irregular migrant work experiences from the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic to Thailand 9 Given occasional non-responses and to facilitate comprehension, the sample sizes are indicated for each figure in the report. Only valid responses are considered for the sample sizes and subsequent analyses. It is acknowledged that migrant workers from the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic can obtain regular status in Thailand through other channels than the MOU process, and that regular migrant workers who went through recruitment agencies may become irregular in Thailand later. For the purposes of this study, however, \u2018regular migrant workers\u2019 are defined as only those who migrated in accordance with the bilateral MOU on Employment Cooperation between the two countries, and only information related to that experience is captured in this survey. Further, \u2018irregular migrant workers\u2019, in this report, captures those who were deported back to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic following employment in Thailand. None of them went through the MOU process and, whilst 13 per cent initially noted that they had formal working documents at some point during their time in Thailand, only a few in fact referred to papers that granted employment rights. Hence, risks for regular work experiences to have been captured and misidentified as irregular in the study are small, and even in theory could only have occurred in very few cases.

Similarly, the sample of 128 respondents in the irregular-migrant survey was insufficient to generate findings at a 95 per cent confidence level and with a 5 per cent margin of error, although random sampling was conducted in this case. The results as presented in Human Trafficking Trends in Asia: Migration Experiences of Lao workers deported from Thailand in 2013 are hence not representative either of the overall population of Lao irregular migrant workers deported from Thailand via the Wang Tao-Chong Mek border crossing. Combining these two datasets presents additional limitations, because the surveys were conducted at different times and due to the structure of the instruments used being different. The data indicates, however, that the stays of many of the regular and irregular migrant workers overlapped in Thailand, with the former often having arrived in Thailand earlier and then stayed longer (see figure 2). Moreover, the two datasets were only integrated and analysed jointly where there was sufficient overlap between the questions asked.

More than 10 per cent in the two groups indicated that they began when they were still children, over 60 per cent when they were aged 18 to 29 years, and around 20 per cent when they were 30 years or older. It is of concern that a number of respondents appear to have been underage when they started working in Thailand, particularly as part of regular labour migration procedures. As outlined above, the MLSW Guideline stipulates that a potential Lao migrant worker must be aged 18 years or older at the time they apply for employment abroad (see table 1). Whilst Thailand, in principle, permits the recruitment of children as of 15 years of age, strict rules apply in such cases as specified in a dedicated chapter on Employment of Young Workers in the 1998 LPA.22 Further, a bilateral working group established to help implement and review the MOU agreed that no minors would be recruited through the process. Of the 15 regular migrant workers who indicated that they were underage, most were 17 years old, although some were as young as 11. 22 Ministry of Labour (MOL): The Labour Protection Act B.E. 2541 (Bangkok, 1998).

The data suggests, however, that some of the country\u2019s migrant workers in Thailand, both regular and irregular, do not reach such compulsory educational levels before moving abroad. There were pronounced differences based on gender among the regular migrant workers with respect to their educational levels. Whilst men were more likely than women to not have completed any education (36 to 25 per cent), the reverse was true for those who only completed primary education (50 per cent of women to 20 per cent of men). This left 44 per cent of men with lower secondary school certificates or higher, as compared to only 25 per cent of women.

Brokerage fees 2. Costs for a passport 3. Visa and/or work permit for Thailand 4. Pre-departure training package 5. Transport costs to destination 6. Accommodation and food at destination 7.

There was one significant difference based on gender with respect to the types of fees that they had to cover, and that related to \u2018insurance\u2019; whilst 18 per cent of women paid for associated expenses, this did not apply to any man. Further, interviewees from Luang Prabang were more likely to be charged transportation costs than those from Champassack, possibly reflecting longer travels to the Thai-Lao border, and the same tendency albeit less pronounced was true for medical/health checks.

The MLSW Guideline stipulates that recruitment agencies advance the recruitment-related fees for the migrant workers, but may subsequently deduct up to 15 per cent of their monthly salaries to recover these costs. However, the practices as reported by respondents to this research suggest that many migrant workers at least partially had to pay directly to their respective recruitment agencies. It is worth reiterating that costs of recruitment should be borne by the employers and not the workers, according to the ILO\u2019s Private Employment Agencies Convention, 1997 (No. 181), though authorities may authorize exceptions. Loans and their terms to finance labour migration Twenty-five respondents (six in Luang Prabang and 19 in Champassack; 16 men and nine women) had to borrow money to fund their migrant work experience in Thailand, typically from relatives or friends (72 per cent), but some also from moneylenders (20 per cent) or recruitment agencies (4 per cent) (see figure 20).

The mean time for repayment was one year and respondents, on average, paid 1.7 instalments. Only three respondents had a contract or other documentation for the loan, two with a friend and one with a moneylender. This is perhaps not surprising, given the low average amounts and the informality of the arrangements that often involved friends and relatives as granters.

There were no pronounced differences based on gender or province in this respect. About 68 per cent of the regular migrant workers who signed contracts with their recruitment agencies did not fully or at all understand the agreements. Again, there was no significant difference based on gender, but a higher proportion of respondents in Champassack than in Luang Prabang did not fully or at all comprehend their contracts.

There were some variations in this respect based on gender and province. The language factor was more important among women than men, and in Champassack than in Luang Prabang, whereas the time factor was a bigger concern in Luang Prabang than in Champassack. 26 Further, it is worth noting that there was only one non-Lao native speaker among those reporting that the contract was not available in a language they could read. Illiteracy may have been a factor in this regard.

Comparing regular and irregular migrant work experiences from the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic to Thailand 27 Further, none of the regular migrant workers signed an agreement with their employer upon arriving in Thailand. Whilst this was not in contradiction to national legislation in the two countries concerned26 or their bilateral MOU on Employment Cooperation, the practice raises important questions about the enforceability of working conditions in the destination country as agreed in the country of origin. Indeed, it remains unclear how an employer in Thailand can be held accountable for breaches of employment terms that they have not directly agreed upon with the violated party and that may not be against minimum working standards in the country of destination. 89% of the regular migrant workers stated that they signed a contract with their recruitment agency 2/3", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "06131abe-2c59-4e26-8af4-a722e81d3d5c": {"__data__": {"id_": "06131abe-2c59-4e26-8af4-a722e81d3d5c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whats-incentive", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "What's the Incentive?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whats-incentive", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "480c45a3df0b61cd3ae5cccdc174b6be0e354673db8a8d073fd81270f8866bf7"}, "3": {"node_id": "0a1b45b1-ccf4-4098-b347-c83a480910fa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whats-incentive", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "82dbb09af67ddc77b07e874223afe6a597b2d66b69ff740114597a6d073d12a9"}}, "hash": "99d2c9fac5d39f63288b31a11b733d53c609e70ddaaf9089272707762a1d70a9", "text": "did not fully or at all understand that agreement 0 of the regular migrant workers signed a contract of employment with their employer upon arriving in Thailand CONTRACTS Only 40% received a copy of their contracts Of these Of these In addition, although most regular migrant workers signed a contract with their recruitment agency as outlined above, many key terms and conditions regarding work and life in Thailand remained unspecified. For example, more than a third of all regular migrant workers said that they had no agreement about the nature of their work in Thailand, and another third indicated that they only had a verbal agreement (see figure 25). Similarly, 23 per cent of respondents noted that they had no arrangements regarding their legal status in Thailand, and 32 per cent only had a verbal agreement in this respect. 26 The Thai LPA does not require written employment contracts. Further, the language of the 2002 MLSW Guideline is somewhat ambiguous in this respect and, as a result, has been interpreted differently. Some analyses suggest that it requires a written contract between the Thai employer and the Lao migrant worker. This interpretation, however, seems questionable, partly because Lao legislation is not in a position to mandate action from Thai employers in Thailand. It is important to note that, in 2016, the Lao and the Thai Government signed a revised MOU on Employment Cooperation with a mandatory employment contract for use in Thailand annexed. 28 Further, between 19 and 38 per cent of regular migrant workers only had verbal agreements for the following terms and conditions: \u2018volume of work\u2019, \u2018duration of employment\u2019, \u2018salary\u2019, \u2018social security\u2019, \u2018location of the job\u2019 and \u2018living conditions\u2019. The 2002 MLSW Guideline, however, requires that salary levels in Thailand, amongst other aspects, be specified in a written contract for all Lao workers (see table 1).

More women than men had no agreements on the \u2018nature of the job\u2019, the \u2018volume of work\u2019 and \u2018social security\u2019, whereas a higher share of men than women lacked any arrangements on \u2018living conditions\u2019. Further, more respondents in Champassack than in Luang Prabang reported that they had no agreements on the \u2018nature of the job\u2019, their \u2018legal status\u2019 and \u2018social security\u2019, with the reverse true for \u2018salary\u2019. All regular migrant workers from Luang Prabang and 88 per cent from Champassack indicated that the arrangement was for them to work in Thailand for two years. For six respondents, the agreed period was 48 months; for one interviewee, it was 18 months; for two it was 27 months; and for another one it was 36 months. There were no significant differences in this respect based on gender. Agreed type of employment Many regular migrant workers moved to Thailand for jobs in factories, especially wood processing (44 per cent of all respondents) and food including seafood (28 per cent) (see figure 26). There were distinct patterns in this respect based on gender and province. Higher proportions of women than men agreed to work in wood, food and fabric factories, whereas the reverse was true for work in the transport or storage industry and electronics factories. The differences were even more pronounced at the provincial level. For example, two-thirds of the respondents from Luang Prabang agreed to work in food factories, compared to 8 per cent from Champassack. Conversely, 65 per cent from Champassack moved for jobs in wood factories, as against 4 per cent from Luang Prabang.

Further, given significant differences at the individual level, many respondents seemingly had to accept earnings well below minimum standards. Payment terms below minimum wages are a breach of Thai law and seen as an indicator of exploitation in the context of human trafficking and forced labour.28 Pre-departure training About 73 per cent of the regular migrant workers reported receiving pre-departure training in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (see figure 28). This applied to 68 per cent of men compared to 80 per cent of women, and to 89 per cent of respondents in Luang Prabang as against 65 per cent in Champassack. According to the 2002 MLSW Guideline, every Lao migrant worker is required to undergo pre-departure training before being sent abroad (see table 1). It is worth noting that a Pre-Departure Training Curriculum (PDTC) for the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic- Thailand migration corridor was developed in 2014 with support from the ILO and may have strengthened pre- departure training since.

The subjects covered mostly focused on the nature of the job or job skills (78 per cent), life and living at destination (76 per cent). Less than half (42 per cent) were trained on contracts including rights and obligations, or legal provisions at destination (34 per cent) (see figure 29). There were some distinct patterns in this respect at the provincial level; 93 per cent of respondents from Luang Prabang received training on life/living at destination and 28 per cent on language skills compared to 64 and 0 per cent respectively in Champassack. The reverse was true for training on the contract including rights and obligations, with 52 per cent of respondents in Champassack and only 28 per cent in Luang Prabang receiving such information. The stronger emphasis on life and language skills in Luang Prabang may be explained by the fact that most respondents from the province were of Khmu ethnicity that is culturally and linguistically more distinct from Thailand than the predominantly ethnic Lao people interviewed in Champassack.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c11ba23-cacb-4125-a19a-d4e88313876f": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c11ba23-cacb-4125-a19a-d4e88313876f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whats-incentive", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "What's the Incentive?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whats-incentive", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b82f319a3247c565ab602c19559f07f12ca32cfd017c932f144e2f7c9544060c"}, "2": {"node_id": "2d200af1-e784-4f41-a331-9cf47da795d6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whats-incentive", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "03d772e1541b5761ca7b879f21462aa41f7e79596cb0770a958e5a223a2232e0"}}, "hash": "327b38ae13dda26b2137cb072f7a2640bcbbac6d0775394f6a2aa5efa66f0818", "text": "Figure\ufffd29:\ufffdSubjects\ufffdcovered\ufffdin\ufffdpre-departure\ufffdtraining\ufffdas\ufffdapplicable,\ufffdin\ufffdtotal,\ufffdby\ufffdgender\ufffdand\ufffd province\ufffdin\ufffdLao\ufffdPDR\ufffd(%) Men (N=51) Total (N=96) Women (N=45) Luang Prabang (N=40) Champassack (N=56) 100 80 60 40 20 0 78.1 86.3 68.9 80 76.8 76 78.4 73.3 92.5 64.3 41.7 45.1 37.8 27.5 51.8 33.3 25.5 42.2 42.5 26.8 18.8 19.6 17.8 22.5 16.1 11.5 13.7 8.9 27.5 0 Nature of work/job skills Introduction to life/living at destination The contract including rights and obligations Legal provisions at destination Seeking assistance in case of problems Language skills 32 Journey to Thailand About 70 per cent of respondents waited between two to five months following their agreement with the recruitment agency for the journey to Thailand to begin, but there were noteworthy variations at an individual level.

In most cases, they travelled with representatives from their Lao recruitment agency (91 per cent), and about a quarter also went with other migrant workers (28 per cent) and/or the employer/staff from the company (22 per cent). Further, 92 per cent of the respondents did not pay any money for their journey to Thailand, beyond what they may have paid to the recruitment agency for that purpose. The remaining 8 per cent, or 11 migrant workers, had costs ranging from THB120 to THB2,000. Among these were six men and five women, with eight coming from Luang Prabang and three from Champassack. Training at destination Only regular migrant workers from Champassack were asked whether they were (further) trained at destination, and if so what content was covered. Of the 86 respondents in that province, 80 \u2013 45 men and 35 women \u2013 indicated that they received training upon arrival, ranging from half-day to four days and covering topics such as nature of work and job skills (100 per cent among those receiving training), contract-related issues including rights and obligations (50 per cent), life and living at destination (45 per cent), legal provisions at destination (45 per cent), or how to access assistance in case of problems (31 per cent).

With 7 per cent engaged in fabric factories and 11 per cent in \u2018other\u2019 factories, a total of 90 per cent worked in different types of production facilities (see figure 31). In contrast, only 39 per cent of the irregular migrant workers were involved in factory work in Thailand, with service30 (33 per cent), construction (14 per cent) and domestic work (9 per cent) constituting significant other sectors of employment. It is worth noting that the Lao Government considers domestic work to be \u2018unskilled\u2019 and, as such, does not authorize labour migration through the MOU process into domestic work in Thailand.

What\u2019s the incentive? Comparing regular and irregular migrant work experiences from the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic to Thailand 35 Location of work The regular migrant workers were sent to work in 12 Thai provinces, while the irregular migrant workers were spread across 25 different provinces. Among the former, more than a quarter were based in Surat Thani, followed by 17 per cent in Pathum Thani and 13 per cent in Chon Buri. Ayutthaya (10 per cent) and Prachin Buri (9 per cent) were also important destination provinces for regular migrant workers. There were distinct patterns between provinces and sectors of employment, with 85 per cent of the regular migrant workers in Surat Thani, 82 per cent in Pathum Thani and 67 per cent in Prachin Buri employed in wood factories, whereas 85 per cent of those in Ayutthaya and 76 per cent in Chonburi were engaged in food factories. Marked patterns were also identifiable between origin and destination provinces, in that all regular migrant workers in Surat Thani and 82 per cent in Pathum Thani came from Champassack, whereas all those in Chonburi and 69 per cent in Ayutthaya were from Luang Prabang. In the irregular-migrant survey, more than 40 per cent of respondents were based in Bangkok, with significantly fewer numbers in Chonburi, Samut Sakhon and Chumphon (see figure 33). There were no recognizable patterns between provinces and sectors of employment among the irregular migrant workers.

Comparing regular and irregular migrant work experiences from the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic to Thailand 39 About 96 per cent of the regular migrant workers cited legal status-related costs including passports and other required documents, followed by authority-related costs (67 per cent) such as social welfare contributions, food- and water-related costs (54 per cent) and accommodation-related costs (25 per cent) (see figure 38). No respondent indicated any recruitment- or migration-/transportation-related deductions, although 15 per cent of the regular migrant workers\u2019 wages were to be deducted for a deportation fund in Thailand, according to the 2002 MOU (see table 1). The Thai LPA requires that employers not make any deductions from salaries, overtime or holiday pay of their workers, except for certain confined circumstances, some of which require the prior consent of the worker. Excluding payments for income taxes, such deductions in aggregate must not exceed 20 per cent of the worker\u2019s salary.38 Further, Lao regulations allow for deductions of up to 15 per cent of the migrant workers\u2019 monthly salaries for recruitment agencies to recover recruitment-related costs,39 with overall charges ranging from THB15,000-THB21,000. It is unclear, however, how these deductions relate to those in Thailand, especially with respect to maximum deductions per month.

Another three respondents indicated that they did not know whether consent had been provided, but none noted explicitly that they had not agreed to any of the deductions made. The 2002 MLSW Guideline requires that the contract between the migrant worker and the recruitment agency state the amount of deductions (see table 1). However, this research is not in a position to verify to what extent the regulation is implemented in practice. Weekly\ufffdworking\ufffdtime There were marked differences between regular and irregular migrant workers with respect to the hours worked per day in Thailand (see figure 39). 95 per cent of the former had a regular eight-hour working day, none worked less while two worked 12 and four worked 13 hours per day.40 Among the irregular migrant workers, only 28 per cent worked eight hours per day, and 6 per cent worked fewer hours, whereas 36 per cent worked between nine and 11 hours, and 31 per cent 12 hours or more per day \u2013 up to 18 hours in two cases. 38 Ministry of Labour (MOL): The Labour Protection Act B.E. 2541 (Bangkok, 1998). 39 Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare (MLSW): Guideline on Implementation of Decree on Export of Lao Workers Working Abroad No. 2417/MLSW (Vientiane, 2002). 40 There were five men and one women among these six respondents, and five worked in transport/storage whereas the sixth was engaged in a food factory. 40 Figure\ufffd39:\ufffdWorking\ufffdhours\ufffdper\ufffdday,\ufffdby\ufffdsurvey\ufffd(%) 100 80 60 40 20 0 0 2.5 0.8 0.8 0 0 0 95.2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1.6 3.2 Hours 4 5 7 6 8 9 10 11 12 14 15 16 17 18 13 Irregular (N=121) Regular (N=126) 1.7 13.2 20.7 1.7 1.7 1.7 4.1 8.3 2.5 0.8 28.1 11.6 Further, 99 per cent, or all but two, of the regular migrant workers indicated that they worked six days per week, which was only applicable to 36 per cent of the irregular migrant workers.

Six per cent reported having worked more, whereas 1 per cent worked less than previously agreed. Three per cent said that the question was not applicable given that the working time had not been agreed upon before. More men than women (8 per cent to 2 per cent) and more respondents from Champassack than Luang Prabang (9 per cent compared to 0 per cent) indicated that they worked longer hours than originally agreed, whereas results were consistent by type of work in Thailand. The irregular-migrant survey did not include a question of how actual working hours compared to previous agreements. It is worth pointing out that, with some exceptions, the standard daily and weekly working hours in Thailand must not exceed eight and 48 hours respectively, according to the Labour Protection Act.41 Whilst such standards were largely upheld among the regular migrant workers, the experiences of the irregular migrant workers suggest breaches in this respect. 41 Ministry of Labour (MOL): The Labour Protection Act B.E. 2541 (Bangkok, 1998).

There were some variations based on gender and type of work in this respect.

Further, all respondents working in wood factories said the same, but this only applied to 87 per cent of those engaged in food factories. The ILO\u2019s Committee of Experts has determined that mandatory overtime may be permissible, for as long as it remains within the limits stipulated in national legislation or collective agreements. However, it becomes forced labour if it exceeds such limits and is made compulsory by threat of penalty. This is irrespective of the reasons for the overtime work.43 The Thai LPA maintains the voluntariness of overtime work, although it introduces some exceptions. Further, it caps the permissible weekly overtime and holiday work at a combined 36 hours, whilst setting additional limitations for specific industries.44 Again, no such question was administered in the irregular-migrant survey. 43 International Labour Organization (ILO): General Survey concerning the Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29), and the Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, 1957 (No. 105) (Geneva, 2007). 44 Ministry of Labour (MOL): The Labour Protection Act B.E. 2541 (Bangkok, 1998).

Another noted that, when he finished his contract, the factory did not let him go and refused to hand out the passport to him. He hence returned to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic without his passport and paid THB500 to cross the border. Two more simply noted that their passports were still with their employers. There were differences based on gender, province in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and type of work in Thailand in this respect. Forty per cent of men versus 28 per cent of women suggested that they were unable to get hold of their passports from their employer/supervisor when needed, and so did 44 per cent of respondents from Champassack compared to 18 per cent from Luang Prabang. Disparities were most pronounced by type of work in Thailand, with 52 per cent of interviewees in wood factories as against 14 per cent in food factories not able to access their passports from employers or supervisors if wanted.

The ILO\u2019s Workers\u2019 Housing Recommendation, 1961 (No. 115) notes that it is \u201cgenerally not desirable that employers should provide housing for their workers directly, with the exception of cases in which circumstances necessitate that \u2026, for instance, when an undertaking is located at a long distance from normal centers of population, or where the nature of the employment requires that the worker should be available at short notice.\u201d49 Where housing is provided by the employer, the recommendation, amongst other aspects, reiterates the importance of safeguarding the workers\u2019 fundamental human rights including their freedom of association and movement.50 It is hence important to be considerate of and address potential signs that employer-provided housing is used as a means of exercising control over workers and/or otherwise infringing upon their rights. The recommendation further notes that rent should not be higher than a reasonable proportion of income and not include speculative profit.51 Complaints\ufffdmechanisms\ufffd About 63 per cent of the regular migrant workers suggested that there were opportunities to raise concerns about their employment conditions if wanted.

Another respondent highlighted that, whilst adjustments were made at first, the conditions changed back to their original status after some time. According to the 2002 MLSW Guideline, recruitment agencies are required to provide protection to regular migrant workers while these are abroad (see table 1). Further, the new Lao Labour Law adopted in 2014 has introduced opportunities for labour disputes with international character to be heard by competent authorities in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic.52 In Thailand, the LPA stipulates that workers including migrant workers are entitled to file a complaint against their employers with the Labour Inspector in the locality of their work, if the companies violate the employees\u2019 payment entitlements.53 This, however, appears to be a very limited framework for complaints. Additionally, the Thai Government maintains a hotline, 1694, providing information to and receiving complaints from both Thai and migrant workers about their employment, including in English, Burmese and Khmer.54 Based on the responses provided to this study, it is unclear whether regular migrants are aware of such channels in either country, or if they feel empowered enough to draw upon them. Indeed, a 2017 ILO report on access to justice for migrant workers notes that not a single complaint was documented by the Migrant Worker Resource Centres (MRCs) in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic over a period of four years. Established in 2011, MRCs provide legal assistance to migrant workers and their families in seeking redress for abuses during recruitment and employment, and in accessing social protection benefits. However, various challenges including procedural uncertainties and insufficient outreach have inhibited the filing of complaints.55 52 Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare (MLSW): Labour Law (Vientiane, 2013). 53 Ministry of Labour (MOL): The Labour Protection Act B.E. 2541 (Bangkok, 1998). 54 Ministry of Labour (MOL): 1694 Hotline Has The Answers (Bangkok, 2015). In 2016, the Thai Department of Employment also introduced the website \u2018Help Me\u2019 providing services similar to those of the 1694 hotline in Thai and five foreign languages. The website can be accessed here: https://www.doe.go.th/helpme. 55 International Labour Organization (ILO): Access to justice for migrant workers in South-East Asia (Bangkok, 2017). 50 Constraints\ufffdto\ufffdleave\ufffdemployment The regular migrant workers were asked if they felt constrained to quit their jobs, if they wanted or when they tried. While 85 per cent did not experience such restrictions, 15 per cent noted that they did (see figure 50).

Whilst the responses lack depth to fully assess the nature of the perceived restrictions, references to menaces of penalty are of serious concern. Such practices are considered to be indicators of forced labour and human trafficking, and require further investigation and appropriate responses. The irregular migrant workers were asked a similar but different question, namely whether their employer would have allowed them to quit their job, making comparisons between the two populations difficult. Whilst 84 per cent confirmed that this was the case, 7 per cent noted that they would not have been able to do so, with 9 per cent saying that they did not know.

Similarly, workers in food factories scored eight out of ten employment conditions better than those in wood factories, with substantial differences in four variables. Whilst differences were less pronounced in the regular-migrant survey based on gender, women on average viewed their employment conditions slightly better than men, the notable exception being ratings for physical violence at work. 62 Further, the regular migrant workers scored all seven employment-related variables included in both surveys better than the irregular migrant workers.

Overall, average remittances per month and person amounted to THB3,806 THB as against THB1,766 in monthly earnings back in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, i.e. more than twice the amount of money. Further, whilst remittances are typically sent in support of others, monthly incomes back home are likely to also have to provide for the respondents themselves. The ratio was particularly favourable towards remittances among women, for whom money sent home exceeded salary levels in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic by a factor of 2.8, compared to 1.8 for men. Further, respondents from Champassack recorded a ratio of 2.6 in favour of remittances, whilst their counterparts in Luang Prabang sent money home at a rate of 1.7 of their incomes in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic prior to migrating to Thailand.

Five per cent tried to find other work in Thailand before returning home, with four individuals succeeding and staying longer. Asked who arranged their return to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, 50 per cent of those who went back immediately said that they did so on their own, whereas 43 per cent had their trip organized by their employers. Another 7 per cent suggested that the recruitment agencies arranged for their return to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic.60 There were differences in this respect based on gender, province in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and type of work in Thailand. Variations were modest between men and women, with a higher proportion of men organizing the journey on their own, whilst arrangements through the employers were more prevalent among women. However, the differences were more pronounced at the provincial and employment level, with 67 per cent of the respondents from Champassack compared to 21 per cent in Luang Prabang, and 80 per cent of workers in wood factories versus 26 per in food factories self-organizing their return trip.

In practice, half of all regular migrant workers did not appear to benefit from any return arrangements by third parties. Moreover, authorities in the host country were to set up a deportation fund under the MOU (see table 1), to which migrant workers had to compulsorily contribute 15 per cent of their monthly salaries. These resources were supposed to be returned to the workers with interest as their stay in Thailand came to an end. The research did not identify any indication of the collection or use of these resources. Further, a 15 per cent salary deduction per month is significant, especially given overall low-income levels for migrant workers from the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. It is worth noting that the new MOU signed in 2016 does not include any reference to this fund. Recommendation of recruitment agency Asked to what extent they would recommend their recruitment agency to friends or relatives, 51 per cent of the regular migrant workers said \u2018quite possibly\u2019 or \u2018definitely\u2019, while 35 per cent responded \u2018not at all\u2019 or \u2018rather not\u2019; another 14 per cent were undecided. There were variations for all the key variables of gender, province in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and type of work in Thailand, albeit to different degrees. Women, on average, were slightly more positive about their recruitment companies, with 55 per cent compared to 48 per cent of men stating that they would \u2018quite possibly\u2019 or \u2018definitely\u2019 recommend their agencies. However, differences were more pronounced at the provincial and employment levels; that is, while 89 per cent of respondents in Luang Prabang would \u2018quite possibly\u2019 or \u2018definitely\u2019 recommend their agency, this only applied to 31 per cent in Champassack. Further, 73 per cent of workers in food factories as against 37 per cent in wood factories reported \u2018quite possibly\u2019 or \u2018definitely\u2019 recommending their recruitment companies. 61 Another respondent was arrested at the border, with a sister reportedly paying THB23,000 for his release.

However, there were differences in the questions asked; whilst the regular migrant workers responded on whether they would like to seek compensation from their recruitment agency in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; from their employer in Thailand; and/or from any others, the irregular migrant workers were only asked if they generally wanted to seek compensation. Among the regular migrant workers, 15 men and seven women wanted to claim compensation, with four from Luang Prabang and 18 from Champassack reflecting the overall more positive labour migration experiences of respondents in the former. Further, this included seven workers in food and ten in wood factories. Asked from whom they would like to seek payments, ten regular migrant workers referred to their respective recruitment agencies in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; six to their employers in Thailand; and another six to others, such as their supervisors or heads of different departments/divisions.

It is interesting that a larger proportion of the regular migrant workers wanted to seek compensation and bring criminal charges despite overall better labour migration experiences. A possible explanation may be that they felt more empowered to do so than the irregular migrant workers given their immigration status. Further, they perhaps had higher expectations with respect to recruitment practices and employment conditions having abided by all procedures in their labour migration. 62 Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare (MLSW): Labour Law (Vientiane, 2013). What\u2019s the incentive? Comparing regular and irregular migrant work experiences from the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic to Thailand 71 6. Summary The summary is divided into the four key sections of the analysis and provides a synopsis of their main findings. Where relevant, it highlights differences based on survey, gender, province in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and type of work in Thailand. Background\ufffdand\ufffdpre-departure\ufffdconditions The demographics of the regular and irregular migrant workers were similar. Results were broadly consistent with respect to the age when they started working in Thailand, with more than 10 per cent in both cohorts migrating when they were still children. Higher proportions of children were identified originating from Champassack than Luang Prabang among the regular migrants, and from Champassack compared to Saravan in the irregular-migrant survey. In both surveys, children were more represented among women than men. Further, the educational levels of the respondents were limited, with 31 per cent of the regular and 20 per cent of the irregular migrant workers not having completed any formal education. In the regular-migrant survey, men were more likely than women to not have finished any schooling (36 to 25 per cent), whereas more women than men only completed primary education (50 per to 20 per cent). Most respondents in both surveys were working in agriculture prior to migrating to Thailand. In addition, higher proportions of regular migrant workers were employed in construction, whilst more irregular migrant workers were unemployed in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. Further, in the regular-migrant survey, a greater share of women than men were working in agriculture, whereas all those in the construction sector were men. The mean monthly income of the regular migrant workers in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic was THB1,766, with 18 per cent indicating that they had no steady income. In the same survey, respondents in Luang Prabang earned almost twice as much as those in Champassack (THB2,566 compared to THB1,348), whilst men, on average, earned more than women (THB1,947 versus THB1,524). The regular migrant workers, on a scale from 1 \u2018very bad\u2019 to 5 \u2018very good\u2019, rated their quality of life in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic at an average of 2.8 and, as such, less favourably than the irregular migrant workers at 3.1. Among the former, respondents from Luang Prabang viewed their lives as significantly worse than those in Champassack (2.5 compared to 3.0). 72 Recruitment\ufffdprocess\ufffd The analysis of the recruitment process is only based on the regular-migrant survey, unless otherwise indicated. Most regular migrant workers first heard about labour migration options via recruitment agencies through the companies themselves (62 per cent), followed by information from family, friends or the community (22 per cent), and media channels (16 per cent). The agencies were a more important source of information for respondents in Champassack, whereas media channels and family/friends played a greater role in Luang Prabang. Further, recruitment agencies and the media were more significant for men than women, whilst the reverse was true for family/friends. The recruitment agencies were chosen primarily because they were the only agencies that respondents were aware of (86 per cent), followed by recommendations received from others (21 per cent).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bee45915-59e0-45f5-b625-839b239f112b": {"__data__": {"id_": "bee45915-59e0-45f5-b625-839b239f112b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whats-incentive", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "What's the Incentive?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whats-incentive", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0c15947b8f19f9a06bef86754a1e8e82a438269e38eef5c540aa0d9cf242e077"}, "2": {"node_id": "b14daef9-8513-4b0d-b330-8ce93f671eeb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whats-incentive", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a94b61ad90575c6e5bf33ccc7ff20e75d47cf1cc6f1a3fbb1cc51eacf4c28d9b"}}, "hash": "fdb63e61cfb40bd0dd62f0d045fff4d873823257f72ec7da96545a11fe767135", "text": "A higher proportion of respondents in Champassack than in Luang Prabang selected their agency because it was the only one they knew of, whereas in the latter a more substantial share suggested that their chosen agency promised many and good services.

Eighty-nine per cent of the regular migrant workers stated that they signed a contract with their respective recruitment agency and prior to departure. Among these, merely 40 per cent received a copy of the agreement, including higher proportions in Luang Prabang than in Champassack. Further, more than two-thirds of those who signed contracts did not fully or at all understand the terms and conditions. This applied to a larger share of respondents in Champassack than in Luang Prabang. The most important reason for the lack of understanding was the complicated terminology (43 per cent), followed by respondents simply not having read the agreement (36 per cent). Others noted that the contract was not in a language that they could read (15 per cent), or that they were not given enough time to study it (11 per cent). The language factor was more important among women than men, and in Champassack than in Luang Prabang, whereas the time factor was a bigger concern in Luang Prabang than in Champassack. Further, none of the regular migrant workers signed an agreement with their employer upon arriving in Thailand. Whilst, at the time of the research, this was not in contradiction to national legislation in the two countries or their bilateral MOU on Employment Cooperation, enforcing working conditions in the destination country as agreed in the country of origin remains problematic. Seventy-three per cent of the regular migrant workers reported receiving pre-departure training in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. This applied to 68 per cent of men compared to 80 per cent of women, and to 89 per cent of respondents in Luang Prabang as against 65 per cent in Champassack. According to the 2002 MLSW Guideline, every Lao migrant worker is required to undergo pre-departure training before being sent abroad. 78 per cent of those who received pre-departure training said that it lasted half a day, with another 20 per cent having a full-day training. The mean waiting time for the journey to begin following an agreement with the recruitment agency was four months (122 days), but there were noteworthy variations at an individual level. Whereas 9 per cent left after 30 or fewer days, 20 per cent had to wait six months or longer \u2013 in some cases almost two years. Men waited an average of 12 days longer than women, and respondents in Luang Prabang 39 days more than their counterparts in Champassack. These periods were significantly longer than official estimates of 55 days, from the time that an employer identifies a vacancy to the actual arrival of the migrant worker, and likely an important factor in migrant workers\u2019 choice of regular or irregular migration channels. What\u2019s the incentive? Comparing regular and irregular migrant work experiences from the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic to Thailand 73 Working\ufffdand\ufffdliving\ufffdconditions\ufffdin\ufffdThailand There were marked differences in the working and living conditions in Thailand between the regular and irregular migrant workers, with the regular migrant workers, on average, being more positive about both aspects. However, respondents in the two cohorts also expressed various degrees of concerns. Forty-four per cent of regular migrant workers were employed in wood and 28 per cent in food including seafood factories. With another 7 per cent engaged in fabric factories and 11 per cent in other factories, a total of 90 per cent worked in different types of production facilities. In contrast, only 39 per cent of the irregular migrant workers were involved in factory work in Thailand, with service (33 per cent), construction (14 per cent) and domestic work (9 per cent) constituting significant other sectors of employment. It is worth noting that the Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic considers domestic work to be \u2018unskilled\u2019 and, as such, does not recruit for this sector through licensed recruitment agencies. Among the regular migrant workers, a greater proportion of women than men worked in food and wood factories, whereas more men than women were employed in transport- and storage-related jobs. Further, respondents from Luang Prabang were predominantly engaged in food factories, while those from Champassack mainly worked in wood factories. Eighty-seven per cent of the regular migrant workers said that their jobs were the same as previously agreed with their recruitment agencies; 8 per cent noted that the question was not applicable as their work had not been defined prior to departure; and another 5 per cent suggested that their jobs were different from what had been agreed.

Major disadvantageous differences between agreed and actual working conditions are considered to be an indicator of forced labour and human trafficking. The mean monthly salary after deductions among the regular migrant workers was THB6,667, whereas the irregular migrant workers\u2019 \u2018actual salary\u2019 averaged THB6,864. The former was 3.8 times higher than the regular migrant workers\u2019 mean income in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic prior to migrating. In the regular-migrant survey, men, on average, earned THB526 more per month than women, and respondents from Luang Prabang benefitted from an extra THB793 compared to those from Champassack. Moreover, respondents employed in food factories earned THB877 more per month than their peers in wood factories. A significant number of respondents were paid below the wage floor of about THB7,200 per month at the time of data collection. Payment terms below minimum wages are considered to be an indicator of exploitation in determining forced labour and human trafficking. For 80 per cent of the regular migrant workers, the actual amounts received were the same as agreed with the recruitment agency. Six per cent noted that the question was not applicable, as their salaries had not been previously established, and 14 per cent said that their salaries were not in line with prior agreements. A higher proportion of respondents in Champassack compared to those in Luang Prabang noted that their salaries were not in line with previous agreements, and similar tendencies were true for workers in wood factories versus those in food factories. There were marked differences between regular and irregular migrant workers with respect to the hours worked per day in Thailand. 95 per cent of the former had a regular eight-hour working day, whereas this applied to only 28 per cent of the irregular migrant workers. Instead, 67 per cent of the latter spent longer hours working, many significantly so. Further, 99 per cent of the regular migrant workers indicated that they worked six days per week, as compared to 36 per cent of the irregular migrant workers. Among the latter, the majority (63 per cent, including 70 per cent of all men and 55 per cent of all women) worked seven days a week. Ninety-six per cent of the regular migrant workers indicated that their passports were retained by their employer or supervisor, with 35 per cent reporting that they were unable to access them if wanted. 40 per cent of men versus 28 per cent of women suggested that they could not get hold of their passports from their employer/supervisor when needed, and so did 44 per cent of respondents from Champassack compared to 18 per cent from Luang Prabang. Disparities were most pronounced by type of work in Thailand, with 52 per cent of interviewees in wood factories as against 14 per cent in food factories not able to access their passports from employers or supervisors if wanted. 74 Confiscation of identity documents is considered to be an indicator of forced labour and human trafficking. While passport retention was not specifically outlawed in Thailand at the time of data collection, the government has since introduced legislation prohibiting this conduct. Sixty-three per cent of the regular migrant workers suggested that there were opportunities to raise concerns about their employment conditions if wanted. However, whereas 70 per cent of the men noted that there were such opportunities, this only applied to 54 per cent of the women. Further, 63 per cent of the respondents working in wood factories acknowledged the existence of channels to complain, but only 51 per cent of those engaged in food factories stated the same. Almost all 79 regular migrant workers referred to one or both of two available channels to file complaints, namely via staff representatives or supervisors and/or employers. Recruitment agencies, labour inspectors, other authorities, trade unions or civil society organizations did not seem to play a significant role in this context. According to the 2002 MLSW Guideline, recruitment agencies are required to provide protection to regular migrant workers while these are abroad. Further, the new Lao Labour Law adopted in 2014 has introduced opportunities for labour disputes with international character to be heard by competent authorities in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. In Thailand, the LPA stipulates that workers including migrant workers are entitled to file a complaint against their employers with the labour inspector in the locality of their work, if the companies violate the employees\u2019 payment entitlements.

Respondents in the regular-migrant survey were asked if they felt constrained to quit their jobs, with 15 per cent noting that they did. Higher proportions of men than women, and of respondents from Champassack than from Luang Prabang, felt constrained in this respect. The irregular migrant workers were asked a similar but different question, namely whether their employer would have allowed them to quit their job, and 7 per cent noted that they would not have been able to do so. The regular migrant workers assessed ten variables related to work and life in Thailand from 1 \u2018very bad (or equivalent) to 5 \u2018very good\u2019 (or equivalent), seven of which were also administered in the irregular-migrant survey. Among the former, the average ratings for all ten were better in Luang Prabang than in Champassack, and workers in food factories scored eight out of ten better than those in wood factories. Further, whilst differences in the regular-migrant survey were less pronounced based on gender, women viewed their employment and living conditions slightly better than men, the notable exception being ratings for physical violence at work. Finally, the regular migrant workers scored all seven employment-related variables included in both surveys better than the irregular migrant workers. Some of these variables relate to fundamental human rights enshrined in international law (for example, freedom of movement); others including payment terms, working time, physical violence or forms of harassment, if experienced as very negatively, may be indicators of coercion or exploitation in the context of human trafficking and forced labour. Against this background, it is of concern that, for many variables, 10 per cent or more of respondents, irrespective of their immigration status, described negative or very negative conditions. Ninety-four per cent of the regular and 78 per cent of the irregular migrant workers reported sending remittances back home in support of their families and/or dependents. Among the former, results were consistently above 90 per cent across genders, provinces in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and types of work in Thailand, with higher proportions of women than men and more workers in wood than in food factories remitting money. In the regular-migrant survey, the average amount of remittances sent back to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic per person and year was THB45,666. Women sent more money home per year than men (THB50,977 to THB41,526 despite earning less in Thailand. Further, respondents in Luang Prabang recorded higher annual average transfers than those in Champassack (THB 51,167 to THB42,742), and the same was true for workers in food compared to wood factories (THB54,344 to THB48,247). Average remittances per month and person among the regular migrant workers came to THB3,806 as against THB1,766 in monthly earnings back in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, more than twice the amount of money. Moreover, for women, the money sent home exceeded their salary levels in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic by a factor of 2.8, compared to 1.8 for men; and respondents from Champassack recorded a ratio of 2.6 in favour of remittances, as against 1.7 for those from Luang Prabang. What\u2019s the incentive? Comparing regular and irregular migrant work experiences from the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic to Thailand 75 Also noting that remittances are typically sent in support of others whereas monthly incomes back home are likely to have to provide for respondents themselves as well, the research points to significant financial benefits associated with regular labour migration from the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic to Thailand. Moreover, there were marked differences between regular and irregular migrant workers based on the average time they spent working in Thailand. The mean duration among the former was 23 months, close to the maximum initial period of employment (two years) under the 2002 MOU, whereas the irregular migrant workers only stayed for an average of 11 months. On average, respondents in the regular-migrant survey rated their quality of life in Thailand significantly better than those in the irregular-migrant cohort. Close to 80 per cent of the former indicated that their lives were \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018very good\u2019 compared to 57 per cent of the irregular migrant workers. Further, both regular and irregular migrant workers scored their lives in Thailand as significantly better than in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ce778e3b-d38e-4252-8e6b-f19f5fc65f76": {"__data__": {"id_": "ce778e3b-d38e-4252-8e6b-f19f5fc65f76", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whats-incentive", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "What's the Incentive?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whats-incentive", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a020f7b1fe19cbdb32bf77e2bb13eab1cf414a92721e1a8bff5db6f277edc2b4"}, "2": {"node_id": "ff61f60a-d83a-4588-a860-ad1179f725fd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whats-incentive", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3778d71ff71613f31906f7bcba336042198f4f59eba507e39f366d00e9796e56"}}, "hash": "e9cc3f7f5b10cdecd66d6a908aab316853a6ec49bdf7c8e5b2bf4e8f321a0b19", "text": "In the regular-migrant survey, workers in food factories, on average, rated their life in Thailand as better than those in wood factories, and so did respondents from Luang Prabang than their peers from Champassack.

Asked who arranged their return, 50 per cent of those who went back immediately said that they did so on their own, whereas 43 per cent had their trip organized by their employers. Another 7 per cent suggested that the recruitment agencies arranged for their return. A higher proportion of men organized the journey on their own, whilst arrangements through the employers were more prevalent among women. However, the differences were more pronounced at the provincial and employment level, with 67 per cent of the respondents from Champassack compared to 21 per cent in Luang Prabang, and 80 per cent of workers in wood factories versus 26 per cent in food factories self-organizing their return trip. In the 2002 MOU, the two countries committed to collaborating in sending workers home when their employment period came to an end, but the nature and scope of the collaboration remained unclear in this study. In practice, half of all regular migrant workers did not appear to benefit from any return arrangements by third parties. Moreover, authorities in Thailand were to set up a deportation fund under the MOU, to which migrant workers had to compulsorily contribute 15 per cent of their monthly salaries. These resources were supposed to be returned to the workers with interest as their stays in Thailand came to an end. The research did not identify any indication of the collection or use of these resources. It is worth noting that the new MOU signed in 2016 no longer includes any reference to the deportation fund. Asked to what extent they would recommend their recruitment agency to friends or relatives, 51 per cent of the regular migrant workers said \u2018quite possibly\u2019 or \u2018definitely\u2019, while 35 per cent responded \u2018not at all\u2019 or \u2018rather not\u2019; another 14 per cent were undecided. Whilst women assessed their recruitment companies slightly more positively than men, differences were more pronounced at the provincial and employment levels. 89 per cent of respondents in Luang Prabang would \u2018quite possibly\u2019 or \u2018definitely\u2019 recommend their agency as against 31 per cent in Champassack; and 73 per cent of workers in food factories compared to 37 per cent in wood factories reported \u2018quite possibly\u2019 or \u2018definitely\u2019 recommending their recruitment companies. Further, 17 per cent of the regular compared to 2 per cent of the irregular migrant workers wanted to claim compensation due to their labour migration experiences. Among the former, there were 15 men and seven women, with four from Luang Prabang and 18 from Champassack. Seven of them worked in food and ten in wood factories. In addition, 15 per cent of the regular compared to none of the irregular migrant workers wanted to bring criminal charges against others for their labour migration experiences. This included 13 men and seven women, with four from Luang Prabang and 16 from Champassack. Seven worked in food and nine in wood factories. It is interesting that a larger proportion of the regular migrant workers wanted to seek compensation and bring criminal charges despite overall better labour migration experiences. A possible explanation may be that they felt more empowered to do so than the irregular migrant workers given their immigration status. Further, they perhaps had higher expectations with respect to recruitment practices and employment conditions having abided by all procedures in their labour migration. 76 7. Recommendations The following recommendations have been developed in response to the findings of this study and relate to both Thailand and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. Where implemented in Thailand, these will likely affect the broader population of migrant workers in the country, including particularly nationals of Myanmar and Cambodia. 1. Streamline and expedite the process for regular labour migration between the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Thailand One of the key challenges in the regular labour migration channels between the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Thailand is the time it takes from enlisting the services of a recruitment agency to being able to start the job. This is further compounded by well-established irregular labour migration patterns that remain an attractive alternative, given the lower costs and time investment, especially for those with urgent economic needs. The Governments of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Thailand are encouraged to improve current procedures, with a particular view towards simplification and acceleration. Additional investment through national budgets to ensure efficiency of regular migration processes is recommended. 2. Regulate the licensing of recruitment agencies and monitor their delivery of recruitment services There were significant variations in migrant workers\u2019 experiences with recruitment agencies, with the analysis suggesting that some hiring practices were in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2c0c844f-fb68-4fb9-add5-25b7338cd299": {"__data__": {"id_": "2c0c844f-fb68-4fb9-add5-25b7338cd299", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whats-incentive", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "What's the Incentive?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whats-incentive", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6713227e707ee5115436122a668bfe6b68f06d7dd009d437327fb29e94b95b83"}}, "hash": "6713227e707ee5115436122a668bfe6b68f06d7dd009d437327fb29e94b95b83", "text": "contradiction to the policy framework governing labour migration between the two countries. The Governments of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Thailand are encouraged to adequately and transparently regulate the recruitment industry including by specifying obligations of agencies and employers towards migrant workers, and to strengthen processes that allow migrant workers to lodge complaints when faced with fraudulent actions. Further, sanctions need to be levied against recruitment agencies that engage in abuse \u2013 including through referral to criminal justice institutions \u2013 whilst ethical hiring practices should be positively incentivized. The introduction of a joint and several liability system is encouraged to reduce accountability gaps between Thailand and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, where the study found little to no enforcement of any liability against recruitment agencies, employers or irregular brokers. Under such an approach, all relevant parties (employers, recruitment agencies in countries of origin and destination) are jointly liable for abuses and exploitation that occur during the migration process, meaning that recruitment agencies can be held responsible for violations by employers, and vice versa. The Philippines provides a potentially applicable model. What\u2019s the incentive? Comparing regular and irregular migrant work experiences from the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic to Thailand 77 Further, policy and practice should ensure that government officials (and members of their families) working on labour migration, immigration, licensing, passport and work permit issuance and related matters do not own or have commercial interest in recruitment agencies. Penalties for fraudulent actions through abuse of position should serve the broader notions of justice, thus increasing the incentive for ethical and transparent recruitment and related services. The public\u2019s easy access to information about recruitment agency licenses and conduct including through reports from migrant workers using their services is recommended, and the creation of a recruitment industry body to promote ethical recruitment services is suggested for consideration. Recruitment agency associations provide a vehicle for self-regulation, monitoring ethical recruitment practices and codes of conduct, and can act as industry stakeholders in the development of law and policy. Comparable industry associations have been created in Cambodia, Myanmar and Viet Nam. 3. Review and enforce the contracting process of migrant workers Some respondents reported not signing a contract prior to their departure. Further, among those who did sign an agreement, many did not fully or at all comprehend the terms, partly due to the complicated terminology, or potentially because of language and literacy challenges. In the contracts that were concluded, various key terms and conditions regarding work and life in Thailand remained unspecified. Moreover, a significant proportion of workers did not receive a copy of their contract for their own records, and none of the respondents signed an agreement with their actual employer in Thailand. The 2002 MLSW Guideline requires that all migrant workers sign and receive a copy of their contract; that the agreement cover key aspects of the employment conditions, such as salaries; and that the document be written in a way that is clearly understandable. Relevant authorities, recruitment agencies and employers in both countries are encouraged to review the contracting process to ensure the Guideline is more adequately enforced, including through a tripartite consultative dialogue and with the involvement of former and prospective migrant workers. Contracts need to be provided in a language that is understood by migrant workers, and the process must allow migrant workers the time to consider the terms of employment including through independent and unbiased review. Further, the enforceability of contracts in Thailand must be ensured, where contract substitution remains an issue. Recruitment and employment contracts should operate with joint and several liability clauses, so that recruitment agencies can be held responsible for working conditions in destination countries that do not adhere to the terms of their contracts, and vice versa. 4. Strengthen procedures to verify the age of prospective migrant workers The findings suggest that Lao children appear to have been recruited for work in Thailand, including some at a very young age. Relevant authorities and recruitment agencies are encouraged to reinforce processes that help verify the age of prospective migrant workers. These include reliable birth registration and citizenship document procedures, which are needed to ensure that recruitment agencies and employers can trust the validity of identification documents. 5. Monitor and review pre-departure trainings Pre-departure training is a requirement for all prospective migrant workers as per the 2002 MLSW Guideline, and the ability to deliver such classes is a condition of recruitment agency licensing. This study finds that not all migrant workers received pre-departure training and questions remain about its quality, partly because of the short programme duration. In 2014, a standardised pre-departure training curriculum", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e5982b44-8ca4-4b5f-a660-b50dc56f48ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "e5982b44-8ca4-4b5f-a660-b50dc56f48ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whats-incentive", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "What's the Incentive?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/whats-incentive", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "31bbfb1bf134af7439153f2e54683135c7e112bf520c2a7c2a6ac9a1cd9794fa"}}, "hash": "31bbfb1bf134af7439153f2e54683135c7e112bf520c2a7c2a6ac9a1cd9794fa", "text": "was established in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic with ILO support, a training-of-trainers was held, and deliberations on how to ensure all prospective migrant workers can access this training continue. Current legislative developments in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic can be considered as an opportunity to review the utility of the pre-departure training programme to date with the involvement of migrant workers, and to make revisions as needed. The delivery of trainings through actors other than recruitment agencies is recommended for consideration during these revisions. 78 6. Ensure that all migrant workers have access to their identification and travel documents at all times It is a serious concern that the passports of almost all respondents in the regular-migrant survey were retained by their employer or supervisor, and that more than a third did not have access to their documents even if wanted. Not being in possession of identification and travel papers seriously constrains freedom of movement, increases risks of arrest from authorities and can be an important factor in coercing workers to remain in jobs against their will. It is strongly recommended that relevant authorities in Thailand work with employers to ensure that workers retain their identification and travel documents at all times. Safe storage needs to be standard in employer-provided housing or as part of other provisions made for 24-hour access to these documents. 7. Strengthen monitoring of working conditions including by improving complaints mechanisms and labour inspections Regular migrant workers, on average, reported better employment experiences in Thailand than irregular workers. Still, significant proportions in both groups highlighted various concerns related to wages and payment terms, working hours and overtime, nature of work, treatment from bosses/supervisors, freedom of movement, physical violence at work, sexual or other forms of harassments, and restrictions to quit their jobs. Relevant stakeholders are encouraged to strengthen monitoring of working conditions, and to work with companies/employers to make improvements as needed. Most regular migrant workers suggested that there were opportunities to raise concerns, but these were almost exclusively available through staff representatives or directly with supervisors/employers. Recruitment agencies, labour inspectors, other authorities, trade unions or civil society organizations are encouraged to take a more active role in ensuring their labour rights. Migrant workers must have confidential and safe avenues for reporting incidences of abuse, harassment, violence or exploitation without fear of deportation, and access to the full range of resolutions available under Thai law including compensation. A \u2018firewall\u2019 between grievance processes and immigration authorities needs to be put in place to encourage lodgement of complaints. 8. Ensure consistent implementation of the \u2018zero fee\u2019 or \u2018employer pays\u2019 principle Respondents had different experiences with respect to payments for labour migration procedures to Thailand. Whilst the majority noted that they did not directly pay the recruitment agencies, significant numbers did including at times high sums. Further, all regular migrant workers reported having deductions from their salaries, partly to pay for costs related to the labour migration process. A \u2018zero fee\u2019 or \u2018employer pays\u2019 policy for all migrant workers, as enshrined in the ILO Private Employment Agencies Convention, 1997 (No. 181), the accompanying Private Employment Agencies Recommendation, 1997 (No. 188), and the 2016 ILO General Principles and Operational Guidelines on Fair Recruitment, should be legislated and enforced by both Thailand and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. From 2016, Thailand has commendably taken steps in this direction, prohibiting recruitment agencies from charging fees to migrant workers, however the corresponding standard on the Lao side has not been legislated. At present, the implementation of the policy on the Thai side may risk payments being made in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; a situation that does not achieve the goal of reducing fees payable by migrant works, and which contravenes international standards on the recruitment of migrant workers. 9. Promote pay equality between women, men, migrants and nationals, and ensure that workers in informal sectors receive decent wages in line with agreements with their employers Findings have revealed pay gaps between men and women, and identified payment terms that are at times well below minimum wage levels across all respondent groups. The Governments of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Thailand are encouraged to promote and guarantee wage equality, and to ensure that at least minimum wage is paid to all workers \u2013 nationals and migrants; women and men; those employed in the formal and informal economy; and migrants with regular and irregular legal status.

For migrant workers accepting jobs in informal sectors, labour inspections need to be extended to help guarantee that they receive wages in line with their employment agreements, whether written or verbal. 10. Repeal all gender-based restrictions on labour migration There continues to be confusion around the availability of regular channels for Lao women to migrate for domestic work in Thailand. The analysis has only identified Lao domestic workers in the irregular- and not in the regular-migrant worker survey. Coupled with a corresponding lack of specific trainings, placement services and in-country support for Lao migrant women in domestic work, this contributes to various vulnerabilities including of abuse and exploitation. In accordance with international standards and ILO conventions, the Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic is encouraged to repeal all provisions that restrict labour migration on the basis of gender, including sectoral restrictions that unduly affect women. The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic has signed and ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). Its General Recommendation No. 26 calls on state parties to repeal bans that are sex-specific and discriminatory with respect to restrictions on women\u2019s migration, whether for age, pregnancy, marital or maternity status.63 It is recommended that authorities in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic consult women migrant workers, through a tripartite social dialogue, as part of the process of lifting bans and putting in place protective mechanisms. Further, both governments are encouraged to sign and ratify the ILO Domestic Workers Convention, 2011 (No. 189)64 and update national laws accordingly. 11. Review the organization and costing of migrant workers\u2019 journeys home In the 2002 MOU, Thailand and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic committed to collaborating in sending migrant workers\u2019 home to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, though it remained unclear if this related to deportations or assistance for return travel upon contract completion. Many respondents noted that they organized their return themselves. Further, the MOU stipulated that a deportation fund be established, to which migrant workers compulsorily contributed 15 per cent of their monthly salaries \u2013 a prohibitively high proportion of already low wages. Yet, the research did not identify any indication of the fund\u2019s existence and the new MOU as revised in 2016 no longer includes references to such a mechanism. It is proposed that relevant authorities, recruitment agencies and employers review the organization and costing of migrant workers\u2019 return journeys. A migrant worker welfare fund, with a clearly defined purpose and well-managed monies to the benefit of migrant workers, is generally considered good practice. In establishing such a fund, however, care must be taken to ensure that costs are not passed on to migrant workers. 63 Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW): General recommendation No. 26 on women migrant workers (Geneva, 2008). 64 International Labour Organization (ILO): Domestic Workers Convention, 2011 (No. 189) (Geneva, 2011).

Comparing regular and irregular migrant work experiences from the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic to Thailand Regular migration is often seen as the safest and most bene\ufb01cial means of migrating for work. Little empirical work, however, has been conducted comparing the experiences of regular and irregular migrant workers, and assessing the associated migration outcomes. This report, informed by two surveys, considers the relative experiences of regular and irregular migrant workers travelling from Lao PDR to Thailand. It outlines the regulatory framework for labour migration between the two countries, evaluates regular migrant workers\u2019 experiences, and compares these with conditions faced by irregular migrant workers. The study covers respondents\u2019 backgrounds and pre-departure conditions; recruitment; working and living conditions in Thailand; and return to Lao PDR.

Foreword by the United Nations Development Programme AI 4 Development 4.0: Opportunities and Challenges for Accelerating Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific UNDP partnered with the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) to review the likely implications of this technological revolution on progress towards the SDGs in the Asia-Pacific region. The resulting analysis identifies the region\u2019s risk flashpoints, the channels through which risks might constrain SDG progress, and, critically, the ways that new technologies might be harnessed to advance rather than hinder sustainable development.

Designing new social and economic approaches is daunting and will not happen overnight. This report points to several key policy areas where governments can begin assessing and adapting their current approaches, institutions, and policies for the coming era. Building on the report\u2019s analysis, UNDP has specifically identified five critical themes that can help form the basis for transformation: 1) Embrace predictive and adaptive decision-making; 2) Capture emerging sources of growth and employment; 3) Reimagine citizen engagement and personalised service delivery; 4) Enhance protection to leave no one behind; and 5) Mobilise and allocate finance for a better future. These represent critical domains where governments\u2014together with civil society, the private sector, and development partners\u2014can evaluate current approaches, consider future scenarios, and create and test new systems and models. This does not represent a comprehensive set of recommendations covering all the ways technology is likely to affect societies. A regional overview also cannot develop a policy roadmap for any specific country. The Asia-Pacific region is diverse and the Fourth Industrial Revolution will affect countries in different ways. But this report and the accompanying UNDP policy recommendations highlight critical areas where action now can boost a country\u2019s ability to capitalise on opportunities arising from the inevitable technological change underway. It is up to each government to develop solutions appropriate to their own economic and social context. This report and recommendations aim to support this process, principally by identifying themes for further analysis and by guiding policy and institutional design that can help societies embrace the opportunities afforded by technological change and manage the possible negative consequences of it. 5 The Asia-Pacific region is in the throes of a digital transformation, accelerated by technological change, including intelligent robots, autonomous drones, sensors, and 3-D printing. Countries must adapt or be left behind if they are to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Executive summary Over 60% of salaried workers in Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam occupy positions at high risk of automation. Progress on at least nine Sustainable Development Goals could be directly affected by the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and millions in Asia\u2019s emergent middle class could slide back into poverty. Possible responses include strengthening social protection policies, leveraging AI and automation to optimise public services, promoting the use of technology to solve ecological challenges, and supporting new growth sectors. 7 Automation, artificial intelligence (AI) and the innovations of the \u201cFourth Industrial Revolution\u201d are penetrating everything from automotive, garment and electronics manufacturing to business processes, logistics and healthcare. The benefits, in terms of efficiency, productivity, speed and agility, are undoubted. These innovations could make products safer, increase industrial productivity, shorten global supply chains and make public services more personalised, predictive, and participatory, as citizens both provide and benefit from increasing data flows around public services. However, as with all technological change, their impact will be shaped by choices and the ends to which they are put. Just like nuclear fission could create civilian energy or military weapons, these innovations could have a wide range of applications and impacts \u2013 both positive and negative. Unemployment is the most commonly discussed threat. Labour organisations, governments and economists are concerned that human workers are vulnerable to replacement at an unprecedented scale and speed, which could worsen inequality, undermine social cohesion, and increase poverty. Machine learning (ML) and automation, through which physical and digital robots acquire abilities once considered uniquely human \u2013 like strategic thought, self-corrective learning and context-responsiveness \u2013 could replace many lower- and middle-class jobs that have been engines of social mobility in times past. This is not just a threat to jobs but also to the tax base in nations where formal employment in at-risk sectors like manufacturing and business service outsourcing is threatened. UNEMPLOYMENT IS THE MOST COMMONLY DISCUSSED THREAT.

What can be done to avert negative outcomes and ensure that automation, AI and the new digital economy make a net positive contribution to the SDGs? This report presents a structured, developing Asia-focused assessment of these questions. It outlines the positive and negative channels through which AI and automation will impact the achievement of the SDGs and then lays out the policy instruments available to governments to steer outcomes in developmentally constructive directions. This assessment evaluates policy instruments across three domains \u2013 economic, social and environmental \u2013 to ensure these technologies help, rather than hinder, progress to the 2030 goals. Negative scenarios \u2013 and impacts on progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals The report first presents the current literature on potential socio-economic downsides of automation and AI, examines current and near-term risks in Asia, and assesses what these mean across the manufacturing and services sectors. It then identifies the impacts these risks would have on progress towards securing the SDGs. While pan-Asian, the report also identifies country-specific risk factors and flashpoints, and differentiates between countries facing threats to existing industries and those whose vulnerability is their potential future loss of entry into sectors they might otherwise have hoped to access. WHAT CONTRIBUTION CAN THESE TOOLS MAKE TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE SDGs, AND IN WHAT WAYS DO THEY THREATEN PROGRESS? HOW, WHEN AND BY WHOM WILL THESE IMPACTS BE FELT? 9 The report finds that at least nine SDGs could be negatively impacted in clear ways, primarily through the direct and indirect consequence of increased unemployment, but also through other channels such as dangers and threats in emergent sectors like the \u201cgig\u201d and \u201con-demand\u201d economies. Throughout, the report pays particular attention to the impact of technological change on gender, particularly in terms of the economic empowerment of women. How these new technologies are developed could make a positive contribution to gender equity, or deepen inequality. Positive scenarios \u2013 and impacts on sustainable development Negative forecasts and predictions are informed by already existing, or conceivable, trends. But such an analysis alone would be one-sided. Human choices, policies, and institutional evolution will also shape the societal outcomes of technological change. Previous periods of rapid technological change led to the rise of new sectors and employment opportunities and contributions to the increased efficiency of public services. Automation and AI can also support the SDGs where stakeholders collaborate to find socially advantageous applications. For instance, drones and satellites are delivering health and humanitarian supplies in rural areas, and data analytics have guided disaster relief efforts. Precision agriculture is increasing agricultural yields and reducing the use of harmful inputs, while AI is helping scientists track and predict the impact of climate change. In short, similar tools can be used in vastly different ways. Algorithms can help predict disease outbreaks, or help disseminate hate speech. Automation can mark student essays so teachers can focus on lesson planning and instruction, or replace customer service operatives. Acknowledging the dual uses of all these innovations, the second dimension of the report articulates the ways in which automation and AI could support progress toward the SDGs and the channels through which those relationships could evolve. DRONES AND SATELLITES ARE DELIVERING HEALTH AND HUMANITARIAN SUPPLIES IN RURAL AREAS, AND DATA ANALYTICS HAVE GUIDED DISASTER RELIEF EFFORTS. 10 Executive summary Development 4.0: Opportunities and Challenges for Accelerating Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific Policy responses This report shows that technology does not have pre- determined outcomes for society. What matters will be the degree to which governments, development actors, labour organisations and other stakeholders, including technology companies themselves, participate in, shape, nurture, and guide the innovation process towards socially and environmentally advantageous ends. Having thus mapped the positive and negative ways in which automation and AI could impact the SDGs, the concluding section of the report identifies interventions which, if pursued successfully, could ensure a positive impact across the three broad domains: economy, society and environment. This includes strengthening social protection policies, and the greater use of AI and automation to optimise public services, promoting the use of technology to solve natural resource and ecological challenges, and maximising the benefits of technology to support new growth sectors like the green and circular economy, digital technology and \u201cnetwork platforms\u201d, like ride-hailing and sharing economy apps, which are showing rapid growth both in Asia and globally.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b1f62b37-3ab7-4de3-8553-43be77072905": {"__data__": {"id_": "b1f62b37-3ab7-4de3-8553-43be77072905", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-40-opportunities-and-challenges-accelerating-progress-towards-sustainable-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Development 4.0: Opportunities and Challenges for Accelerating Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-40-opportunities-and-challenges-accelerating-progress-towards-sustainable-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "61801779d36d66ba5c4f2214135fb41e5d4b07437d11dbcf4e4bcceb9f121c21"}, "2": {"node_id": "1ab6d50f-c498-44c6-9f02-048c17a4e962", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-40-opportunities-and-challenges-accelerating-progress-towards-sustainable-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "142c14e97c108617c31b02e21cc285e11af63f8a779b53355be244bae8c5afe8"}}, "hash": "1110b46ffee22ab48141013681f57de9d7a175d100ad693df9798d44f37ddc26", "text": "This multidimensional perspective, alive to both positive and negative technological pathways and how they could impact achievement of the SDGs, can help the development community and governments to be mindful of the risks and, critically, to proactively embrace", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5a51ad7-4203-4a6f-9e84-3478bc9ec878": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5a51ad7-4203-4a6f-9e84-3478bc9ec878", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-40-opportunities-and-challenges-accelerating-progress-towards-sustainable-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Development 4.0: Opportunities and Challenges for Accelerating Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-40-opportunities-and-challenges-accelerating-progress-towards-sustainable-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6c15d132d017670e7246c5173139088936ab3ccf7f0a90d311bad308f7beeaee"}, "3": {"node_id": "44ac3dbc-e7a2-4ec4-a5a1-0d3e278d37cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-40-opportunities-and-challenges-accelerating-progress-towards-sustainable-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "de679c5a45ecbcdc736d154ac264dd5febdffee097b875abb4f308d50a95880a"}}, "hash": "a94ca6ef1f0bfaf3a5f1fc28d07c9423424ba0041ff433de1ddff2d30a5fea80", "text": "the opportunities, of accelerating technological change.

Situated within the broader \u201cnew digital economy\u201d, covering emergent trends including the Internet of Things (IoT), ubiquitous smartphones, advanced data analytics and cloud computing, we are living in a \u201csecond machine age\u201d set to unleash dramatic changes in human productivity, work and welfare, in a turbulent process of \u201cwrenching change\u201d1. \u201cTechno-anxiety\u201d, however, is on the rise, with a range of commentators, policymakers, think-tanks and economists worrying whether today\u2019s innovations could replace humans in a growing number of physical and cognitive tasks, and if powerful AI could be put to malicious use. While much literature examines such issues in the West and China, where automation, AI and digital innovation is clustered, the implications for developing economies \u2013 and Asia in particular \u2013 are paramount. How worried should the development community be about technological acceleration? What are the risk factors, versus the upsides? This report provides a structured analysis to help governments and development actors ensure that today\u2019s technologies make a constructive contribution to the social, economic and environmental challenges facing the region. Examined through the prism of the SDGs, it identifies Asia\u2019s risks, the possible negative impacts of new innovations, and the ways in which the policy community can respond to manage the downsides, and leverage the many benefits that new technologies can bring to support the ambitions of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 12 Introduction Development 4.0: Opportunities and Challenges for Accelerating Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific Internet of Things IoT refers to the fusion of Internet connectivity with everyday objects, enabling bidirectional data flows and \u201csmart\u201d products. Its subfield, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), refers to machine-to-machine communication in industrial production, which includes \u201cdigital twins\u201d that design units, and test and simulate production, helping to bring products to market faster, with more iterations and experimentation.2 Big Data Big data refers to the generation and computation of very large datasets, both structured and unstructured. While there is no simple marker of \u201cbig\u201d as opposed to conventional data, a popular definition refers to \u201cthree Vs\u201d \u2013 volume, velocity and variety \u2013 while other commentators have added \u201cvariability\u201d and \u201ccomplexity\u201d. Robotics and Automation While robots have a long precedent in electronics and manufacturing, their roles are now expanding due to greater 3D situational awareness, flexibility and movement range, which enables them to carry out more diverse tasks such as stacking goods, and providing care services for the elderly. Artificial Intelligence Computer-based applications that carry out functions typically associated with humans, such as visual perception, decision-making, and speech recognition. AI\u2019s most recent advances include machine learning (ML), in which algorithm- driven tools can self- correct and learn over time. Robotic process automation (RPA) is the application of robotics to the processes of an increasing range of white collar jobs. In the words of AI visionary Andrew Ng, \u201cif a task takes less that a second of thought, a machine can probably do it.\u201d3 AI Definitions 13 Technology has historically brought disruptive change and created new employment that has often been safer and more productive.

AI, additive (3D) printing and robotic software automation.6 These \u201cfour waves\u201d impose a somewhat simplified linear order to what has in reality been a hesitant and uneven process, with some innovations existing for decades before widescale deployment, and long lags between new technologies and corresponding increases in productivity growth or, more importantly, human well-being. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is the most contestable of all as it has yet to deliver development gains on a par with previous periods.7 8 What could distinguish today\u2019s era as a meaningful break from the past is the growing ability of machines \u2013 physical and informational \u2013 to self-learn and self-correct through \u201cmachine learning\u201d. ML, which in some cases mimics the human brain through \u201cneural networks\u201d, vastly expands the types of activities that can be automated to include legal research, health diagnostics, policing decisions and customer services. Technology has always brought disruptive change, and often eliminated livelihoods, but it has also created new employment that has often been safer and more productive compared with the so-called \u201cdirty, dangerous and demanding\u201d jobs it replaced in areas like manufacturing. But today, the prospect of self-learning and \u201cthinking\u201d machines is sparking fears that this innovation revolution may look very different to what came before.9 10 11 THE PROSPECT OF SELF-LEARNING AND \u201cTHINKING\u201d MACHINES IS SPARKING FEARS THAT THIS INNOVATION REVOLUTION MAY LOOK VERY DIFFERENT TO WHAT CAME BEFORE 16 Automation and the future of work: Contested narratives Development 4.0: Opportunities and Challenges for Accelerating Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific To date, the literature on automation and AI focuses mostly on its potential impact on employment, but there are broader concerns such as the prospect of \u201cpremature deindustrialisation\u201d in developing economies, the loss of a common economic growth model (in the form of labour-intensive, export- focused manufacturing), and even the abuse of new powerful technologies like AI, be it through spying and surveillance or the use of algorithm-driven social media platforms to spread misinformation and foment tension. Fears about the power of new technology have even been voiced by the entrepreneurs at the heart of it, including Tesla founder Elon Musk and Facebook founders Mark Zuckerberg and Chris Hughes.12 The current discourse and literature falls into three areas: employment, premature deindustrialisation and public services. THERE ARE BROADER CONCERNS SUCH AS THE PROSPECT OF \u201cPREMATURE DEINDUSTRIALISATION\u201d IN DEVELOPING ECONOMIES, THE LOSS OF A COMMON ECONOMIC GROWTH MODEL (IN THE FORM OF LABOUR-INTENSIVE, EXPORT-FOCUSED MANUFACTURING), AND EVEN THE ABUSE OF NEW POWERFUL TECHNOLOGIES LIKE AI BY NEFARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS 17 1. Employment Researchers have identified a large range of tasks \u2013 and jobs \u2013 vulnerable to automation from current or future technologies.

Rodrik believes this to have broader political implications for democracy itself because the labour movement has been a critical social actor, able to negotiate with elites the compromises and bargains (including social insurance and worker protections) that enabled the morphing of the working class into a middle class. Their critiques gain weight in the context of deepening automation. As the workforce fragments into gig workers, small enterprises and \u201cpetty services\u201d, workers lose cohesion as well as the ability to organise and pursue their interests at a societal level. 3. Public services AI and automation have significant public sector implications, from reducing government bureaucracy to optimising service design and delivery, which will be explored in the social domain section of this report. But there are also risks, including the embedding of racial, ethnic and gender biases in algorithm- based public services decisions such as those of policing and justice. Research shows that biased policing is aggravated due to data feedback loops which predict more crime in certain neighbourhoods, typically populated by a larger number of racial minorities.22 Artificial Intelligence and ML can \u201cbake in\u201d prevalent biases from the past into the future, whether it be image databases associating women with performing domestic chores and men with watching sports, or racial biases which increase police patrolling in ethnic minority areas.23 Gender, race and other stereotypes can also be encoded into algorithms by associating certain professions with particular genders: receptionists and nannies as female, with architects and philosophers as male.24 The attainment of SDG 5 \u2013 gender equality and empowerment of all women and girls \u2013 will be undermined if AI tools are developed without oversight of such flaws. A second AI risk in the public services domain relates to privacy protection. A UK National Health Service (NHS)-based app developed by DeepMind, the AI firm acquired by Google, reportedly breached patient privacy rules,25 and concerns have emerged over whether the use of predictive analytics and big data in monitoring health could breach privacy and lead to, for instance, unfair insurance policy practices.26 In China, groups have expressed concern about the rise of facial recognition and AI-embedded street cameras.27 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND ML CAN \u201cBAKE IN\u201d PREVALENT BIASES FROM THE PAST INTO THE FUTURE, WHETHER IT BE IMAGE DATABASES ASSOCIATING WOMEN WITH DOMESTIC CHORES AND MEN WITH SPORTS, OR RACIAL BIASES WHICH INCREASE POLICE PATROLLING IN ETHNIC MINORITY AREAS 19 Technology is hard to forecast, and dystopian predictions have accompanied the rise of each new technological and economic era. Yet, the data shows that, over three turbulent centuries, human welfare \u2212 whether measured in terms of income, life expectancy or health \u2212 has improved. Impacts of automation and AI in Asia East Asia\u2019s development \u201cmiracle\u201d, from Japan to the \u201cEast Asian tigers\u201d (Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan) and China, through to the likes of Malaysia, Vietnam, Bangladesh and Thailand today, was built on manufacturing sectors now at risk of automation. In the services sector, Asian economies with successful BPO sectors could see comparative advantages, like widespread English language skills and lower labour costs, dissipate in the face of automation. AI and the new digital economy could bring both threats and opportunities to the attainment of a selection of SDGs. Progress towards at least nine SDGs could be undermined in the most negative automation and AI scenarios. 21 21 To date, most discussions about the impact of automation and AI on society have, with the exception of China (a leader in both sectors), focused mostly on advanced economies.

The share of manufacturing value added (MVA) as a percentage of GDP is highest in East Asia and increasingly Southeast Asia, where parts of the supply chain have migrated. The most recent MVA data highlights Thailand (27%), Myanmar (22%), Malaysia (22%), Indonesia (21.2%) and the Philippines (19.6%) as higher risk, with Cambodia (17%) and Vietnam (15.8%) following. Over 60% of salaried workers in Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam occupy positions at high risk of automation.28 South Asia\u2019s MVA is at 16% of its GDP, with Bangladesh at 17.9% and India at 16%. The least exposed country in the region is Laos at 8%.29 The share of MVA alone does not determine automation risk: the technical nature of production is a crucial consideration. Vietnam, for instance, is a higher-risk economy because it has a heavy exposure in electronics. This is an automation-sensitive sector because robots excel at structured, hard materials of pre-determined sizes.30 Electronics are also automation- sensitive because of higher commercial margins, and intense global competitive pressure which forces firms to keep up with Western rivals; Asian manufacturers Samsung, Foxconn and Huawei are all progressing automation plans. Automation is thus already relatively advanced in export-led electronics manufacturing, and automation risk increases as countries move to more advanced production sectors.

However, garments are at lower automation risk for technical reasons: soft materials are harder for robots to handle. One market leader, SoftWear Automation, has introduced a sewing robot that can reportedly replace ten workers and produce 1,142 t-shirts in eight hours, compared with 669 from a human sewing line,31 but thus far there is limited evidence of large-scale textiles automation and data suggests that garments are not a dominant area of robotics production. Of the 1.6m industrial robots in 2015, the latest year of available data, only 1,580 were in textiles.32 A leap forward to robotic instruments could change this. Harvard researchers recently successfully developed \u201csoft robots\u201d that can sense touch, pressure, movement and temperature, and improved tactile sensitivity will doubtless be quickened by research into \u201ccare- bots\u201d which can play a more active role in healthcare.33 Shoes and trainers, a subfield of the clothing sector, is showing more immediate evidence of automation. Global giant Nike is working with Flex, the manufacturer behind Fitbit, to automate shoe-making; its Asia production sites in Vietnam, Indonesia and China could all be affected. Nike\u2019s rival Adidas has also reshored to Germany and the US, using computerised knitting, robotic cutting and additive manufacturing. Reshoring in sectors like footwear and fashion is, for Western firms, not just about lowering labour cost but also other benefits in terms of speed to market, and greater product development flexibility, including product customisation, which may be a growing trend at the high end of the Western consumer market and could be enabled by additive manufacturing. ONE MARKET LEADER, SOFTWEAR AUTOMATION, HAS INTRODUCED A SEWING ROBOT THAT CAN REPORTEDLY REPLACE TEN WORKERS AND PRODUCE 1,142 T-SHIRTS IN EIGHT HOURS, COMPARED WITH 669 FROM A HUMAN SEWING LINE 25 Automation and reshoring matter, since trainers and sports shoes alone are an US$80bn/year global industry.34 If firms in high-income countries advance their automation agenda faster than those in low- and middle-income countries in Asia, Asian exporters face the risk of losing market share. Countries with large domestic populations that include a significant \u201cconsumer class\u201d (such as Indonesia and India) may offset this through growth in domestic demand, but this would be a challenging pathway, with no guarantee of success. Beyond countries\u2019 industrial structure, other factors play an important role.

The 2030 Agenda moves even further, emphasising the need for approaches that take account of the integrated nature of the dimensions of sustainable development \u2212 economic, social and environment \u2212 where decisions in one domain affect outcomes across the others. As such, this report takes the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs as the central organising framework. The graphic on the following page outlines the dual ways in which automation, AI and the new digital economy could bring both threats and opportunities to the attainment of a selection of SDGs. The follow-on text explains in more detail the threat effects, while the following section elucidates the opportunities. If they materially reduce employment within services and industries, automation and AI could have negative effects on progress towards the SDGs. The relegation of medium-skilled, waged workers into unemployment and/or informal employment would push a large cohort of Asia\u2019s population back into poverty, while the lowest-skilled workers \u2013 and the poorest countries, yet to enter the manufacturing and services value chain \u2013 would lose access to a development model that had hitherto substantially driven poverty reduction in Asia. SDGs that depend on pro-poor fiscal interventions, such as investing in clean water and sanitation, would also be undermined by a reduction in government tax revenues, should foreign investors reshore from their Asian bases.

measures by some multinational firms, through which profits in higher-tax jurisdictions are drained through internal financial engineering and channelled to low-tax jurisdictions. International transparency efforts, and the work of non- governmental organisations (NGOs) like tax justice groups, have helped expose tax-avoidance practices by multinationals, but the problem remains significant. Furthermore, falling taxes due to the re-orchestration of manufacturing supply chains undermines the policy progress made. Overall, and as shown in the graphic on the previous pages, this analysis finds that progress towards at least nine SDGs could be undermined in the most negative automation and AI scenarios. 41 Most effects stem from the loss of employment in automation- vulnerable sectors like electronics, automotives, BPO and, to a lesser extent, garments, pushing once upwardly mobile workers back into poverty. Loss of predictable waged employment in turn impacts household budget decisions and would cause some families to under-invest in their children\u2019s education. This channel \u2013 waged employment converting into higher investment in children\u2019s education \u2013 was crucial to East Asia achieving its generational transformation. Automation-driven unemployment could have a gender dimension since women dominate employment in vulnerable sectors like BPO and garments. Women have made significant economic advancements through BPO in the Philippines, delivering services like back- office support, software development and data transcription. Women account for 59% of the more than 1m people employed in the Philippines\u2019 BPO sector, and 89% of salaried call centre staff.42 Men and women will respond differently to the new opportunities that attend technological development. Rising economic returns to STEM skills in higher- technology contexts could benefit males who are generally over-represented in these sectors. One UNESCO report found that only three Asian countries out of 18 had an equal or above proportion of female STEM researchers.43 Even new jobs created by digital technology, like logistics, deliveries and ride-hailing, could benefit male employment, given concerns around women\u2019s safety in such contexts, or their constrained ability, for cultural reasons, to work independently.44 AUTOMATION-DRIVEN UNEMPLOYMENT COULD HAVE A GENDER DIMENSION SINCE WOMEN DOMINATE EMPLOYMENT IN VULNERABLE SECTORS LIKE BPO AND GARMENTS. 32 Impacts of automation and AI in Asia Development 4.0: Opportunities and Challenges for Accelerating Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific Not all automation and technology will hit women harder than men \u2013 some manufacturing assembly sectors are male- dominated, while women are more advantaged by the rise of new economic opportunities such as hosting. Airbnb data shows that, globally, women have earned US$10bn through the platform and are often using income for vital spending such as rent, and as a source of capital to invest in their own ventures.45 Sectors like education, social work, healthcare, and the care economy more generally, have a strong female presence, a lower risk of job automation, and provide jobs at multiple levels which can help address labour market challenges.46 47 Tourism, which is currently relatively immune to automation, also provides better opportunities for women\u2019s participation in the workforce, women\u2019s entrepreneurship, and women\u2019s leadership than other sectors of the economy; global evidence shows that women are also more likely to hold managerial positions in tourism.48 In Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand, more than half of tourism businesses are run by women.49 Some e-commerce and gig economy activities can also have positive gender impacts by offering more flexible working arrangements for women than conventional full-time employment often does. Digital entrepreneurship could have pro-female effects because start-up costs are low thanks to low-cost software and widening Internet access, which could tackle a structural factor limiting women\u2019s entrepreneurship: their more limited ability to access capital. SDG progress could also be undermined by risks that attend new job sources enabled by digital innovation. Good health and well-being (SDG 3) could be compromised as workers move into the gig economy, where conditions are often unregulated and can be dangerous, without union or trade association protection.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "85510115-35aa-4421-a37a-2acc70df00b7": {"__data__": {"id_": "85510115-35aa-4421-a37a-2acc70df00b7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-40-opportunities-and-challenges-accelerating-progress-towards-sustainable-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Development 4.0: Opportunities and Challenges for Accelerating Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-40-opportunities-and-challenges-accelerating-progress-towards-sustainable-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4f7f98167b128ba59bd2564084141c448074bb3afec17292068a46fb2785b022"}, "2": {"node_id": "cfebba86-0a6c-41d3-92a8-2237a3b8f50d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-40-opportunities-and-challenges-accelerating-progress-towards-sustainable-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1606877bf5a443bae9482423f7b623c0f2b1bb84e4b98584102820b85ef73895"}}, "hash": "365fc4911011797b2a3918c3a57f237c89754c3d88a70f0558ff5fc8e68c923e", "text": "Stress, over-work, and isolation have all affected gig workers around the world and workers\u2019 rights groups claim that so- called gig economy platforms put pressure on workers to meet minimum hours, even though the platform itself offers no work guarantees or protections.50 While union participation has often been absent in Asian manufacturing, the ability to unionise or form labour interest groups, even with NGOs and human rights groups, is challenged by the fragmentation and atomisation of the workforce in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01122878-efa2-41b9-b0fc-8d65f4bc29b6": {"__data__": {"id_": "01122878-efa2-41b9-b0fc-8d65f4bc29b6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-40-opportunities-and-challenges-accelerating-progress-towards-sustainable-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Development 4.0: Opportunities and Challenges for Accelerating Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-40-opportunities-and-challenges-accelerating-progress-towards-sustainable-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9b8f02deeb5e3e027c76a32d5c272db25d0b47ad1f632e0dfcd8f5e73587a262"}, "3": {"node_id": "eb7018fe-ea21-4212-9744-48cd1627579d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-40-opportunities-and-challenges-accelerating-progress-towards-sustainable-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a22404aa6ccc3d746a400f7ceba0e9c2176ed70a6f64e1c0221201db6f03f28c"}}, "hash": "edc64a1be230234cfc2e32d44a1320f5a6bc2d8238b1a3df0cdec007ab4f14ae", "text": "the low-end gig economy.

Of course, working conditions in manufacturing industries have not been without their health impacts \u2013 witness the collapse of Bangladesh\u2019s Rana Plaza,51 and the suicides in Foxconn electronics factories. The point is that new sectors may bring threats of their own. Beyond employment dynamics, there are other threats posed by AI and associated digital sectors, including big data and predictive analytics, that could undermine progress towards the SDGs, and especially SDG 16: peace, justice and strong institutions. Social media bots and algorithm-based platforms have contributed to social divisions through enabling and disseminating hate speech and misinformation. This is now well- documented in the US context, but Asia is also feeling its effects. Online hate speech has been prominent during the Rohingya crisis, both in Myanmar and abroad, with social media platforms enabling the spread of misinformation and the propagation of racial and ethnic hatred.52 In India, the rapid spread of information via platforms like WhatsApp has given rise to violence, evidenced by the recent murders by gang members of seven men wrongly believed to have been involved in child abductions.53 Even if misinformation is not the product of bots, it relies on social media platforms to be spread, through their algorithm-based dissemination mechanisms. A second impact of AI on the SDGs relates to inequality: both gender inequality (SDG 5) and overall inequality (SDG 10). There is evidence of bias in algorithm-based decisions in justice and policing, which can result in overt police presences in areas populated by minority groups, for instance.54 Finally, SDG 16, and especially its \u201cstrong institutions\u201d component, could be undermined by the use of AI and big data by authoritarian governments which can use powerful surveillance tools to monitor, spy on and track populations. Governments can also engage in state-on-state cyberattacks. Related concerns include the development of lethal autonomous weapons without proper UN-driven ethical oversight, the unethical use of drones for military purposes or by rogue actors like terrorists, the use of cryptocurrencies to facilitate illegal commerce and criminal gang activity, and social and environmental conflict between companies and communities in areas harbouring raw materials needed for today\u2019s technologies, including lithium and rare-earth metals.55 FINALLY, SDG 16, AND ESPECIALLY ITS \u201cSTRONG INSTITUTIONS\u201d COMPONENT, COULD BE UNDERMINED BY THE USE OF AI AND BIG DATA BY AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNMENTS WHICH CAN USE POWERFUL SURVEILLANCE TOOLS TO MONITOR, SPY ON AND TRACK POPULATIONS. 34 Impacts of automation and AI in Asia Development 4.0: Opportunities and Challenges for Accelerating Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific Mitigating factors These SDG impacts are not forecasts, but rather possible future pathways which, without proactive approaches, could undermine progress towards the SDGs.56 But this alone is not a holistic way of thinking about technological change. The evidence clearly shows that AI and automation are multiple- use technologies that could have benefits, not just for those who design them. Welfare payments and public services can be more efficient in the digital era, with rote bureaucracy carried out by AI, allowing civil servants to focus on other, more complex policy areas, as well as allowing some countries facing fiscal constraints to limit the size of the public sector without reducing services.

While the risk framework examined aggregates risk in manufacturing and services, automation risk varies across sub-sectors rather than overall GDP categories. Electronics and automotives are more automation-sensitive because they involve linear workflows and structured, defined physical materials, and because their product markets are globally competitive and dominated by the world\u2019s most sophisticated technology companies. Garments are harder to automate completely because robots are still less competent at managing unpredictable, creasing and soft materials \u2013 an important part of the garments workflow.57 Of course, further innovation could increase risk if these obstacles are overcome, but technical nuances matter.

GDP, employment distribution and trade structure all shape the real impact of automation. Philippines BPO is \u201chigh-risk\u201d, but employs around 2\u20133% of the labour force.58 59 India has 45m textiles workers, but the informal sector dominates output and informal firms typically have less incentive and means to automate in ways directly threatening to employment. While these dynamics should not justify ignoring automation threats, they provide context for assessing overall impact. Other structural factors include export versus domestic demand. Small economies heavily exposed to high-tech markets will be more at risk than those with a large domestic market, if automation technology is not likely to be adopted by firms within a lower-income country context. Risk levels also depend on the distribution of the workforce across automation-sensitive and non-sensitive sectors; retail jobs are less automation- vulnerable given the often unpredictable, customer-facing nature of interactions, and retail employs over 40m people in ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries alone, compared with 800,000 in automotives and 2.5m in electronics.60 Similarly, tourism does not appear automation- vulnerable and is a major employer with strong growth trends across the continent, which has abundant cultural, ecological and geographical assets that attract millions of travellers around the world. Political economy factors. It should not be assumed that just because firms can automate, they will retrench as much as possible. There is evidence of firms reallocating workers. India\u2019s Infosys moved 9,000 workers from lower-skilled jobs to more advanced projects, like ML and AI, and Wipro redeployed 3,200 people in 2016, and predicted to move another 4,500 in 2017. Political considerations and pressure to maintain employment levels will play an important role and firms \u2212 either from the country, or with a desire to remain present in the country \u2212 can be expected to respond in some circumstances to political and societal pressures. SMALL ECONOMIES HEAVILY EXPOSED TO HIGH-TECH MARKETS WILL BE MORE AT RISK THAN THOSE WITH A LARGE DOMESTIC MARKET INDIA\u2019S INFOSYS MOVED 9,000 WORKERS FROM LOWER-SKILLED JOBS TO MORE ADVANCED PROJECTS, LIKE ML AND AI, AND WIPRO REDEPLOYED 3,200 PEOPLE IN 2016, AND PREDICTED TO MOVE ANOTHER 4,500 IN 2017. 37 Social overhead capital, and \u201csystem effects\u201d.

Other examples include efficiency gains in critical services that tackle bottlenecks that keep poorer entrepreneurs from accessing capital: the use of non- traditional data, such as social media networks and activities, is being explored to widen access to finance and credit. Similarly, the application of blockchain to property registries could give millions of people access to titles on which they could secure financing, both for business activities and for household loans and credit. Bringing more people into the innovation ecosystem in this way can have far-reaching and unpredictable effects. The creation of more open, meritocratic economies could generate a rise in self-employment and firm formation, lessening the central employment functions of government and large firms.

However, the country still needs to embark on sustained structural transformation, which entails lifting productivity and avoiding the middle-income trap by shifting its growth model. The tools of Industry 4.0 could provide support but equally, through automation, erode existing sectors before they have advanced to higher-value addition plateaus. The country\u2019s service, industry (which includes construction) and agriculture sectors account for 44%, 39% and 17% of GDP, respectively, and the largest sectors of the country include manufacturing, mining, construction, real estate and finance.63 By comparison, the agriculture sector employs the largest share of workers at nearly 50%, and is characterised by small-scale production, inadequate infrastructure, low productivity and a low mechanisation ratio. Services and industry employ the remaining 31% and 21% of workers, respectively.64 The informal sector remains sizeable, and researchers estimate that it could account for 25\u201330% of GDP and nearly 60% of the workforce, or approximately 18m people.65 The Asian Development Bank has estimated that approximately 1m agricultural workers need to upgrade their skills each year as they transition into industry and services.66 THE ILO HAS ESTIMATED THAT 70% OF JOBS IN VIETNAM HAVE A HIGH PROBABILITY OF BEING REPLACED BY MACHINERY. 39 VIETNAM IS ONE OF THE ASIAN ECONOMIES THAT NEEDS TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO AUTOMATION THREATS GIVEN THE STRUCTURE OF ITS CURRENT INDUSTRIES AND SERVICES.

This compares with an average of 56% of jobs at risk in the region, although some of these jobs, such as in agriculture, are also affected by structural challenges beyond mechanisation. Occupations with the highest risk of disappearing in the future include shop sales assistants (2.1m), garden labourers (1m) and sewing-machine operators in garment manufacturing (770,000).67 Separately, the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs has determined that Vietnam needs to create about 650,000 jobs per year to keep pace with growth in the labour force and the expected structural changes in the market.68 Education is one of the fundamental pillars of Vietnam\u2019s socio- economic planning.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "abfa4d6d-575c-4206-9aea-690f03ead4b1": {"__data__": {"id_": "abfa4d6d-575c-4206-9aea-690f03ead4b1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-40-opportunities-and-challenges-accelerating-progress-towards-sustainable-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Development 4.0: Opportunities and Challenges for Accelerating Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-40-opportunities-and-challenges-accelerating-progress-towards-sustainable-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6bac4f24b5a8b1d0399569909fad30eeb9986e7a571107f5ed70af4f524c1b01"}, "2": {"node_id": "df94c1bd-dfeb-4ddc-9fc7-f7a54ae352cd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-40-opportunities-and-challenges-accelerating-progress-towards-sustainable-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cedd89d047bd13040ec7a52e5025cb9bbb6c085d329229b59c64643492fc33bd"}}, "hash": "80ffb0e54b260610db551ec09fa1a5692c0cae4caf9c6acb9aa05a2ef6a8a722", "text": "Reforms include the establishment of new accreditation and quality-assurance mechanisms, a new national qualifications framework, and an increase in higher education enrolments by 125%, from 200 students per 10,000 people in 2010 to 450 students per 10,000 by 2020.69 The national curriculum reform reinforces the development of 21st-century skills, such as intellectual curiosity, civic capacity, foreign languages and information and communications technology (ICT) skills.70 The government is committed to modernising education and currently spends around 15% of total expenditures on education.71 Promoting ICT and high-tech industries is another government priority.

Vietnam is also developing regional high-tech clusters that receive support from both the central and local governments, as well as from other relevant state agencies. Three high-tech parks located in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and Danang continue to attract international investors. For example, Samsung has invested cumulatively approximately US$17bn in the country and the local subsidiary was the largest company in Vietnam in 2017, superseding PetroVietnam, the state oil company.73 41 Case study Impact of Automation and AI on Vietnam Impact of automation on individuals: An SDG lens Despite Vietnam\u2019s positive economic trajectory, attainment of the SDGs is far from assured. With approximately 70% of the population at income levels close to the poverty line, the country needs to create decent work even as the economy stands today, let alone if substantial job losses are incurred due to automation. Given the size of automation-vulnerable sectors in the country, SDG 1 (no poverty) is jeopardised, which by extension threatens many other SDGs. Gender (SDG 5) is one important SDG in the Vietnamese case. Labour force participation rates for women are among the highest in the world at around 72%. However, there is a 10 percentage point gap in labour force participation between women and men, although this has improved from previous years. Women form a large majority of the working poor, earning 10.5% less than men in the paid employment sector according to the most recent labour force survey data, and are most affected by underemployment, unemployment and precarious working conditions.74 It is not yet clear what impact the Fourth Industrial Revolution will have on the most vulnerable workers, but policymakers must continue to monitor them and provide adequate support when necessary. Gender inequality can also be tackled by addressing unequal participation in scientific and technological careers. Women account for around 40% of scientific researchers, but only 19% of key national science and technology programmes have female leaders or a high percentage of women researchers. Government initiatives that encourage women in science may help to tip the scales towards greater gender equality in technical fields. A further important SDG for Vietnam is the promotion of innovation, industry and infrastructure (SDG 9), as this is the means by which the country can avoid a middle-income trap and find new growth engines as wages rise. In 2016, the government launched a scheme to provide national support and funding for innovation and entrepreneurship through to 2025. The programme aims to develop over 2,000 innovation projects and start-ups that will have a total value of investment capital of around VND 2trn (approximately US$89.3m). Financing will also be available from private partners.75 A strategic industrial policy, which provides the underlying infrastructures needed to foster innovation, would be one proactive move that could help Vietnam not just withstand the threats of technological change, but be an active participant in them. WITH APPROXIMATELY 70% OF THE POPULATION AT INCOME LEVELS CLOSE TO THE POVERTY LINE, THE COUNTRY NEEDS TO CREATE DECENT WORK EVEN AS THE ECONOMY STANDS TODAY 42 Policy considerations Vietnam is one of the Asian economies that needs to pay close attention to automation threats given the structure of its current industries and services. This will require both macro and micro policies, including those which improve supply- side competitiveness, and which link competitiveness and productivity to the country\u2019s overall national development strategy. Generally, the information base for innovative government policies is low and the system tends to produce multiple, overlapping and sometimes competing initiatives. A 2016 report by the World Bank and the Ministry of Planning and Investment found that government research and development (R&D) funding is spread thinly across more than 600 small government research institutes that produce little valuable output.

Case study Impact of Automation and AI on Vietnam 43 How can automation, AI and the new digital economy accelerate progress towards the SDGs and what can governments do to maximise the upsides, and manage the risks? Responding to the opportunities and challenges of automation and AI Economic policy, and growth policy in particular, must work with the technological, geopolitical and policy tools available at the time, rather than try to copy outdated models. Data privacy protocols, fines for companies with inadequate data protection protocols, and even bans on companies failing to show good faith and proper engagement with operational risks are examples of how harder regulatory enforcement in the digital sphere is playing out. Unlike manufacturing, in which Asian firms took decades to catch up with the West and compete, in the digital economy the timelines are compressed, with home- grown firms quickly dominating their own markets. 45 45 Technologies do not always have pre-determined outcomes for societies. Policy choices, social dialogue and public opinion all shape the ends to which technology is deployed. In the 19th and 20th centuries, advances in transport, electricity and power led to unprecedented improvements in standards of living in Western countries, across a broad spectrum of their populations. Today, nations with high innovation rates and deep technological adoption include many peaceful, egalitarian and flourishing societies like South Korea, Japan, Finland, Switzerland, Sweden and the Netherlands,77 while the world\u2019s lowest-scoring nations in the Human Development Index and Gini inequality rankings, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic, Brazil and South Africa, suffer far more from poor governance, conflict and corruption than from a surfeit of technology. In the US, the world technology leader, inequality has many social and political causes including the costs of higher education, weak social safety nets in healthcare, and structural inequalities, including the mass incarceration of minority groups. Observers also argue that policies that favour elites are more deserving of scrutiny as a cause of inequality than automation.78 79 80 As such, any analysis seeking to make sense of technological change must recognise both the opportunities that innovation brings and the ways that key stakeholders, especially public institutions, shape its outcomes. Against such a backdrop, this section examines how automation, AI and the new digital economy could accelerate progress towards the SDGs and what governments can do to maximise the upsides, and manage the risks, across the three domains of sustainable development: economic, social and environmental. From such a perspective, technological innovation can contribute to the ends that matter \u2212 to people, prosperity, the planet, peace and partnerships. 46 Responding to the opportunities and challenges of automation and AI Development 4.0: Opportunities and Challenges for Accelerating Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific Economic Economic policy, and growth policy in particular, must work with the technological, geopolitical and policy tools available at the time, rather than try to copy outdated models. The Asian manufacturing boom delivered profound benefits but was the product of an era, many of whose conditions, political and economic, no longer hold. Wage differentials with the West were far higher in the 1970s than in the early 2000s. Geopolitical dynamics, such as US aid to South Korea during the Cold War, provided massive financial assistance for public investment. Today, in contrast, reshoring is a policy priority in advanced economies as blue-collar workers have seen their standards of living decline in relative terms as Asia\u2019s have grown. Automation is therefore one among many forces threatening the labour-intensive manufacturing model. Changing circumstances call for new growth strategies which can withstand emergent threats, and take the opportunity to recognise limits of older models, such as environmental harm, and leverage the new opportunities that exist today and which did not previously. These growth strategies can indeed improve on the many flaws of the prior era. Factory work conditions have been gruesome, and workers have enjoyed few labour protections and paid a heavy price for Asia\u2019s development boom in previous decades.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9630f302-803b-49e1-8024-af77ffe3072a": {"__data__": {"id_": "9630f302-803b-49e1-8024-af77ffe3072a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-40-opportunities-and-challenges-accelerating-progress-towards-sustainable-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Development 4.0: Opportunities and Challenges for Accelerating Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-40-opportunities-and-challenges-accelerating-progress-towards-sustainable-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2895844a210871e5944d2b4ba58a59064c8787f2c42100381ddf2b1aaecdbac9"}, "2": {"node_id": "c66e545a-aebb-44c1-8461-93c723cb0b2c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-40-opportunities-and-challenges-accelerating-progress-towards-sustainable-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a265afc5688b5ef5688118089c863a32d8ef7985adae8b5dba863ea0e0c5600d"}}, "hash": "02cd65bbe06ba2653de0e9101c7c08cee1e21f2cabc504e200638545d0cdda6d", "text": "Recent events, from collapsed garment factories in Bangladesh to the spate of suicides and suicide attempts at the Foxconn factories,81 bring into question whether such elements can be described as consonant", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "07910c8f-a1da-4f4e-82a2-f73058e93743": {"__data__": {"id_": "07910c8f-a1da-4f4e-82a2-f73058e93743", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-40-opportunities-and-challenges-accelerating-progress-towards-sustainable-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Development 4.0: Opportunities and Challenges for Accelerating Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-40-opportunities-and-challenges-accelerating-progress-towards-sustainable-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ec35661fd18121b0686ff7c34c57f91c1180e34bab042e252f61cb509f0233d1"}, "3": {"node_id": "9076b268-724e-45b2-ac1e-632eae5d4a33", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-40-opportunities-and-challenges-accelerating-progress-towards-sustainable-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "76f634683062a922cc9c8dc9e907bf0e47c0b3e41ba2e7228b8e3bf53e25d683"}}, "hash": "110a0550f2c1ecc45f210c64fa0914efa72768d6de4bec9fdd51bc51e84f9668", "text": "with the values of the 2030 Agenda. Asian policymakers are increasingly looking at emergent growth sectors, mostly building out the digital economy using the same underlying innovations this report has. Digital platforms \u2212 spanning \u201csearch\u201d, \u201csocial\u201d and \u201ce-commerce\u201d \u2212 are especially powerful innovations that are already growing quickly in many Asian economies. 47 A digital platform is a business based on enabling value-creating interactions between external producers and consumers, providing an \u201copen participative infrastructure for these interactions and setting governance conditions for them.\u201d82 Economists believe digital platforms are writing a new chapter in commerce.83 Unlike industries of old, which leveraged supply economies of scale to achieve low-cost production, digital platforms leverage \u201cdemand economies\u201d of scale through which every participant joining the network \u2212 whether drivers and passengers in ride-hailing, or sellers and buyers in e-commerce \u2212 makes the platform more valuable for all participants84 and the data that platforms acquire through that activity is in turn commercially valuable. Unlike manufacturing, in which Asian firms took decades to catch up with the West and compete, in digital economy the timelines are compressed, with home-grown firms quickly dominating their own markets. Asia\u2019s e-commerce transactions accounted for 25% of the business-to-consumer market globally in 2016,85 led by China and India. Digital commerce is a smaller segment in ASEAN countries but still generated US$150bn in revenues in 2016, while Southeast Asia as a group is forecast to become one of the world\u2019s top-five digital economies by 2025, with the Internet user base forecast to pass 480m by 2020.86 Top firms include Alibaba, Tencent (China) and Flipkart (India) in e-commerce, and Didi Chuxing (China), Ola (India) and Grab (Southeast Asia) in transport. ASIA\u2019S E-COMMERCE TRANSACTIONS ACCOUNTED FOR 25% OF THE BUSINESS- TO-CONSUMER MARKET GLOBALLY IN 2016 48 Responding to the opportunities and challenges of automation and AI Development 4.0: Opportunities and Challenges for Accelerating Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific If policymakers are looking for a new growth paradigm, the digital economy, including platforms but going beyond them, shows promise. In nurturing these sectors and providing the appropriate regulatory frameworks, policymakers can support the \u201cknowledge-intensity\u201d of economies, which has been a core ingredient of endogenous growth theory. Endogenous growth theory argues that the development of new ideas and the number of people working in the knowledge sectors make economies more productive in ways that physical capital investment on its own cannot. This model, developed over the course of the 1990s, influenced the emergence of human capital as a core development domain, in contrast to previous decades, which emphasised a narrower package of reforms involving economic liberalisation. This provides the economic logic supporting greater focus on areas like education, healthcare and other metrics of human wellness, rather than cruder, market-wide economic liberalisation reforms. Data regulation will be critical A knowledge-driven economy requires digital infrastructure to allow firms to transact efficiently, and appropriate restraints to deal with challenges, such as data privacy or online fraud. However, digital is not always at the heart of national and regional growth initiatives. For example, a stocktaking analysis of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) blueprint of 2015 found that more progress was needed in areas like encouraging the flow of digital data in the region, a critical enabler of knowledge- based economic development. The analysis also observed that only 30% of ASEAN countries had enacted privacy legislation in the e-commerce domain, and only 60% had consumer protection regulations, which are crucial to build trust in online commerce.87 IF POLICYMAKERS ARE LOOKING FOR A NEW GROWTH PARADIGM, THE DIGITAL ECONOMY, INCLUDING PLATFORMS BUT GOING BEYOND THEM, SHOWS PROMISE. 49 Investment in connectivity and innovation will be needed Investment is needed to ensure ubiquitous, high-speed Internet access, especially 4G and 5G networks.

These include removing business obstacles like high licensing costs, aggressive bankruptcy rules, or burdensome tax systems, and roll out incentives to encourage catalytic underlying sectors, like e-commerce and e-payments, as part of the creation of more dynamic, small and medium-sized enterprise (SME)-friendly growth pathways.90 Any discussion of digital growth models would be incomplete without observing the risks these sectors can bring, as has been apparent in the many regulatory problems \u2212 such as anti-trust and privacy breaches \u2212 facing the likes of Google in the EU and Facebook after the post-Cambridge Analytica era. Hate speech, social polarisation and debates over misinformation have all been prominent across a number of Asian countries. Regulators are also eyeing monopoly formations.91 For instance, the aggressive expansion of some gig economy platforms has left workers vulnerable by changing ride-hailing pricing after drivers invest significant sums in vehicles.92 To counteract such ANY DISCUSSION OF DIGITAL GROWTH MODELS WOULD BE INCOMPLETE WITHOUT OBSERVING THE RISKS THESE SECTORS CAN BRING 50 Responding to the opportunities and challenges of automation and AI Development 4.0: Opportunities and Challenges for Accelerating Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific problems, and ensure innovative new sectors contribute to the SDGs, governments can explore forming consultative groups and public\u2212private consortia with leading firms to develop codes of conduct and best practices, and pursue educational campaigns for people entering sectors like the gig economy. They will also need to consider firmer regulatory interventions which explicitly forbid certain types of activities or conduct in the digital economy. Data privacy protocols like those enshrined in the EU\u2019s new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), fines for companies with inadequate data protection protocols, and even bans on companies failing to show good faith and proper engagement with operational risks, as has occurred with Transport for London against ride-hailing company Uber, are just a few examples of how harder regulatory enforcement in the digital sphere is playing out in other regions. Gender should be part of the design and implementation of economic growth policy Economic policies can have a positive impact on gender divergence; conversely, failure to develop growth policy with a gender lens can aggravate and entrench inequalities. One study of male and female workers across 31 developed and developing countries found that STEM skills were positively related to labour market returns,93 94 especially for workers in digital-intensive sectors, and the persistent gender wage gap could be explained in part by males\u2019 greater access to STEM education. Another study suggests that the increase in female earnings following an increase in ICT skill acquisition ranges from 4% in Denmark to 19% in South Korea.95 A digital growth policy without a gender lens could exacerbate inequality, even if it creates positive economic outcomes overall. Narrowing the gap will require policies to equip female workers with sufficient STEM and ICT skills, including encouraging girls and women to pursue STEM-related studies in the first place.96 Basic skills are critical. In a World Wide Web Foundation study, almost all women in the survey of nine poor urban communities including in India, Indonesia and the Philippines, owned or had access to a mobile phone but, on average, only 21% of the connected women had searched for critical information on topics like health, legal rights and transport information.97 (The majority of women who lack access to digital technologies are in developing countries \u2013 the gender gap in A DIGITAL GROWTH POLICY WITHOUT A GENDER LENS COULD EXACERBATE INEQUALITY 51 mobile broadband access is 45% in Sub-Saharan Africa, and up to 50% in some parts of rural Asia.98) Other gender-framed growth policies include those that close the gap in digital finance and measures to protect women entering vulnerable sectors like the gig economy; a study of such opportunities for Syrian women refugees in Jordan, for instance, called for interventions to encourage protection and ensure safety.99 For more equitable outcomes in the new digital economy, companies should \u201cdesign-in\u201d such good practices, and governments should identify protective measures, as well as skill-supporting initiatives, to ensure that digital growth has pro- gender or gender-neutral effects.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "153160da-01a9-4d2c-94f8-db34ca8a1de0": {"__data__": {"id_": "153160da-01a9-4d2c-94f8-db34ca8a1de0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-40-opportunities-and-challenges-accelerating-progress-towards-sustainable-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Development 4.0: Opportunities and Challenges for Accelerating Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-40-opportunities-and-challenges-accelerating-progress-towards-sustainable-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c6676097dcb19b3ce25814084cf25b8fc47a8bf457c95ec99eeb76dda0391463"}, "2": {"node_id": "66cdd7c2-efe9-43bd-9467-ffb7272d2e02", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-40-opportunities-and-challenges-accelerating-progress-towards-sustainable-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a5340f65216e279b6b307482d6e95f60fdca0aa85e66b20465a7baa4f94c20a3"}}, "hash": "184b640204bd44c4d402a95c7d9cd07bd92c69c990af3673f6091ef94d240990", "text": "Education policy will need to focus on 21st-century skills Education is one of the few time-proven development strategies and has been rightly prioritised in the human capital literature.

In these cases, education systems can serve to reinforce inequalities, rather than remove them, as better funded schools in more affluent areas produce increasingly better educated children, who go on to occupy the most lucrative and powerful jobs in private and public sectors.

The Australian government is investing AU$13m over five years from 2016/17 in initiatives focused on women\u2019s participation in STEM. The National Innovation and Science Agenda is contributing to ongoing efforts by the government to encourage more girls and women to study STEM and pursue STEM- based and entrepreneurial careers. Meninas Digitais in Brazil aims to promote technology and STEM subjects by motivating female high school students and by developing their skills with short computing courses. The Japanese government is carrying out the Riko Challenge to inspire women to choose careers in STEM and increase the number of female science and engineering professionals. The OECD Mexico initiative, Ni\u00f1aSTEM PUEDEN, launched in early 2017, invites Mexican women who have prominent careers in science and mathematics to act as mentors and encourage girls to choose STEM subjects. Codigo X in Mexico is a programme to orientate women towards disciplines related to STEM and to promote the inclusion of girls and women in ICT sectors.

Millions of children remain out of school across Asia, despite a target set at the turn of the century to guarantee universal basic education by 2015. Many countries fail to teach even basic cognitive skills, let alone prepare students for the future. It is crucial that all youths access a full course of basic education, and that governments allocate adequate funds, and skills, to train teachers. Syllabuses, teaching methodologies, and assessment modes should be regularly refreshed to reflect 21st-century skills and expertise. This need not only come from the public sector. Issues such as teacher absenteeism show that state schooling may fail to address students\u2019 needs: a Transparency International study put the figure of absenteeism at over 15% in India, Indonesia, Cambodia, Pakistan and Bangladesh,101 while India in particular has been singled out for poor levels of quality education in its school system.102 In some contexts, low-cost private schools have been shown to achieve greater levels of service quality provision, although this is largely a reflection of the poor state of public schooling than any inherent traits; UNESCO has noted that governments can use \u201cstrategically low-cost private schools as an interim solution while plans are implemented to raise the number and the teaching quality of public schools.\u201d103 Secondary education.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "082779d0-c7eb-4725-8eb4-787151451bd1": {"__data__": {"id_": "082779d0-c7eb-4725-8eb4-787151451bd1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-40-opportunities-and-challenges-accelerating-progress-towards-sustainable-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Development 4.0: Opportunities and Challenges for Accelerating Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-40-opportunities-and-challenges-accelerating-progress-towards-sustainable-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "318e79e954c84389a2411d08845646e831159114fb3ab9d8f158e18136e0762c"}, "2": {"node_id": "42602f5f-8107-4a5d-a480-7a8141223864", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-40-opportunities-and-challenges-accelerating-progress-towards-sustainable-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a26156a14f0b01e3e00f0017df8577d3fc724891718da0d0eff115a0446dacec"}}, "hash": "009ed4999b23f2b183ee73add8c51f8a61d1288099b169f890c8f481e7281e56", "text": "Education quality needs to improve at the secondary level too, with greater curricular focus on ICT and STEM subjects in preparation for an evolving job market.

Many countries already promote Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) but quality is often poor. To improve outcomes, governments should identify skills which are in deficit at a regional, as well as national level, and prioritise practical work-integrated learning, which combines classroom study with hands-on experience. TVET courses should offer flexibility, so that cash-poor students can work while they study. Competency-based assessment systems to grant poorly- educated but skilled workers qualifications based on their experience could be an area to consider.107 For example, Malaysia\u2019s \u201cRedesigning Higher Education\u201d strategy aims to prepare students for the Fourth Industrial Revolution with programmes including 2u2i \u2013 a technical training pathway including two years of university and two of industry apprenticeship \u2013 and a CEO Faculty, where industry leaders provide lectures, curriculum development and mentoring at universities. In Thailand, the Institute of Field Robotics at King Mongkut\u2019s University of Technology, Thonburi, has been offering courses on industrial robotics and automation systems to nurture relevant skills and capacities to support a wide-scale adoption of robotics and automation technologies across the nation.108 The government is aiming for an investment of 12bn Baht (US$362m) in the first year, increasing to 200bn Baht (US$6bn) over the next five years,109 and has pledged to support all target groups that can use automation or robotics systems, covering the agricultural, industrial and service sectors, to enhance their manufacturing efficiency and help them compete more effectively at the global level.

Countries should support on-the-job learning and invest in lifelong education and entrepreneurship programmes that allow adults to re-skill in cases of redundancy. Incentives are numerous, including grants, subsidies, scholarships, or education credit. So too are free tuition and the guarantee of paid leave from work. Lifetime learning funds \u2013 taking contributions from employers, employees and government, which are invested tax-free and withdrawn as required \u2013 may prove a viable model for the future. In addition, the development of national guidelines can help workers navigate career pathways and provide advice on relevant education and training programmes. Governments may also support businesses with sector-specific training based on national competency standards. Policymakers can work with businesses and the third sector to identify missing skills and pique students\u2019 interest in alternative careers. The Philippines, for instance, has partnered with industries to promote alternative job opportunities for high school graduates. In the Panglao municipality, the association of hotels and resorts has trained high school teachers to engage students about the prospect of a career in tourism and services.110 Previously, 80% of public high school graduates would not have gone on to a college where tourism courses were offered, but due to the industry collaboration, almost all grade 10 graduates enrolled in grade 11 looked towards potential employment in the tourism industry, according to analysis by the Asia Foundation.

This second domain explains the ways the AI and innovation technology portfolio can be successfully used to promote the SDGs, and the social protection policies that could counter its downsides. AI can improve the efficiency of public administration and service delivery Governments are adopting AI, ML, big data and blockchain to optimise public services. By improving the efficiency of public administration, and lowering costs, AI can support the SDGs by freeing up government resources to focus on critical areas, lowering the fiscal cost of public administration and improving governments\u2019 ability to reach those most in need.111 112 Within the civil service, AI and ML can reduce bureaucracy and paperwork and improve data-driven services, as automation cuts the time taken to produce paperwork. Evidence shows that AI can be used in public administration where human resources are limited. For example, a study estimates that documenting and recording information consumes half a billion staff hours annually, at a cost of US$16bn in wages, in the US federal government, with procuring and processing information consuming another 280m person hours at a cost of $15bn in wages.113 Automated workflows and innovations such as blockchain are powerful forces that could dramatically cut such workloads. In the UK NHS, simple digital innovations have already cut costs and improved efficiency. Examples include a website, built by a doctor, which standardised documentation procedures for discharge summaries, which EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT AI CAN BE USED IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION WHERE HUMAN RESOURCES ARE LIMITED. 58 Responding to the opportunities and challenges of automation and AI Development 4.0: Opportunities and Challenges for Accelerating Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific are completed when patients leave hospital and return to their general practitioner. These had previously been prone to inconsistency and often contained missing or confusing information entered by often harried and over-worked medical staff.114 Such examples show how even simple digital innovations can make a substantial difference to public service delivery. Some Asian governments continue to suffer from very slow public administration processes \u2212 India\u2019s court system is a case in point \u2212 which can stymie economic growth and social welfare. Given that automation excels in structured, rule-based work, there is a huge opportunity to deploy such software for government administration. Data-driven public services can be a boon in healthcare provision Public services benefit from improved data, and evidence shows that AI and automation are making a contribution to more effective service delivery. Healthcare is a particular beneficiary. ML can improve infectious disease monitoring, crucial in a region with high population density and large cities, and this includes identifying less-known risks. One team used ML to determine bat species most likely to host filovirus, which causes severe haemorrhagic fevers like Ebola; their model, which achieved 87% accuracy, signalled significant bat reservoirs in parts of Southeast Asia, even though most focus to date has been on Sub-Saharan Africa.115 Collaborating with ML research communities could improve countries\u2019 readiness to such outbreaks.

Alibaba has partnered with the Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation and Kuala Lumpur city council to develop technology capable of live traffic predictions and recommendations to increase traffic efficiency in Kuala Lumpur. The system analyses data from video footage, traffic bureaus, public transportation systems and mapping apps, integrated with 500 inner-city cameras by 2018.124 Social protection responses will be needed The above examples illustrate how technologies can improve social services and make a positive contribution to the SDGs, but social policy can also counter the downsides of new technologies, as touched upon in the first part of this report. The function of social protection should be to provide every citizen with a basic, dignified standard of living regardless of employment status, disability or disadvantage. The social protection floor is defined by the ILO as the \u201cnationally defined set of basic social security guarantees to ensure, over the life cycle, that those in need have access to essential healthcare and basic income security\u201d.125 This is both a moral imperative and the necessary foundation of a resilient labour market because, without such a social protection floor, unemployment can push people into chronic poverty. Deteriorating mental and physical health, and inadequate financial means to access information about new work opportunities, re-train or migrate to new job opportunities, can lock individuals into permanent poverty. Well-designed and sustainable safety nets can thus ensure a smoother transition, and an elastic, responsive labour market that adapts to change. Social protection interventions can be split into four categories: protective (providing relief from deprivation, such as disability benefits or non-contributory pensions); preventive (averting deprivation such as through savings clubs, insurance or risk diversification); promotive (enhancing incomes and capabilities); and transformative (which address social equity and exclusion such as through anti-discrimination laws, affirmative action, and THE FUNCTION OF SOCIAL PROTECTION SHOULD BE TO PROVIDE EVERY CITIZEN WITH A BASIC, DIGNIFIED STANDARD OF LIVING REGARDLESS OF EMPLOYMENT STATUS, DISABILITY OR DISADVANTAGE 61 sensitisation campaigns).126 Social protection policies target eight broad areas: child and family support, maternity support, sickness, unemployment, employment injury, disability/invalidity, survivors, and old age.127 Here we focus on measures to help those displaced by technological change.

The following nations have no unemployment benefits programme or no information pertaining to such a programme: Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, the Philippines, and Vietnam.131 Beyond conventional statutory instruments, two other policy levers have been explored: cash transfers, and public works programmes/employment guarantees. IN ASIA, THERE IS CONSIDERABLE VARIATION IN THE SCALE AND SCOPE OF SOCIAL PROTECTION MEASURES. 62 Responding to the opportunities and challenges of automation and AI Development 4.0: Opportunities and Challenges for Accelerating Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific Cash transfers. Cash transfers provide direct cash benefits to individuals, without regard to their past contributions through tax (e.g. national insurance). Means-tested transfers provide benefits to people or households whose income falls below a pre- determined threshold, and are primarily financed by government revenues.132 Conditional cash transfers tie the continued receipt of money to specific development-related behaviours like child schooling or vaccinations.133 Cash transfers have steadily expanded globally in both developed and developing economies, and governments have re-purposed them to deal with new challenges; for example, US safety net programmes were scaled up to support post-disaster recovery after Hurricane Katrina, and Ethiopia\u2019s Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP), to aid for the chronically deprived added top-ups linked to weather- related shocks.134 Evaluation literature presents a mixed picture of the effectiveness of cash transfers. Contrary to assumptions that such measures dis-incentivise work, studies show that their receipt does not cause people to work less, except in certain cases such as the elderly. However, one literature assessment observed that cash transfers made without any explicit employment focus resulted in little or no change to adult labour markets, while those tied to job search assistance or for business start-up activity increased adult labour supply and earnings through channels including the alleviation of financial constraints to either job searching or new business formation.135 A more novel mode of cash transfer is universal basic income (UBI), an unconditional, population-wide basic financial transfer intended to provide a minimum income baseline. It has received growing attention as a tool to both simplify complex welfare systems and help those falling into unemployment and poverty. Even leading voices in the technology sector itself have put their weight behind the idea \u2212 Elon Musk predicted that job losses from automation could necessitate government help for some, and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has publicly lent support to the idea, while entrepreneur Andrew Yang, who is running for US President in the 2020 elections, has put UBI at the heart of his campaign agenda. CASH TRANSFERS MADE WITHOUT ANY EXPLICIT EMPLOYMENT FOCUS RESULTED IN LITTLE OR NO CHANGE TO ADULT LABOUR MARKETS 63 It is too early to establish whether UBI is effective, since no country has tried it at scale with monitoring and evaluation measures in place. There are also many ideological factors which have influenced the debate over UBI for decades. One is whether it is additional to current welfare systems or replaces them \u2013 if the latter, then by dint of being universal, it could be regressive by spreading welfare payments to many on middle and high incomes. Andrew Yang, in contrast, envisages an opt-in system for those who de facto receive more support through existing welfare transfers, which might include those with disabilities. Other obvious debates include how such interventions would be financed \u2013 for example, through \u201crobo- taxes\u201d levied on companies driving the automation transition. This is a complex problem for Asia, however, which is not the home of such firms \u2013 beyond China and its high-income economies \u2013 and therefore not a recipient of such tax spending.

THERE ARE ALSO MANY IDEOLOGICAL FACTORS WHICH HAVE INFLUENCED THE DEBATE OVER UBI FOR DECADES. FINLAND WAS AN EARLY MOVER IN A SMALL TRIAL IN WHICH 2,000 PEOPLE RECEIVED \u20ac560 PER MONTH 64 Responding to the opportunities and challenges of automation and AI Development 4.0: Opportunities and Challenges for Accelerating Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific Employment guarantees and public works programmes. Employment guarantees offer a set number of workdays to vulnerable households or individuals. Historically, public works programmes have frequently been used to rescue economies during troubled periods. While no simple evaluations can be made of such interventions, economists have argued that public works programmes can be effective but have tended to focus on infrastructure and less on education and social services, which can have a greater payback; they have also criticised the tendency for infrastructure programmes to end in white elephant projects.140 In developing Asia, the most notable and discussed public works programme is India\u2019s National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 2005 (NREGA), the largest public employment project in the world, which at its peak in 2009\u221210 granted 2.8bn days of employment to 54m rural households.141 NREGA offers 100 days of waged employment per financial year for rural households where adults are willing to participate in manual work. Unlike usual public works efforts, NREGA was a statutory right, rather than being at the discretion of government. Evidence on the programme is mixed. One 20-district review in 2006\u22127, soon after it was launched, found that female-headed household participation ranged from 12% to 52%, but many operational problems were reported, such as long time lags between requests and work allocation. Data at the time also showed limited uplift, with only 2% of household heads opening a bank account, although over half had purchased livestock.142 However, as befits a country of India\u2019s size and diversity, some states reported positive results. Dungarpur district in Rajasthan saw a high level of NREGA awareness and half the population utilising it, while corruption, a problem for NREGA elsewhere, was minimised due to tight oversight and transparency, which one think-tank attributed to Rajasthan\u2019s extensive experience in labour-intensive work programmes.143 Public works programmes have also been assessed outside of Asia. One review of Ethiopia\u2019s PSNP, launched in 2005, identified some positive gender components, but noted that it failed to address gender inequality in food security and agricultural productivity. It also observed that the ends to which public works are aimed are not gender-neutral: roads, terraces and water harvest facilities may meet male needs more than female, with women potentially benefitting more from health clinics closer HISTORICALLY, PUBLIC WORKS PROGRAMMES HAVE FREQUENTLY BEEN USED TO RESCUE ECONOMIES DURING TROUBLED PERIODS 65 to the community; gender is therefore an important factor in project selection.144 While a comprehensive review of public works and employment guarantees is beyond the scope of this report, lessons learned so far indicate that these have been a common government intervention for dealing with economic transition in both rich and developing countries, but they alone do not amount to a strategy for economic transformation outside of high-income economies. The Obama administration in the US, for instance, sought to use the financial crisis stimulus as an opportunity to push the country towards green energy.

As such, the third policy domain explores how AI, automation and the new digital economy can positively contribute to the environment and natural resource-related SDGs and areas of potential trade-offs. Emergent technologies can drive energy efficiency in industry The industrial sector accounts for approximately one-third of global final energy use, and the International Energy Agency has claimed that, even a decade ago, energy use could be reduced by between 13% and 29% in five energy-intensive sectors through implementing \u201cemergent technologies\u201d, amounting to a 4% reduction in global CO2 emissions.145 Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies improve energy efficiency and reduce waste across channels, including real-time analytics to identify energy usage trends and spot inefficiencies and waste. Innovations like Virtual Power Plants, which pool distributed energy resources, are orchestrated by a cloud-based centralised or distributed control centre, using IoT devices and digital technologies. 3D printing and rapid prototyping, meanwhile, allow firms to experiment with new products and designs using a fraction of the industrial energy needed in conventional, large-scale manufacturing processes. 3D printing also enables machinery to be simplified, reducing its weight and improving combustion efficiency. FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION TECHNOLOGIES IMPROVE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND REDUCE WASTE ACROSS CHANNELS, INCLUDING REAL- TIME ANALYTICS TO IDENTIFY ENERGY USAGE TRENDS AND SPOT INEFFICIENCIES AND WASTE. 67 Development 4.0: Opportunities and Challenges for Accelerating Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific For example, the General Electric LEAP engine, the first with 3D-printed fuel nozzles made from advanced materials, posted a 15% increase in fuel efficiency.146 Other efficiency gains from General Electric\u2019s use of software and additive printing include 10% higher energy production from wind, and 62% efficiency gains in gas turbines. Asian governments should consider attracting firms that are successfully utilising such technologies, and provide support mechanisms for local competitors to ensure they benefit from the same technologies. Fiscal incentives including custom exemptions or trade facilitation measures could be explored. Governments should also consider partnerships with digital logistics platforms that can be agents of change. Regulations to phase out internal combustion engines, for instance, force fast-growing businesses to invest heavily in future-proofing their business: there are already 200,000 electric cars in Didi\u2019s fleet, potentially rising to 1m within a decade.147 Agriculture stands to benefit from precision agriculture Asian agriculture faces a number of sustainability challenges including stagnant productivity, poorly regulated water usage and environmentally damaging practices. There is hope that precision agriculture, an emerging portfolio of technologies which applies robots, sensors, IoT, mobile telephony and geographical information systems, can improve farmers\u2019 visibility of their crops, helping them spot problems, respond to threats and more finely tailor their use of inputs, with powerful benefits in terms of, sustainability and reduced food waste. Innovations like vertical and hydroponic farming are also of note. The former grows food in vertically stacked layers, allowing greater output without using arable land, making it well suited to more densely populated areas. Asia is a lead market, with Spread and Fujitsu pursuing soilless and vertical agriculture. Technology inventions have been shown in studies to make a meaningful contribution to food security, which underpins most of the SDGs. One study argued that a portfolio of innovations including integrated soil fertility management, precision agriculture and water harvesting, applied to wheat, rice and maize, could reduce the number of people at risk of hunger by 35%, and all climate change-related increases in child malnutrition in the Pacific Islands could be eliminated by a package of policies that includes increasing R&D to 2% of agricultural GDP.148 69 However, precision agriculture is being led by developed economies. To increase its relevance and take-up in Asia, governments will need to work actively with the science and technology community and extension agencies, to support technology transfer, adapt innovations to local circumstances, and ensure that farmers \u2212 especially the smallholders who make up most of the agricultural production in lower-income Asia \u2212 understand how to use, and can access, these technologies.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e85a5765-5530-4d92-9b83-7f56162c2e0f": {"__data__": {"id_": "e85a5765-5530-4d92-9b83-7f56162c2e0f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-40-opportunities-and-challenges-accelerating-progress-towards-sustainable-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Development 4.0: Opportunities and Challenges for Accelerating Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-40-opportunities-and-challenges-accelerating-progress-towards-sustainable-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2710845a4466793cc41d459b9d5b69948171711c12f4efb3fc1b53ca7d4556ed"}, "2": {"node_id": "75e2ba3c-4da0-49e0-b22f-efcdb75b422a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-40-opportunities-and-challenges-accelerating-progress-towards-sustainable-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b8f3dc8d977fc6220093f55b1ecbd596afeefd03e676b46d1b6c11a625d6aac9"}}, "hash": "ac8f61ea2f373ebca6d21eda2dd61232cf0e9f711694d75ca2e83c7e0d0ec8f5", "text": "This can include helping them access higher-quality climate data \u2212 pest and disease forecasting services \u2212 and weather- based crop insurance programmes.149 For example, NITI Aayog is collaborating with IBM to develop a crop yield prediction model, using AI to provide real-time analytics to farmers.150 The partnership aims to enable use of technology to provide insights to farmers to improve crop productivity and soil yield, and control agricultural inputs, with the overarching goal of improving farmers\u2019 incomes.

The head of mining multinational Anglo American, which is active in China and India, recently predicted that robots, virtual modelling and sensors will be managing mines \u201cwithin a decade\u201d. BHP Billiton is also developing autonomous train systems in Australia\u2019s Pilbara iron ore region and robots have been used to improve safety in South African mines.152 As well as potentially carrying out more dangerous mining activities, such as developing the underground infrastructure, more sophisticated modelling tools could reduce harmful \u201ctailings\u201d \u2212 the run-off, often toxic, by-products of mining. This is critical because while many new technologies bring efficiency gains, they also increasingly depend on new types of raw materials: the advanced technologies of today rely on a number of resources that are problematic to extract. One study tracked the technology portfolios necessary to achieve the SDGs, and forecast large expected increases in demand for lithium, dysprosium/terbium, rhenium, and neodymium.153 Accessing these and other heavy rare-earth metals brings risks, as they often occur alongside hazardous and radioactive elements like uranium and thorium, which can be released during the mining, smelting and refining process.154 The study found that, as well as putting in place proper environmental protection policies, measures like recycling, especially of commodities such as copper, could also help, since products at the end of their lifetime can provide raw materials for new technologies. Evidence already shows problems in the Asia region. Bayan Obo, a major rare-earth mining site in Mongolia, has seen radioactive waste and sulfuric acid passing into dams and the Yellow River, which provides local drinking water. Cancer is a leading cause of death in the region and health problems associated with poisonous elements are reportedly common.155 71 Conclusion: Technological change and the openness of the future Asia\u2019s half-century of growth has made the largest contribution to global poverty reduction of any region, and was built on labour-intensive manufacturing and outsourced business services; precisely those sectors that are now threatened. If automation evolves at the pace some predict, it could slow, or even reverse, the region\u2019s progress towards the SDGs. The same innovations threatening to replace workers are being credited with progressive impacts, from improving social service delivery and simplifying public sector bureaucracy to providing new revenues and forms of income in the digital economy, a sector in which Asia is flourishing Choices made by governments, public institutions, the private sector and civil society shape the ends to which technologies are put and the extent to which their risks are managed. 73 73 The Fourth Industrial Revolution has generated much hype and excitement, with innovative companies promising a world of efficiency, productivity and progress. As these tools have advanced in range, speed and flexibility, they have amplified fears about technology-driven unemployment and inequality. This debate has been largely Western-centric to date as these economies deal with long-term stagnation in productivity and rising inequality. But development institutions and governments in emerging economies are rightly scrutinising this technology portfolio for threats \u2212 as well as opportunities \u2212 they might bring.

ASIA\u2019S HALF-CENTURY OF GROWTH HAS MADE THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTION TO GLOBAL POVERTY REDUCTION OF ANY REGION, AND WAS BUILT ON LABOUR-INTENSIVE MANUFACTURING AND OUTSOURCED BUSINESS SERVICES, PRECISELY THOSE SECTORS THAT ARE NOW THREATENED. 74 Conclusion: Technological change and the openness of the future Development 4.0: Opportunities and Challenges for Accelerating Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific Whichever route countries take, they should take heart in the fact that dystopian technological predictions have accompanied every new phase of innovation and rarely has economic history played out in either an overtly positive or negative direction. Choices made by governments, public institutions, the private sector and civil society shape the ends to which technologies are put and the extent to which their risks are managed. There are multiple drivers of inequality and economic marginalisation beyond the technological, which can be more directly influenced by governments. Innovation has always been an endeavour, shaped, constrained and directed by the choices we make about the role we want technology to play in the building of prosperous, inclusive and productive societies. 75 Policy directives by the United Nations Development Programme Rapid advances in technology are already profoundly affecting societies in Asia-Pacific. But while the possible effects of these changes on jobs, growth, or the environment can be estimated, even the best predictions are unlikely to hold in the face of rapid innovation. The impact of the Fourth Industrial Revolution is not pre-determined. How countries embrace and adapt to the coming changes will influence whether they meet the promise of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). AI 76 Policy directives by the United Nations Development Programme Development 4.0: Opportunities and Challenges for Accelerating Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific Building on the findings of the report, the six policy themes below are intended to be a practical guide to help promote progress across dimensions of sustainable development (economy, society and environment) and across segments of society. These are critical domains where governments\u2014 together with civil society, the private sector, and development partners\u2014can evaluate current approaches, consider future scenarios, and create and test new systems and models. It is up to each country to develop solutions appropriate to their own economic and social context\u2014 both in the present and in the future. These recommendations support this effort. They identify themes for further analysis and guide policy and institutional design to help societies capture the opportunities afforded by technological change and manage the possible negative consequences of it. Embrace predictive and adaptive decision-making. The Fourth Industrial Revolution coincides with other mega-trends such as rapid urbanisation, rising inequality, and climate change. Reactive policies and institutions will be increasingly ill-suited to manage these new challenges or to capture the potential of technological innovations to help strengthen approaches to sustainable development. Governments more likely to accelerate progress towards the SDGs will be those that actively design policies and institutions that are more predictive, adaptive, and responsive to citizen needs. \u2014 Use cognitive and analytical tools such as \u201cstrategic foresight\u201d, \u201chorizon-scanning\u201d, \u201csystems analysis\u201d, as well as big-data techniques and predictive analysis for policy and planning. \u2014 Introduce a culture of innovation and experimentation to test new solutions and technology. \u2014 Establish \u201ccross-functional teams\u201d from across ministries and between tiers of government. Capture emerging sources of growth and employment. Development models reliant on labour-intensive manufacturing are likely less suitable for the new era. One estimate, for example, is that 85% of the jobs that today\u2019s students will hold in 2030 do not currently exist.

Reimagine citizen engagement and personalised service delivery. Governments need to go beyond traditional forms of citizen engagement and rethink existing models of governance. New technologies make it possible for large numbers of citizens, including marginalised groups, to systematically engage and participate in shaping policy decisions and the services that affect them. New technologies can also provide better means for understanding citizen needs and pave the way for recipient-driven public service delivery. \u2014 Use technology to create platforms for continuously assessing citizen demand, tracking usage, and gauging customer satisfaction. \u2014 Broaden the development dialogue to include the views and perspectives of marginalised groups. \u2014 Integrate technology as a fundamental layer of the public service architecture, including training staff across tiers of government in its use and applications. \u2014 Leverage technology to boost efficiency, widen coverage, and personalise services. \u2014 Adopt transparent and regulated processes related to the use of technologies that affect civic engagement and citizen interaction. \u2014 Invest in expansion of the Internet to reach underserved communities to support wider access to information and direct connections with government platforms. Enhance protection to help leave no one behind. Adapting to coming changes will be difficult for many. Some workers will lose their jobs and others will discover their skills outdated. The impact of automation and technological change will also not be evenly distributed, including different consequences for men and women such as gaps in opportunity for developing skills relevant to the new economy. Some countries also confront a \u201cyouth bulge\u201d, increasing the prospects of an unemployed generation in the absence of preventive measures, while others face a demographic shift toward older populations that will put pressure on pension systems. Governments need to consider\u2014even in the best-case scenario\u2014how to support citizens, including re-examining ideas of social protection and the basic obligations of the government to its citizens. 78 Policy directives by the United Nations Development Programme Development 4.0: Opportunities and Challenges for Accelerating Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific \u2014 Experiment with and evaluate forms of universal basic income (UBI). An ambitious package of UBI, depending on country income level, is estimated to cost between 5 and 18% of GDP. \u2014 Leverage technology to improve social assistance and protection that is better targeted and tailored to specific demographic groups, including through improved understanding of needs through data and information collection. \u2014 Prototype tech-driven solutions to boost efficiency and effectiveness of social programmes, such as through more efficient delivery systems. \u2014 Consider innovative employment support, such as allowing flexibility for breaks in careers, facilitating transitions between wage and self-employment, and integration of care responsibilities into social protection. \u2014 Support research to better understand and respond to the gender implications of AI and technology, including for perpetuating inequalities. Mobilise and allocate finance for a better future. Governments will need to reframe how they plan resource allocation and mobilise new sources of domestic revenue. This includes through both public and private sources to finance: (i) strengthened social protection; (ii) interventions aimed at quality investments in health and education; and (iii) the provision of opportunities to increase productivity among youth. Advances in technology can also support systems for allocating, transferring, and tracking spending, and can create opportunities to support new and necessary measures in collecting and enforcing tax collection. \u2014 Determine options for phasing in tax reforms aligned with financing projections, such as excise tax, carbon tax, tax on large \u201csuper star\u201d multi-national companies, and VAT. \u2014 Leverage financing and direct investments toward key areas to accelerate education and skilling efforts. \u2014 Explore how innovative finance mechanisms, including impact investment, crowdfunding, pooled funds, and blended financing can contribute to financing strategies for inclusive growth. \u2014 Use foresight and costing methods to determine available resources and future gaps as a first step toward financing strategies that are responsive to future challenges. \u2014 Experiment with increasing corporate and wealth taxes to help counteract possible inequality effects", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e17e5532-13eb-4355-8037-f4512873e902": {"__data__": {"id_": "e17e5532-13eb-4355-8037-f4512873e902", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-40-opportunities-and-challenges-accelerating-progress-towards-sustainable-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Development 4.0: Opportunities and Challenges for Accelerating Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-40-opportunities-and-challenges-accelerating-progress-towards-sustainable-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9536961a817069798423124a39d54bdcb150eee5246a81355a5747ca445281be"}, "3": {"node_id": "31ff74e5-cc1d-4296-b3db-428b1533a8e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-40-opportunities-and-challenges-accelerating-progress-towards-sustainable-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "14ff809772ded1ff6eb4cfd3c52e0ba90f81dda1c0dbcfe9385b3df36329e22d"}}, "hash": "885f3a732898222401c17bb2cf9c033b8f9bb8f9cb5dc3df84d2940d5b98dd04", "text": "and source needed revenue. 79 List of abbreviations AEC ASEAN Economic Community AI Artificial Intelligence ASEAN Association of Southeast Asian Nations BPO Business Process Outsourcing GDPR General Data Protection Regulation ICT Information and Communications Technology IIoT Industrial Internet of Things ILO International Labour Organization IoT Internet of Things IT Information Technology ML Machine Learning MVA Manufacturing Value Added NGO Non-governmental organisation NHS National Health Service (UK) NREGA National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (India) PSNP Productive Safety Net Programme (Ethiopia) R&D Research and Development RPA Robotic Process Automation SDG Sustainable Development Goal SME Small and Medium-sized Enterprises STEM Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics TVET Technical and Vocational Education and Training UBI Universal Basic Income 80 Development 4.0: Opportunities and Challenges for Accelerating Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific References 1 \u201cThe Second Machine Age: Work, progress and prosperity in a time of brilliant technologies\u201d, Brynjolfsson and McAfee, MIT Press, 2016. 2 \u201cMillions of things will soon have digital twins\u201d, The Econwomist, July 2017. 3 \u201cWhat artificial intelligence can and can\u2019t do right now\u201d, A.

Transnational Organized Crime LIST OF ACRONYMS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY T rafficking in persons represents one of the worst forms of human rights abuses, whereby people are severely exploited through means of deception, coercion, or force. Some of the most dynamic human trafficking flows take place in the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS: Cambodia, China, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand and Viet Nam), defined by significant transnational patterns due to long and porous borders, traditional migration trends, important socio-economic imbalances, or cultural linkages. The United Nations Action for Cooperation against Trafficking in Persons (UN-ACT) is a regional project of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), launched in 2014 to counter human trafficking in the GMS and beyond. UN-ACT is the only United Nations project in the sub-region dealing comprehensively with human trafficking, positioned at the strategic intersection of governance, policy, research, coordination, and direct interventions. UN-ACT provides technical, coordination and financial support to the Coordinated Mekong Ministerial Initiative Against Trafficking (COMMIT), an inter- governmental body that brings together the six countries in the GMS in a joint effort to counter trafficking in persons. Throughout 2017, the COMMIT governments continued implementing the 4th COMMIT Sub-Regional Plan of Action on trafficking (SPA IV) supported by UN-ACT. Ongoing efforts aim at building national capacities for a more sustainable COMMIT, with related functions being gradually integrated into the countries\u2019 own systems and procedures. 2017 was marked by increased COMMIT governments\u2019 capacity and ownership of the COMMIT Process.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b5a544f-b83b-49d5-98ee-46cec68ffc9b": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b5a544f-b83b-49d5-98ee-46cec68ffc9b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/un-act-annual-progess-report-2017", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UN-ACT-Annual-Progess-Report-2017", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/un-act-annual-progess-report-2017", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2d3ab149e10316c2724478f24a825772de9c8d185b5bb3f37c37b5d9205c8921"}, "2": {"node_id": "7f92b4f4-f20d-4c2a-81ce-23ac94cec48d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/un-act-annual-progess-report-2017", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b6b5a9ced578f656e1e7f51440f5b0ab3482df66b591dc85de5a53cfc19a2017"}}, "hash": "d687aebc0bd3583f989826c78271c5198162f68d8d1e43b69c225a3ef6914c37", "text": "2017 was marked by increased COMMIT governments\u2019 capacity and ownership of the COMMIT Process.

UN-ACT provided results-based management (RBM) and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) trainings to five out of six COMMIT governments, which helped them to successfully develop their standardised M&E frameworks and report back their progress at the SOM12. COMMIT governments have developed and standardised victim identification and referral mechanisms across the region. Following the adoption of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)- COMMIT Indicators of Human Trafficking and Related Forms of Exploitation and Common COMMIT Guidelines on Victim Identification and Referral Mechanisms the year prior, UN-ACT encouraged the COMMIT governments to standardise victim identification and referral mechanisms by using the adopted indicators and further supported the governments to conduct initial needs assessments for victim identification. COMMIT countries have increased their cooperation with other countries and regional actors to effectively counter human trafficking. This includes Malaysia, the Netherlands, ASEAN and the Bali Process. Policy makers, academia, non-state actors and the public have been able to increase their access to evidence-based research and knowledge on human trafficking. UN-ACT continued to promote access to data on trafficking in persons by conducting and supporting research projects. It published \u2018The Guidebook \u2013 Supporting the Reintegration of Trafficked Persons: A Guidebook for the Greater Mekong Sub-Region\u2019 in April 2017. It also organized an International Seminar on Mixed Migration in collaboration with Mahidol University, during which 30 researchers from around the globe presented their academic research on mixed migration. Civil society and other non-governmental actors have been able to contribute more effectively to anti-trafficking efforts. UN-ACT continued to provide technical and financial support to civil society organizations (CSOs) in the GMS. Fourteen CSOs engaged in discussion with the COMMIT governments at the SOM12. In addition, 813 out of the 1,817 victims of trafficking supported through COMMIT\u2019s (trans-) national referral mechanisms in 2017 were referred from CSOs to government agencies, or vice versa. Finally, UN-ACT collaborated further with the private sector, especially recruitment agencies, to prevent human trafficking through fair recruitment of migrant workers. The Association of Cambodia Recruitment Agencies, the Myanmar Overseas Employment Agencies Federation, the Employers Confederation of Thailand, and the Viet Nam International Manpower Supply and Trade Company Ltd were all involved in the development of Fair Recruitment Guidelines for the region. UN-ACT looks forward to 2018, with China to take office as the first-ever annual COMMIT Chair and serve as host for the COMMIT meetings in 2018 including the 13th iii 1 Annual Progress Report 2017 COMMIT Senior Officials Meeting. COMMIT, with UN- ACT\u2019s technical support, will implement the COMMIT 2018 priorities upon which the COMMIT governments agreed. This includes bilateral cooperation between COMMIT countries and cooperation with non-COMMIT countries; prosecution; victim identification and sustainable reintegration; prevention and awareness raising; and capacity development of COMMIT countries including improved M&E. In addition, throughout 2018 UN-ACT will continue its research to increase the evidence base for policy making and interventions. UN-ACT will also continue to support and build the capacity of youth and civil society through the COMMIT Youth Forum and the CSO Platform to COMMIT, which are platforms for youth representatives and CSOs from the GMS to contribute towards trafficking awareness, prevention and support to victims.

INTRODUCTION Trafficking in persons is an estimated US$150 BILLION industry One of the world\u2019s largest CRIMINAL INDUSTRIES 24.9 MILLION persons globally are in forced labour, according to ILO estimates Over 50% of those in forced labour are in the Asia-Pacific region Figure 2. Human Trafficking and Forced Labour in Numbers Group photo of COMMIT representatives, national and international observers at SOM 12 Key to UN-ACT\u2019s work is its support to COMMIT, a government-led, multi-stakeholder process between the GMS countries, established in 2004 to jointly counter human trafficking in the sub-region. In addition, UN- ACT seeks to address patterns of human trafficking that go beyond the COMMIT countries, including in Malaysia and Indonesia. UN-ACT also aims to increase evidence-based research on trafficking issues and conducts research in-house and in collaboration with other institutions. 2 3 Annual Progress Report 2017 Figure 3. Patterns of human trafficking in the Greater Mekong Sub-region1 HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN THE GREATER MEKONG SUB-REGION T rafficking in persons constitutes one of the worst forms of human rights abuses, whereby individuals are severely exploited through means of deception, coercion, or force. From the trade in infants and organs, to marriage trafficking or severe forms of labour/sexual exploitation, human trafficking is a complex and dynamic phenomenon affected by multiple, intertwined factors including socio-economic disparities, weak governance systems, gender inequalities, as well as limited labour rights and migration opportunities. The Asia-Pacific region records by far the highest rates of trafficking in persons worldwide, with a prevalence three times greater than the second most affected region, namely Africa. Within the Asia-Pacific region, the GMS features some of the most extensive flows, characterized by strong cross-border patterns due to such factors as traditional migration trends, long and porous borders, significant socio-economic imbalances, and cultural linkages. In 2017, trafficking for forced marriage in China remained a growing issue across the GMS. It constituted an increasing trend in Lao PDR and Cambodia as well as one of the main causes of cross-border human trafficking in Myanmar, the primary source country for victims of trafficking in the region. In addition, traffickers in Cambodia have developed new means to send Cambodian women to China. Instead of flying them directly from Cambodia to China, they now transport them to Viet Nam by bus before putting them on flights from the transit country to China. New patterns in the way traffickers lure potential victims into vulnerable situations and trafficking have been observed in Viet Nam, characterised by an increasing use of the internet, especially gaming sites and social media. For instance, traffickers entice young women and girls with online dating relationships to persuade them to move abroad, then subject them to forced labour/sexual work or forced marriage often involving labour/sexual exploitation and other abuses. As a result, the number of reported incidences of Vietnamese women being trafficked internally or across borders has risen in recent years. Vietnamese organized crime networks also recruit Vietnamese adults and children under pretences of lucrative job opportunities and transport them to Europe, particularly the United Kingdom, to subject them to forced labour in cannabis farms and nail bars. While Lao PDR witnessed an increased record of internal human trafficking in 2017, with victims being mainly trafficked from rural areas to big cities or exploited in banana farms and rubber plantations, a decrease in official victim identifications and deportation cases compared to previous years was also observed. The reasons of this decrease may relate to victims not wishing to be identified. In Thailand, the Criminal Court concluded the 2015 Rohingya human trafficking and mass grave case, sentencing 62 defendants to four to 94-year imprisonment. This is considered as Thailand\u2019s historic human trafficking case and the biggest smuggling and human trafficking crackdown to date. Human trafficking in fishing and related industries also remained a priority focus of the government. There was an increase in investigation, protection and prosecution of human trafficking cases in 2017. Prominent cases in 2017 include the Long Kung shrimp peeling factory and Kantrang cases.

In addition, the Government of Myanmar organized the Regional COMMIT Taskforce Meeting and SOM12 in Nay Pyi Taw, Myanmar on 28- 29 November 2017, with UN-ACT technical support. The SOM12 successfully brought together the COMMIT leadership from each of the six member states and UN- ACT as the COMMIT Secretariat, along with counter- trafficking partners from across the region including youth, civil society, UN partners, embassies, donors, the private sector, and ASEAN which led one of the sessions on COMMIT-ASEAN collaboration. The wide range of stakeholders and partners engaging and feeding into the discussions in the SOM12 and COMMIT Taskforce underscores COMMIT\u2019s accountability to its stakeholders and increased transparency. On the SOM12 agenda were COMMIT sustainability and capacity development; victim identification and referral mechanisms, labour migration/fair recruitment; engagement with youth and civil society; cooperation with ASEAN and the private sector; M&E progress in the implementation of SPA IV; and 2018 priorities and work planning. The COMMIT members were able to successfully negotiate and come to an agreement on the following decisions: \u2022 The COMMIT governments agreed to use the ILO\u2019s General Principles and Operational Guidelines on Fair Recruitment as a reference for the development of bilateral agreements on human trafficking between member states. These are based on international standards and best practices to protect migrant workers from trafficking and it was an important step to have the governments deliberate, negotiate and agree on how it should be implemented. This was in line with the regional priority of COMMIT in 2017, which aimed to address the nexus between labour migration and human trafficking, especially at the recruitment stage. A workshop on these Principles and Guidelines was held with stakeholders from COMMIT countries in September 2017 and the outcome fed into the SOM12. ILO, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) also supported this effort. Representatives of governments, employers, workers and civil society from all GMS countries jointly developed a preamble for the Principles and Guidelines highlighting protection of migrant workers\u2019 rights, international best practices, and a gender-sensitive approach.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ade5402b-b595-4f86-b1b8-fa2afd0c57ad": {"__data__": {"id_": "ade5402b-b595-4f86-b1b8-fa2afd0c57ad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/un-act-annual-progess-report-2017", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UN-ACT-Annual-Progess-Report-2017", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/un-act-annual-progess-report-2017", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e5eac844b481e22a4e2dd54e9c69b963260ec9b110bb942499eddb31b5d3d31d"}, "2": {"node_id": "1c1a66c0-aceb-4a90-9a7e-91323797b957", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/un-act-annual-progess-report-2017", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0d401fb5df9b74f8ca58edc6c1570ba0a3245c9ededf5a1db5b0a5473385de2b"}}, "hash": "c35e0e041a560803ead931c4d6330a82fb38d2d42656bbe226b23aeeb0d7b3be", "text": "\u2022 The COMMIT governments finalized and adopted the terms of reference for a COMMIT Chair and agreed that China will serve as the first-ever COMMIT Chair for 2018.

Activity Result 1.2: Sufficient technical and functional capacities developed by governments UN-ACT continued to support the COMMIT governments in following up with COMMIT capacity development strategies and national capacity development plans. In 2017, the governments took on more secretariat functions themselves as part of the strategy to have the COMMIT governments eventually assume the secretariat role. This includes organizing COMMIT Taskforce training workshops and regional COMMIT Taskforce meetings, mobilising financial resources, providing administrative support to COMMIT Taskforce meetings including preparation, documentation, reporting and financial contributions. All governments have increased their participation and engagement with the COMMIT Process such as by developing and providing active feedback on draft COMMIT documents and they will be able to take on further functions in 2018 and beyond. The establishment of the annual COMMIT Chair reflects the increased technical and functional capacities that governments are now taking on. In 2017, UN-ACT provided M&E and RBM trainings to Myanmar high level and operational officers (training for Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand and Viet Nam took place the previous year). With increased M&E capacities, this enabled COMMIT countries to monitor and review their own effectiveness of the implementation of the SPA IV. The COMMIT governments also identified capacity development in COMMIT countries, including on M&E, as a priority for 2018. 6 7 Annual Progress Report 2017 A selection of important results in 2017: \u2022 COMMIT governments increased capacities to combat human trafficking based on systematic collection and tracking of data. Five out of six COMMIT countries successfully developed their standardised M&E frameworks and reported back their progress with indicators and targets at the SOM12. \u2022 The Ministry of Social Affairs, Veterans, and Youth Rehabilitation of Cambodia carried out missions to five provinces in Cambodia to monitor the implementation of minimum standards of residential care for victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation. The government officials have started to apply the endorsed M&E tool, developed with the support of UN-ACT to monitor the minimum standards of residential care. Based on the findings, the government officials followed up with shelter staff to improve residential care services so that they meet minimum standards. \u2022 The Myanmar Central Body for the Suppression of Trafficking in Persons established its first National M&E Group in 2017. Its mandate is to monitor the implementation of the 5-year Myanmar National Plan of Action (2017-2021). UN-ACT organized an RBM training workshop for the National M&E Group in July 2017, during which UN-ACT provided advice to the National M&E Group on developing their national results-based M&E framework for building a strong evidence base around human trafficking and for assessing the wide, diverse range of interventions being implemented to address the issue. Further, UN-ACT supported the National M&E Group to link its national M&E framework with the SPA IV\u2019s results- based M&E framework. Myanmar is the first country to link national and regional action plans through a results-based framework. This significant step forward is in line with the recommendation in the COMMIT capacity development strategy which aims to ensure consistency in addressing trafficking nationally and regionally. \u2022 Just as the Government of Lao PDR did in 2016, the Government of Myanmar provided all technical, logistical, administrative and financial support in organizing and hosting the SOM12, allowing UN-ACT to assume mainly a technical and coordinating role. \u2022 The COMMIT governments have been able to increase their technical abilities related to private sector collaboration on anti-trafficking efforts. The private sector engaged with the COMMIT governments in the session on \u2018Private sector engagement in counter- trafficking\u2019 at the SOM12, during which COMMIT governments shared results of their engagement with the private sector. Thailand reported on the establishment of the first fishermen live action centre to provide assistance to sea fearers and fishermen. Viet Nam highlighted its engagement with recruitment agencies in responding to migrant workers\u2019 needs. China mentioned its labour monitoring department which communicates with the private sector on labour issues and noted the collaboration between the government and Alibaba, China\u2019s biggest online commerce company, which provides support for a police tracking system for cases of missing or trafficked children through a web-based platform called \u201cTuan Yuan\u201d (reunion). The Government of China also partnered with Baidu, a Chinese multinational technology company, to create a nation-wide public alert network accessible by social media users. Finally, Cambodia explained its work with trade unions and Lao PDR underscored its collaboration with 23 recruitment agencies as well as the ASEAN Corporate Social Responsibility network.

Bilateral cooperation between COMMIT countries in particular, remained a key priority under the SPA IV in 2017, with UN-ACT ensuring that the voices of civil society and trafficked persons were represented and considered in the cooperation. Key results by COMMIT countries implemented under SPA IV in 2017: \u2022 Cambodia and China developed a bilateral cooperation agreement and joint action plan in 2017. The two parties agreed to cooperate on the following areas: 1) Establish a hotline between the two countries, with focal persons and contact details, for effective information exchange. 2) Set up taskforces by both countries to implement the agreement and joint activities. 3) Carry out a joint special sting operation against human traffickers from April to August 2017. 4) Carry out special preventive measures to strengthen education and awareness on human trafficking, particularly on forced marriage, by both countries annually, particularly in hotspot areas. 5) Conduct discussions and disseminate communications on legal procedures and necessary documents for transnational marriage registration and other legal affairs. 6) Carry out regular bilateral meetings, with the second meeting planned for the first quarter of 2018. 1,817 Victims Referred and Supported Through National and Transnational Mechanism Cambodia: 773 China: 8 Myanmar: 25 2017 Results at a Glance Thailand: 234 Lao PDR: 30 Viet Nam: 517 Thailand (1) : Royal Ordinance Concerning the Management of Foreign Workers\u2019 Employment B.E. 2560 (2017). UN- ACT, in collaboration with Winrock International, organized a stakeholder consultation to provide initial responses and recommendations for this policy. The policy underwent a first revision and is currently under the second revision. Following UN-ACT advocacy, the UN Country Team (including UN-ACT) under the UN Resident Coodinator\u2019s leadership met with the Minister of Labour on this policy to convey a coordinated UN response emphasizing human rights-based policy making. Vietnam (1) : UN-ACT and civil society have been involved in the review and revision of the Penal Code in Viet Nam since 2015. The revised Penal Code, which includes trafficking articles, was approved by the National Assembly in June 2017 for the implementation to strengthen the criminal justice response in Viet Nam. Cambodia (5): drafted law of surrogacy; law on migrant smuggling; mid-review of National Plan of Action (NPA-2014- 2018) against TIP; Joint Plan of Action (PoA) on TIP between Cambodia and China; recommendations on the Minimum Standards on Residential Care for Victims of Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation. 7 Improvements to Anti-Trafficking Polices in the GMS Civil society (CS) plays a key role in influencing trafficking interventions at the policy level and these improvements to policies were developed following advocacy from CS. Figure 3. UN-ACT Results at a glance table 2017 8 9 Annual Progress Report 2017 \u2022 Cambodia launched its \u201cNational Guidelines on Victim Identification and Referral for Appropriate Service Provision\u201d in early 2016 and conducted subsequent training courses on these guidelines for relevant government officials and staff from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in 2017. As a result, a national referral mechanism was established and 664 victims of trafficking were repatriated from abroad in 2017. In addition, the government incorporated a trafficking in persons curriculum into the National Police Academy and worked to integrate the curriculum into the Royal Academy for Judicial Professionals; conducted a bilateral meeting with China and endorsed the joint Plan of Action; held a bilateral meeting with Thailand to discuss case management and prepare the development of a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for victim identification and repatriation; and conducted preparations for a meeting with Malaysia in 2018 to finalise the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on trafficking in persons. \u2022 China enacted a new judicial interpretation on trafficking in women and children to better protect victims of trafficking. Government officials prosecuted perpetrators, including traffickers and marriage brokers of forced marriages. It also engaged a transnational organized crime advisor (since January 2017) to ensure collaboration in trafficking cases and cross-border irregular migration issues. Of note was the launch of Phase Three of the innovative web platform \u201cTuan Yuan\u201d as noted above. Over 20 mobile applications were developed for complaint mechanisms for cases of missing children. As of 31 October 2017, the Tuan Yuan platform achieved a 96% success rate, which recovered 2,169 missing children, 44 of whom were trafficking victims.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c44b5afe-5a9c-4c8a-a09b-01371a99d596": {"__data__": {"id_": "c44b5afe-5a9c-4c8a-a09b-01371a99d596", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/un-act-annual-progess-report-2017", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UN-ACT-Annual-Progess-Report-2017", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/un-act-annual-progess-report-2017", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4473450d0500774a64b3bb6d8f74be2b648487c6e3b04e688a42410729a474b7"}, "2": {"node_id": "41ca0fec-1afb-4296-b972-dcbe41312aed", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/un-act-annual-progess-report-2017", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d3de4651ee941f6dd9a6c672cb68fc3ba0242697ceeb6d78c1f50048c9124412"}}, "hash": "0a59b658f247fac813072d9ec88253bf1d9fe8e0f7df1dd731b021e9ac74aabc", "text": "\u2022 Lao PDR adopted the National Plan of Action on Anti-Trafficking in Persons (2017-2020) and allocated national resources for its implementation.

In addition, Thailand registered and trained 251 interpreters, so that they can support communication between trafficked persons from Myanmar, Lao PDR, Viet Nam, Cambodia and Thai officials. The government continued to develop bilateral and multilateral cooperation within and outside the GMS and established post-arrival and reintegration centres, as well as provincial assistance centres for migrant workers under the Ministry of Labour. Thailand provided awareness trainings on human trafficking to provincial children and youth councils throughout Thailand and organized a series of government and civil society forums to discuss joint efforts in addressing human trafficking. \u2022 Viet Nam revised the Penal Code, with amendments on the trafficking in persons-related section to align it with the UNTOC, and revised the law on children particularly on the right to be protected from exploitation. The government is implementing joint communication campaigns on anti-human trafficking along the borders between Viet Nam, Cambodia, China, and Lao PDR. It also collaborated with Interpol on trafficking cases (230 cases and 310 traffickers were investigated in 2017). Viet Nam developed a national referral mechanism for trafficked victims and conducted a national survey on the situation of trafficked victims. The government is assessing victim support centres and ensuring proper victim support standards. It also organized the Viet Nam \u2013 Lao PDR \u2013 Cambodia \u201cfriendship bus\u201d for awareness raising on preventing human trafficking. In 2017, more than 600 victims of trafficking were identified and rescued, and all of the identified victims received initial support.

In addition, UN-ACT supported further engagement between Viet Nam and the United Kingdom to combat human trafficking and modern slavery, and co-hosted with the United Kingdom a conference in Viet Nam addressing trafficking in persons between the two countries. At the regional level, UN-ACT engaged with a number of countries outside the GMS through various fora to share experiences of the COMMIT model and discuss areas of collaboration with COMMIT. This includes: \u2022 The Asian Women\u2019s Parliamentarian Caucus in Singapore with Members of Parliament from India, COMMIT representatives reviewing their progress in implementing SPA IV at SOM 12, with national and international observers 10 11 Annual Progress Report 2017 Nepal, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Timor-Leste \u2022 The ASEAN Community and People Mobility: Impacts, Challenges & Prospects conference in Japan \u2022 The Enhancing Human Security of Victims of Trafficking in Women in the Asia-Pacific Region conference and the \u2018Seoul Debates: Lessons Learnt on Addressing Gender-Based Violence: From Korea and Around the World\u2019 in South Korea \u2022 Responses to Transnational Organized Crime for the Peace and Order Council of the City of Makati in the Philippines. Activity Results 2.2: Institutionalised engagement between COMMIT and ASEAN UN-ACT continued to support the COMMIT governments to establish standardised victim identification and referral mechanisms at national levels, including the implementation of the ASEAN- COMMIT victim identification indicators. Assessments for victim identification were initiated in some ASEAN and COMMIT countries in 2017. Additionally, UN-ACT engaged COMMIT and ASEAN at the SOM12 to work together on the protection and promotion of migrant workers\u2019 rights and prevention of human trafficking through fair recruitment. The national COMMIT Taskforces have increasingly liaised with the relevant ASEAN focal points at the country level and have included them in the national COMMIT Taskforce meetings. In Cambodia, UN- ACT provided technical inputs on the draft Regional Guidelines and Procedures to Address the Needs of Victims of Trafficking of the ASEAN Commission on The Promotion and Protection of The Rights of Women and Children, as well as the draft Resolution on Promotion of the Health of Female Migrant Workers of the ASEAN Parliamentarian Assembly. In Thailand, the COMMIT- ASEAN indicators of human trafficking were introduced and discussed as tools and standards for labour inspectors to draw upon in their work. ASEAN representatives also participated in the SOM12. The Philippines, as the Chair of ASEAN in 2017, shared the country\u2019s innovative measures to combat trafficking in persons and illegal recruitment. The ASEAN Chair representative discussed with COMMIT governments and agreed on further collaboration. Activity Result 2.3: Coordination and cooperation among relevant regional actors for anti-trafficking increased UN-ACT organized three regional network meetings in 2017, which brought together civil society, UN and academic stakeholders from across Southeast and East Asia to present and discuss developments in the field of migration and human trafficking. The meetings provided inclusive opportunities for anti-trafficking organizations to connect on a regular basis and explore opportunities for collaboration. The themes of the events were private sector engagement in anti-human trafficking, regional and global work on mixed migration, and the model of a national rapporteur on trafficking in persons. There have been continued efforts to coordinate amongst UN agencies with active participation of UN-ACT, which led to concrete deliverables on addressing human trafficking/migration issues. UN agencies have notably coordinated through the UN Technical Working Group on Sustainable Societies, which includes migration/ human trafficking issues, the UNDP Technical Working Group on Migration and Displacement, which internally coordinates UNDP\u2019s work with other stakeholders including other UN partners, and the UN Development Group Asia Pacific Human Rights Network. In addition, UN-ACT co-chairs the South East Asia Coordination Group Against Trafficking in Persons with UN partners, which meets regularly, and provided technical support to the \u2018ILO TRIANGLE II/IOM PROMISE Baseline Survey and Access to Justice for Migrant Workers\u2019 Study.

Finally, UN-ACT provided technical support and advice to regional NGOs in the organization of youth debates on the impact of begging and street children. UN-ACT continued to be involved in the Bali Process and provided support to several events this year, including consultations to develop a facilitator\u2019s guide for \u201cComprehensive Approaches for Addressing Irregular Movements of People by Sea\u201d, and to establish a Regional Strategic Roadmap to strengthen counter- and share his desire to support organizations working on combatting human trafficking. He reported having learnt useful information which he will share with his friends and relatives to help them be less vulnerable to human trafficking. Min and the other participants also discussed and developed recommendations for the improvement of assistance and services provided to trafficked victims. UN-ACT is a member of the Myanmar Human Trafficking Working Group and played an active role at the Survivor Gathering Workshop held in Nay Pyi Taw. UN-ACT provided technical support to the preparation of the event, stage performances and recommendations of the survivors. Survivors practising song performances on stage Min was a 20 year old man living in Kawthaung, in the south of Myanmar with his wife and mother. He worked as a labourer in a palm oil plantation earning less than 100 USD per month. One day, he met a stranger in a teashop who promised him a job in a Thai factory, where he would earn over 400 USD per month. Min agreed instantly and followed the stranger to Ranong, Thailand. Once there, however, Min was locked up and violently forced to board a fishing boat. Min spent over half a year at sea, forced to work very long hours for no salary. He was physically and psychologically abused by the crew and the captain himself, who regularly beat him, called him abusive words and threatened to harm his family if he tried to escape. One day, the Indonesian Police intercepted the boat while it was illegally fishing in Indonesian waters and instructed them to go back to Ranong. When the vessel arrived at its destination, Min managed to escape and return to Myanmar where he approached the Anti-Trafficking Task Force for help. Thanks to his active involvement in the criminal justice process, his broker was arrested and sentenced to jail, yet Min never received any compensation. He was reunited with his family and found a job in a palm oil plantation. Fortunately, Min did receive some support from NGOs, which helped him in renovating his house and opening a small grocery shop. Min was delighted when he received an invitation to participate in the Survivors Gathering Event organized in June 2017 by World Vision Myanmar under the guidance of the Central Body for Suppression of Trafficking in Persons (CBTIP). Min was excited about meeting other survivors and overcoming their trafficking experiences together. The workshop gave him an opportunity to express his feelings Supporting Survivors of Trafficking trafficking responses among members. UN-ACT also engaged with regional actors beyond the GMS. In March, the project was invited to engage with stakeholders on combatting human trafficking at several regional events. This included the Corporate Affairs Forum Conference, which was organized by Public Affairs Asia in Singapore to engage the private sector in counter-trafficking efforts, and the Asian Forum of Parliamentarians for Population and Development organized in Bangkok to share COMMIT experiences and provide insights into regional cooperation in counter-trafficking for parliamentarians from Asia and the Pacific. UN-ACT conducted a series of webinars via Freedom Collaborative, an online community platform that unites anti-human trafficking stakeholders from the region and around the world. A first webinar on \u2018Irregular migration, Refugees, and Victims of Trafficking: The Complexities of Mixed Migration in Counter-Trafficking in Persons\u2019 was held in March, followed by a second on \u2018Mixed Migration in Southeast and East Asia: Strengthening the Evidence Base for More Informed Policy and Programming\u201d in June, and a third on \u2018(Trans-)National Referral Mechanisms in CTIP: Models, Challenges and Approaches\u2019, jointly with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Further, UN-ACT conducted capacity development interventions for a wide range of regional stakeholders, including for GMS officials on labour migration in partnership with the Mekong Institute, and supported the development of the Global Compact on Migration at both national and regional levels.

The Guidebook has been disseminated to relevant organizations and institutions in the region to support their on-going assistance work for victims of trafficking. UN-ACT and Mahidol University organized an International Seminar on Mixed Migration in Bangkok on 21-22 June. This event increased access to research and knowledge, and contributed to developing the evidence base on human trafficking and mixed migration for policy makers, programme implementers, and the public. Registration was immediately oversubscribed and 30 presenters, including leading academics and practitioners from NGOs/CSOs, UN and governments discussed their papers on various dimensions of mixed migration, such as migration flows and patterns, national/international policies, and human trafficking. A few thousand people also joined the seminar via livestream and the online video of the event has been watched by over 40,000 viewers since. The presented papers are under consideration for publication in a 2018 issue on mixed migration of the prestigious Anti- Trafficking Review (with UN-ACT as guest editor), a peer-reviewed academic journal housed under the Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women. The seminar created an open dialogue around the latest research and evidence base and facilitated new partnerships across stakeholders for joint interventions.

Recent blogs include \u201cSafe Migration in a World on the Move\u201d and \u201cThe Importance of Narrative in Understanding Human Trafficking\u201d. Another blog was on \u201cSex Work and Human Trafficking: The Case for Agency and Empowerment\u201d, which provides conceptual reflections on the nexus between sex work and human trafficking, and discusses a series of vulnerability factors to human trafficking, introducing an empowerment approach on how to prevent and address exploitation in commercial sex.

UN-ACT China also has its own website, which had 376 new visitors and a total of 1,614 page views this year. Output 4: Civil society and other non- governmental actors are able to contribute more effectively to anti-trafficking efforts Activity Result 4.1: Increased engagement between government and civil society UN-ACT continued to position itself as a key facilitator for government and civil society engagement on anti- trafficking efforts in the GMS, by drawing upon direct engagements that have been built and maintained between governments and CSOs during COMMIT Senior Official Meetings in the past years. In 2017, 22 local and international representatives from 14 CSOs engaged on anti-trafficking interventions at the SOM12. CSOs also continued to participate in national and regional COMMIT Taskforce meetings as well as other national meetings implemented under COMMIT. The six COMMIT governments reported that 1,817 victims of trafficking were supported through COMMIT national and transnational referrals mechanisms in 2017. 813 were referred from CSOs to government agencies, or vice versa, among whom 773 were referred in Cambodia, 4 in China, 30 in Lao PDR, and 6 in Thailand. In 2017, UN-ACT Offices engaged their respective governments and civil society organizations as follows: \u2022 In Cambodia, UN-ACT held an inter-agency meeting among key anti-trafficking NGO partners in February, to prepare for a bilateral meeting between Cambodia and China. The meeting discussed a Plan of Action and SOP, and collected inputs from NGOs to be tabled for discussions with the National Committee on Counter Trafficking. Another inter-agency meeting was also held in May with key NGO partners to discuss how a counselling service can be provided to Cambodian victims in China. The meeting also discussed the production of a brochure to promote Cambodian student networks among the Cambodian women in China. In addition, UN-ACT convened counter- trafficking stakeholder meetings (including with civil society partners) which aim to coordinate and share research findings and information on various activities and issues concerning human trafficking in Cambodia. \u2022 In China, on the side lines of a Cambodia-China governmental bilateral meeting, UN-ACT discussed and agreed with visiting Cambodian CSOs on action points and initiatives to support the governments on their priorities to implement their plan of action for 2017.

The meetings provided a platform for anti-trafficking stakeholders, including civil society representatives, to update each other on their progress on anti-trafficking activities and collaborate on joint advocacy on government policies. On 30 July, (National Anti-Trafficking Day) network members agreed with the Ministry of Public Security and the government focal point on trafficking on the following areas of collaboration: 1) A joint public statement prepared by Counter Trafficking Network members to mark the National Day Against Human Trafficking, which was widely disseminated through social media. 2) Creation of an online space to share communications materials among the Network, which will inform support to national counter-trafficking efforts. 3) A mapping of counter trafficking agencies\u2019 work, which will inform further support to national authorities. 4) A workshop on victims of trafficking case data collection and management. \u2022 In Myanmar, UN-ACT convened regular Human Trafficking Working Group Meetings, which included civil society stakeholders to collaborate and update each other on anti-trafficking activities, plans and priorities, as well as raise common issues that need to be jointly addressed with the national anti-trafficking units. In addition, UN-ACT supported a survivor gathering event organized by World Vision under the guidance of the government\u2019s Central Body for Suppression of Trafficking in Persons. Activity Result 4.2: Civil society has increased and sustained capacity to support Victims of Trafficking With support from UN-ACT, CSOs in the GMS countries increased their involvement in anti-trafficking efforts and enhanced their capacity to support victims of trafficking. Through direct assistance to CSOs, UN-ACT continued to provide financial and technical support to CSOs which supported 160 victims of trafficking in Cambodia and Lao PDR in 2017. UN-ACT, in collaboration with the Government of Thailand\u2019s Department of Special Investigation, provided ongoing support to the Mekong Club and the United Nations University, together with local and international NGOs, to develop a mobile application for preliminary victim identification. The application aims at assisting frontline responders from both governmental and non-governmental organizations by responding to the problem of language barriers between frontline respondents and potential victims and provides a preliminary evaluation regarding if a person may possibly be a victim of trafficking. Multiple workshops, focus groups and a stakeholder consultation were organized this year to demonstrate, discuss and update all stakeholders on the use of this application. A pilot trial of the application will be launched in early 2018. Activity Result 4.3: Increased engagement by the private sector In 2017, UN-ACT sustained its engagement and collaboration with private sector partners. Key collaborative efforts are highlighted below: \u2022 UN-ACT engaged with recruitment companies to prevent human trafficking through fair recruitment of migrant workers. The Association of Cambodia Recruitment Agencies, the Myanmar Overseas Employment Agencies Federation, the Employers Confederation of Thailand, the Viet Nam\u2019s SONA company were all involved in the development of Fair Recruitment Guidelines for the GMS. \u2022 The Union of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce & Industry discussed and engaged on private sector collaboration in counter-trafficking with COMMIT governments at the SOM12. \u2022 The Internet Science and Technology Corporation in Maanshan City continued to provide pro bono support to host the UN-ACT China website throughout 2017. \u2022 UN-ACT provided support to Interwoven\u2019s vocational training project in Lao.

These efforts have ensured that gender-sensitive coordinated actions are undertaken at both national and regional levels in source, transit and destination countries. UN-ACT also ensured that disaggregated and gender-sensitive indicators were used to monitor progress under SPA IV and encouraged the COMMIT governments to develop and use those indicators to monitor their national plans of action. This was the case for Myanmar\u2019s 5-year National Plan of Action (2017- 2021). In addition, the COMMIT governments developed a common set of guidelines for victim identification and referral mechanisms that is gender-sensitive. UN-ACT recognises that the dearth of data on trafficking continues to constitute an important barrier to effective, gender-informed responses. Driven by such concerns, UN-ACT has supported four CSOs: Cambodian Centre for the Protection of Children Right in Cambodia, Village Focus International in Lao PDR, Labour Rights Promotion Network in Thailand, and Viet Nam Judicial Support for the Poor in Viet Nam, to ensure gender-sensitive interventions and, where possible, data disaggregation, particularly by sex, age and forms of exploitation. Continued attention to the gender dimensions and drivers of human trafficking led UN-ACT to address patterns of forced marriages affecting the sub-region through a research on forced marriages between Cambodia and China. Many Cambodian women (as well as those from other countries in the GMS) are trafficked for forced marriages to China, coupled with sexual exploitation and forced labour. Limited employment and livelihood opportunities, as well as pressures to contribute to families\u2019 economic situations increase women and girls\u2019 vulnerabilities. UN-ACT seeks to address rehabilitation and reintegration for these women through considering women\u2019s particular needs and the broader societal context including by addressing systemic inequalities and discrimination affecting their opportunities. UN- ACT\u2019s research identified various opportunities for preventive and protective interventions, which informed the negotiations of a bilateral agreement on human trafficking between Cambodia and China. UN-ACT\u2019s advocacy around the research\u2019s recommendations has since also led to regulatory changes which consider women and girls\u2019 needs, including for example revisions to the system of interpretation in Chinese\u2019s marriage registration centres, where consent to a marriage is to be independently confirmed. In the past, limited language capabilities often resulted in brokers and their affiliates serving as interpreters threatening women to ensure their \u2018consent\u2019. Human rights H uman trafficking is a severe form of human rights abuse whereby people are deprived of control over their lives. A human rights-based approach requires that interventions are designed with the objective to strengthen and protect people\u2019s inherent rights, including through empowerment to claim such rights. UN-ACT\u2019s activities seek to ensure that victims are empowered to regain control over their lives, while strengthening duty bearers\u2019 capacities to respect, protect and fulfil the rights of vulnerable populations and trafficked persons. In the GMS, it has been observed that interventions against human trafficking are widely dominated by law enforcement and security approaches, often with negative repercussions on human rights especially in \u2022 UN-ACT and the Charoen Pokphand Group, a Thai conglomerate engaged on potential agricultural research and vulnerabilities to trafficking. \u2022 The Mekong Club, which engages with the private sector, and UN-ACT collaborated on a victim identification mobile application in Thailand. \u2022 The Thai Tuna Association engaged with anti trafficking stakeholders at the workshop on Global Plan of Action that UN-ACT co-hosted with the Thailand Ministry of Foreign Affairs. \u2022 UN-ACT supported to PricewaterhouseCoopers in training one of their private sector clients on trafficking in persons and business and human rights in Thailand. \u2022 UN-ACT provided policy advice to recruitment associations companies and sub-contractors in Thailand. 18 19 Annual Progress Report 2017 women-dominated, informal sectors. More structural, empowerment-oriented responses to exploitation is needed. UN-ACT\u2019s persistent advocacy and action for more coordinated and integrated counter-trafficking efforts over the years, including through collaboration with civil society, have contributed significantly to this effort. With COMMIT endorsing and implementing an annual priority around strengthening recruitment and labour migration systems in and between its member states, 2017 saw an important development with regards to the advancement of human rights.

Concerns were raised about specific human rights issues in the policies as well as about the lack of proper consultation with relevant stakeholders before the policy was implemented. Some aspects of the policy address the longer-term management of migrant workers in Thailand and these positive aspects are to be promoted, yet other aspects were seen as increasing vulnerability to corruption and trafficking. UN-ACT rapidly worked together with UN and civil society partners from June 2017 to advocate for migrant workers\u2019 rights in response to the policy changes and engaged the government on recommended revisions. UN-ACT, in collaboration with Winrock International, organized a stakeholder consultation attended by concerned CSOs and UN partners, during which UN- ACT agreed to contribute towards a coordinated human-rights based UN response and provide policy recommendations. The efforts, led by the UN Resident Coordinator, helped to ensure joint and coordinated advocacy on the main issues addressed by UN agencies. As a result, there has been stronger engagement between the UN and the Thai Government on the issue of migrant workers/trafficking prevention at the policy level based on human rights approaches. UN-ACT will continue to work on human-rights based trafficking prevention and migration-related issues in Thailand in 2018 when the law is scheduled to take effect. Migration and displacement (M&D) and root causes including environment/climate change U N-ACT serves as the Asia-Pacific focal point for UNDP\u2019s global work on migration and displacement, which particularly focuses on addressing the root causes of M&D such as environmental drivers/climate change, governance challenges, exclusion and inequalities, insufficient development gains, protracted conflicts and violent extremism. Through its role as the UNDP Asia-Pacific M&D focal point, UN-ACT has been instrumental in the key role that UNDP played for the September 2016 global UN Summit for Refugees and Migrants convened by the Secretary General and it has been supporting UNDP\u2019s efforts in the follow up to the Summit throughout 2017, which includes the Global Compact on Migration and Global Compact on Refugees. In 2017, UN-ACT, together with the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific and other UN agencies, organized a roundtable for the regional meeting with Asia Pacific Member States on the Global Compact on Migration. One of the main areas for the roundtable UN-ACT organized focused on the environmental impact on migration. As the natural environment becomes more stressed, environmental changes like sea-level rise, deforestation and land degradation prompt migration. There are also the impacts on migration from more frequent droughts and tropical cyclones of greater magnitude. UN-ACT has also been providing technical inputs into policy papers and strategies for UNDP\u2019s global work on M&D in line with the Sustainable Development Goals and advises UNDP managers and country offices on M&D. It has been helping to shape UNDP\u2019s global approach to M&D, including human trafficking and has been representing UNDP in high-level regional meetings related to M&D. U N-ACT faced budget constraints in 2017 as donor funding was confirmed for year end and 2018. The funding challenge particularly affected UN-ACT\u2019s ability to provide financial support to CSOs and to invest in developing stronger cooperation and engagement between COMMIT and other countries. Nevertheless, UN-ACT has been able to partially overcome budgetary constraints through joint implementation with other development partners, using more of its technical expertise and convening power and having COMMIT governments take more ownership and increasingly contribute more of their national budgets to fund counter-trafficking efforts. ASEAN is a key counter-trafficking partner for COMMIT at the regional level and UN-ACT/COMMIT have engaged with ASEAN through various fora in 2017. However, there are challenges in collaborating effectively with ASEAN systematically, as recognised by many counter-trafficking partners. ASEAN addresses trafficking and trafficking-related issues through different ASEAN pillars and organs. The lead body responsible for the implementation of the ASEAN Convention against Trafficking in Persons is the ASEAN Senior Officials Meeting on Transnational Crime but this department is focused primarily on the criminal justice response.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5d62d0ca-b2e8-45e1-92c1-8541948aed72": {"__data__": {"id_": "5d62d0ca-b2e8-45e1-92c1-8541948aed72", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/un-act-annual-progess-report-2017", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UN-ACT-Annual-Progess-Report-2017", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/un-act-annual-progess-report-2017", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d5cd47c7969d980ae7a23c97acbcf8b9d7dbab22eccbf08c9c410859bc548f69"}, "2": {"node_id": "d6eec3b2-f546-43fd-8805-0d2605774e34", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/un-act-annual-progess-report-2017", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cde953327ef919896bc11845802dc50b7232ac0696481bf2c635841c7680cc23"}}, "hash": "169f86090c622dfbbf2fa989d00a32a72b2f24242b3ee04da34423a7aa4ef326", "text": "UN-ACT supports COMMIT through a multi-disciplinary response, and therefore reaches out to the various ASEAN departments/bodies, including the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights, the ASEAN Commission on Women and Children CONSTRAINTS IN IMPLEMENTATION: Improving UN-ACT Project Performance Through Learning and Reflections on victim protection, and the ASEAN Forum on Migrant Labour.

The dearth of data poses a challenge to developing effective interventions based on evidence. UN-ACT continues to address this issue through its studies and research, together with partners. Victim identification and referral mechanisms have been a priority for COMMIT, yet challenges remain substantial and justice for victims continues to be limited. Fear among victims to disclose details of the case, or even identify themselves as victims, results in limited success during the prosecution and reintegration procedures, while the time taken to process cases and the potential for corruption undermine efforts. This highlights the importance of learning and developing support services in victim identification and referral mechanisms, in coordination with criminal justice responses. These are all areas that UN-ACT and COMMIT have focussed on in 2017 and will continue to do in partnership with other UN agencies, NGOs and other national and international anti-trafficking stakeholders. 20 21 Annual Progress Report 2017 Outcome: Key anti-trafficking stakeholders in the region are working in a more cooperative and mutually supportive manner to effectively combat trafficking in persons Indicator 1: Number of victims referred and supported through national and transnational referral mechanisms (disaggregated by sex/gender) Baseline: 0 Progress Marker 2017: 4000 Result 2017: 1817 (CMB: 773, CHN: 8, LAO: 30, MMR:255, THA: 234, VNM: 517; disaggregated data on age and sex are available for CMB and LAO) 2018 Target: 15, 000 Indicator 2: Number of changes in trafficking policies after advocacy from civil society Baseline: 0 Progress Marker 2017: 9 Result 2017: 7 (CMB: 5, THA: 1, VNM: 1) 2018 Target: 40 Activity result Indicators Baseline Cambodia China Lao PDR Myanmar Thailand V i e t Nam Regional Progress M a r k e r 2017 Achievements Output 1: The COMMIT Process is strengthened to become sustainable and self-reliant 1.1 COMMIT accountability and transparency enhanced # of countries reporting back on agreed M&E framework 0 1 - 1 1 1 1 N/A 5 As of 2017, five out of six countries are able to develop and/or sustain their national monitoring and evaluation frameworks, which support the COMMIT Process in undertaking an approach oriented to \u2018managing for results\u2019. 1 ANNEX 1 INDICATOR TABLE THE WAY FORWARD 2 018 will be an exciting year for COMMIT, with the first- ever annual COMMIT Chair, China, to take office and host COMMIT\u2019s high-level meetings. In 2018, COMMIT governments will continue to enhance its ownership of the COMMIT Process and take on more responsibility for various technical and functional capacities, including several secretariat functions that used to be undertaken by UN-ACT. In the meantime, UN-ACT will continue to work on increasing governments\u2019 capacity further by supporting governments to implement capacity development strategies and achieve COMMIT priorities in 2018. This includes bilateral cooperation between COMMIT countries as well as with non- COMMIT countries, victim identification and referral mechanisms, sustainable reintegration of trafficking survivors, prevention and awareness raising. UN-ACT will also pursue efforts to bridge the data gap for trafficking in persons in the region by continuing to conduct in-house and joint research to increase the evidence base for policy making and interventions. An in-house research on the recruitment practices and employment conditions experienced by regular migrant workers from Lao PDR going to Thailand, as well as a study on recruitment practices and employment conditions of urban refugees in Bangkok will notably be published in 2018. Their findings should be of significant help to develop and implement effective, evidence- based interventions. UN-ACT will continue to support and build the capacity of youth through the COMMIT Youth Forum, a platform for youth representatives from the GMS to exchange their creative skills for effective trafficking awareness and prevention. UN-ACT also recognises that civil society plays an important role in combatting trafficking in persons. Through the COMMIT Process and UN-ACT\u2019s inter-agency working groups in the GMS countries, UN- ACT provides a platform for systematic civil society engagement and collaboration with governments. UN- ACT will also be supporting civil society and government partners in extending support services to trafficked persons, including through its COMMIT National Referral Mechanism Catalytic Initiative Project that will be implemented between 2018-2020. UN-ACT will also continue to collaborate with the private sector and bolster partnerships and collaboration with countries beyond COMMIT as well as regional mechanisms such as ASEAN in 2018 and beyond.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eef25125-069f-4ed2-9908-b72c20069748": {"__data__": {"id_": "eef25125-069f-4ed2-9908-b72c20069748", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/un-act-annual-progess-report-2017", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UN-ACT-Annual-Progess-Report-2017", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/un-act-annual-progess-report-2017", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eefd97c782d5bdfc55f9f98723097af93f22a2caa99ee7374b3c498812691313"}, "2": {"node_id": "0fcce99c-628a-4b49-bc45-522e534b397c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/un-act-annual-progess-report-2017", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "85c62c3a8b5ddd1bfd5beb7b993d36f59fd045615ec33152d1656d581b4a45f6"}}, "hash": "9ebe6ce523dc93686eb62e12773ba0c26e5a6aec56ff52da07a451bdbfcf7a06", "text": "Lastly, UN-ACT will work to identify new developments and trends in trafficking in persons as well as counter-trafficking strategies in order to enhance national capacities in collective responses.

All governments are continuing to take over the secretariat functions for COMMIT and successfully established an annual COMMIT Chair to facilitate greater government ownership from 2018 and beyond. 4. Myanmar and Viet Nam saw low percentages. In Myanmar, changes in the anti-trafficking structure and overall government structure affected the government\u2019s budget in 2017. Similarly, in Viet Nam, the government departments which implement COMMIT activities were undergoing a restructuring process, which affected budgeting and implementation in 2017. 5. All countries made good progress on implementing their 2017 COMMIT work plans. As noted above, Myanmar and Viet Nam could have had a higher rate but the government departments were undergoing restructuring in 2017. Nevertheless, Myanmar was still able to successfully host a regional COMMIT Task Force and a Senior Officials Meeting, where all countries reported back on their COMMIT progress and implementation update. 6. (1) UN-ACT provided technical support to Cambodia in discussions with Malaysia to further progress on a bilateral agreement to combat trafficking between the two countries. (2) In Lao PDR, the government engaged with non-COMMIT countries through the Bali Process. (3) Myanmar held a discussion with India to develop a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to combat trafficking in persons (TIP). (4) UN-ACT facilitated a visit of the Dutch National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings and Sexual Violence Against Children to share her experience with Thailand on the system of rapporteurs on human trafficking and how the counter-trafficking community can draw upon this to more effectively address exploitative practices. (5) UN-ACT, in partnership with UNODC and the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs, co-hosted a workshop on the \u2018UN Global Plan of Action on Combating Trafficking in Persons\u2019 in preparation for Thailand\u2019s engagement at the UN Global Plan of Action meeting with other countries at the global level. (6) UN-ACT supported engagement between Vietnam and the UK to combat TIP and modern slavery, and co-hosted a conference addressing TIP between the two countries. (7) UN-ACT supported the Asian Women\u2019s Parliamentarian Caucus at a conference in Singapore, sharing experiences of the COMMIT model and discussing areas of collaboration with representatives from a number of countries in Asia. This included Members of Parliament from India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Timor and others. (8-9) UN- ACT provided capacity building trainings on \u2018Enhancing Human Security of Victims of Trafficking in Women in the Asia-Pacific Region and contributed to \u2018Seoul Debates: Lessons Learnt on Addressing Gender-Based Violence: From Korea and Around the World\u2019 in South Korea. (10) UN-ACT shared experiences of the COMMIT Process at the Conference on \u2018The ASEAN Community and People Mobility: Impacts, Challenges & Prospects\u2019 in Japan. (11) UN-ACT shared experiences of COMMIT with counter-trafficking stakeholders in Malaysia at the conference \u2018Walk the Talk \u2013 Stop Trafficking Women and Girls\u2019 in Kuala Lumpur. (12) UN-ACT provided a training 26 27 Annual Progress Report 2017 on \u2018Responses to Transnational Organized Crime for the Peace and Order Council of the City of Makati/ Philippines. 7.

Expenditures by Output (with Operations) Figure 11. Expenditure per Activity Result (without Operations)2 Figure 9. Division of Expenditure by Office 2 Note that even though some activities above have little or no expenditure, UN-ACT still implemented work in these areas through providing technical support, coordination and convening support, and joint implementation with partners which funded activities of mutual interest, all of which required little or no funds from UN-ACT. LACK OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES RISK EVALUATION: It is possible that this risk will occur. Insufficient donor funding can undermines UN-ACT\u2019s operational and programmatic capacity to effectively implement the planned activities or initiate substantive interventions. ASSESSING CONSEQUENCE: The project risks not being able to achieve the objectives set, if sufficient funding is not secured. MITIGATION: The project developed a fundraising strategy to help guide the project\u2019s ongoing efforts to liaise with potential traditional and new donors. In 2016, China became the first COMMIT country to make a financial contribution to the project and it has been funding UN-ACT annually ever since. UN-ACT continues to seek increased funding from China and is encouraging other COMMIT countries to also contribute. UN-ACT continues to actively fund raise and promote its achievements to existing and potential donors and aims to maintain a high public profile to ensure that donors are aware of UN-ACT\u2019s value and relevance in anti-trafficking. An independent mid-term evaluation was finalized in 2017 and reviewed the funding situation and analysed the fundraising reality and strategy. UN-ACT has been implementing the recommendations of the evaluation. LACK OF POLITICAL WILL RISK EVALUATION: It is possible that the risk will occur. COMMIT countries have demonstrated considerable political will to combat human trafficking. This has been evident in increased financial contributions to their national COMMIT activities and the development of victim identification guidelines and monitoring systems for counter-trafficking with measurable indicators and targets to monitor their progress under a COMMIT Sub-regional Plan of Action. Governments also showed commitment through their work on the Fair Recruitment Guidelines in 2017. However, there remains indirect risks from restrictive laws and policies being developed related to limiting the space for civil society organizations to work, among them organizations involved in anti-human trafficking efforts. Previously, there was little pressure on the governments to show progress made against indicators and commitments related to trafficking. However, governments are now requested to demonstrate how they are combating human trafficking, through action and resources, and to report on this progress. ASSESSING CONSEQUENCE: Major consequence on the ability to achieve the intended results. A lack of political will may limit the sustainability of the COMMIT Process after the end date of the UN- ACT project, and implementation of measures agreed to under the COMMIT SPA IV. Limited implementation could result in inadequate prevention, protection and prosecution efforts, with a negative impact on those vulnerable to or affected by human trafficking. MITIGATION: Building trust and developing stronger relationships with the relevant government counterparts will continue to be key for reinforcing political will. Continuous engagement and focusing discussions on the factors driving the need for better anti-trafficking efforts, not only moral and rights-based, but also political, economic and social, will be emphasised at all levels. UN-ACT also ensures the importance of research and the systematic collection of data on human trafficking and counter-trafficking responses by government agencies to demonstrate whether COMMIT countries are meeting commitments made in SPA IV or other COMMIT decisions. This will increase governments accountability and transparency, and will encourage them to effectively address counter-trafficking efforts. INSUFFICENT ENGAGEMENT WITH NON- COMMIT COUNTRIES RISK EVALUATION: It is possible that the risk will occur. There has been formal and informal engagement with non-COMMIT countries and ASEAN bodies. However, limited financial resources hinders UN-ACT\u2019s efforts to engage more with ASEAN and non-COMMIT countries. In addition, engagement on anti-trafficking depends on the willingness of non-COMMIT governments to coordinate and partner with COMMIT governments through bilateral agreements and other efforts.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8100c989-b84c-4b12-8b16-72fcd098e963": {"__data__": {"id_": "8100c989-b84c-4b12-8b16-72fcd098e963", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/un-act-annual-progess-report-2017", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UN-ACT-Annual-Progess-Report-2017", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/un-act-annual-progess-report-2017", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dd75648d1dd1ab13a4383d23fc58025000ea88413454de68fc9aa4fea5f249bc"}, "2": {"node_id": "b233ee7b-ec7b-4d57-bfe4-21c80515a019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/un-act-annual-progess-report-2017", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c6371fb837487b7e8affc0265560446f440203612650a2708af3936df1828918"}}, "hash": "d26ffe9cf78afdff0c9eefff9295d3dfcb918879668f26aa5761e5b2e94643a8", "text": "ANNEX 3 UN-ACT RISK ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK 30 31 Annual Progress Report 2017 ASSESSING CONSEQUENCE: Limited consequence on the ability to achieve the intended results.

POLITICAL SENSITIVITY RISK EVALUATION: It is possible that the risk will occur. Working with governments, civil society and other stakeholders to combat human trafficking is likely to continue to be politically sensitive, due to the various economic, political, social and reputational impacts of the problem. However, the project design has taken account of such concerns and focuses on collaboration and capacity development in the sector. The need to work across borders and across sectors is now well recognized and sets the foundation for overcoming sensitivities. Further, the COMMIT Process provides its member countries with a forum to address human trafficking across sectors and borders in a safe environment in which governments have developed a sense of mutual trust with fellow COMMIT members as well as with UN-ACT. ASSESSING CONSEQUENCE: Limited consequence on the ability to achieve the intended results. The consequences may vary from initiative to initiative and will be contained within those initiatives should political sensitivities become heightened. Working closely with the COMMIT governments and other stakeholders provides channels for feedback at different stages and therefore limits consequences of politically sensitive actions. There is also a need to weigh different interests and relationships in strategizing initiatives, and pushing some boundaries may be necessary. MITIGATION: The project will take a collaborative approach to work with a wide range of stakeholders and prioritize its capacity building goals. Assessing the sensitivity of initiatives based on the experience and expertise of UN- ACT staff will help to guide interventions and reduce the potential risk. LACK OF COMMITMENT BY PARTNERS TO PROJECT INITIATIVES RISK EVALUATION: It is possible that the risk will occur. The project relies on partnerships for the success of project initiatives, and these are dependent on common goals and available resources. Where the project has limited resources for initiatives, the incentives for partners to join and remain committed to interventions may be reduced. ASSESSING CONSEQUENCE: Limited consequence on the ability to achieve the intended results. The project continues to engage with both current and new partners. Due to the collaborative nature of the project and the synergies in different initiatives with different partners, this risk is likely to be minimized. Also, given the range of partnerships that the project has developed, any lack of engagement from any one partner will be balanced by engagement with others. MITIGATION: Careful and strategic selection of partnerships and developing a wide range of partners involved in different activities will mitigate this risk. ETHICAL AND SECURITY CONCERNS RISK EVALUATION: It is unlikely that the risk will occur. The project takes a rights-based approach to interventions and therefore seeks to implement initiatives with such considerations well planned for. The primary risk is that government and non-government partners may unintentionally cause ethical and security concerns in their work with victims of trafficking, in developing policies, or in their work with the media. ASSESSING CONSEQUENCE: Limited consequence on the ability to achieve the intended results. Any infringements on ethical and security concerns may have significant consequences to the lives of trafficked and vulnerable persons as well as those directly communicating with them. MITIGATION: Mitigating measures will include security, ethical and risk assessments conducted on initiatives with implementing partners, and corresponding capacity building to reduce risks as an ongoing strategy.

The views expressed in this publication are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily represent those of the United Nations, including UNDP, or the UN Member States. UNDP partners with people at all levels of society to help build nations that can withstand crisis, and drive and sustain the kind of growth that improves the quality of life for everyone. On the ground in more than 170 countries and territories, we offer global perspective and local insight to help empower lives and build resilient nations. 3 Development Approaches to Migration and Displacement in Asia and the Pacific Summary Migration and displacement are significant and complex development challenges that require a multi-faceted and multi-stakeholder response. Of the 258 million international migrants in 2017, 106 million were from Asia, remitting $256 billion to their home countries. Further, the number of those displaced globally has increased to 68.5 million due to conflicts, climate change, and disasters induced by natural hazards, many of which have occurred in Asia and the Pacific. UNDP has been working on migration and displacement for decades, addressing both the positive and negative impacts of population movements. The phenomena intersect with governance and human rights, from international to local levels; livelihoods and inclusive growth, often as drivers of migration; rule of law and access to justice, with migrants frequently excluded; urbanization, which has increased internal and international migration; climate, disasters, conflict and violent extremism, having resulted in displacement; and sustaining peace. They are about inequality and discrimination \u2013 people move to better opportunities, which can paradoxically exacerbate inequalities when not managed; about youth \u2013 the demographic most likely to migrate for work; and about gender \u2013 migration and employment opportunities, as well as vulnerabilities and resilience to displacement events, are often differentiated by gender. In Asia and the Pacific, UNDP applies a holistic development approach to migration and displacement, promoting the benefits and mitigating the challenges. As such, we: work towards ensuring migration is a choice rather than a necessity, supporting alternatives where needed, and developing early warning systems and mitigation to displacement events; help empower migrants and host communities, facilitating integration and social cohesion; strengthen channels for migrants and diaspora communities within and from the region to contribute to sustainable development in their home countries; build the resilience of migrants and displaced persons to various vulnerabilities, including trafficking in persons; and support the re/integration of migrants and displaced persons, helping to develop a range of services tailored to their needs. In doing so, UNDP will support multi-stakeholder partnerships, engaging relevant actors in improving development outcomes of these issues in support of Agenda 2030. Human mobility is a key factor in the SDG\u2019s and to \u2018leave no one behind\u2019 and \u2018to reach the furthest behind first\u2019 requires that migrants and displaced populations be prioritized. The Global Compacts on Refugees and Migrants further elaborate the political will to catalyse efforts specifically for migrants and those displaced. Development Approaches to Migration and Displacement in Asia and the Pacific 4 The Global Context Migration and displacement have become global megatrends, significantly affecting economic and social development. Estimates indicate that 258 million people now reside outside of their country of birth, which has tripled in the past 50 years1. Within that, the number of those displaced from their home communities has also increased to 68.5 million in 2017 due to conflict, disasters and climate change2.

International migration is generally seen to be more heterogeneous than internal migration, although the socio-economic, ethnic and cultural differences in national populations mean similar challenges are encountered. Migration makes an overwhelmingly positive contribution to economic and social development globally, both in host and source communities. This reality is however often misrepresented and combines with a lack of protection to create significant vulnerabilities for migrants, in particular among already marginalized groups \u2013 such as women, youth, minorities, or people with disabilities. Migration can be voluntary or forced, with different degrees of voluntariness, coercion and deception, in-between. Forced migration, including displacement, intensifies vulnerabilities to abuse and exploitation, and needs to be urgently addressed in its various forms. Indeed, how governments and other stakeholders shape and respond to migration fundamentally affect its broader impact in a given country. 6 R. Skeldon: International Migration, Internal Migration, Mobility and Urbanization: Towards More Integrated Approaches (New York, 2017). Development Approaches to Migration and Displacement in Asia and the Pacific 6 Migration and Displacement in Asia-Pacific Migration The Asia-Pacific region sees some of the largest migration flows globally, driven especially by uneven development and demographics. In 2017, of the 258 million international migrants worldwide, 106 million were born in Asia, up from 65 million in 20007. Migration occurs primarily between countries located within the same region, accounting for 60% of migrants from Asia, largely for labour. The limited and inefficient channels to facilitate safe and regular labour migration are in stark contrast to its benefits and the demand for migrant work in the region. As a result, large numbers of migrants work in irregular status in destination countries, such as in Malaysia and Thailand. Remittances to the region reached $256 billion in 2017. While the efficiency of remittance channels is to be optimized, the amounts sent are ten times the total official development assistance in the Asia-Pacific and directly benefit 10% of the population of the region8, with significant further increases projected in coming years.

The UN Secretary General noted that in 2017 \u2018extreme weather events were largely responsible for displacing almost 19 million people around the world. Asia-Pacific is the most disaster prone region in the world and accounted for almost half this number\u201914. Notable and severe displacement events also occurred due to conflict in Myanmar, with 655,500 fleeing to Bangladesh, as well as in Marawi City in the Philippines connected to violent extremism, leaving 350,000 displaced. Migration from small islands in the Pacific, though smaller in absolute numbers, is significant proportionally, and results from sudden- and slow-onset natural disasters, the adverse effects of climate change, or environmental degradation. Climate hotspots in the Pacific are highly likely to become source areas for climate change-related migration, whether from urban, coastal and delta areas prone to floods, or communities affected by droughts. Displacement, as with other forms of unsafe migration, can reduce resilience to abuses and exploitation including human trafficking, and reverse development gains more broadly. Responses are mostly reactive rather than based on proactive preparation to displacement events before they occur, although examples of good practices are now emerging, largely as a result of improved data and analysis15.

Development Approaches to Migration and Displacement in Asia and the Pacific 10 UNDP on Migration and Displacement Mandate and experience With many years of experience in these areas, UNDP has a key role in supporting governments and other actors to respond to the new and evolving challenges related to migration and displacement, facilitating a whole-of-government, whole-of-society, and whole-of-development approach. As a member of the Global Migration Group, UNDP co-chairs the \u2018Working Group on Mainstreaming Migration into National Development Strategies\u2019, and is an observer to the Global Forum on Migration and Development18. In co-implementing the Mainstreaming Migration into National Development Strategies programme and the Joint Migration and Development Initiative, UNDP has delivered development results from international, to national and local levels, together with and for partners. In response to crises, both natural or man-made, UNDP works to build resilience to risks for displaced and vulnerable populations, whether through preparedness, recovery and access to livelihoods, or re/integration support. UNDP coordinates the Global Cluster for Early Recovery in humanitarian emergencies, seeking to transcend the humanitarian and development divide, and has worked closely with the Inter-Agency Standing Committee and UNHCR in this area as well as in the development of an approach to durable solutions for internally displaced persons and refugees19. The experience of the UNDP initiative UN Action for Cooperation against Trafficking in Persons (UN-ACT) in developing multi-sectoral cooperation in the Greater Mekong Sub-region sets a precedent for this work. This includes UN-ACT\u2019s role as Secretariat to the intergovernmental COMMIT Process and its support to the implementation of a regional plan of action at (sub-) national levels. The initiative convenes a network of partners engaged in counter-trafficking and migration for cooperation and joint initiatives, and integrates feedback mechanisms to policies through a research and M&E strategy. 18 UNDP\u2019s approach is detailed in Guidance Note: A Development Approach to Migration and Displacement. 19 UNDP, UNHCR, GCER and Global Protection Cluster: Durable Solutions: Preliminary Operational Guide (Brussels, 2016). 11 Development Approaches to Migration and Displacement in Asia and the Pacific Approach UNDP applies a holistic approach to migration and displacement, from source to destination, and re/integration. In Asia and the Pacific, this is aligned to the Global Compacts on Migrants and Refugees, and will support the development of tailored programming through the following five broad areas: 1. Ensuring migration is a choice rather than a necessity, supporting alternatives where needed, and developing early warning systems and mitigation to displacement events Emphasizing the use of data to analyse migration and displacement flows, root causes and drivers, we will work with partners to better understand, promote and implement appropriate responses. Adaptation strategies will be increasingly important in response to a changing climate and climate events, while UNDP\u2019s ongoing programming and partnerships in sustainable development, particularly in areas of governance, livelihoods and the environment, will also be key. 2. Empowering migrants and host communities, facilitating integration and social cohesion Migrants and displaced persons, host communities and governments at local and national levels will be engaged to increase social cohesion, and respect between and within populations of different origins. Support for integration efforts will be dependent on the specific contexts involved, yet seeks to build greater understanding and bonds among host communities and migrants.

Building the resilience of migrants and displaced persons to a range of vulnerabilities, including trafficking in persons To prevent and mitigate the negative impacts of displacement, and potential exploitation and abuse of migrants, we will implement pre-emptive programming to build resilience. Drawing on the substantial experience and partnerships in counter-trafficking in the region, comprehensive evidence-based responses will be facilitated. Further, host communities will be engaged to reduce consequences of conflicts, disasters and climate change events on displaced persons and refugees. 5. Supporting the re/integration of migrants and displaced persons, helping to develop a range of services tailored to their needs From successful circular migration, to returning displaced persons from conflicts or disasters, a range of services are needed for successful re/integration. Some may be in place to draw upon in a given environment, while in others capacities will need to be developed and monitored for sustainability. Individualised plans and services for exploited and trafficked persons are required to support re/ integration in special cases. Different approaches will be relevant in different countries due to a range of factors, in particular, the migration and displacement dynamics that are present. Social, economic, political and cultural variables will also have an impact on the types of programming and partnerships to be selected. Coming together in new ways of working that are constantly evolving, UNDP seeks to provide a platform for partners, both traditional and non-traditional, to convene and collaborate in developing approaches to migration and displacement. Throughout the support to governments, migrants, their source and host communities, different interventions will be co- created, co-supported and co-implemented, using new technologies and networks as viable and appropriate. 13 Development Approaches to Migration and Displacement in Asia and the Pacific Together with our partners, UNDP will integrate the provision of tools, technical assistance and capacity building, with constant learning from new collaborations to improve responses. We will convene dialogues and support policy advice and advocacy at regional, national and local levels. Recognising the value and importance of data, research and dissemination of knowledge products will be fundamental throughout the areas of work. South-South cooperation will be explored, developed and promoted in development approaches to migration and displacement, acknowledging the experiences generated throughout Asia and the Pacific to date. Bi- and multilateral mechanisms and relationships already enjoyed by countries in the region will be important channels in building effective responses and cooperation. Human rights and gender are significant concerns in migration and displacement, and are considered and incorporated throughout UNDP\u2019s programming and partnerships. The promotion and protection of human rights are fundamental to the quality of life of migrants and displaced persons, and the highly gendered nature of the phenomena means that different gender-based vulnerabilities and resiliencies need to be better understood and addressed. Development Approaches to Migration and Displacement in Asia and the Pacific 14 Partnerships New multi-stakeholder partnerships and approaches are needed to facilitate more positive migration outcomes for migrants, their families, and host and source communities. While governments, civil society and international organisations remain key, the private sector has also emerged as an important partner in addressing migration and displacement. Indeed, new analyses and expertise have been brought to the issue beyond the traditional actors as a result20. UNDP closely engages with the UN Asia-Pacific Regional Coordination Mechanism to strengthen policy and programme coherence. As co-chair of the Technical Working Group for Disaster Risk Management, together with UNISDR and UNESCAP, this has involved coordinating inter-agency work with ASEAN for El Nino Early Warning/Early Action. On migration and sustainable societies, UNDP works closely with IOM, UNESCAP, ILO, UNHCR, UNWomen, UNFPA and UNODC. Development agencies, financial institutions and think-tanks that have developed specialization in these areas will also be engaged, including: World Bank, ADB, Stockholm Environment Institute, Internally Displaced Monitoring Center, OECD and the Overseas Development Institute21. With migrants and displaced persons, their source and host communities at the heart of all of our efforts, they will be closely engaged in the development, implementation and monitoring of all interventions.

However, despite the large pool of talent and high entrepreneurial capacities, access to business financing remains a significant hinderance to youth financial inclusion. As part of efforts to fill this gap, and to demonstrate how the leveraging of new and pre-existing data can strongly contribute to improve youth access to enterprise financing, UNCDF has authored this working paper to provide an overview of youth entrepreneurship and access to finance in South and Southeast Asia \u2013 with a specific focus on the developing economies of Cambodia, Myanmar, and Lao PDR \u2013 and to offer more in-depth insights into barriers to finance and financial service usage for youth. To achieve this, it draws from Findex and FinScope financial inclusion data, entrepreneurship survey data (EDS and GEM), and an in-house Big Data study conducted by UNCDF (2018). The paper finds that while youth have sufficient business or learning opportunities and are in fact more loyal customers and use savings accounts more actively than their older counterparts, their access to formal credit is constrained due to barriers including a lack of collateral and credit history, and certain restrictive regulatory issues such as minimum age requirements to open an account, amongst others. The paper concludes that creating positive regulatory environments and removing service barriers to youth financial inclusion can unlock significant growth and entrepreneurship opportunities in emerging ASEAN and SAARC markets \u2013 including LDCs \u2013 and that new business models are emerging through the rise of financial technology (\u2018fintech\u2019) that can accelerate youth financial inclusion and entrepreneurship in these nations including alternative credit scoring, digital banking for millennials, crowd- and P2P-lending, digital financial literacy and business skills platforms. ABOUT UNCDF The United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) makes public and private finance work for the poor in the world\u2019s 47 least developed countries. With its capital mandate and instruments, UNCDF offers \u201clast mile\u201d finance models that unlock public and private resources, especially at the domestic level, to reduce poverty and support local economic development. UNCDF\u2019s financing models work through two channels: financial inclusion that expands the opportunities for individuals, households, and small businesses to participate in the local economy, providing them with the tools they need to climb out of poverty and manage their financial lives; and by showing how localized investments \u2014 through fiscal decentralization, innovative municipal finance, and structured project finance \u2014 can drive public and private funding that underpins local economic expansion and sustainable development. By strengthening how finance works for poor people at the household, small enterprise, and local infrastructure levels, UNCDF contributes to SDG 1 on eradicating poverty and SDG 17 on the means of implementation. By identifying those market segments where innovative financing models can have transformational impact in helping to reach the last mile and address exclusion and inequalities of access, UNCDF contributes to a number of different SDGs. ABOUT THE UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) partners with people at all levels of society to help build nations that can withstand crisis, and drive and sustain growth that improves the quality of life for everyone. On the ground in more than 170 countries and territories, UNDP offers a global perspective, as well as local insights to help empower lives and build resilient nations.

Accessing formal finance is even more difficult for less educated youth. By way of example, only 5 percent of entrepreneurs with primary level education in the Philippines have raised business capital from formal financial sources, while one in three entrepreneurs with a secondary or tertiary degree has done so (GERA, 2017). Although account ownership among young adults in South and Southeast Asia has more than doubled between 2011 and 2017, there remains a significant \u2018youth gap\u2019 between account ownership of older adults and young adults of 13 percent for SAARC1 and 8 percent for ASEAN2 respectively. Only 41 percent of youth in ASEAN and 60 percent in SAARC countries have a bank or a mobile money account (Findex, 2017). Furthermore, while account ownership remains low, usage of such accounts is even lower, as nearly 45 percent of savings accounts in South Asia and 24 percent in Southeast Asia3 are reported inactive4 (Findex, 2017). For the majority of youth, digital financial services are likely to be their first contact with the banking sector and in this respect, the use of digital payments including mobile money, credit and debit cards has increased among youth in SAARC from 13 to 21 percent and in ASEAN from 24 to 32 percent over the period 2014-2017 alone. Yet still less than 5 percent of the youth in South and Southeast Asia have a mobile money wallet. South and Southeast Asia are home to a combined 441 million youths, equivalent to almost 37 percent of the world\u2019s population aged 15-24 years (UNDESA, 2015). Although most of the countries in these regions are currently experiencing strong economic growth, over 50 percent of working-age people are engaged in vulnerable low-paid employment and youth unemployment remains high with an increasing number of young people reaching the working age (ILO, 2016). One way to generate decent work and inclusive growth is by empowering young people to innovate and respond to the needs of society - increasing youth entrepreneurship and social enterprise. Difficulties persist, however, as besides legal and regulatory challenges, lack of access to finance is a major obstacle to youth entrepreneurship. Fulfilling the financial needs of young people can empower them as entrepreneurs or to serve as innovators, leading to increased employment, income and economic growth. This working paper focuses on youth entrepreneurship and financial inclusion in South Asia and Southeast Asia, with a focus on the frontier economies of Cambodia, Lao PDR and Myanmar (CLM). The 2016 Global Entrepreneurship Monitoring survey (GERA, 2017) shows that youth and adults are equally optimistic about starting new ventures, however, the prevalence of entrepreneurial activities among youth is relatively low.

The majority of young entrepreneurs in CLM rely on informal savings and/or borrowing to start or operate a business, which suggests that access to formal finance is deeply constrained, in part because of existing institutional, infrastructure and regulatory barriers. The share of youth borrowing any money has reduced between 2014 and 2017 from 40 percent to 34 percent in South Asia and 50 percent to 47 percent in Southeast Asia (Findex, 2017). Fewer than 7 percent of youth borrow from formal financial institutions, and the majority of youth borrow through informal sources (30 percent). Furthermore, few young people in the ASEAN and SAARC region borrow (4 percent) or save (20 percent) for business or farming purposes. Youth looking to access formal finance face similar yet potentially larger barriers than their older counterparts, including a lack of collateral and credit history, and additional regulatory issues such as minimum age requirements to open an account, among others. The financial exclusion of youth is especially prevalent in the low-income economies of Cambodia, Lao PDR and Myanmar (CLM): approximately half of the youth in Cambodia and Myanmar, and one-third in Lao PDR, are completely excluded from formal and informal 6% 2% 5% Youth Gap in Formal Savings Cambodia Lao PDR Myanmar 12% 4% 7% Youth Gap in Formal Credit Cambodia Lao PDR Myanmar -2% -6% 4% Youth Gap in Formal Savings among Entrepreneurs Cambodia Lao PDR Myanmar 11% 5% 9% Youth Gap in Formal Credit among Entrepreneurs Cambodia Lao PDR Myanmar Figure 1: % Gap in Access to Formal Savings and Credit between Older Adults and Youth in CLM Source: FinScope Consumer Survey for Cambodia (2015), Lao PDR (2014), and Myanmar (2013).

The surveys contain subjective questions on entrepreneurial skills and capabilities which can be benchmarked to a Big Data set and credit score that accurately predicts default rates, opening new channels of finance to youth enterprises. With better data insights, larger loans can be given to the \u2018missing middle\u20197 of MSMEs that lack traditional collateral and financial track record while maintaining high repayment rates.8 Youth-focused mobile wallets and digital banking: While youth tend to be financially excluded, their participation in the digital economy is generally high and thus their first financial contact with a bank is likely to be a digital one. FSPs can develop and implement digital mobile-based banking solutions9 to provide financial products to unbanked young customers. These mobile wallets can provide savings, loans and payment services on a mobile device and in some cases allow for financial interaction through social media outlets such as WhatsApp and Facebook.10 The use of social media to conduct business payments and transactions has a clear youth focus, as young people are often familiar with such platforms. Furthermore, digital financial service providers can make use of youth-friendly delivery channels to market financial services. For example, the LienVietPostBank in Viet Nam (LVPB) started the marketing of its mobile wallet initially at universities as well as through the Viet Nam Women\u2019s Union which generated a distribution channel specifically for youth and women. Other FSPs have begun to collect deposits at schools or universities and places where youth are working (UNCDF 2015). Expansion of business funding platforms: Crowd funding, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending and venture capital financiers open a new channel of available funding for youth entrepreneurs, away from traditional financial institutions A recent UNCDF and UN Pulse Lab (2018) Big Data5 study on financial service usage undertaken in Cambodia demonstrates that youth have fewer low-value or passive savings accounts6 and tend to stay longer in the borrowing relationship with FSPs than older adults (UNCDF, 2018). Yet, despite being more loyal customers, youth entrepreneurs receive lower individual loans because they are perceived as high-risk borrowers. Based on such evidence, there is a strong business case and market need for FSPs to expand their services to young entrepreneurs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "41031005-ba46-48d1-85c5-fc76f928b54c": {"__data__": {"id_": "41031005-ba46-48d1-85c5-fc76f928b54c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-entrepreneurship-and-financial-inclusion-outlook-asean-and-saarc", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Youth Entrepreneurship and Financial Inclusion: Outlook for ASEAN and SAARC", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-entrepreneurship-and-financial-inclusion-outlook-asean-and-saarc", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7863d400088c606c15ebb1725b4c478725b52613d7503bd0a5444831bf435efb"}, "2": {"node_id": "11e8a02d-c8a1-482d-aa2d-df4d7d01ebcc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-entrepreneurship-and-financial-inclusion-outlook-asean-and-saarc", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a5ddc827e8e679ef4e83c297785486de952424b67824729d313771102d5aa4d5"}}, "hash": "706c7c91afa4cf80148b56a520dadddcc9e2e34cdba451852dda68e14a837cd7", "text": "WAYS TO IMPROVE YOUTH FINANCIAL INCLUSION AND CAPABILITY Removing barriers to youth financial inclusion can unlock significant growth and entrepreneurship opportunities in emerging ASEAN and SAARC markets, especially in the region\u2019s Least Developed Countries (LDCs).

What follows is a set of suggested solutions to improve youth financial inclusion and capability, including examples of digital finance and fintech solutions that have been effective in improving youth entrepreneurship and financial inclusion and that can be replicated in other Asian developing countries, as well as suggested regulatory measures and actions that may be taken by youth entrepreneurs. DIGITAL FINANCE AND FINTECH SOLUTIONS: Alternative credit scoring for youth entrepreneurship financing: Fintechs can analyse social media, mobile phone and transaction data, as well as conduct surveys to develop alternative credit scoring models that reduce collateral requirements. This Big Data can be applied to develop responsible financial viii ExEcutivE Summary entrepreneurs and opening new avenues of financing businesses (Gravesteijn 2014).13 Rather than funding the most profitable business ideas, these funding vehicles take into account the projects\u2019 social returns and innovativeness. Offering client-centric products and financial services that respond to the needs of youth: Since 2010 UNCDF has been actively working to increase youths\u2019 financial inclusion. With a specific emphasis on savings, UNCDF\u2019s YouthStart programme works with FSPs to pilot and roll out sustainable financial and non-financial services tailored to young people. For example, Finance Trust Bank in Uganda proposed a savings account developed specifically for youth and used technology to reach young clients at an early age. In Senegal, the PAMECAS developed a loan product for young entrepreneurs that integrates incorporates financial education and uses savings as collateral to minimize the risks associated with lending to such customers. The programme also triggered dialogue among policymakers on youth financial inclusion, particularly in Rwanda and in West Africa. Encouraging financial institutions to leverage technology for facilitating lending to youth in rural areas: 70 percent of the youth in CLM still live in rural areas and are employed in agricultural activities, and have low access to (digital) credit, savings and insurance, but are generally active mobile phone and internet users. Fintech can offer solutions, for example in the use of geotagging of farms for remote monitoring and evaluation and assessing the profitability of farmers based on input and output costs, thus helping financial institutions to shift from asset-based lending towards cash-flow based lending. Mobile banking can also enable young entrepreneurs in rural areas to develop new value-added products and services along the agro-food value chain (OECD, 2017). and/or locally sourced informal credit, and fintechs play a key role in facilitating this shift. P2P lending platforms active in Southeast Asia directly connect MSMEs looking for finance with a crowd of investors, allowing the MSME to choose the best offer made by potential investors.11 Another model is incubation and accelerator programmes that foster innovative start-up businesses offering blended finance and mentoring programmes at different stages of entrepreneurship. Promoting digital financial literacy and capability among young entrepreneurs: Fintechs increasingly incorporate learning and best-practice elements into products to increase financial literacy and capability among their customers. An example is Wave Money in Myanmar, which launched the first digital financial literacy app in Myanmar in collaboration with UNCDF. There are also digital education tools tailored to children, including mobile piggy banks such as Ernit and Bankaroo. Advancing youth social enterprise financing: One business area which is increasingly capturing the attention of youth in South and Southeast Asia is the concept of social business (Yunus, 2007) and social entrepreneurship (Nichols 2006:xiv; Lehner 2012).12 Social enterprises are involved in a diverse set of activities varying from microfinance and fair trade to agricultural cooperatives and increasingly also fintech solutions, sharing a commonality to pursue development goals through financially sustainable business models rather than grant-dependant activities. Social entrepreneurship programmes can offer training and funding opportunities that help young entrepreneurs find innovative business solutions to address sustainable development goals. Social businesses increasingly receive funds from impact investment and challenge funds to scale their operations as well as crowd funding and peer-to-peer lending platforms which are expanding the network of young ix ExEcutivE Summary FOR YOUTH ENTREPRENEURS Young entrepreneurs should network with social enterprises and entrepreneur associations to gain sufficient training in and exposure to entrepreneurship. Such institutions15 look to train, fund, connect, and empower youth entrepreneurs to find innovative solutions to social and business problems. Many FSPs employ project managers to specifically focus on providing financial and non-financial services to the youth customers. Young people can actively engage with such youth officers to understand the products and services offered by the FSPs and requirements to access them.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "24f5abd1-7820-4f81-9175-3d4640b2f0f0": {"__data__": {"id_": "24f5abd1-7820-4f81-9175-3d4640b2f0f0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-entrepreneurship-and-financial-inclusion-outlook-asean-and-saarc", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Youth Entrepreneurship and Financial Inclusion: Outlook for ASEAN and SAARC", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-entrepreneurship-and-financial-inclusion-outlook-asean-and-saarc", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "73df943ccd8bfcefa72373aab63bdc3675a7fee8b8074ef245eeebfbbfadc29f"}, "2": {"node_id": "f8d45c67-b7cf-4f60-9189-15a38f8ffe00", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-entrepreneurship-and-financial-inclusion-outlook-asean-and-saarc", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "032e05d039c5aa6b47a165a01735c2903154a4c6cdc7827b296b41cbbcae9e64"}}, "hash": "ae5d712a17ea8cf021a67a61ffec8cb1a4896a302f52bb332d14ca78893d13c9", "text": "Social media provides an excellent platform for advertising, growing, and sustaining a business for young entrepreneurs.

Youth-focused FSPs also provide financial education sessions to disclose clear and accurate product information to the young customers. Youth also have the right to register a complaint and seek timely resolution should there be any dispute with the financial institutions. FOR POLICYMAKERS AND REGULATORS Set ambitious targets for improving access to financial services among youth and young entrepreneurs under national financial inclusion strategies: Under the Maya Declaration,14 several Asian countries such as Malaysia, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal have already committed to advance youth financial inclusion in their national financial inclusion strategies. Collect demand and supply side data on the financing of youth-led micro and small enterprises for evidence-based policy making: This will help policymakers and FSPs to understand the barriers to youth financial inclusion and to design and deliver needs-based financial products and services. Encourage FSPs to partner with non-financial institutions such as telecom companies, education institutions and youth-serving organisations to improve youths\u2019 financial literacy and awareness of digital banking services: Delivering financial education digitally can improve the outreach of governments in their mission to improve financial inclusion. Furthermore, incorporating financial literacy, basic accounting, and business education into the secondary school curriculum can help to build the financial capabilities of younger people (UNCDF, 2015). Implement programmes such as those offering Individual Development Accounts (IDA) which can help youth to save for asset building or income-generating activities and provide them with financial literacy skills and business training. The IDA holders must participate in a programme for a period during which they save money for a specific goal. Every dollar saved in an IDA is matched by a participating public or private donor. At the end of the programme the youth can access the savings for a variety of asset building activities, including education and training, and income generating activities. x ExEcutivE Summary 1 South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) also referred to as South Asia in this study includes Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Maldives, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. 2 Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) also referred to as Southeast Asia in this study includes Brunei, Cambodia, Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore. 3 Excluding Singapore and Thailand where savings account dormancy is less than 10 percent. 4 Inactive accounts are defined as accounts that have had no deposits or withdrawals within the past 12 months. 5 Big Data refers to data sources that require new tools or methods to capture, curate, and process data in an efficient way. Big data can be characterized by the large volume of data, the wide variety of types of data, and the routine processes by which it is collected. In the financial service industry this includes, in particular, transaction data and historical savings and loan balances. 6 We refer to \u2018passive savings accounts\u2019 as those accounts with a total savings balance below US$5.

Though most of the countries in these regions experience rapid economic growth and have strong human capital in the form of youth, more than 50 percent of working-age people are engaged in vulnerable low-paid jobs and youth unemployment remains high with an increasing number of young adults reaching the working age (ILO, 2016). One way to generate decent employment and inclusive growth is to empower young entrepreneurs to innovate and respond to the needs of society. That is easier said than done, as besides the legal and regulatory environment, lack of access to finance is a major obstacle to youth entrepreneurship. Fulfilling the financial needs of young people can empower them to serve as innovators, fostering the economic prosperity of developing nations. This working paper focuses on youth entrepreneurship and youth access to formal financial services in South Asia and Southeast Asia, particularly focussing on Cambodia, Lao PDR and Myanmar (CLM). The study analyses youth entrepreneurship in South Asia and Southeast Asia using the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) survey data (Section 1), youth financial inclusion data, and the Global Findex database (Section 2). The analysis then dives deeper to examine youth financial inclusion in Cambodia, Myanmar and Lao PDR using FinScope consumer surveys (Section 3), followed by an analysis of the use of financial services using Big Data analysis from Cambodia (Section 4). Finally, the paper proposes recommendations for policy makers, FSPs and young entrepreneurs that can foster youth entrepreneurship and financial inclusion (Section 5). 1 yOuth ENtrEprENEurShip iN SOuth aSia aND SOuthEaSt aSia Figure 2: Youth Occupation in a selection of Asian countries (%) 02 YOUTH ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN SOUTH ASIA AND SOUTHEAST ASIA The 2016 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor Survey16 (GERA, 2017) finds that although youth and adults are equally optimistic about starting new ventures, the prevalence of entrepreneurial activities among youth is relatively low. With the exception of Indonesia, fewer than 15 percent of youth are self-employed in both South and Southeast Asia (Figure 2: Youth Occupation in a selection of Asian countries (%)). In both regions, fewer than 20 percent of new businesses are started by young entrepreneurs aged 18-24 years whereby the lack of formal employment represents a critical deciding factor in establishing a business for these entrepreneurs (GERA, 2017). The survey also finds that entrepreneurial intentions tend to be higher for developing economies that rely on subsistence agriculture and unskilled labour such as Cambodia, because there are fewer alternatives for people to generate income. One of the reasons for lower rates of entrepreneurship among youths compared to older adults is their increasing participation in tertiary education (GERA, 2017). For example, between 2004 and 2014 the enrolment of Cambodian youth in tertiary education increased from 5 percent to 20 percent and the rate of tertiary qualification attainment increased from 2 percent to 13 percent (OECD, 2017). This is a positive scenario given that investments in human capital not only increase job market opportunities but also generate better chances of accessing formal sources of finance for entrepreneurial activities. By way of example, according to the GEM survey, one third of entrepreneurs with a secondary or tertiary degree were able to secure business capital from formal financial sources, in comparison with only 5 percent of entrepreneurs with primary education in the Philippines.

Financial literacy in ASEAN and SAARC is generally low, with less than half of the adult population being able to measure fundamental concepts for financial decision-making such as basic numeracy, interest compounding, inflation, and risk diversification. In countries such as Cambodia, Viet Nam, Bangladesh, Nepal and Afghanistan, less than 25 percent of the population is financially literate (Klapper et al, 2015). A recent youth financial literacy study in Cambodia finds that only 26 percent of secondary school students had visited a bank or MFI, and enter the labour market early with limited awareness and understanding of formal financial services compared to those who will study longer, thus are subsequently forced to access informal sources of finance such as local money lenders. While lack of education can be seen as a major obstacle for youth in accessing formal financing for entrepreneurial pursuits, lack of confidence in one\u2019s business skills is also a major hindrance. Figure 3: % Youth Gap in Self-perception of Skills and Experience for Pursuing Business shows youth seem to be much less confident than adults about starting a new business. For example, in Cambodia 46 percent of the youth (aged 15- 30 years) are under-educated for their current occupations (OECD, 2017). As a result, employers find it difficult to fill job vacancies, while youth struggle in low-paid vulnerable and informal work activities. There is a lack of comprehensive skills and training government programmes for start-ups to support business plan development, management and access to capital. The gap in skills needs to be addressed by providing on-the- job training to youth and align training as per the needs of young farmers, SMEs and emerging sectors like agro-food, services and tourism (OECD, 2017). There are also strong differences in skills and levels of confidence about entrepreneurial abilities between genders. For example, in Cambodia half of the female workers are Figure 3: % Youth Gap in Self-perception of Skills and Experience for Pursuing Business Source: Global Entrepreneurship Monitor Survey, 2016 0 5 10 15 20 Singapore Malaysia Thailand Indonesia Philippines Viet Nam India Pakistan 3 yOuth ENtrEprENEurShip iN SOuth aSia aND SOuthEaSt aSia For example, while some financial institutions provide collateral free loans, these are limited and not designed for youth specifically. Most microfinance institutions limit loans to one year, which is not sufficient time for a young entrepreneur to get a business off the ground (UNCDF,2016). Likewise, some banks and MFIs provide education loans but require the parents who own collateral to act as guarantors, which still makes it difficult for youth from poor families to take advantage of these, even though they have the most urgent need. Furthermore, even if youth are offered business loans they often fear not being able to repay in the case of the business failing. In addition, some FSP staff have a negative bias against youth as clients, while others assume mass-market products should be sufficient to meet youth needs (UNCDF,2015).17 Under such circumstances it is more effective to combine youth finance with non-financial services such as financial literacy training and business development services (ILO, 2014; UNCDF, 2015). In the following sections, we focus on the youth gap in access to finance\u2014a major factor hindering youth entrepreneurship in South and Southeast Asia\u2014and identify a number of possible solutions. less than 6 percent knew the steps to open a bank account (Save the Children, 2014). There is a need for Children\u2019s Financial Literacy programmes that teach children the value of savings, and develop wider community understanding of financial literacy through children. However, besides some of the above-mentioned barriers, youths\u2019 lack of access to finance tends to be the biggest obstacle to entrepreneurship. As with the rest of the population, youth also need financial services to save money, insure against risks, and borrow at affordable interest rates to capitalize on business opportunities. However, young people are denied financial services due to lack of credit history, collateral and identity documents, lack of business skills and experience, and the higher transaction costs FSPs must bear on small loans. This results in youth accessing funds on unfavourable terms from informal financial sources and putting their business ventures at greater financial risks. Although there are a number of FSPs interested in serving youth, particularly in regard to securing future clientele, few understand the nuanced needs of this group or tailor services to their needs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3826ab01-07de-4fb5-9e04-2ced511aa36e": {"__data__": {"id_": "3826ab01-07de-4fb5-9e04-2ced511aa36e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-entrepreneurship-and-financial-inclusion-outlook-asean-and-saarc", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Youth Entrepreneurship and Financial Inclusion: Outlook for ASEAN and SAARC", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-entrepreneurship-and-financial-inclusion-outlook-asean-and-saarc", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d146e733f0e47dffe19ca76abbbd3ae3bd2172fba97e7ebaeab27250158e8028"}, "2": {"node_id": "093e08c5-0832-4175-9c75-bc0b3a39587f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-entrepreneurship-and-financial-inclusion-outlook-asean-and-saarc", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4e91ca9db1c61f010ebdb7bc98ae83b5b25c9b1392ea0c2f32ca3cf003315872"}}, "hash": "2c697d39517f6cf5ffb7c2bee15b9c19d8e8d44bf10975021c432a09f85fdf97", "text": "Figure 4: % Gender Gap in Self-perception of Skills and Experience for Pursuing Business Source: Global Entrepreneurship Monitor Survey, 2016 16 This survey examines the participation, attitude, and ambition of youth and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c123a61-b1e8-4bc2-9f93-0020c96d7df4": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c123a61-b1e8-4bc2-9f93-0020c96d7df4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-entrepreneurship-and-financial-inclusion-outlook-asean-and-saarc", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Youth Entrepreneurship and Financial Inclusion: Outlook for ASEAN and SAARC", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-entrepreneurship-and-financial-inclusion-outlook-asean-and-saarc", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6b6cf46bafe37a331ceceeca12ff55c0294ff7baa11790e0428cd8c006d3d8ff"}}, "hash": "6b6cf46bafe37a331ceceeca12ff55c0294ff7baa11790e0428cd8c006d3d8ff", "text": "adults towards entrepreneurial activity. 17 For example, a customer journey mapping in Viet Nam among young students found that they are increasingly downloading mobile money wallets and that they initially utilize them for making payments.

Southeast Asian youth on the other hand have a high savings rate of 61 percent, which is on par with the 58 percent savings rate among older adults.

Using digital identification19 for e-KYC, leveraging transactional data of young customers for assessing their credit-worthiness, and extending digital lending facilities can enable an increased uptake of credit among young borrowers. A digital identification database can further support the protection of young customers and help to increase the monitoring of over-indebtedness and multiple lending for the FSPs. For example, research in Malawi suggests that use of digital identification has increased loan repayment rates amongst risky borrowers (Findex, 2017). As discussed in Section 5, fintech firms are beginning to use social media, mobile phone usage, and e-commerce transactional data of customers to develop alternative credit scoring models, which can help in quick assessments and provide need- specific credit to the young entrepreneurs. On the policy and regulation side, under the Maya Declaration,20 Asian countries such as Malaysia, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal have committed to advance youth financial inclusion in their national financial inclusion strategies. These countries are developing policies aimed at enhancing financial literacy among young students, designing youth-specific financial products and services, and reaching out to youth to elevate their financial capabilities (AFI data- portal).21 India, Malaysia and Bangladesh are also actively advancing micro and small enterprises\u2019 access to finance by increasing their awareness of the availability of financial products, extending additional finances, and creating special platforms to provide support for debt-distressed money solutions for convenient access to low- cost savings accounts, payments, insurance and micro-loans. Mobile wallets may also offer convenient alternatives to informal savings as deposits can be made in relatively low and frequent amounts, mirroring the convenience of informal savings and mitigating some of the major barriers young customer may face at banks. In addition, youth-specific savings mobilization and financial inclusion targets could be set by policymakers to improve formal savings behaviour in low-income economies such as Afghanistan, Cambodia and Myanmar where only 3 to 4 percent of youth save formally. Between 2014 and 2017, youth propensity to save for entrepreneurial activities improved in both the ASEAN (+5 percentage points) and SAARC (+3 percentage points) regions. Simultaneously, it decreased significantly among youth in low-income economies such as Cambodia and Myanmar and improved by more than 10 percentage points in the middle-income economies of Thailand and Indonesia. Youth in Southeast Asia are more inclined to save for investing in business activities; nearly 20 percent of ASEAN youth save to start, operate or expand a farm or business compared to only 7 percent in South Asia. The share of youth borrowing any money has reduced between 2014 and 2017 from 40 to 34 percent of the youth population in South Asia and 50 to 47 percent in Southeast Asia. Figure 7b shows that less than 7 percent of young adults in both the regions borrow from formal financial institutions and more than 30 percent access informal sources. Furthermore, less than 4 percent of young people in these regions borrow money from formal financial institutions to start, operate, or expand a farm or business. This suggests that youth access to formal credit is constrained by", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5510dfac-0a8d-444f-9c43-f06a1815799f": {"__data__": {"id_": "5510dfac-0a8d-444f-9c43-f06a1815799f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-entrepreneurship-and-financial-inclusion-outlook-asean-and-saarc", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Youth Entrepreneurship and Financial Inclusion: Outlook for ASEAN and SAARC", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-entrepreneurship-and-financial-inclusion-outlook-asean-and-saarc", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fee8f9f87951999cfd1099a1a45398d5a9022988c2146e1a55e6fec57693923b"}, "3": {"node_id": "0f013887-235b-4d8c-bb1c-3683c81d3c82", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-entrepreneurship-and-financial-inclusion-outlook-asean-and-saarc", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "71b17c960cd1648638bf3365bf4d5779c8acd3d376a1a20e80db7d46af195822"}}, "hash": "8ced2369041d61a22dd1a031a280f27e95c2ab24258b6ce9a6496c1947c5aa30", "text": "factors including unavailability of documents required by FSPs, collateral and know your customer/anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) requirements, insufficient credit history and a 7 yOuth accESS tO FiNaNcE iN SOuth aSia aND SOuthEaSt aSia challenging than in developed Asian nations.

Such information can include biological information (i.e. photos, finger- prints etc.) and user behaviour. 20 The Alliance for Financial Inclusion\u2019s (AFI) Maya Declaration is the first global and measurable set of commitments by developing and emerging country policymakers to unlock the economic and social potential of the 2.5 billion poorest people through greater financial inclusion. 21 https://www.afi-dataportal.org 22 The Micro Units Development & Refinance Agency (MUDRA) of the Indian government is one such programme. 23 The FinScope survey is conducted to measure and profile the levels of access to and uptake of financial products/ services (both formal and informal) in a particular country, across income ranges and other demographics (FinScope, 2013, 2014,2015). 8 yOuth Gap iN FiNaNcial iNcluSiON YOUTH GAP ACCESS TO FINANCE IN CLM Across CLM, youth are less likely to have access to formal financial services such as savings, credit and insurance than older adults which constrains young people\u2019s ability to start or expand a business or farming activities. Limited access to finance could also result in youth dropping out of school or cause an enterprise to fail, and leaves youths more vulnerable to shocks such as poor health or other emergencies (OECD, 2017). The FinScope surveys found that nearly half of the youth population in Cambodia and Myanmar and one-third in Lao PDR are financially excluded (Figure 9: Access to Finance among Youth and Adults in CLM (%)a). The financial exclusion rate for youth is significantly higher than that of the general population. Cambodia (21 percent) has the highest youth gap in formal finance followed by Myanmar (11 percent) and Lao PDR (4 percent). Interestingly, the youth gap in informal finance is marginal (3 04 YOUTH GAP IN FINANCIAL INCLUSION IN CAMBODIA, LAO PDR AND MYANMAR YOUTH PROFILE Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar (CLM) have nearly 7 million young people aged 18- 24 combined, representing 13 percent of the total adult population of these countries, with Cambodia (24 percent) having the highest share of young people in its population, followed by Lao PDR (12 percent) and Myanmar (10 percent).

Young entrepreneurs save more than the overall youth population in CLM. They are also much more likely to save at formal financial institutions than older adults, with more than 50 percent saving formally in Lao PDR. These findings contradict the popular belief that young people do not save. Providing youth with better access to savings and enabling linked financial services such as digital payments and domestic remittances on savings accounts can greatly help FSPs to transition informal savings into formal deposits, which in turn can help the banking sector to lower the cost of capital. YOUTH GAP IN ACCESS TO CREDIT IN CLM Youth in CLM are less likely to borrow than older adults, and the youth gap in access to credit is highest in Cambodia (18 percent) compared with Lao PDR (6 percent) and Myanmar (13 percent). Less than 20 percent of youths borrow formally, nearly 10 percent engage in informal borrowing and more than two-thirds do not borrow at all and Myanmar indicates lack of capital from MFIs to offer to entrepreneurs starting small businesses (LYU and UNFPA, 2014) and limited percent), indicating that barriers exist primarily in the formal banking and non-banking sectors. Furthermore, FSPs in general are reluctant to serve young people and consider them \u2018unbankable\u2019 as they perceive that youth have lower levels of savings, lack collateral and documents required for AML/KYC procedures, and lack experience in business. As shown in Figure 9: Access to Finance among Youth and Adults in CLM (%)b, between 30 and 50 percent of young entrepreneurs do not have any form of financial access and rely on their own capital to finance their business. Accessing funds from local moneylenders at often exorbitant rates makes youth-led enterprises less profitable and less likely to remain sustainable over the long term.

As depicted by the red slices in Figure 11: Proportion of Cambodian Youth and Adults by their Formal Savings (%), 2015, savings mobilization in Cambodia remains a significant problem, with 70 percent of depositors not mobilizing savings beyond US$5. Savings mobilization remains a challenge, especially in rural areas outside Phnom Penh, where the rate of low-value passive savings accounts is about 29 percent higher than the capital city. Savings mobilization also varies by gender, with women being more likely to have passive accounts with a savings balance below $5 (70 percent) compared to men (55 percent). Interestingly, as demonstrated in Figure 12 by the larger yellow slices in the left chart; youth have significantly better savings account usage compared to the overall population. 05 YOUTH GAP IN FINANCIAL SERVICE USE IN CAMBODIA High levels of access to finance do not necessarily imply strong financial service usage. Nearly 22 percent of depositors in Cambodia, 30 percent in Lao PDR, and 38 percent in Myanmar are reported as inactive24 (Findex, 2017) and borrower exit rates25 of FSPs vary between 28 percent and 39 percent per annum (UNCDF, 2018). High rates of inactive or passive savings accounts26 and high borrower exit reduces the potential impact that financial services can have on inclusive growth and the economic empowerment of under-served segments such as women and youth. Therefore, the UNCDF and UN Pulse Lab Jakarta (2018) conducted a Big Data study on financial service usage examining the savings and loan mobilisation of around 2.3 million customers from four leading Cambodian FSPs27, covering over half of Cambodia\u2019s microfinance depositors Figure 12: Proportion of Cambodian Youth and Adults by their Formal Savings (%), 2015 Source: UNCDF and UN Pulse Lab Jakarta, 2018 * The pie charts show the distribution in terms of number depositors with passive (<$5), small ($5-100), medium ($100-$1000) and large total savings balances (1000$).

Moreover, the gender gap in savings is virtually absent, with young women having higher savings balances than young men ($177 on average) and similar rates of account use. These findings contradict the popular belief that youth save less or do not save at all. On the borrowing side, customers generally tend to have a short-term relationship with their lenders; 39 percent of the borrowers exited the microloan programme after the first year, and 78 percent of borrowers exited the loan scheme within three years. Among the group loan customers, exit rates are almost similar When mapping passive savings account from the year of opening the savings account (year 0) to the year when the account becomes inactive, we see that youth are 37 percent less likely to have passive accounts than older adults (>25 years) (Figure 13), meaning young depositors are more active savers than older depositors.

It provides a simple and convenient savings wallet via a smartphone app to access a wide variety of financial products, including low-cost savings accounts, overdraft loans, bill payments and micro-loans. The LVPB started the marketing of its product initially at universities as well as through the Viet Nam Women\u2019s Union which generated a distribution channel specifically for youth and women.

Advancing youth social enterprise financing: One business area which is increasingly capturing the attention of youth in South and Southeast Asia is that of the concept of social business (Yunus, 2007) and social entrepreneurship (Nichols 2006:xiv; Lehner 2012).37 Social enterprises are involved in a diverse set of activities varying from microfinance and fair trade, to agricultural cooperatives and increasingly also fintech solutions, and they all share a commonality to pursue development goals through financially sustainable business models rather than grant-dependant activities. Social entrepreneurship programmes can offer training and funding opportunities that help young entrepreneurs find innovative business solutions to address sustainable development goals. Social businesses increasingly receive funds from impact investment and challenge funds to scale their operations as well as crowd funding and peer-to-peer lending platforms which are expanding the network of young entrepreneurs and opening new avenues of financing businesses (Gravesteijn, 2014).38 Rather than funding the most profitable business ideas, these funding vehicles take into account the project social returns and innovativeness. Offering responsive, tailored youth-oriented products and financial services: Since 2010, UNCDF has been actively working to increase to reach uninsured customers, with phone technology being used to register and pay for services.30 FSPs are also experimenting with sending personalized and local language messages to mobile phones and social media to people with dormant savings accounts in Southeast Asia to improve savings mobilisation.31 Business Funding Platforms: Crowd funding, P2P and venture capital financiers open new channels of available funding for young entrepreneurs, away from traditional financial institutions and/or locally sourced informal credit, and fintechs have a key role in the facilitating of this shift. Peer-to- peer lending platforms directly connect MSMEs looking for finance with a crowd of investors, thus creating an avenue for mutually beneficial partnerships for growth. Such platforms undertake due diligence on each business listed on the platform and facilitates the finance agreement between the business and investors, charging a percentage of the amount loaned as a fee, in addition to having a bidding system that allows the MSME to choose the lowest interest rate offered by potential investors.32 Other fintech firms also combine peer-to-peer platforms and digitization of invoice financing, this represents another means by which cash-poor MSMEs can access the capital they need to grow.33 Another model, as demonstrated by four large Thai Banks, is that of incubation programmes. These foster innovative start-up businesses by offering blended finance and mentoring programmes at different stages of entrepreneurship. Digital Financial Literacy and Capability: The increase in availability of financial services to traditionally unserved markets naturally brings with it the challenge of financial literacy in an increasingly digital age. Indeed, many parties have an interest in increasing digital financial literacy, not least fintechs, which have an inherent interest in proper usage of their services. The Center for Financial Inclusion identifies 7 behaviourally-informed practices for effective financial capability interventions, including teachable moments, learning by doing, nudges, reminders, and default options, heuristics, 16 FiNtEch aND DiGital FiNaNcE SOlutiONS technology companies specialized in money transfers, etc.) who are interested in extending their clientele to young entrepreneurs lacking the skills or capital to develop their own businesses. This model targets youth aged 18 \u2013 30, living in peri-urban and rural areas of Senegal and provides them with a new economic opportunity as agents for digital financial services. The programme is also focused on developing youths\u2019 entrepreneurial skills through training and mentorship; supporting youth in expanding the types of services and products they offer in order to increase the profitability of their business; scaling up sustainable branchless and mobile financial services that reach the vulnerable communities in rural Senegal; and encouraging young people to contribute to increasing the number of ITC and digital financial services among young people. The programme also triggered dialogue among policymakers on youth financial inclusion. For example, in Rwanda the model to integrate financial and non-financial services for youth has been incorporated into the National Strategy of Financial Education as one worthy of replication and In West Africa, the BCEAO (Banque Centrale des Etats de l\u2019Afrique de l\u2019Ouest) has placed youth at the core of their regional financial inclusion strategy.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a2036b8e-1bd7-4ccb-8f23-b8023f19e6dd": {"__data__": {"id_": "a2036b8e-1bd7-4ccb-8f23-b8023f19e6dd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-entrepreneurship-and-financial-inclusion-outlook-asean-and-saarc", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Youth Entrepreneurship and Financial Inclusion: Outlook for ASEAN and SAARC", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-entrepreneurship-and-financial-inclusion-outlook-asean-and-saarc", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "52f5b7778b1bea9d3741862a1573899acb7e1bb619860f075850a330115eaa3a"}, "2": {"node_id": "7697f022-f44d-4d4a-a8a4-e2b2b7ec3919", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-entrepreneurship-and-financial-inclusion-outlook-asean-and-saarc", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e27bbc2837ecddb50d78461972544799bba9d4f2b27a2a6a42e5888e478ca66d"}}, "hash": "89cb2d46230a651b51dcd7929e2ec559ed0bdebc09ba30b55a63e3c3f64d804a", "text": "Leveraging technology for facilitating lending to youth in rural areas: 70 percent of the youth in CLM still live in rural areas and are employed in agricultural activities, and have low access to (digital) credit, savings and insurance, but are generally active mobile phone and internet", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "129057e1-c393-4732-a84a-0c2283a54166": {"__data__": {"id_": "129057e1-c393-4732-a84a-0c2283a54166", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-entrepreneurship-and-financial-inclusion-outlook-asean-and-saarc", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Youth Entrepreneurship and Financial Inclusion: Outlook for ASEAN and SAARC", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-entrepreneurship-and-financial-inclusion-outlook-asean-and-saarc", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6c6b71647764008e6994eaca3debc55c36debbce3731aca69c5e4be0d9303295"}, "3": {"node_id": "52e77aae-ba9e-4bfe-9ce9-c910728e7be2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-entrepreneurship-and-financial-inclusion-outlook-asean-and-saarc", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "301be50ea2574555262c0a17ad31832790cba4aaef693c317b5a7fef58dae7a2"}}, "hash": "c87e739061261c142639d8beb5aae4906975e5ff6895bbaa37c91bd3722b30c6", "text": "users. Fintech can offer solutions, for example in the use of geotagging of farms for remote monitoring and evaluation and assessing the profitability of farmers based on input and output costs, thus helping financial institutions to shift from asset-based lending towards cash-flow based lending. Mobile banking can also enable young entrepreneurs in rural areas to develop new value-added products and services along the agro-food value chain (OECD, 2017). youths\u2019 financial inclusion. To date, through YouthStart, a regional pilot in Sub-Saharan Africa, UNCDF has granted access to savings accounts to almost 830,000 young people (of which 43 percent are young women and girls), trained almost 792,000 youths in financial education; and provided loans to almost 210,000 young entrepreneurs (54 percent young women). These young clients have accumulated over $22 million in savings while the outstanding loan portfolio to young entrepreneurs is $29 million. With a specific emphasis on savings, YouthStart works with FSPs to pilot and roll out sustainable financial and non-financial services tailored to young people. For example, Finance Trust Bank in Uganda proposed a savings account developed specifically for youth and used technology to reach young clients at an early age. The FSP is using digital channels to help adolescent girls in Uganda access financial and nonfinancial services. With a target to reach up to 1,000 adolescent girls, the platform to date is being accessed by over 1,500 adolescent girls within only 3 months of being launched. It currently provides them access to an interactive mobile application in which they can access financial and reproductive health education modules and helps them to set their own savings goals through nudges that remind them to save on a daily basis. The application is linked to their savings account at a partner FSP so that they do not have to go to the branch to make a deposit. In Senegal, the partner FSP developed a loan product for young entrepreneurs that uses savings as collateral to minimize the risks associated with lending to such customers. In addition, since 2017, UNCDF YouthStart and MM4P programmes have been partnering with MNOs and local partners with expertise in building networks in Senegal to design, test, and manage a micro-franchisor network of kiosks to help young entrepreneurs seize economic opportunities in the digital financial services ecosystem. Micro-franchising is an approach that connects companies (i.e. mobile operators, 17 FiNtEch aND DiGital FiNaNcE SOlutiONS 29 Examples include Confirmu, Dianrong, Entrepreneurial Finance Lab and Lenddo, to name a few. 30 Examples of such services include BIMA and Stonestep. 31 A leader in this technology is Juntos, which offers a turn-key solution to FSPs and has had success in different markets globally. 32 An example of such a platform is Beehive, which is active in South-East Asia. 33 An example of such a product is Funding Circle. 34 Arnold and Rhyne (2016) 35 Gamification refers to adding elements common to games, such as collecting points, to non-game areas to promote more active participation in the product, in this case financial literacy learning materials. 36 Examples of other organizations with similar models include Kshetriya Gramin Financial Services, which uses a wealth management engine that uses data to create a financial plan for the household, helping customers to make informed financial decisions. 37 Social entrepreneurship resonates with views on sustainable development and advocates double or triple bottom line management which focuses on \u2018People, Planet, Profit\u2019 (Nichols, 2006; Yunus, 2007; Lehner, 2012).

Furthermore, incorporating financial literacy, basic accounting, and business education into the secondary school curriculum can help to build the financial capabilities of younger people (UNCDF, 2015). Implement programmes such as those offering Individual Development Accounts (IDA) which can help youth to save for asset building or income-generating activities and provide them with financial literacy skills and business training: The IDA holders must participate in a programme for a period during which they save money for a specific goal. Every dollar saved in an IDA is matched by a participating public or private donor. At the end of the programme the youth can access the savings for a variety of asset building activities, including education and training, and income generating activities. 39 The Alliance for Financial Inclusion\u2019s (AFI) Maya Declaration is the first global and measurable set of commitments by developing and emerging country policymakers to unlock the economic and social potential of the 2.5 billion poorest people through greater financial inclusion. 19 rEFErENcES REFERENCES Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Oliver Wyman (2017).

About the United Nations Volunteer Programme The United Nations Volunteers (UNV) programme contributes to peace and development through volunteerism worldwide. We work with partners to integrate qualified, highly motivated and well supported UN Volunteers into development programming and promote the value and global recognition of volunteerism. UNV is administered by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and reports to the UNDP/UNFPA/UNOPS Executive Board. About the United Nations Development Programme The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) partners with people at all levels of society to help build nations that can withstand crisis, and drive and sustain growth that improves the quality of life for everyone. On the ground in more than 170 countries and territories, UNDP offers a global perspective, as well as local insights to help empower lives and build resilient nations. The views expressed in this publication are those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of the United Nations, including UNDP, or the UN Member States. Youth Co:Lab, UNDP\u2019s Asia-Pacific youth entrepreneurship initiative, is positioning young people front and center in order to solve the region\u2019s most pressing challenges. Led by UNDP and Citi Foundation, in partnership with Baoshang Bank as well as network partners such as TechStars and MaGIC, the initiative aims to instigate, catalyse and sustain youth innovation by supporting the region\u2019s youth-led start-ups and social enterprises. This paper was made possible thanks to the generous support of BSB Baoshang Bank.

References 31 The focus of this Issue Brief is to explore to what extent youth volunteerism contributes to the economic empowerment of young people in Asia and the Pacific, due to the skills which may have been developed during volunteering. The Brief is a result of a desk study on volunteering and youth unemployment and underemployment throughout the region, accompanied by a number of interviews with current and former volunteers. The Issue Brief first breaks down the challenges of youth unemployment, underemployment and informality in Asia and Pacific, as well as rapidly changing skill requirements, which are barriers for young people entering the labor market. The Brief moves on to discuss the various forms of volunteering in the region, as well as the skills volunteers may develop during volunteering. The last section explores which of those skills are relevant to employability and labor market access for young people and discovers the benefits of volunteering for youth entrepreneurship. A number of recommendations are made on employability including but not limited to the importance of skill needs anticipation and skills development relevant for labor market access and entrepreneurship, followed by recommendations for volunteer serving organizations and volunteers themselves. These include, for example, to design volunteer programmes to empower women and expose them to new work environments and for volunteers to volunteer more strategically to expand social capital and networks, which are crucial for finding employment in markets dominated by informality. Executive Summary PAGE 4 ISSUE BRIEF Today\u2019s economic reality in Asia and the Pacific does not provide a thriving and supportive environment for the 750 million young people living in the region. A decline in long-term capital investment, the drop in productivity growth rates and unequal distribution of gains from growth has led to a severe lack of decent work in the region, marked by informality and poor work quality and conditions. This affects young people in particular, who find it difficult to transition from education into accessing the labor market. Finding decent employment is also hindered by the skills gap or \u2018skills mismatch\u2019 between the market needs and the expectations of employers, and the skills developed in traditional educational and training institutions on the other hand.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f094c9bc-9668-41db-a229-74196ffd8eed": {"__data__": {"id_": "f094c9bc-9668-41db-a229-74196ffd8eed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-volunteerism-and-skills-development-economic-empowerment-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Youth Volunteerism and Skills Development for Economic Empowerment in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-volunteerism-and-skills-development-economic-empowerment-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "378b5f53762dd10479c616edae3a986fbb1c7c71dc7433211ee498ef8096feeb"}, "2": {"node_id": "f81bdf52-1c5e-4a02-bce6-1c7c21d1640c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/youth-volunteerism-and-skills-development-economic-empowerment-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eaab1e26ca5f05eab65804a434c0200e517c11dbb0d32ac5b1d412a4d1671519"}}, "hash": "69c7442ea560288d0fb489ab9888965b89330086face8c5ccab4c910bb556356", "text": "Studies suggest that the impact of prolonged unemployment has lasting effects on young people, especially on productivity and revenue on a long-term scale.

Countries can only capitalize on demographic changes when targeted approaches across relevant sectors are implemented. Scaled and sector-specific policy and decision-making is important with regards to the 2030 Agenda, which depicts a global vision for sustainable development requiring a translation into action at the national level. Youth-employment focused policy is a key part of this picture, both for national policies and the programmes of international organizations. Given the increasingly limited resources available to these actors, understanding the underlying drivers of the challenges to development becomes an urgent need. The reason for this study and Issue Brief is to provide an overview into this important context of youth unemployment across the Asia and the Pacific under the perspective of volunteerism and skills development. In order to respond to the economic challenges and to move towards evidence-based approaches, development programmes focus more and more on skills development. Skill building is generally viewed as a device to improve the efficacy and contribution of labor to overall production. Individuals with more sophisticated professional skills are more qualified and tend to be viewed as workers that contribute more significantly to the economy. However, skill development can also be an instrument to empower the individual. \u2018Skills anticipation\u2019 examines how labor markets are developing and, consequently, how jobs, skills and learning needs are changing. Anticipating contemporary and future skill needs helps individuals understand what type of education and training to follow and enterprises to identify the skills they need. Policy-makers can therefore formulate informed decisions to adapt education and training systems to new skills in demand. Training programmes and volunteer projects are seen as offering the opportunity to develop new skills and build capacity, as well as try new vocations and gain experience. Current formal volunteer programmes, such as the Australian Volunteers for International Development programme, tend to list economic empowerment and valuable work experience as part Introduction YOUTH VOLUNTEERISM AND ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT PAGE 5 of their aims. However, impact assessment of such programmes is often conducted on a short-term and self-reported basis. In Asia and the Pacific, there is a severe lack of scientific studies on the development of skills through volunteer projects and to what degree volunteers might find employment faster or easier than people who do not volunteer. However, volunteering is widely spread in cultures and societies across the Asia-Pacific region, with high degrees of informal volunteering in local communities and religious contexts. The analysis in this document is based on literature review, journals, reports and research, including publications by the International Labor Organization (ILO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Volunteers programme (UNV). The research was further enhanced by a number of interviews with UN Volunteers and volunteers from other organizations from Asia and the Pacific. The scope of the analysis is limited in terms of geographic dimension to the sub-regions of East Asia, South Asia, South-East Asia and the Pacific. The specific challenges to access decent work for young people differ widely across the region which includes industrialized economies, for example Japan, Korea, China, Singapore and Australia, as well as low and middle income countries (LMICs) with emerging economies, such as Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia, where vulnerable and informal employment still dominate the labor market. This group also includes least developed countries (LDCs), for example Cambodia, Laos, or Vanuatu, for which labor policies remain crucial for their overall development. To contextualize the thematic of this Issue Brief, volunteerism is defined as \u201ca wide range of activities, including traditional forms of mutual aid and self- help, formal service delivery and other forms of civic participation, undertaken of free will, for the general public good and where monetary reward is not the principal motivating factor\u201d (UN Resolution 56/38, Recommendations on Support for Volunteering). To complement this definition, the ILO Technical Experts Group proposes the definition of volunteer work as \u201cunpaid non-compulsory work; that is, time individuals give without pay to activities performed either through an organization or directly for others outside their own household\u201d (ILO, 2011). According to these definitions, internships, military service, as well as free work in family business or care do not qualify as volunteer work, though a large majority of young women and men across Asia and the Pacific carry out such types of free work on a regular basis or as a main occupation.
