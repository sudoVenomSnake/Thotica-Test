In addition, the approach taken in this report may be replicated by other country agencies. METHODS The Systematic Conservation Planning (SCP) framework was followed to design the analysis. Its goal is to develop cost effective networks of protected areas that represent and maintain biodiversity. This project used the decision support tool Marxan and one of its user interfaces, CLUZ, to select additional conservation areas that met (KBAs) conservation targets. These targets were developed in close collaboration with KNPS and methods and results were discussed in a workshop in Seoul, Korea. The project was implemented through three main activities: 1) data collection; 2) assessment of the current coverage of Korea\u2019s protected areas network through a gap analyses; and 3) proposal of areas for expansion based on a target based spatial prioritisation analysis. iii KEY MESSAGES \u25cf The results of the terrestrial selected scenarios show that, depending on the target scenario, an area between 17.3% and 46.4% of Korea\u2019s total terrestrial and inland water areas is needed to meet the set of pre-defined conservation targets while ensuring ecological representation of sites and features important for biodiversity. \u25cf At the time when this report was prepared there was not enough high resolution data to conduct a thorough analysis for the expansion of the protected area network in coastal areas. A preliminary solution that covers 10 % of this area is however proposed with the data available. \u25cf The analyses proposes solutions for expanding the boundaries of Korea\u2019s current terrestrial protected area network improving the representation of biodiversity, covering important sites while enhancing connectivity, generally avoiding high levels of agricultural activities and areas of high human population density. \u25cf This report has highlighted areas where the presence of globally threatened species has been confirmed and identified areas of high selection frequency. Some of these areas are not within designated protected areas or existing Key Biodiversity Areas. These areas need further assessment and could be candidates for new Key Biodiversity Areas under the KBA standard approved by IUCN Council in 2016. \u25cf In addition to expanding the protected area network to ensure adequate representation of biodiversity, there are many other attributes that are crucial to achieving a well-functioning network, that were not considered in this analyses for example, effective management, connectivity between protected areas, equity and consideration of the contribution of other effective area based conservation measures to the meeting biodiversity targets. \u25cf While the results presented here can inform future steps and decisions on how to meet national and international conservation targets, a wider stakeholder consultation is needed to prioritise conservation actions and test further alternatives for protected area expansion. Implementation, monitoring and evaluation of actions will be a crucial step in completing a full conservation planning process. 1 1. Introduction The Protected Planet Report was originally conceived as an assessment of progress towards global targets for protected areas (Bertzky et al., 2012, Juffe-Bignoli et al., 2014a) and since its inception has focused principally on assessing the status of implementation of the global Aichi Biodiversity Target 11, one of the 20 global biodiversity targets agreed by 193 countries in 2010 as part of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2010-2020 (CBD, 2010). In 2014, following recommendations from the first Asia Parks Congress (IUCN, 2014), the Asia Protected Planet Report was released. The aim was to assess progress towards the achievement of Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 at a regional level by focusing on 24 Asian countries (Juffe- Bignoli et al., 2014b). In addition to the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, most countries have their own national biodiversity targets which may or may not be aligned with the global Targets. Although the CBD recommends that national and global biodiversity strategies and actions plans are aligned, some countries chose to develop national targets that are stricter than the global ones, and focus on addressing specific national issues, or other international obligations. The Protected Planet National Technical Series is a new concept under the Protected Planet Report initiative which aims to support decisions on protected area expansion at the national scale by assessing progress towards global biodiversity targets, while also informing implementation of national targets. Thus, the use of national biodiversity and land use datasets and the direct involvement of national protected area agencies in the inception, development and key messages of the report is a fundamental part of the process. 2 1.1.

This includes, but is not restricted to Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 of the Convention on Biological Diversity and relevant national biodiversity targets. The geographical scope of this project is the Republic of Korea terrestrial territory, and territorial seas which span from the coast to 12 nautical miles from the Korean shoreline (Figure 1.1). Marine areas beyond 12 nautical miles were not considered because of the lack of appropriate high resolution marine biodiversity data in such areas (see Section 3.1.1 for more information). Figure 1.1. Project extent including terrestrial areas and coastal areas (0-12 nautical miles from the Korean shoreline) of the Republic of Korea. 3 The Protected Planet National Technical Series is a desktop based analysis that uses biodiversity information and other relevant available data on the Republic of Korea to inform future decisions on biodiversity. The information used in this report was directly provided by ministries and country agencies and did not involve field work or collection of primary data. In collaboration with KNPS, targets of protection for biodiversity were defined and used to evaluate potential areas for expansion of the current Korean protected area network. The report ends with a spatial prioritisation analysis, the results of which can help to inform decisions at the national level. However, such decisions are complex, require wide stakeholder consultation, consideration of national policy frameworks and cross-agency cooperation, all of which were outside the scope of this project. Nevertheless, the results presented here may be used by the relevant Korean agencies to inform such processes and ultimately to build consensus on actions to improve biodiversity protection in the Republic of Korea. In addition, the approach taken in this report may be replicated by other country agencies. 1.2. OVERALL APPROACH This report is structured in five parts. Section one sets the aim and scope of the project as well as the overall approach. The current protected area network of the Republic of Korea is introduced in Section 2. Section 3 describes the methods used to collect spatial data, conduct a protected area gap analyses and propose areas for protected area expansion. Results of applying this methodology are presented in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 provides some conclusions and recommendations. Systematic Conservation Planning (SCP) The Systematic Conservation Planning (SCP) framework was followed to design the analysis (Margules and Pressey, 2000). Systematic conservation planning is an operational model for identifying and implementing priority areas for conservation. It is a long-term process that combines a spatial conservation prioritisation with approaches for developing an implementation strategy with relevant stakeholders. SCP is widely regarded as a comprehensive and scientifically sound method to identify gaps in protected area networks and priorities for expansion (Margules and Pressey, 2000; Sarkar et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2007; Moilanen et al., 2009). Its goal is to develop cost effective networks of protected areas that represent and maintain biodiversity. It uses spatially explicit targets, and considers irreplaceability and complementarity as core concepts in its framework (Box 1.1.). Pressey and Bottrill (2009) defined 11 non-sequential key stages in conservation planning (Figure 1.2.). SCP has been used to assess priorities for protected area expansion in various countries, for example in South Africa (Driver et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2008), Madagascar (Kremen et al., 2008), the Solomon Islands (Game et al., 2011), Indonesia (Syakur et al., 2012), and the English Channel (Delavenne et al., 2011). A recent review of how spatial biodiversity analyses can support the implementation of Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 found that, during the period 2010-2012, a total of 705 scientific articles directly relevant to spatial conservation decision making were published, 207 of which included information potentially relevant for spatial conservation resource allocation (Kullberg and Moilanen, 2014). 4 Box 1.1 Key concepts of Systematic Conservation Planning Representation: To be representative a protected area network must contain the range of biodiversity found in the planning region. This can be measured using any appropriate and available spatial distribution data including presence/absence and probability of occurrence maps (Sarkar et al., 2006). Persistence: Conservation plans must aim to maintain biodiversity through time by accounting for ecological, evolutionary and socio-political processes (Sarkar et al., 2006). Complementarity: Systematic conservation planning seeks to identify a complementary set of priority areas that best meet the proposed goals, rather than consider the values of each priority area on a one-to-one basis. Irreplaceability: This is a measure of the likelihood that an area will be required as", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "34fc96f0-7eae-431f-9f6f-4308f9eed553": {"__data__": {"id_": "34fc96f0-7eae-431f-9f6f-4308f9eed553", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/protected-planet-national-technical-series-republic-korea", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Protected planet national technical series : Republic of Korea", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/protected-planet-national-technical-series-republic-korea", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "506c158e0468dc9ca04f71ddf32b854f2187d70c0116e89beb27fda55670a75d"}, "3": {"node_id": "66dfbcad-af18-4db3-89f6-f038d0bd084f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/protected-planet-national-technical-series-republic-korea", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "61414a38fa4f7292e4ea833ee5abbbd8d853490ab23ebbd7b896236e08ca0197"}}, "hash": "be767fa2b1e0011e2c53e3440061b4f65d908862d139962631bb43cf4fa72156", "text": "part of a system that achieves a set of representative targets, or the extent to which the options for achieving the set of targets are reduced if the area is unavailable for conservation (Ferrier et al., 2000). 1.

Stage Description This project 1 Scoping and costing of the planning process The scope of the project is clearly defined (see Section 1.1) but the project did not include an assessment of the cost of the planning process. 2 Identifying and involving stakeholders This project was developed with the Korea National Park Service. A workshop was organised to involve a wider range of stakeholders. 3 Describing the context for conservation areas Section 2 of this report sets such context and section 4.1. Assesses the current coverage of the national protected area network. 4 Identifying conservation goals Korea\u2019s CBD National Biodiversity Strategy 2014-2018 and CBD 5th National Report were used to inform the definition of conservation goals. 5 Collecting data on socio- economic variables and threats In this project, such data include spatial information on population density, developed areas and agricultural areas, among others. 6 Collecting data on biodiversity and other national features Underpinning this project are national and global biodiversity datasets collected from governmental agencies and international NGOs. 7 Setting conservation objectives This project defined specific conservation targets for all conservation features selected (see section 3.3.1). 8 Reviewing current achievement of objectives In this project the existing progress towards all targets and overall goals were also assessed in section 4.2.2. 9 Selecting additional conservation areas In this project spatial prioritisation techniques and decision support tools were used to inform the selection of additional conservation areas. No decision is made in this report on which areas need to be specifically selected as these decisions are out of the scope of the project and part of a more complex nationally driven stakeholder consultation process. 7 2. The Protected Area network of the Republic of Korea The Republic of Korea is a peninsula surrounded by around 3,000 islands and is located between lat. 33\u00b0 - 43\u00b0 and long. 124\u00b0 - 132\u00b0. The country has 100,284 km2 of territorial lands and 86,891 km2 of territorial seas. Sixty-three percent of the terrestrial part of Korea is covered by mountain ranges, including Baekdudaegan, which is the largest terrestrial protected area in the country. Korea has a long history of conserving nature as part of hunting sites, gardens, and royal tombs of kings and noble families. Sacred sites and religious places have also historically been conserved by local communities, although few of these sites survive following the Korean War in the 1950s that devastated much of the Korean peninsula. 8 The first World Conference on National Parks in Seattle, the United States, in 1962 was a turning point for protected areas in Korea.

This was the first in Asia. It then undertook improvements based on the recommendations and findings of this study (IUCN-WCPA, 2011). Some of the key recommendations for further improving management include: 1. Move from species to ecosystems 2. Strengthen system planning 3. Integrate management 4. Improve local community relations 5. Interact with more interest groups 6. Improve regional integration 7. Enhance staff effectiveness and satisfaction 8. Diversify funding base 9.

The main threats and management issues identified at the site level were inappropriate behaviour by visitors, illegal harvests, and conflict with landowners (Heo and Kwon, 2012). Large-scale infrastructure projects such as dams and highways can cause isolation of, or encroachment on, protected areas. These pressures also act as barriers to further expansion of the protected area system. An associated threat, identified at the system level, is the \u2018edge effect\u2019 suffered by many protected areas without buffer zones. Other major problems include fire and disturbance dynamics, invasive species, climate change, and visitor impacts (IUCN et al., 2009). These are issues that demand cooperation between all stakeholders. Other issues identified include poaching pressure and illegal fishing, which are considered to be minor problems within protected areas in the Republic of Korea. 11 3. Methodology The project comprised three main activities which this chapter describes: 1) data collection (section 3.1); 2) assessment of the current coverage of Korea\u2019s protected areas\u2019 network through a gap analysis (section 3.2.); and 3) proposal of areas for protected area expansion based on a spatial prioritisation analysis (section 3.3.). 12 3.1. DATA COLLECTION The aim of this activity was to gather spatial data to conduct a protected area gap analysis and to design and run the spatial prioritisation. The data compilation focused on obtaining data on conservation features, conservation areas, and threats and constraints to biodiversity protection (Figure 3.1). Conservation features data consisted of spatial data on the location of species, ecosystems, land forms and geological features of conservation importance. Conservation areas included currently designated protected areas, Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs, a subset of Key Biodiversity Areas), and other relevant areas identified by the Korean governmental agencies. Data on land use, population density and other factors that might conflict with biodiversity protection were also collected analyses. Figure 3.1. Main types of information collected for the gap analysis and spatial prioritisation analysis. During data collection, national datasets were prioritised over global datasets. When no data was available at the national level, the use of global datasets was assessed. The resolution of the data was the primary reason for use or rejection of a global dataset. This ensured that the datasets used were of sufficient spatial resolution to inform decisions at the national level. The data collection phase ran from February 2015 to July 2015. Tables 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 summarise the datasets selected to conduct the protected areas gap analysis and the spatial prioritisation exercise. 3.1.1. Conservation features In this report the word \u2018conservation features\u2019 is used to refer to species, habitats and any other biogeographical features considered in the analyses. Similarly, the word \u2018amount\u2019 is used to refer to quantity of any of these conservation features. This mirrors the terminology used in the softwares Marxan and CLUZ, used to carry out the target based spatial prioritisation analyses (see section 3.3.). The spatial data on conservation features specifically included species, ecosystems, and geological data. Not all datasets compiled were included in the spatial analyses. For example, national data on the spatial location and conservation value of species and vegetation types were used instead of the global datasets. The global Red List of Threatened Species distribution ranges, which were mapped at a global level, were not used, but the Red List category, assigned through the Red List risk assessment processes (IUCN, 2012), was linked to the national data to identify those biodiversity features that were also of global importance. In total 1,533 different conservation features were selected (Table 3.1). For example, the species dataset provided information on 543 species of national conservation value including amphibians, birds, fishes, insects, mammals, plants, reptiles, and spiders. It specified whether a species was considered threatened at a national level and whether it was an endemic or rare species. The Vegetation types dataset included 325 vegetation types of five different classes of conservation importance assigned by the Ministry of Environment. Similarly, the dataset Geographic features included information on 360 geological and geographical features identified as in need of conservation by the Ministry of Environment. These features consist of caves, sand beaches, cliffs and water falls, and are categorized under two conservation classes: conservation class I (strict conservation is required) or conservation class II (conservation is required).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "26bcddb8-d426-4c2a-89e6-124f7d435e12": {"__data__": {"id_": "26bcddb8-d426-4c2a-89e6-124f7d435e12", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/protected-planet-national-technical-series-republic-korea", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Protected planet national technical series : Republic of Korea", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/protected-planet-national-technical-series-republic-korea", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a4401c05886a0a5fedcf1d10dd3a53a4e306c1ce4252d00181228de6e51a3b2a"}, "2": {"node_id": "83070148-6340-41be-8050-de31650a17b3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/protected-planet-national-technical-series-republic-korea", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "778dc3079c8ff9bcac55a092aab6e7ab9c55e7ec56d2322abfe52433428608f5"}}, "hash": "8edfec718e22376e0d32b7a60104eef66f711c0d13b14b4b298723efdc1a4ac6", "text": "Threats and constraints G Population density G Land cover G Fisheries Conservation areas G Protected Areas G Key Biodiversity Areas G Other areas Conservation features G Species G Habitats and ecosystems G Geological features 13 13 Table 3.1.

Conservation areas The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA; IUCN and UNEP-WCMC. 2015) was used to consider all protected areas designated and reported to UNEP-WCMC in the Republic of Korea. Protected areas provided with no boundaries (point records) were excluded from the analyses. Therefore, the analyses did not include all protected areas in the Republic of Korea as described in Table 2.1 as there was no data available for some designated sites at the time of the analysis. In total 504 protected areas from the WDPA were considered. In addition, a total of 599 sites of Forest Genetic Resources Reserves were added to the dataset for analysis. These sites, which were not included in the WDPA, are considered as designated protected areas.

PROTECTED AREAS GAP ANALYSES Knowing where protected areas are located, their management objectives, and the diversity and quantity of species and ecosystems they protect, is fundamental to identifying gaps, and to inform options for improvement of the network. The protected areas gap analysis consisted of measuring the extent of habitats and number of species (conservation features) within the existing protected area network using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software.

EXPANDING KOREA\u2019S PROTECTED AREA NETWORK Potential areas for expansion of protected areas were identified through a spatial prioritisation analyses. In collaboration with stakeholders, a set of conservation targets were defined and tested through target scenarios using conservation planning decision support tools and software. Stakeholders were consulted on the targets set and the preliminary results. The analyses were re-run incorporating stakeholder input and portfolios of proposed protected areas networks that met the conservation targets were selected. Finally, the achievement of conservation targets under each proposed network was assessed. 3.3.1. Defining conservation targets Setting targets involves determining the number of species, species\u2019 assemblages, ecological communities, and extent of ecosystems that should be included in the network of protected areas. These targets should be set based on local expertise and the best available data and be influenced by key concepts in systematic conservation planning (see Box 1.1.). In this report the term \u201camount\u201d is used to refer to how much (i.e. square kilometres of habitat, number of species) of each of these elements of biodiversity targets were set using the datasets compiled in the data collection phase (see Section 3.1.) and by considering the importance, at the national and global level, of biodiversity, while aiming to achieve an adequate representation of biodiversity. Approach to define targets The Korea\u2019s CBD National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP; Ministry of Environment of the Republic of Korea 2014a) and the Fifth National Report to the CBD (Ministry of Environment of the Republic of Korea 2014b) were reviewed to inform target-setting. References to habitats and species identified as national and international priorities in these reports were compiled. In addition, the level of importance assigned by the Government of Korea to the different datasets was used to inform the targets. Targets were assigned to all conservation features considered important and were refined through discussions with KNPS (see Table 3.4.). To assess the performance of different spatial configurations, and determine the total area needed to meet the conservation targets a series of target scenarios were developed. For each successive scenario, conservation targets were increased, ranging from an improvement in existing representation, to inclusion of all relevant conservation features (see Appendix 2 for more details on these scenarios). These conservation target scenarios were tested running a spatial prioritisation analyses (see section 3.3.2) and discussed with relevant stakeholder to agree on a final set of selected targets and scenarios (Table 3.4). Stakeholder consultation Involving local stakeholders is fundamental for the success of any conservation planning exercise. Two meetings were organised during the project to seek stakeholder input. Although the meetings carried out in this project were fundamental to design the analyses and discuss the results, a broader stakeholder consulation workshop would be needed to define and implement actions on the ground.

Setting the spatial prioritisation analyses Decision support tools The decision support tool Marxan and one of its user interfaces, CLUZ, were used to select additional conservation areas that met the conservation targets set in each of the scenarios (see Box 3.1). Spatial planning software and decision support tools usually require input data to be formatted in a specific way to produce the desired outputs. CLUZ and Marxan work by dividing the planning region into a series of planning units, listing the distribution of the conservation features found in each planning unit, setting targets for the amount of each feature to be included in the conservation landscape and using computer software to identify portfolios of units that best meet the targets. Box 3.1 Marxan and CLUZ Marxan is a decision support tool for conservation planning, developed by the University of Queensland and extensively used in spatial prioritisation exercises with over 2,600 individuals and 1,500 organisational users in 110 countries (Watts et al., 2009). Marxan is designed to resolve the \u201cminimum set problem\u201d when designing a reserve network or solving a conservation planning issue. This problem arises when there are a great number of potential sites and manual calculation of the best options is highly complex. MARXAN software runs simulated annealing algorithms to identify near-optimal sets of sites for meeting targets for each conservation feature at the lowest possible cost (Possingham et al., 2000; Ball et al., 2009). Cost may refer to area, financial costs, social cost, environmental cost, or level of threat. CLUZ was developed by the University of Kent with support from UNEP-WCMC (Smith RJ, 2015). It is an open source user interface of the software Marxan that can be integrated into the QGIS software. It can be used for on-screen planning and also acts as a link to the Marxan conservation planning software. Marxan and CLUZ are not the only software available for conservation planning. Zonation, for example, is another widely used and publically available decision support system for spatial conservation planning (Moilanen et al., 2005; Moilanen, 2007). Zonation differs from other spatial prioritisation software in that it does not require the setting of conservation targets, instead trade-offs are incorporated into the model through the prioritisation or weighting of features.

Zonation produces a single hierarchical prioritisation which ranks all cells based on their conservation value. This is accompanied by a performance curve which represents the performance of the reserve network at protecting the defined conservation features at different levels of landscape removal (for more information see http://cbig.it.helsinki.fi/ software/zonation). 20 Steps to run the spatial prioritisation analyses The terrestrial and coastal analyses were run separately due to the differences in quality and scale of the marine and terrestrial data, and to ensure adequate representation of biodiversity features across the different biomes. The steps followed are described in Figure 3.3. The terrestrial and coastal areas of Korea were divided in hexagonal planning units (PU) of 2.5 km2. Each PU was labelled either as terrestrial (including inland waters), coastal or terrestrial/coastal when the hexagon was present in both biomes. Hexagons were chosen instead of squares as they produce more efficient and less fragmented portfolios (Nhancale and Smith, 2011). Figure 3.3. Main steps followed to run the spatial prioritisation analyses in each of the target scenarios using CLUZ/Marxan. The amount of each conservation feature in each PU was calculated using GIS software (ArcGIS desktop) and the previously defined targets (see 3.3.1) were assigned through CLUZ. The data collected for the coastal analyses were not sufficient to conduct a comprehensive spatial prioritisation analysis. Nevertheless, a preliminary analysis was completed to inform further decisions on the key gaps. The results of the coastal assessment are available in Appendix 2. Focusing on the terrestrial analyses for which there were enough data to conduct comprehensive analyses, nine terrestrial target scenarios (TS) with different increasing targets were developed. The aim was to test different spatial configurations for conservation features found in terrestrial and inland water areas that would inform stakeholder consultations and target refinement (see section 3.3.1). For each of the scenarios four different settings were tested: Setting 1 \u2013 No areas locked in or excluded. Setting 2 \u2013 Current protected areas locked in. Setting 3 - Current protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas locked in. Setting 4 \u2013 Current protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas locked in. Areas where more than 60% of a planning unit is occupied by developed areas, bare grounds, artificial water bodies, artificial grasslands, or agricultural areas are excluded. Depending on the settings assigned to each target scenario, each planning unit was classified under one of three different status: 1) Conserved (locked in): planning units that needed to be included in the proposed network (e.g. existing protected areas); 2) Available: planning units that might be available for protected area expansion (e.g. undeveloped land); 3) Excluded (locked out): planning units that are or might not be available for protected area expansion (e.g. highly developed areas, croplands).

Cost may refer to the area of that planning unit, financial costs of the planning unit, or level of threat. Population density was used to assign a cost to each planning unit. To reduce the total cost of the proposed network, the Marxan algorithm, would favour planning units with low population density, therefore avoiding potential conflicts related to densely populated areas. Another important decision when setting the spatial prioritisation analyses in Marxan is the use of the Boundary Length Modifier (BLM) variable. This variable, is used to determine how much emphasis should be placed on minimising the overall reserve system boundary length. Increasing the BLM value will produce a more compact reserve system, while decreasing it will deliver a more dispersed solution. The method recommended in Game et al.

For example, a planning units that is selected 999 times in 1,000 runs should be considered very important for meeting the conservation targets under the pre-defined conditions of the scenario. 3.3.3. Assessing the achievement of targets The aim of the spatial prioritisation analyses was to identify a portfolio of sites or proposed conservation network that meets the conservation targets at a minimum cost. Due to the exclusion of some areas where land use could potentially conflict with the establishment or expansion of protected areas, some targets will only be partially met or not met. The degree to which targets are not meet depends on 1) the tolerance settings in Marxan; 2) specific spatial constraints defined in the settings. Tolerance refers to the extent to which Marxan considers a target to be met. In some cases, stakeholders may accept a tolerance lower than 90%. This requires careful assessment of which features have been excluded, to what extent, and whether this is acceptable for the actors involved. For example, if a target for a given conservation feature is to select 100 km2 of it and the tolerance is 95%, the target will be considered as met if the result captures 95 km2 or more. For some conservation features it might not be possible to fully meet the targets even with high tolerances. For, example a conservation target for a specific conservation feature might be to protect 10% of its known range. However, due to specific spatial constraints defined in the settings (e.g. exclude all developed areas and agricultural areas), it may only possible to conserve a limited amount below 10%. The achievement of the targets for each of the conservation features was assessed by comparing the amount included in the proposed network to the target amount assigned in the settings of the analyses. In addition, those conservation features for which targets were not met were identified and listed (See section 4.2.2 and Appendix 2). 3.4. CAVEATS Any spatial prioritisation analysis is subject to data limitations that have an impact on the quality and comprehensiveness of the outputs. These limitations include, but are not restricted to, lack of data, issues related to the quality of the data, or outdated data. Other potential issues include low resolution of data, lack of comprehensiveness, or inappropriate scale for the scope of the project. The analyses presented in this report did not use Species Distribution Models (SDM) to predict the presence of species of conservation concern in areas of suitable habitat (Elith and Leathwick, 2009). SDM reduces the probability of commission (false positives) or omission (false negatives) errors. Instead, confirmed occurrences of species through point data were used. Thus, the analyses might be biased to areas where there has been more data collection. The use of habitats maps such as vegetation types, forests, or tidal flats might in part reduce this bias as they can be considered as proxies of suitable habitats for some species. The lack of a high quality marine and coastal biodiversity data arose as one of the major issues for the analyses. Due to this constraint the analysis was restricted to Korea\u2019s territorial seas (from the coast to 12 nautical miles). In addition, the coastal data used consisted only of seaweed and sea grass occurrence points, tidal flats habitats, some geographic features and the pre-defined coastal value map which was low resolution. Therefore the coastal analyses and results need to be taken with extreme caution as other potentially important biodiversity features have not been considered. 22 23 4. Results 4.1. PROTECTED AREAS GAP ANALYSES According to the data stored in the WDPA in October 2015, the protected area network of the Republic of Korea covers 7.92% of terrestrial and inland water areas (7,876.32 km2) and 4.5% of the coastal areas (3,366.34 km2). The Ministry of Environment of The Republic of Korea reported in 2015 a protected area coverage of 12.6% for terrestrial and inland areas and 6.1% for coastal areas (Ministry of Environment of the Republic of Korea, 2015). This difference is because the data used at the time of the analyses presented in this report did not include all protected areas currently designated in the Republic of Korea.

Source: Intersection between the protected areas dataset and the Land Cover Map for Korea (see sections 3.1.2 and 3.1.3 for details on the datasets used). The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species has assessed the risk of extinction of 995 species whose ranges overlap with the territory of the Republic of Korea. However, the species range maps provided by the IUCN Red List were not used because they were of too coarse scale for a national level analysis. Instead, the species national dataset was used to confirm presence of some of these globally assessed species. In total the presence of 91 species assessed at a global level was confirmed. Of these, 26 were classified as globally threatened (Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable). Results of the protected areas gap analysis revealed that the current protected area network covers only 54% (14 species) of these 26 globally threatened species (Figure 4.3). The Critically Endangered insect Libellula angelina of which there were 12 confirmed occurrences (points) is not found in any protected areas or Key Biodiversity Areas included in this analysis.

CANDIDATE KEY BIODIVERSITY AREAS Key Biodiversity Areas are defined as \u201csites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity\u201d (IUCN, 2016). Its identification spans over three decades when BirdLife International started their Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas programme (BirdLife International, 2014). KBA are identified using a globally agreed set of criteria and thresholds that are applied through ideally nationally driven processes. The identification of KBAs requires the assessment of 5 Criteria: A) Threatened Biodiversity, B) Geographically Restricted Biodiversity, C) Ecological Integrity, D) Biological Processes and E) Irreplaceability Through Quantitative Analyses. Sites identified as KBAs are important for several reasons. They can support the strategic expansion of protected area networks by governments and civil society working toward achievement of the Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 and 12 (Butchart et al., 2012) and the Sustainable Development Goals (Brooks et al., 2015); inform the description or identification of sites under international conventions (such as wetlands of international importance designated under the Ramsar Convention, and natural World Heritage Sites) or inform private sector safeguard policies, environmental standards (Dudley et al., 2014; IUCN, 2016).

The boundaries of protected areas where these species occur can facilitate potential delineation of these globally important sites. Similarly, existing Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas can be documented for other non-bird species. However, identifying the presence of globally threatened species and its priority to KBAs and protected areas is only one step to complete a full KBA identification and delineation process (IUCN, 2016). A comprehensive assessment against the five KBA criteria and a stakeholder consultation is at least needed to identify any additional KBAs to the 40 IBAs already identified in the Republic of Korea. 39 5. Key Messages This report carries out a spatial analysis to assess the status of the protected area network of the Republic of Korea and propose priorities for protected area expansion to support the implementation of international and national biodiversity targets. It is a desktop analysis based on biodiversity, conservation area, land cover, threat and constraint data and uses spatial prioritisation software to identify a portfolio of sites that meet pre-defined conservation targets. The results aim to inform decisions on future work on protected area expansion for the Republic of Korea which require wider stakeholder consultation and decisions at a national level that are out the scope of this project. 40 5.1. CONCLUSIONS According to the World Database on Protected Area (WDPA), the Protected Area network of the Republic of Korea covers 7.9% of terrestrial and inland areas (7,876.32 km2) and 4.5% of the coastal areas (3,366.34 km2). In another recent analyses using a different methodology, the Ministry of Environment of The Republic of Korea reported in 2015 a protected area coverage of 12.6% for terrestrial and inland areas and 6.1% for coastal areas. Both analyses show the Protected Area network falls short of meeting the 17% and 10% marks specified in Aichi Biodiversity Target 11. Although Aichi Target 11 is a global target, in the absence of specific biodiversity targets for protected areas some countries have decided to set this mark as their national target. Based on the WDPA analyses and taking Aichi Target 11 as a national target for Korea, an additional 9,034 km2 of terrestrial and 4,122 km2 coastal protected areas would be needed to cover 17% of terrestrial and inland water areas and 10% of coastal areas of Korea. However, 17% and 10% are politically negotiated values and not scientifically defined end points (Woodley et al., 2012). Research has shown that a considerably larger area will need to be protected to achieve, for example, a global ecologically representative network (Butchart et al., 2015), and there are different strategies to achieve this efficiently (Venter et al., 2014; Montesino-Pouzols et al., 2014). More importantly, an expanded network of protected areas needs to represent adequately all biodiversity, and must take into account the specific biodiversity patterns in each country. To achieve this, some countries might need less than 17% and some countries might need more that 17%. In addition, Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 relates not only to expanding protected areas. There are many other attributes not considered in this project that are crucial to achieving a well-functioning network of protected areas, including, but not restricted to, effective management, connectivity between protected areas, equity and consideration of the contribution of other effective area based conservation measures to the target (Juffe-Bignoli et al., 2014a). A series of options for protected area expansion are explored in this report by setting conservation targets and testing different spatial configurations. Two of the major outputs from the analyses are a proposed network of sites for each of the scenarios, and the selection frequency (number of times each planning unit is selected in all runs). While the terrestrial results can be considered an adequate representation of biodiversity in the Republic of Korea, the coastal analysis requires more fine-scale data on habitats and species. The combined solution shown in section 4.2.1 (Figure 4.7) includes protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas and avoids areas that might conflict with setting new protected areas such as developed areas or agricultural lands. These results show that expanding the boundaries of Korea\u2019s current protected areas network will improve representation of biodiversity while enhancing connectivity between protected areas, in a way that generally avoids with high levels of agriculture and human population density. Moreover, the selection frequency for this combined solution (Figure 4.8) with no spatial restrictions - not locking protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas and not excluding any areas - gives an indication of how well the current protected area network and Key Biodiversity Areas are covering", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e2757d1d-c9fd-4684-8931-c7d8ce69fda1": {"__data__": {"id_": "e2757d1d-c9fd-4684-8931-c7d8ce69fda1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/protected-planet-national-technical-series-republic-korea", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Protected planet national technical series : Republic of Korea", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/protected-planet-national-technical-series-republic-korea", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7faf1e551cdb17a8ff9a6079571afbf683243e5f114b98165ce9a382985b1b54"}, "3": {"node_id": "4da12512-df11-4ce8-894f-35f5af16423a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/protected-planet-national-technical-series-republic-korea", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2cb0e2826b49aaa391c5c6c6c2e8b718bf8239fb6b6c3109395f8e6dc2158df2"}}, "hash": "070be98f6e0b071c52e4fe183645267344b70f5ff05ce3fc34700049cc7f863b", "text": "areas of high selection frequency, i.e. areas that are important to meet the predefined conservation targets. While current protected areas are mainly located in areas of high selection frequency some areas of high selection frequency are not within protected areas or Key Biodiversity Areas. These areas need further attention as they may be candidates for expansion or creation of protected areas. They could also be candidates for new Key Biodiversity Areas (see criteria E in IUCN, 2016). Finally, it is important to stress that solutions and options for protected area expansion are flexible but depend greatly on the conservation targets set and data quality. A different set of targets will provide a different solution. Targets provide a transparent way of defining conservation objectives and a clear end point, but can be subjective or arbitrary if they are not justified and clearly explained. Similarly, more data will improve the quality of the results, thus spatial prioritisation analyses need to be updated and validated periodically to ensure the network adequately conserves and represents biodiversity over time. This is particularly important given the potential future effects of climate change on species ranges. 41 5.2. RECOMMENDATIONS The analysis presented here is a starting point for a complex national policy process to determine which areas of the country should be selected for protected area expansion. The methodology and results will prove useful to inform future decisions on how to meet global and national targets for protected areas and biodiversity. The key recommendations from this report are: \u25cf Consider other elements of Aichi Biodiversity Target 11: While adequate representation of biodiversity features is important, other elements of Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 need to be considered to achieve a fully functioning protected area system, and to meet Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 such as protected area management effectiveness, connectivity or other effective area based conservation measures. \u25cf Explore synergies between biodiversity targets: This report does not evaluate synergies between Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 and other Aichi Targets. Nevertheless, these synergies exist and have been explored (see Di Marco et al., 2015 and Marques et al., 2014). For example, expanding and effectively managing protected areas might help to conserve threatened species (Target 12) and prevent habitat loss (Target 5). \u25cf Consider other important factors: Future analyses will need to consider other factors that will impact decisions on where to locate protected areas. These include climate change, long term maintenance of ecological processes to deliver ecosystem services, land use scenarios to assess trade-offs when conflicting uses occur (e.g. designating a new protected area could restrict large-scale development that might have an impact on local economies). \u25cf Compile better quality data for the marine and coastal ecosystems and species: A more detailed coastal and marine analysis is needed. Thus, additional species and habitat national data at fine scale needs to become available to fill the gap found in this report and identify potential areas for protected area expansion. \u25cf Complete a KBA identification process: this report has highlighted areas where the presence of globally threatened species has been confirmed and identified areas of high selection frequency. Some of these areas are not within designated protected areas or existing Key Biodiversity Areas. These areas need further assessment and could be candidates for new Key Biodiversity Areas under the KBA standard (IUCN, 2016). \u25cf Consider other approaches: Target based approaches are not the only option for designating protected area networks under the systematic conservation planning framework. Other approaches, including those based on the decision support tool Zonation for example (Moilanen et al., 2005, Moilanen, 2007), may warrant consideration. \u25cf Go beyond spatial prioritisation: The SCP framework was used to identify potential areas for protected area expansion. While the results presented here can inform future steps and decisions on how to meet national and international conservation targets, a wider consultation is needed to prioritise conservation actions and test alternatives for protected areas expansion. Implementation, monitoring and evaluation of actions will be a crucial step in completing a full conservation planning process. 42 References Ball, I.R., Possingham H.P., and Watts M. (2009).

Section 2.1. presents the results for the terrestrial and inland water areas and analyses while section 2.2. does the same for the coastal areas analyses. Each section is structured in 3 subsections: i) Developing scenarios (which scenarios were tested), ii) Selecting additional conservation areas (settings for the spatial prioritisation analyses and results for the selected scenarios), and iii) Assessing the achievement of targets (to what extent targets were met in the selected scenarios) 2.1. TERRESTRIAL AND INLAND WATER AREAS 2.1.1. Developing scenarios Nine terrestrial target scenarios (TS) with different increasing targets were developed for conservation features found in terrestrial and inland water areas (See Table 1 in Appendix 2). Table 1. Criteria used in the different runs to test options for terrestrial scenarios (TS). Terrestrial Scenarios (TS) Criteria 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Increase current representation in protected areas of conservation features important by law Increase representation from previous scenario Increase representation from previous scenario of species and geographic features identified as important in NBSAPs and/or National Reporting to CBD Increase representation from previous scenario Increase representation from previous scenario of habitats: forest age, vegetation types, tidal flats, and wetlands. Increase representation from previous scenario Increase representation from previous scenario of wetlands Increase representation from previous scenario Increase representation from previous scenario 48 2.1.2. Selecting additional conservation areas Table 2 shows the settings for running the Marxan software through the CLUZ interface. The results of the analyses are presented in Table 3. For each of the scenarios four different settings were tested: Setting 1 \u2013 No areas locked in or excluded. Setting 2 - Protected areas locked in. Setting 3 - Protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas locked in. Setting 4 \u2013 Protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas locked in. Areas where more than 60% of a planning unit occupied by developed areas, bare grounds, artificial water bodies, artificial grasslands, and agricultural areas excluded. Table 2.

Whilst some may be aware of the implications of a warming ocean for coral reefs, few know about the other consequences for the ocean. We have known about global warming for about 120 years, since Svante Arrhenius\u2019s work1, and ocean warming from Rossby\u2019s work2 in the 1950s. It is clear though that the heat and carbon management roles of the ocean have only been properly recognized in the international debate on climate change in the last decade or so, and afforded their proper significance by the scientific community within the last few years. More than 93% of the enhanced heating since the 1970s due to the greenhouse effect and other human activities has been absorbed by the ocean, and data show a sustained and accelerating upward trend in ocean warming. The year 2015 has recently been confirmed the warmest within the 136-year extended reconstructed sea surface temperature records, and the fourth such record-breaking year since 2005. The scale of ocean warming is truly staggering with the numbers so large that it is difficult for most people to comprehend. If the same amount of heat that has gone into the top 2000m of the ocean between 1955-2010 had gone into the lower 10km of the atmosphere, then the Earth would have seen a warming of 36\u00b0C3. This reports explores the consequences of putting such massive amounts of energy into the ocean, the warming it is causing and resulting changes that are now taking place. Until very recently, the debate on climate change has focused on specific themes such as land surface temperatures, melting ice caps in Greenland and Polar Regions, and shrinking glaciers in mountain ranges. It has only occasionally mentioned the ocean. When the ocean was included, the issues discussed generally related to dramatic changes to coral reefs, with water temperature rises turning beautifully-coloured reefs a ghostly white from bleaching. Ocean acidification also emerged as a \u2018new story\u2019 around 2004, with problems already being encountered due to changes in ocean chemistry, add ocean warming to the mix and there is a far bigger story to tell. It is only in recent years that the science on these cumulative ocean impacts has started to emerge and the stories documented in this report begun to be heard. Whether ocean warming impacts a particular group of organisms, alters the structures of ecosystems such as coral reefs, changes the very essence of environmental conditions, or indeed influences weather, it impacts on everyone to some degree as we are an ocean planet. It has profound implications not just for ecosystems but also for the significant number of coastal communities and valuable economies that depend on a healthy ocean. Up to now, the ocean has shielded us from the worst impacts of climate change by absorbing 1 http://www.lenntech.com/greenhouse-effect/global-warming-history.htm 2 https://www.aip.org/history/climate/oceans.htm#M_13_ 3 Whitmarsh, F., Zika, J., and Cazaja, A. 2015.

This regulating function, however, happens at the profound cost to alterations of the ocean\u2019s physics and chemistry that lead especially to ocean warming and acidification, and consequently sea-level rise. This report represents the most recent and comprehensive review on ocean warming; it builds on the IPCC\u2019s 2013 assessment, promotes their messages, and adds in new information published since then \u2013 over 25% of the peer reviewed papers quoted here have been published since 2014 - as well as highlighting lesser- known consequences of ocean warming on species, ecosystems and services. It is hoped that this report will help generate far greater awareness and scrutiny of ocean warming and its impacts in the future. To build up the report, leading scientists from around the world were invited to join with colleagues to contribute individual chapters or sections. Each chapter has been subject to peer review and tells in the scientist\u2019s own words the scale, nature and consequences of changes being driven by ocean warming, often in association with other stressors such as ocean acidification and deoxygenation. It contains many recommendations from the scientists on capability gaps and research issues that need to be resolved if we are to tackle the impacts of ocean warming with greater confidence in the future.

Since the process was started to compile this report, IPCC has agreed to prepare a special report on climate change and oceans and the cryosphere. The papers in this report will, we hope, help that process and shape further thinking on the scale and consequences of climate change in our seas. Alongside this work a second report is in production, which will use the knowledge on ocean warming to re- evaluate the risks to society from the growing changes that are now being seen. Above all though this report is the story of ocean warming and its consequences for all of us. It outlines cautionary tales about changes that are now underway in the ocean, often hidden and unseen, but nevertheless of great consequence. A warming ocean is one where changes to ecosystems, chemistry and processes are generating risks to the benefits we and many other species receive and depend on during our lives: changes that are not theory, but now a reality supported by hard facts. For this reason, the relationship we have with the ocean matters more than ever and we hope this report will be instrumental in inspiring greater action to care for it. Increases in ocean temperature may broaden the reproductive periods of mid-latitude jellyfish, and improve winter survival of tropical species expanding to temperate waters, therefore boosting both alien and native outbreaks. \u00a9 Fredski2013 Facts at a glance - a catalogue of change 4 Some of the major findingS, impactS and conSequenceS for weather, ocean, ecoSyStemS and SpecieS. Key warming factS By absorbing a disproportionate amount of heat from global warming and by taking up the rapidly increasing emissions of carbon dioxide, the ocean has shielded the world from even more rapid changes in climate. The crucial role that the ocean plays in climate regulation as the major heat, carbon and water reservoir of the world has not until now been generally recognized or appreciated by the public or policy makers. More than 93% of the enhanced heating since the 1970s due to the greenhouse effect and other human activities has been absorbed by the ocean, even affecting the deep ocean. If the same amount of heat that has gone into the top 2000m of the ocean between 1955-2010 had gone into the lower 10km of the atmosphere, then the Earth would have seen a warming of 36\u00b0C. Sea surface temperature, ocean heat content, sea-level rise, melting of glaciers and ice sheets, CO2 emissions and atmospheric concentrations are increasing at an accelerating rate with significant consequences for humanity and the marine species and ecosystems of the ocean. There is likely to be an increase in mean global ocean temperature of 1-4oC by 2100. The greatest ocean warming overall is occurring in the Southern Hemisphere and is contributing to the subsurface melting of Antarctic ice shelves. Since the 1990s the atmosphere in the polar regions has been warming at about twice the average rate of global warming. Increases in the atmospheric and upper ocean water temperatures are not quickly transferred to the deep sea, but the deep water masses are warming, now storing 16\u201389% more heat, including in the deep Mediterranean Sea, now 0.12\u00b0C warmer than a few decades ago. This increase in deep ocean water temperature is projected to continue for centuries after the atmospheric temperatures have levelled off or even decreased. The heat content of the upper 700 m of the global ocean is the equivalent of ~ 240 times the human global energy consumption in 2013. The heat and CO2 accumulated in the ocean are not permanently locked away, but can be released back to the atmosphere when the ocean surface is anomalously warm, giving a positive rapid feed-back to global warming. While global hurricane frequency has not changed significantly there are now more severe hurricanes (Saffir-Simpson scale 3-5) than several decades ago, with an increase in these severe systems at a rate of ~ 25-30% per oC of global warming. It appears likely that the probability of strong hurricanes occurring will increase, although there may be a point in the warming process beyond which this trend halts. 4 For precise details and context for every fact please refer to the main scientific report downloadable from the web site address given at the end of this summary Anthropogenically-forced ocean thermal expansion and ice sheet melting, along with a much smaller contribution from changes in land-water storage, have led to a global sea- level rise of 3.3 \u00b1 0.4 mm yr\u22121 over the last two decades.

The coupled effects of ocean warming and acidification are hard to predict but likely include: ocean deoxygenation, sea- level rise, a slowdown of ocean circulation and changes in the structure of marine ecosystems and ocean primary production. An increase in the melting of ice sheets, particularly Greenland, an increase in iceberg calving, and a rise in sea level as well as a significant increase in iceberg numbers in the ocean since the 1990s. An acceleration of Arctic warming and ice loss, combined with more variable, and extreme, mid-latitude weather. There is likely to be further major loss, and possibly the essential removal in some years, of summer Arctic sea ice in the next few decades. In the Antarctic the extent of the sea ice has been growing at a rate of ~1.3% per decade, although there is strong inter-annual variability. The oceans around Antarctica are changing rapidly, with average rates of warming and freshening that greatly exceed the global mean, but with complex regional structure to these changes. This is a problem as the Antarctic marine ecosystem is strongly dependent on the regional circulation and climate of the ocean, and is important because of its roles in the global carbon cycle, fisheries, and the conservation of many of the planet\u2019s iconic marine mammals, penguins and flying seabirds. Increasing freshwater supply to the ocean, will lead to a decrease in overturning and in vertical mixing thus reducing nutrient supply, and hence productivity, in the surface ocean. There has been an intensification and distinct change in El Ni\u00f1o events over the last 20 years, with a shift of the mean location of sea surface temperature anomalies towards the central Pacific. There has been an increase in storm surges along Arctic coasts, leading to more frequent inundation of fragile coastal ecosystems. In late March 2004 the only hurricane ever observed in the South Atlantic since satellite records began in 1970 (unofficially known as Catarina) formed off the southern coast of Brazil. As sea surface temperatures continue to rise, the classical condition required for hurricanes will begin to occur in some years, and changes to atmospheric convection related to changes in land- based heating may well make such storms a less exceptional event in the future. Expansion of zones experiencing oxygen deficiency, with important consequences for biogeochemical cycling and the role of micro-organisms - a decrease of 3-12 mmol kg-1 in oxygen concentration is forecast by 2100 due to climate change, with 18\u201350% of this decline due to ocean warming reducing oxygen solubility. Low oxygen conditions also activate the production of nitrous oxide as a result of the complex set of metabolic pathways in the nitrogen cycle. Nitrous oxide is a potent greenhouse gas (approximately 310 times more powerful than CO2) whose flux from the ocean to the atmosphere is increasing. Any expansion of low oxygen regions clearly has the potential to intensify this flux. Reduced oxygen in sea water as higher temperatures reduce solubility, resulting in reduced penetration of oxygen into deeper water due to enhanced stratification in warmer conditions. Due to increased stratification of the ocean, the global Meridional Circulation is likely to decline over the next century, although there is not a consensus as to the rate of decline. Negative feedback on the ocean carbon sink, due to higher sea surface temperatures which reduce carbon dioxide uptake from the atmosphere. A higher global sea surface temperature and land surface temperature in part enhance the rate of increase in atmospheric CO2. Currently 2.5 Gt of frozen methane hydrate are stored in the sea floor at water depths of 200 \u2013 2000 m. Increasing water temperature may destabilize the methane hydrates, however, direct observations of methane flares at the sea floor suggest that these do not result in significant increases in flux to the atmosphere. There has, however, been an as yet unexplained increase in surface methane concentrations. Uncertainty about the future of most large-scale ocean- atmosphere teleconnections under greenhouse warming is ubiquitous.

Coastal areas have warmed 35% faster than in the open ocean since 1960 and are more susceptible to impacts directly from warming, sea-level rise, changes in storms and increased land runoff than any other ocean realm. Changes have now occurred in rocky shore species ranges, distribution, abundance and phenology, leading to promotion of nuisance and fouling species, reduced diversity of native species, and eventual changes in ecosystem functioning. Ocean warming has caused significant changes in seaweed distribution, especially at Arctic and temperate latitudes. Gradual warming, marine heatwaves and over-grazing by range- shifting herbivores have forced and augmented regime-shifts in at least seven regions across four continents. In places, highly complex productive seaweed forests have been replaced by structurally simple coralline crusts, filamentous turfs or small fleshy seaweeds. Low latitude saltmarsh distributions will decline due to expansion of mangrove forest, while high latitude marshes will expand onto mud flats. Within saltmarshes, because individual species respond differently, changes to future community composition is uncertain. Increased plant production is likely, which will generally improve ecosystem services but other aspects are highly uncertain such as carbon sequestration capacity, which may increase, and the likely increase in methane emissions, thus affecting climate-motivated restoration activities. Persistent, structurally complex seagrass species do not recover quickly from major mortality incidents, as clonal propagation is slow and recruitment from sexual reproduction is limited. Thus, a global phase shift to more ephemeral, opportunistic seagrass species, macroalgae or bare sediment is likely, consequently reducing future seagrass ecosystem services. Tidal freshwater forest area declines due to salinity intrusion and geomorphic constraints. The direct effects of the projected temperature increase driving ocean warming are likely to be mostly beneficial to mangroves, with a shift poleward and increasing mangrove productivity and biodiversity particularly at higher latitudes. There will be loss or narrowing to mangrove habitats, and species composition changes, due to sea-level rise, leading to fragmentation. There will be a reduction in mangrove diversity, photosynthesis and growth and impacts on associated fauna with low adaptive capacity with reduced rainfall and humidity. Where the current rate of sea-level rise exceeds the soil surface elevation gain, mangroves with low tidal range and low sediment supply could be submerged as early as 2070, such as in the Gulf of Thailand, the south-east coast of Sumatra, the north coasts of Java and Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. The rate of warming in coral reef areas has increased from ~0.04\u00b0C/decade over the past century to 0.2\u00b0C/decade over recent decades (1985-2012). Across this period, reefs were exposed to prolonged high temperatures that caused bleaching, approximately once every six years. However, within the last three decades, as the planet has warmed the frequency of bleaching stress has increased three-fold. The latest climate models predict that ocean warming will cause annual coral bleaching for almost all reefs by 2050. They also predict that disease is as likely to be a future cause of coral mortality as coral bleaching. Unabated temperature increases will produce serious consequences for coral reef ecosystems and dependent communities. The proportion of reefs in which ocean chemistry will allow coral reefs to grow has decreased from 98% (ca. 1780) to 38% (ca. 2006) due to ocean acidification and this continues to drop. The impacts of climate change on deep sea faunal communities are not fully known.

The speed of change in the ocean, such as the poleward range shifts in marine systems, is happening between 1.5 and 5 times faster than on land. Such range shifts are potentially irreversible with great impacts on ecosystems \u2013 but the consequences of these changes, decades down the line, are far less clear. Whilst rising CO2 levels and increasing warming can occasionally have positive effects, the overwhelming evidence and predictions shown in this report are for a cocktail of negative effects, which we are only just starting to understand, but about which we know enough to be very concerned. The warning signs are clear to see. These range from the persistence of jellyfish blooms and their increasing frequency of occurrence, year after year, through to the current prevalence of bleaching of coral reefs around the world, but also the increasing confidence of predictions that all coral reefs will be so affected by 2050, unless we change our ways, and quickly. Ocean warming and climate change are ultimately contributing to global homogenization of biodiversity, as vulnerable species become extinct and \u201cnon-native\u201d species from different biogeographic regions spread, overlap, and become established across the world\u2019s ocean. Predictions are for a decrease of biodiversity in warm-water regions, but as much as a 300% increase in polar regions. Biomass losses in deep sea areas in the north-east Atlantic for example may reach 40% and for biodiversity hotspots, such as seamounts, even 80%. Overall, ocean primary production is expected to continue to change, however, the global patterns of these changes are difficult to project, but regional evidence suggests that carbon cycling and storage will be fundamentally altered in some specific coastal situations, e.g. saltmarshes and mangroves. Existing projections suggest an increase in productivity in high latitude systems like the Arctic and Southern Ocean and a decrease in productivity in the tropics and mid-latitudes. Ocean warming is causing the expansion of zones experiencing oxygen deficiency, with important consequences for biogeochemical cycling and an increased role for the microbial world, and especially bacteria, archaea and viruses, at the expense of eukaryotes which are generally more sensitive to reduced oxygen levels. This will likely make the already dominant role of microbes in the functioning of the marine ecosystems even more pronounced in a scenario of a warming ocean. Declines in the amount of oxygen will make the demands of water-breathing organisms, such as fishes and invertebrates, increasingly difficult to meet under global warming scenarios, and will stimulate the production of nitrous oxide which is a potent greenhouse gas approximately 310 times more powerful than CO2. It also has one of the longest atmosphere lifetimes of the greenhouse gases, lasting for up to 150 years. There is evidence that the flux of nitrous oxide from the ocean to the atmosphere is increasing. All these changes and predictions for the future matter from moral, social, ecological and economic perspectives. The value of our relationship with the ocean sometimes seems difficult to cost, but is the ultimate relationship that enables life to exist on Earth. Estimates of worth vary but range from the services value of seaweeds at US$ 30,000 ha-1yr-1 through to US$ 5-10 trillion yr-1 for the services provided by rocky shores. In terms of economic losses, where this is quantified, it runs from millions to trillions of dollars a year. For example, the current tourism costs associated with the loss of corals from warming and acidification have been estimated as high as US$ 12 billion per year, with annual estimated costs from the loss of reef ecosystem services rising to US$ 1 trillion by 2100, directly and indirectly affecting many of the benefits we have so far taken for granted. Alongside the high economic impacts from recent extreme storm event impacts, other single event economic losses related to ocean warming impacts already run from the tens to hundreds of million dollars. A major outbreak of Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning in 2012 and 2015 along 200km of coastline of Tasmania triggered a global product recall and loss to the local economy of AU$ 23million. A single coral bleaching event in South-east Asia suggested an economic loss of services to dive tourists in the order of US$ 49-74 million for the six-month period during and following bleaching, whilst more recently the 2016 unusually strong El Ni\u00f1o pattern triggered the largest ever reported algal blooms and aquaculture fish kills in Chile causing losses of US$ 800million.

From a purely ocean perspective, human disease risk is most likely to be affected by changes in disease incidence for marine animals that are part of our diet, allowing for direct transmission of the pathogen to humans, or for infections of wounds exposed during recreational (e.g. bathing) activities. Plankton at the base of the ocean food chain have already shown marked responses to ocean warming, moving up to 10o of latitude. \u00a9 Fisheries and Oceans Canada There is already a fundamental concern for the economic effects and consequences ocean warming will have on global fisheries and aquaculture. Together they play a vital but often poorly acknowledged role in global food security, providing 4.3 billion people with ~15% of their average per capita intake of animal protein. By 2050, an additional 75 million tonnes of fish will be needed to help feed more than 9 billion people, but warming of the world\u2019s ocean could disrupt these important initiatives with projected decreases in fisheries production in some countries and increases in others. Similarly, the prime locations for mariculture are expected to be altered by ocean warming, resulting in changes in yield patterns among countries. The costs of this for countries could be high as we know key species are vulnerable to ocean warming impacts, such as tuna, and they account for 8% of the US$ 129 billion value of internationally traded fishery products. Rapid population growth, fish exports and poor fisheries management also affect availability of fish in many developing countries. These drivers often create a gap between how much fish is needed for good nutrition and local fish harvests. The main effects of ocean warming will be to alter (increase or decrease) the gap, with the greatest changes expected in tropical and subtropical countries. Closing this gap will require the expansion of environmentally sustainable mariculture (and freshwater aquaculture), or even re- allocating some of the catch of large and small pelagic fish taken by industrial fleets to small-scale fishers, and/or arranging for industrial fleets to land more of their catch in local ports. From the community perspective, the greatest human losses will likely fall upon those people who rely upon the ocean for day-to-day subsistence \u2013 typically in these poorest coastal nations. With issues of such importance at stake, we need to vastly improve the science and knowledge available as we move forward into an increasingly compromised ocean world. This is a common conclusion of many of the scientists involved with this report. As the global community through action, or sadly and probably inaction, increasingly commits itself to a high carbon future, knowledge of ocean warming and biological interactions will become invaluable in working out how we cope with the impacts and changes that become evident and prevalent, and impact and alter our way of life. With the realization that ocean ecosystems are vulnerable to human threats such as overfishing, climate change, eutrophication, habitat destruction, pollution and species introductions there is an increasing imperative to observe ocean biology in a more integrated fashion in order to provide the long- term baselines needed for management actions and research. Historical datasets will need to be maintained and where possible expanded into new areas of the world\u2019s ocean where there are little or no sustained observations, including the open and the deep ocean and seabed Area. Many new international research initiatives such as Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) and Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEOBON) are being set up to address these issues and monitor these changes. Future biological monitoring of these open-ocean ecosystems, through an integrated and sustained observational approach, will be essential to understand the continuing impacts of ocean warming and other stressors on oceanic systems. Improvements in ecosystem and coupled climate models are needed to provide a comprehensive overview of ecosystem change and directions of change in the future. A repeated problem in this respect is being able to resolve sufficient detail to make models more applicable at the regional scale. Inadequacies in such systems already pose great challenges, for example, for estimating effects of climate change on Antarctic marine ecosystems and for projecting future change. This is a widespread problem as there is a failure of the range of existing climate models to reach adequate consensus on future change in processes of air-sea interaction. Such uncertainty is an abiding feature of predictions of the future, and is why the improvement of climate model representation of the feedbacks in the climate system between the ocean and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "db4f8e75-6e7f-476b-b2b9-4810af5fdd82": {"__data__": {"id_": "db4f8e75-6e7f-476b-b2b9-4810af5fdd82", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ocean-warming-causes-scale-effects-and-consequencesexecutive-summary", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ocean warming : causes, scale, effects and consequences...Executive summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ocean-warming-causes-scale-effects-and-consequencesexecutive-summary", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "31d969f98a6898cfa157f19762ebd55e2ce18e98013d4ff478576124daa82dd1"}}, "hash": "31d969f98a6898cfa157f19762ebd55e2ce18e98013d4ff478576124daa82dd1", "text": "atmosphere is therefore a priority for more successful prediction. More comprehensive observations may allow us through international collaboration to mitigate and adaptively manage some of their more detrimental impacts. More studies are needed in this respect. The impacts of ocean warming and other stressors will drive a new paradigm in ecological restoration towards active management and restoration. This will increasingly drive approaches from just \u2018protect\u2019 towards more active intervention to recover or restore, with a focus on sustaining resistance or increasing resilience in natural systems and their services, and increasing adaptive capacity. Increasing human interventions on the ecologically-sensitive design of artificial structures may become increasingly important as natural habitats are \u201csqueezed\u201d by sea-level rise. The viability of reducing impacts of warming by managing additional local stressors such as eutrophication, pollution and commercial and overfishing needs more investigation, but is clearly already a part of the strategy to sustain ocean benefits moving forwards. The rationale being that the more ecosystems are impacted, the less they will be resilient to gradual and on-set change. Alongside this are simple needs such as good resolution maps of the distribution worldwide of ecosystems, habitats and species to put all such observations, plans, and actions into operation. It is perhaps surprising to many that we have yet to successfully complete even this most basic of steps. None of this, however, should detract from the urgency or need to reduce global CO2 emissions which lies centrally at the heart of what the international community must achieve. Ocean warming is changing the distribution and occurrence of prey species, affecting the survival and reproduction of seabirds further up the food chain. \u00a9 John M Baxter Key recommendations based on the evidence presented in this report are: 1. Recognition of impact severity. There is a need for a much better recognition of the unequivocal scientific evidence of impacts on key marine and coastal organisms, ecosystems, and services that are already detectable, with predictions of high to very high risk of impact to be expected by 2100, even under the low emissions scenario (RCP2.6). These impacts will occur across all latitudes, making this a global concern beyond the usual North/South divide. 2. Concerted joined-up global policy action for ocean protection. There is a need to join up action across global conventions with respect to climate change and environmental protection. Action must be taken in light of these findings on ocean warming to accelerate and dramatically scale-up area- based, effective, and full protection of marine ecosystems, and to better implement sustainability measures across the entire ocean. Similarly, species assessment and advice, such as IUCN\u2019s Red List, must ensure that ocean warming impacts are fully integrated into assessments, findings and actions. 3. Ensure comprehensive protection and management. There is a need to ensure that we rapidly fill gaps in protective regimes, such as protecting the High Seas and the seabed Area \u2013 the ocean and sea floor beyond the jurisdiction of any single country \u2013 under a new Implementing Agreement under the Law of the Sea, as well as expanding global conventions to be truly \u2018global\u2019 \u2013 such as expanding the World Heritage Convention to take action across the High Seas and seabed Area. 4. Updated risk assessments. A re-evaluation is needed on the risks that impacts from ocean warming and other stressors pose to humanity, to the viability of the very species and ecosystems involved, and to the provisioning of goods and services we derive from them. As documented in this report vast change is underway and will be locked in for many decades \u2013 there is an urgency to determine what risk this holds for now and for the future so we can mitigate, plan and adapt accordingly. 5. Updated economic analysis. New and updated economic analysis is needed on the scale, nature and effects of impacts from ocean warming and other stressors. This is both in terms of the severity of impacts that are being felt, and are being predicted, but also on how such impacts may affect regional economies as high worth services are affected (e.g. coral reefs, kelp forests, mangroves, seagrass, etc.) and the distribution of valued assets diminish or increase (e.g. economically valuable species such as tuna, krill, etc.). 6. Closing gaps in fundamental science and capability needs.

Whilst some of the ocean warming-related science and capability needs right now may not sit easily against other priorities for governments, as the planet changes, we may regret the day we didn\u2019t take action early enough to obtain the essential data we will need in the future. 7. Achieving rapid and substantial cuts in greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gas mitigation at the global scale is the overarching solution that will determine the future of all other solutions (protect, repair, adapt). As a result, rapid and substantial reductions of greenhouse gas emissions are required. Through the implementation of the Paris Agreement under the UNFCCC Parties should now put forward rapid and substantial reductions of greenhouse gases, and consider ocean impacts in the so-called \u201cnationally determined contributions\u201d (NDCs) outlining national best efforts towards a sustainable low carbon future. The concerns among the scientific community is that as atmospheric CO2 increases, the options for the ocean (i.e. mitigate, protect, repair, adapt) become fewer and less effective. Time is not on our side and delays in taking action on greenhouse gas reductions close off future prospects that could otherwise help us cope with changes and impacts. To conclude the evidence in this report shows a complex story of change in the ocean, change that is underway, is often already locked in for future decades, and is beginning to impact on all our lives whether it is obvious or not. This is no longer a single story of challenges to coral reefs, but stories of changes across species and at ecosystem scales, and across geographies and the entire world. It is pervasive change, driven by ocean warming and other stressors that are already operating across scales and in ways we only barely understand. It is critical that we sit up and recognize these issues and act, or we will be poorly prepared, if at all, for an uncertain changing future. The ocean lies at the heart of the climate system and should thus be at the heart of climate discussions. We have perhaps become distracted by our daily issues on land, and have been ignoring the impact climate has been having on by far and away the majority of the living space on the planet \u2013 the ocean. A relevant architecture must now be developed to put the ocean at the heart of climate discussions. The scale and nature of impacts we are seeing are already running way ahead of what we know, and importantly, what we are apparently capable of acting on. Adaptation action is already needed to evolve short- and long-term management strategies for the ocean. This most likely will require increased levels of support and investment. Finally, and most critical, is the need to address atmospheric CO2 and achieve rapid and significant reductions in what we emit. To do otherwise will be to \u2018sleepwalk ourselves into a nightmare\u2019, where no level of conservation action in the future will be enough to override the impacts in order to save many of the ocean\u2019s species, ecosystems and benefits we currently rely on and take for granted. acKnowledgementS Development of this report has been a significant undertaking.

The habitats and species dependent on islands are severely threatened by human activity such as habitat destruction (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005) and the introduction of non-native species (Courchamp 2003, Paulay 1994). St Helena, a UK Overseas Territory, is a 14 million year old island of volcanic origin in the South Atlantic Ocean (figure 1), 4,000 km east of Rio de Janeiro and 1,950 km west of the coast of Angola and Namibia. Like many island ecosystems, St Helena is ecologically distinctive - supporting unique habitats such as the cloud forests of the Central Peaks. Many endemic species of flora and fauna abound on this island, and it is considered a global hotspot for invertebrate biodiversity (Buglife, 2013). St Helena supports around 460 invertebrate species found nowhere else on earth, which represents the highest number of endemic invertebrates of all the UK Overseas Territories (Churchyard et al., 2014). The summit ridge, known as the Central Peaks, is the highest part of St Helena at around 700-800 metres.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cddba03c-b54c-4dfa-ab34-942e7dedb10c": {"__data__": {"id_": "cddba03c-b54c-4dfa-ab34-942e7dedb10c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/spiky-yellow-woodlouse-pseudolaureola-atlantica", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Spiky yellow woodlouse (Pseudolaureola atlantica)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/spiky-yellow-woodlouse-pseudolaureola-atlantica", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "46684b74662372627bc5dae56fc5295f953fddcc87d2908ff6c277ff2a9945ef"}, "2": {"node_id": "b09dd83e-a2a8-48b1-9f65-03dcb213aa21", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/spiky-yellow-woodlouse-pseudolaureola-atlantica", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6dc3ee689a8e4749c4c4611f52819a9a29697a928fb7184cf7ce32db630f3819"}}, "hash": "0cc683e214342405c4cef9d325a99c6d3214abfed11922e654ae4b29a10741b0", "text": "Regularly enveloped in orographic cloud, it is covered with fragmented cloud forest, comprising endemic cabbage tree Melanodendron integrifolium woodland and tree-fern Dicksonia arborescens thicket. On St Helena the cloud forest is a hotspot and key habitat for invertebrates; with more than 200 endemic invertebrates occurring in the Central Peaks, comprising over half the endemic fauna (Buglife, 2013). Unfortunately human activities have had a severe impact on the unique ecosystems of St Helena. Habitat destruction, through the historic clearance for timber, the introduction of livestock and the clearance of the cloud forest for the introduced invasive New Zealand flax (Phormium tenax) plantations, coupled with the ongoing problems of further intentionally and accidently introduced invasive plants and animals; has led to the fragmentation of habitats, isolation of populations and dramatic population declines of native flora and fauna. The remnants of the native biodiversity are now struggling to survive in tiny fragments. Sadly, this has led to extinction for some invertebrates \u2013 such as the giant earwig Labidura herculeana, giant ground beetle Aplothorax burchelli and St Helena darter Sympetrum dilatatum which have become globally extinct within the memory spans of long-term residents living on the island (Buglife, 2013). (Note: S.dilatatum not been formally assessed as extinct by IUCN, but is very likely to be extinct based on existing information).

(a) (c) (b) 6 STATUS REVIEW 1. Species description 1.1. Systematics/Taxonomy The spiky yellow woodlouse Pseudolaureola atlantica (Vandel, 1977) is endemic to the island. It belongs to the family Armadillidae, which currently requires further study in terms of evolutionary phylogeny (Lambdon, 2015). As presently defined, the genus Pseudolaureola (Kwon, Ferrara & Taiti) comprises just four species with a remarkably disjunct distribution across humid forests of the tropical Afro-Australasian zone (IUCN, 2016). In addition to the Atlantic outpost occupied by P. atlantica, the other taxa from the genus are found in Madagascar, New Caledonia and Western Australia (Schmalfuss, 2003). Related genera (e.g. Laureola) have a predominantly southern African distribution but some do extend as far as south-east Asia. P. atlantica is synonymous with Laureola atlantica Vandel, 1977 (Lambdon, 2015). Variations in colour and differences in morphology are commonly found in separated populations of both plant and invertebrate species on St Helena (Dr P. Lambdon 2016, pers.comm.January). For example, there is a small endemic woodlouse species (Littorophiloscia alticola Vandell 1977), found in association with P.atlantica, that exhibits colour variation between subpopulations, with some appearing yellow-grey and other individuals being reddish (Dr P. Lambdon 2016, pers.comm.January). More recent findings however have found L. alticola in abundance with all colour forms present throughout the Peaks (Mr L. Malan 2016, pers.comm.March). Colour variation has recently been observed in P.atlantica which has included some very pale and some dark individuals (Fig. 2; Malan, 2015). It is currently unknown what the cause is of this colour variation, and whether this is influenced by the environment (e.g. food, substrate or climate) or if habitat fragmentation has had an impact in terms of genetic variation through the isolation of populations. Individual habitat patches are often isolated by complex topography and have been isolated for hundreds of years, and many plant and invertebrate species have not evolved good dispersal mechanisms, resulting in less gene flow between subpopulations (Dr P. Lambdon 2016, pers.comm.January). It is likely that different P. atlantica subpopulations have been isolated for several centuries at least (Dr P. Lambdon 2016, pers.comm.January); therefore a genetic study is required to determine if the subpopulations should be regarded as separate conservation units. 7 Figure 2: The colour variations of the recently found P.atlantica on Dogwood trees in Diana\u2019s Peak (Malan, 2015). Note the interesting star branching of one of the spines in the top right photo (Malan, 2015). 8 One newly discovered population of a \u2018spiky\u2019 woodlouse, which may represent a separate species new to science, was found by Mr L. Malan, 2015. These woodlice in appearance are smaller than P. atlantica, exhibit a colour difference, have more prominent stripes, blunt- ended spines rather than sharp, and spines which are almost restricted to the wider mid- dorsal area rather than extending laterally (Dr R. Key & Mr L. Malan 2016, pers.comm.January). It exhibits unusual features to that of P.atlantica, but is considered likely to be within the Genus Pseudolaureola (Stefano Taiti 2015, pers.comm.).

Lambdon 2016, pers.comm.January). Very little is known about the biology and ecology of this species. It is arboreal and has generally been considered to be found on fern fronds forming the understory of black cabbage tree Melanodendron integrifolium woodland, where its habitat preferences appear to be closely associated with fern cover and high humidity (Dr P. Lambdon 2016, pers.comm.January). Black-Scale Fern Diplazium filamentosum appears to be the preferred host-plant and this association occurs at the P.atlantica sites at the Dell at High Peak (Lambdon, 2015). However, one of the newly found P. atlantica sites is on High Peak, but not under black cabbage canopy (Mr L. Malan 2016, pers.comm.March). The dominant vegetation type in this site is tree fern Dicksonia arborescens thicket with no black scale in that section of the site. The habitat conditions are currently considered to be the driver of habitat preference (Dr P. Lambdon & Dr R. Cairn-Wicks 2015, pers.comm.), however these conditions are not yet fully understood. The black cabbage trees M.integrifolium act as keystone species in this ecosystem and their presence facilitates the necessary conditions for the endemic Endangered St Helena dogwood Nesohedyotis arborea and the endemic Endangered whitewood Petrobium arboreum to germinate (Percy and Cronk, 1995) and so these tree species are usually associated (Dr P. Lambdon 2016, pers.comm.January), see section 5 for more details. It is suspected that the size of black cabbage tree also generally facilitates the necessary high humidity requirements for P. atlantica (Dr P. Lambdon 2016, pers.comm.January). Older, bryophyte rich tree fern Dicksonia arborescens thicket appear to be prime habitat for P. atlantica (Mr L. Malan 2016, pers.comm.March). The Diana\u2019s Peak locations of P.atlantica have found to be associated with the St Helena dogwood N.arborea and the whitewood P. arboreum (Malan, 2015). However, it currently remains uncertain what the driver of habitat preference is for the P.atlantica on Diana\u2019s Peak. In 1993 P. atlantica were observed (>7 in a 30 minute period) during the day on an endemic St Helena redwood Trochetiopsis erythroxylon tree planted at the edge of the Dell (Rowe, 1995). They were regularly observed being active in redwoods T. erythroxylon and at the time was thought to be visiting flowers for nectar and possibly pollen (Mr P. Pearce-Kelly 2016, pers.comm. March). P. atlantica has been observed feeding on the micro-films covering fronds of Black-Scale Fern Diplazium filamentosum and other plants supporting this micro-film (Fig.3; Dr P. Lambdon 2015, pers.comm.December). The films are presumed to be composed of micro- debris, fern spores, pollen, algae and/or fungi, although whether one or more of these components is preferred has not been determined (Dr P. Lambdon 2016, pers.comm.January). Interestingly, observations of P. atlantica in Diana\u2019s Peak indicate that they may access food sources from different plant species to that of the Dell subpopulation (Malan, 2015). Furthermore, they give the impression of being more social, congregating in one part of a tree or in one tree, despite other apparently suitable habitat being available, however the reason for their grouped congregations is not understood (Mr L. Malan 2016, 10 pers.comm.January). Patches where P. atlantica is prevalent, L. alticola, another woodlouse species, is lacking or in low densities (Mr L. Malan 2016, pers.comm.March). This might indicate some form of territorial behaviour, or deliberate avoidance, possibly due to the need to compete for food sources, or a number of other reasons (Mr L.

Functions and values The functional role of P. atlantica in the ecosystem is not currently understood. P. atlantica does not fill a role as primary decomposers or pollinators, though it is suspected it may play a role in regulation of the epiphyllous flora of black-scale fern and other endemic plant species; though this has not yet been studied (Dr P. Lambdon 2016, pers.comm.January). The societal value of P. atlantica would be as a flagship species for the endemic invertebrates of St. Helena and its unique cloud forest habitat. The Bugs on the Brink project, led by Buglife and SHNT, has involved an education programme aimed at local school children, which had a focus on P. atlantica. A potential captive breeding programme and wider conservation work could provide opportunities for further public engagement. Several research gaps are identified: \uf0b7 What potential engagement options are there for the future? \uf0b7 Does P. atlantica removal pests from foliage for native vegetation? 13 3. Historical account Over recent decades there has been clear evidence of decline in both the number and distribution of P. atlantica subpopulations and the number of individuals, and there is no obvious reason to assume that these trends have halted (Lambdon, 2015). It is believed that the losses are strongly linked to reduction in the area of suitable habitat (Lambdon, 2015). Previously common at the site which is now believed to hold the largest subpopulation (the Dell); local accounts indicate that this subpopulation has declined substantially over the past 10 - 20 years (Lambdon, 2015). Distribution It is difficult however, to determine how extensively the distribution of P. atlantica has retracted because there have been so few records of invertebrates on St Helena. Nineteenth century authors such as Melliss (1875) were unaware of it entirely, which may suggest that the distribution has been confined to few, very restricted and isolated localities for some time (Lambdon, 2015). The first comprehensive entomological survey of St Helena was conducted by the Royal Museum of Central Africa, Tervuren (Belgium) in the 1960s (Basilewsky 1977). They recorded P.atlantica only from High Peak. In 1993, as part of a wider ZSL invertebrate survey visit a relatively numerous population was seen and a small number of living specimens were collected as an initial ex-situ breeding attempt (Mr P. Pearce-Kelly 2016, pers.comm.March). See section 7.3 for more details. A further detailed study of the Central Peaks in 2005-06 (Mendel et al., 2008) identified a separate subpopulation near Mt Actaeon (the most northerly of three summits along Diana\u2019s Peak Ridge), and reported additional accounts from locals of the species occurring nearby in Wells\u2019 Gut. More recently, a number of islanders report seeing P. atlantica at the head of Byron\u2019s Valley within the past decade (this could conceivably be the same locality as that of Mendel et al. 2008). Other accounts, from the few older residents familiar with the upland forests (also Q. Cronk pers. comm. 2014), describe seeing more general sightings, without a specific location and it was suspected that a small subpopulation could possibly have existed at Wash House (Lambdon, 2015). These records provide little more than suggestions, but they are sufficient to at least conclude that the range appears to have contracted substantially in the Diana\u2019s Peak area (Lambdon, 2015). Philip and Myrtle Ashmole recorded Spiky Yellow Woodlice from a tiny cave (small overhang) on the northern slope of High Peak (Ashmole P & M, 2000). They recorded it again in 2005-06. The cave is isolated from the cabbage tree woodland in sheep pasture and there appears to be little surrounding habitat to support the species outside of the cave. More recent visits found no evidence of continued presence. A further sighting was made in a hollow below The Dell in 2009 (K. Herian and L. Malan pers. comm.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5ef89bc8-b814-4986-a57e-b82c7d718f77": {"__data__": {"id_": "5ef89bc8-b814-4986-a57e-b82c7d718f77", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/spiky-yellow-woodlouse-pseudolaureola-atlantica", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Spiky yellow woodlouse (Pseudolaureola atlantica)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/spiky-yellow-woodlouse-pseudolaureola-atlantica", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7540bb1bfc25915fb40da064a1564c4730a300d3e25620faf01e868389c4127f"}, "2": {"node_id": "78647447-8227-482b-b736-66ee9f453771", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/spiky-yellow-woodlouse-pseudolaureola-atlantica", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "49dc10d694a829622b256b11b847b8f4c033c1772ab97738145e1e35641eb4e7"}}, "hash": "7c307d76c610e3ac0bf64c0f08f4ca13a6a25e86c2c3b311616108be09ba3a6f", "text": "comm.), but no individuals could be found here in 2013 (Lambdon, 2015). 14 Abundance There can be little doubt that it has also suffered considerable declines from the sites where it currently occurs at High Peak. In 1993 it was recorded on redwoods (>7 sited in a 30 minute period) (Rowe, 1995). It was still sighted regularly at The Dell as recently as the late 1990s (Ms R. Cairns-Wicks and Ms V.

The first (and best known) of these sites lies in a pocket of black cabbage tree Melanodendron integrifolium woodland known as \u2018The Dell\u2019. The copse is less than 30m wide, and even within it the subpopulation is highly localised; although a few scattered woodlouse individuals were sporadically found across the entire patch, the majority were restricted to a single fern stand spanning only seven by three metres (Lambdon, 2015).

During these surveys, no P.atlantica were found at the three sites in the Dell (Mr L. Malan 2016, pers.comm.March) which currently suggests the Dell sites may now represent a small constituent of the P atlantica population. However, the third site at High Peak, one of the newly found P. atlantica sites, is not in the Dell and not under black cabbage canopy (Mr L. Malan 2016, pers.comm.March). 20 Figure 7: The steep sided slopes of High Peak, the second location of P. atlantica on High Peak, found during the 2013-2014 surveys (P.Lambdon). 4.2. Diana\u2019s Peak During 2015, the current Darwin Plus funded Cloud Forest & Associated Invertebrates project led by ENRD, has been surveying the endemic hardwood trees and has found P. atlantica in new locations for this species over the southern side of Diana\u2019s Peak (Table 1; Malan, 2015). The study has included timed point counts and timed active searching for P. atlantica at survey sites and has currently found between an estimated 66 and 78 individual P. atlantica in seven of the sites (Table 1, Fig 5; Mr L. Malan 2016, pers.comm.January), with a further two sites in Diana\u2019s Peak being documented (Mr L. Malan 2016, pers.comm.March). It is highly likely that these timed counts are an underestimation of the numbers present, due to the limited amount of available time to complete the counts and searches. The distances between these sites are highlighted in Table 1. Sites 34, 33 & 31 are all found within a valley (Fig 5). Sites 57 & 35 are on a cliff down the side of a ridge, with site 49 immediately on the other side of that same ridge. Site 65 is completely separate with very little endemic vegetation, some present along its uphill edge only, which raises questions regarding the habitat specificity of the species (Mr L.

Several knowledge gaps are identified: \uf0b7 More comprehensive and detailed surveys of these new sites are required to get accurate population estimates; \uf0b7 Accurate habitat assessments are required to fully understand the habitat requirements of the species; \uf0b7 The size of potentially suitable habitat present is key to understanding the suitability of these habitat patches and long-term sustainability of these sites; a better understanding of habitat needs and any subpopulation differences \uf0b7 Long-term monitoring method to understand population trend \uf0b7 (1) what is the likely outcome of doing nothing?

Habitat and resource assessment Fragments of cloud forest are now confined only to High Peak and the Diana\u2019s Peak range, but even these have been substantially degraded following invasion by numerous non-native plant species. Vigorous competitors such as Whiteweed Austroeupatorium inulifolium, Small Fuchsia Fuchsia coccinea, Bilberry Tree Solanum mauritianum and Blackberry Rubus pinnatus are well evidenced problems, but other small, ground cover species are likely to have imposed more subtle yet important pressures on native species (Lambdon, 2015). The black cabbage tree Melanodendron integrifolium woodland of the Central Peaks of St Helena is a unique cloud forest habitat which is now almost extinct following the large-scale conversion of upland areas to flax plantations (Lambdon, 2012). The remaining patches of black cabbage tree woodland habitat are indicated in Figure 8. Its dark, humid conditions support a unique plant and invertebrate community. The site supporting the highest number of P. atlantica (with c.62 individuals, see Table 1) is found in the single remaining continuous stand at \u2018the Dell\u2019, which has been reduced to 250 m2. The Dell has become more exposed in recent years with the loss of wind attenuating low tree cover in front of it, notably redwoods and hybrids planted in front of the Dell which were removed or died, and therefore the loss of canopy structure within it. As a result, further black cabbage trees are rapidly succumbing to strong winds due to this exposure (Lambdon, 2015).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e248b2af-99cf-4dac-8def-de3248c55824": {"__data__": {"id_": "e248b2af-99cf-4dac-8def-de3248c55824", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/spiky-yellow-woodlouse-pseudolaureola-atlantica", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Spiky yellow woodlouse (Pseudolaureola atlantica)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/spiky-yellow-woodlouse-pseudolaureola-atlantica", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "961cbc80d0ff2ca5a0bb58b85cdaf2a557ddf264bca2585550b6e757a66c6d35"}, "2": {"node_id": "7dcc1375-1fb2-40b3-bea2-5e825756e58a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/spiky-yellow-woodlouse-pseudolaureola-atlantica", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ed077e5437aa5126cdc1dde41fd3b3278676fb696478debccaf88a04d5bf3c29"}}, "hash": "8e54890474bb0207dfc67c25037a1f44e20791de928007715a80cfb80567acf6", "text": "This tiny fragment is home to several other highly threatened species, including several bryophytes and five endangered ferns (Lambdon, 2015).

Although The Dell comprises 25 mature cabbage tree individuals, very few other copses of more than three trees survive (Lambdon, 2015). Even in areas where there are concentrations of black cabbage the understory is sometimes dominated by tree ferns Dicksonia arborescens, which accumulates a heavy, acid leaf litter which smothers the open ground needed for more diverse herbaceous species to establish (Lambdon, 2015). Conditions are dependent however, on the maturity of the D. arborescens thicket. Older, bryophyte rich D. arborescens thicket seem to be prime habitat (Mr L. Malan 2016, pers.comm.March). The most recently found P. atlantica sites are within such vegetation and appear to support good density of P. atlantica. Figure 9: Black cabbage tree (M. integrifolium) woodland and associated fern-rich understory at the Dell, the location of the largest subpopulation of P. atlantica (P. Lambdon). The lack of useful historical data limits our understanding of what the climax vegetation of the cloud forests might have looked like, but from observations it is likely to be black tree cabbage M. integrifolium woodland (Mr L. Malan 2016, pers.comm.March). Proper climax black cabbage M. integrifolium woodland is likely to be more diverse than the meagre fragments now left. Other endemic could forest trees (Whitewood Petrobium arboreum, 23 dogwood Nesohedyotis arborea, he cabbage Pladaroxylon leucodendron and she cabbage Lachanodes arborea and redwood Trochetiopsis erythroxylon) all seem capable to reach higher height than M. integrifolium do, but in the protected valleys at lower elevation, dominance would depend on which of these species does best. At high elevation (judging by a very few remaining, slowly declining, BC trees which could not have grown to their current size and form in isolation) there might well have been quite substantial M. integrifolium woodlands at the higher elevations. Tree fern thicket Dicksonia arborescens seems to function as some sort early successional stage which becomes more diverse as older fern fall and get covered in epipiphytes and tree seedlings. Standing D. arborescens trunks that are exposed often have small cabbage tree seedlings on them which can survive for many years without seemingly gaining in size. Meanwhile their roots, protected within D. arborescens roots follow gravity and once establishing a foothold in the soil below D. arborescens they have magnificent and surprisingly fast growth. In this fashion, D. arborescens thickets are succeeded by the trees (Mr L. Malan 2016, pers.comm.March). Several knowledge gaps are identified: \uf0b7 The understanding of ecosystem function might be critical for identifying restoration details to effect expansion and protection of habitat \uf0b7 A thorough habitat assessment, including mapping, of potentially suitable habitat is required across the Peaks, highlighting currently known P.atlantica sites and potential new sites \uf0b7 The quality and sustainability of the habitat at each site needs to be determined and assessed 24 6. Threat analysis 6.1. Habitat degradation & fragmentation The main threat for P. atlantica is habitat degradation and fragmentation, notably associated with the loss of black cabbage tree M. integrifolium woodland (Lambdon, 2015). Degradation has limited the amount of suitable habitat and fragmentation has undoubtedly imposed major limitations on the ability of P. atlantica to recover. The sustainability of the sites where P. atlantica are found is currently unknown. Over recent decades there has been clear evidence of decline in both the number and distribution of P. atlantica at the Dell and the total number of individuals and it is thought that these losses are heavily linked to a dwindling area of suitable habitat (Lambdon, 2015). The species appears to be highly sedentary and since it is confined to the fern layer, it is assumed to travel by clambering from one frond to another.

The arrival of pasture grasses and the introduced feather moss Pseudoscleropodium purum have increasingly reduced the availability of bare ground, resulting in more limited germination opportunities for endemic trees (Lambdon, 2015). The site is isolated on three sides by pasture which limits further colonization and spread of plant species, and leaves the copse exposed to very strong winds which scour the upper parts of High Peak for much of the year. A number of trees have fallen during storms since 2008. This has further opened the canopy, making the site even more vulnerable to tree losses and reducing the copse ability to trap humidity. The fern layer can be heavily buffeted during the winter months leaving many fronds ragged. There are concerns that this dominant component of the upland forests is declining (Lambdon and Ellick 2015), and, in particular, that further habitat losses will become apparent as the current older trees die (Lambdon, 2015). Kikuyu grass Pennisetum clandestinum has encroached onto areas of open ground where light now penetrates (Lambdon, 2015). 25 6.2. Invasive species and pathogens The impacts of predators and diseases are less certain. Numerous invertebrate threats (e.g. the woodlouse spider, Dysdera crocata) have been introduced to St Helena, although the 2013-2014 study did not record any incidences of losses to them and few potential predators or diseases were noted (Lambdon, 2015). The impacts of introduced small mammals (Rattus rattus, Rattus norvegicus and Mus musculus), which are prevalent near The Dell, are unknown but these species are considered unlikely to present an acute threat as they are too heavy to climb onto the fern fronds (Lambdon, 2015). Predation by the introduced African grass frog (Strongylopus grayi) is another consideration, and a few individuals have been heard calling in the area (Lambdon, 2015). This introduced amphibian was not seen near the main colony area during repeated day and night searches in 2013, but its distribution and potential impacts require further research (Lambdon, 2015). Several gaps are identified: \uf0b7 Are current subpopulations viable? How much suitable habitat is actually, and potentially, available? \uf0b7 How much habitat is needed to sustain viable subpopulations? How can adequate habitat level be restored? \uf0b7 How much suitable habitat is needed to sustain a viable population? \uf0b7 Impacts of introduced invertebrates such as woodlouse spider, Dysdera crocata \uf0b7 Impacts of introduced vertebrates, such as rats, mice & frogs (Rattus rattus, Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus and Strongylopus grayi) \uf0b7 How can the optimal habitat of the species be promoted/expanded? 26 7. Conservation and management 7.1. Research and status The conservation status of P. atlantica has been assessed for the first time, through funding from FFI\u2019s Flagship Species Fund, which has led to P. atlantica being classified as Critically Endangered (under criteria B1ab(i,ii,iii,iv,v); B2(i,ii,iii,iv,v); C2a(ii); D) according to IUCN Red List criteria (Lambdon, 2015). 7.2. Habitat restoration All potential habitat for P. atlantica now lies within the Central Peaks National Park (part of the recently designated National Conservation Area network), and will be protected under the National Conservation Area development plans, which are expected to be in place in the near future.

Lambdon 2015, pers. comm.). Modified wind breaks have been put in place since to provide some protection to plantings (Fig.10). The cloud forest habitat not only supports P. atlantica, but is also vitally important for the survival of highly threatened epiphytes (e.g. common and dwarf tongue- ferns, Elaphoglossum conforme and Grammitis ebenina and several specialized invertebrate species (e.g. the rainbow leaf beetle Vernonia wollastoniana and the endemic spider Tecution mellissii) (Lambdon, 2015). 27 Figure 10: The extent of the invasive plants situated alongside the black cabbage tree woodland at the Dell. Areas have been cleared as part of the ongoing Darwin project aiming to replant native vegetation which requires windbreaks to allow seedling establishment (R. Cairns-Wicks). 7.3. Captive breeding In 1993, as part of a wider ZSL invertebrate survey visit, a limited investigation of the Central Peak invertebrates, a relatively numerous population was seen and a small number of living specimens were collected as an initial ex-situ breeding attempt. Unfortunately the population died shortly after arriving in UK, testifying to their delicate nature (Mr P. Pearce- Kelly 2016, pers.comm.March). The habitat restoration work will take many years to mature sufficiently for the habitat requirements of P.atlantica. The Darwin Plus project therefore was initially aiming to start the captive breeding programme for P.atlantica, effectively safeguarding this species by allowing time for habitat restoration (Lambdon, 2015). The aim was to set up the captive breeding colony in 2015 at St Helena Government\u2019s conservation facilities on-island (the \u2018Scotland\u2019 site), aiming to secure a nucleus of individuals under protected management which can be used to populate an eventual reintroduction programme (Lambdon, 2015). However, due to unforeseen circumstances, this aspect of the current Darwin Plus project has now changed to focus on habitat restoration and further understanding the newly found P. atlantica sites. 28 Several knowledge gaps are identified: \uf0b7 What habitat management techniques will have minimal impact on the conditions of the existing P.atlantica sites? \uf0b7 What defines the population of P. atlantica? \uf0b7 How could a captive breeding programme be started without harming the wild population? \uf0b7 What are the requirements that must be met in the captive population to optimize captive breeding? \uf0b7 What are the resource needs to enable a captive breeding programme to be established? 29 CONSERVATION STRATEGY PLANNING Methodology To develop the conservation strategy of the spiky yellow woodlouse the handbook of the IUCN Species Survival Commission (IUCN SSC 2008), strategies from other species and advices from experts were used, particularly the Crau plain grasshopper (Hochkirch et al., 2014). Definitions of Vision, Goals, Objectives and Actions were adopted from the IUCN SSC handbook. The way they interact through the conservation strategy planning is shown in Fig. 11. Figure11: Conservation strategy planning. Utilised from the Crau Plain Grasshopper Conservation Strategy, adapted from IUCN/SSC (2008). As defined in the handbook, actions must be SMART: specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-bound. Targets were included in actions and goals. 30 Workshop To develop this conservation strategy for the spiky yellow woodlouse, the approach of the IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC) was used and technical support and expertise was sought from the IUCN Invertebrates Conservation Sub-committee, the IUCN Species Conservation Planning Sub-Committee and the Mid Atlantic Island Invertebrate Specialist Group. The IUCN SSC conservation planning approach requires a review of the species\u2019 status and its threats, and development of a Vision, Goals, Objectives and Actions.

Workshop programme is given in Annex I. 31 VISION The Central Peaks cloud forest ecosystem is a unique habitat whose biodiversity value will be restored and expanded to create high quality well- connected cloud forest, such that it will sustainably support a viable population of the spiky yellow woodlouse Pseudolaureola atlantica, which are found only in this ecosystem. The species will be a flagship for the conservation of the Central Peaks and all invertebrates on St Helena. The vision was carefully worded to reflect the following points: (i) \u2018Support a viable population\u2019: more studies are needed on population dynamics, habitat suitability and threats to define a minimum viable population (ii) \u2018High quality well-connected cloud forest\u2019: protected natural habitat suffers from fragmentation, thus protection, enhancement and restoration is urgently needed (iii) \u2018Flagship for conservation\u2019: largely unknown to the public, so awareness has to be enhanced. Once the vision had been defined, the workshop participants identified how to achieve this vision. GOALS, OBJECTIVES AND ACTIONS See Table 2: Actions Details Sheet for details for each Action.

i Drafting process and acknowledgements A \u201cDe-extinction Task Force\u201d was established in April 2014 under the auspices of the Species Survival Commission (SSC) and charged with drafting a set of Guiding Principles on Creating Proxies of Extinct Species for Conservation Benefit to position the IUCN SSC on the rapidly emerging technological feasibility of creating a proxy of an extinct species. The core group of the Task Force was chosen to represent a wide range of expertise relating primarily to species conservation, but with no a priori position, either for or against the concept of species \u201cde-extinction\u201d. The drafting process started with the production of a scoping document to define the terms of reference for the group, and to clarify the scope of the proposed document. Several preliminary drafts were circulated, reviewed and amended by Task Force members. The Task Force was chaired by Philip Seddon, co-chaired by Axel Moehrenschlager, and comprised H. Resit Ak\u00e7akaya, Liz Ben- nett, Mike Bruford, Neil Cox, Piero Genovesi, Henry T. Greely, Claire Marris, David Oehler, and Will Turner. Additional input and advice during the preliminary drafting phase was provided by Paul Smith, Craig Hilton-Taylor, Claudio Campagna, Tammy Steeves, Patrick Whittle, and Richard Maloney. Mike Hoffmann served as the SSC Steering Committee liaison, while Simon Stuart retained oversight for this project. A first draft was presented to SSC Chair Simon Stuart, and submitted to the SSC Steering Committee, its Subcommittees, all Specialist Groups and Task Force Chairs, and affiliates for review between May and September 2015. A further consultation was held during the SSC Leaders\u2019 Meeting in September 2015, in Abu Dhabi ,UAE.

The increasing public profile of species \u201cde-extinction\u201d has been driven in part by rapid advances in the technical capacity to read and manipulate genetic code. The discussion around revival of extinct species has shifted from \u201ccould we?\u201d to \u201cshould we?\u201d As with almost any new technology, enthusiastic endorsement needs to be balanced against significant con- cern over any possible harmful consequences. To date, \u201cde-extinction\u201d candidate lists have featured species that are beloved, missed, charismatic, i.e. primarily larger mammals and birds. This taxonomic bias that pervades \u201cde-extinction\u201d wish lists tends to mirror the bias in current ecological research and conservation management, and to some degree even our knowledge of what has gone extinct. However, the stated primary ratio- nale for pursuing the creation of proxies for extinct species has been framed around ecological enrichment, and the case has been made that \u201cde-extinction\u201d with environmental release is fundamentally a conservation translocation issue that seeks to re-establish populations of proxy species in suitable areas of habitat to achieve ecosystem conservation benefits. The requirement for sufficient area of habitat might be most easily met for species that have gone extinct in very recent times when ecological conditions were similar. The creation of proxies for species that went extinct in the more distant past is more likely to face significantly different ecological conditions in potential recipient sites, increasing uncertainty and the risks of unwanted outcomes, and reducing the likelihood that any conservation benefits would be achieved. This document sets forth SSC guiding principles on the creation of proxies for extinct species, as defined in Section II, as a po- tential conservation tool to restore biological diversity, to enhance ecosystem stability and resilience, and to engage in meaningful dialogue with the public about the role of proxy creation for conservation. This is a controversial topic, supported or opposed on the basis of a wide range of biological, economic, political, and ethical viewpoints. This document does not aim to cover all aspects of \u201cde-extinction\u201d, but is focussed on the potential for the creation of ecological replacements for extinct species to yield conservation benefits while minimising the likelihood of negative impacts on current conservation efforts, extant species, the environment, and local livelihoods. The principal objectives of these guidelines are: to outline the current SSC consensus view of the key issues, considerations, and implications of species \u201cde-extinction\u201d; to highlight critical areas of concern; to acknowledge opportunities, and uncertainties; to link this issue with other areas of SSC policy; and to set out guiding principles that seek to maximise conservation benefits and mini- mise harm. Note on Terminology The term \u201cde-extinction\u201d is misleading in its implication that extinct species, species for which no viable members remain, can be resurrected in their genetic, behavioural and physiological entirety. These guidelines proceed on the basis that none of the current pathways will result in a faithful replica of any extinct species, due to genetic, epigenetic, behavioural, physiological, and other differences1. For the purposes of these guidelines the legitimate objective for the creation of a proxy of an extinct species is the production of a functional equivalent able to restore ecological functions or processes that might have been lost as a result of the extinction of the original species. Proxy is used here to mean a substitute that would represent in some sense (e.g. phenotypical- ly, behaviourally, ecologically) another entity \u2013 the extinct form. Proxy is preferred to facsimile, which implies creation of an exact copy. The guidelines do not consider the application of techniques to address the conservation of extant species, such as cloning of extant rare species or the introduction of genetic variation into extant species that are at risk of inbreeding. \u201cDe-extinction\u201d is therefore here used in a limited sense to apply to any attempt to create some proxy of an extinct species or subspecies (hereafter \u201cspecies\u201d) through any technique, including methods such as selective back breeding, somatic cell nuclear transfer (cloning)2, and genome engineering (see Section V). Where possible the term \u201cproxy\u201d will be used to avoid the connota- tions of \u201cde-extinction\u201d.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "389e4015-d884-455c-986b-ab1d85e7891d": {"__data__": {"id_": "389e4015-d884-455c-986b-ab1d85e7891d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-ssc-guiding-principles-creating-proxies-extinct-species-conservation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN SSC guiding principles on creating proxies of extinct species for conservation benefit", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-ssc-guiding-principles-creating-proxies-extinct-species-conservation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d0af3726e458732ac73c00d12a3c0de1d06b0bed1d558ec5f37853fe9bc75484"}, "2": {"node_id": "3d84b942-08f1-4079-9a64-3e938ff28d9b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-ssc-guiding-principles-creating-proxies-extinct-species-conservation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8a07ad1f87ce280617b165f30cbfc4b2980c0b7efc72072c154be7da6638f46e"}}, "hash": "ce25a964ffb02e40821cb68c49fd220b92a8274c1865a26e20dbc1e5513c7bc2", "text": "1 Shapiro (in press) 2 The precautionary terminology adopted in these Guidelines is not intended to create an obstacle to equally precautionary cryo-banking of endangered species, and it is acknowledged that advances in interspecies cloning might open up the best pathway to the production of faithful genomic copies of an extinct species in some taxonomic groups. 2 Section II\ufffd Scope of this guidance To achieve conservation benefits, proxies of extinct species need to be", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "db5aae8d-4077-49cc-968a-a76e32fe9315": {"__data__": {"id_": "db5aae8d-4077-49cc-968a-a76e32fe9315", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-ssc-guiding-principles-creating-proxies-extinct-species-conservation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN SSC guiding principles on creating proxies of extinct species for conservation benefit", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-ssc-guiding-principles-creating-proxies-extinct-species-conservation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7fe672dd951edf6696cc8749657588c291c47556ab084428a22dec372707962e"}, "3": {"node_id": "9a8af60b-a4e4-4857-aac1-65118216a8ca", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-ssc-guiding-principles-creating-proxies-extinct-species-conservation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7fdf0912e7266980e19077f2473675452e76376f91157bc0feb30ed929ae9699"}}, "hash": "44dbc57217260fc7590f56a4050748cd316d73b3ec0d015967dc40d744b90271", "text": "more than attractions or laboratory test cases. They would have to be translocated into suitable areas of habitat where they would be free to interact with other species. For this reason these guidelines proceed on the basis that proxy creation for conservation benefit is in large part a conservation translocation issue, where conservation translocation is defined as \u201cthe intentional movement and release of a living organism where the primary ob- jective is a conservation benefit: this will usually comprise improving the conservation status of the focal species locally or globally, and/or restoring natural ecosystem functions or processes\u201d 3. Therefore the focus of these guidelines is based on achieving spe- cies-and-ecosystem-level conservation goals through conservation translocations, including ecological replacements (sensu 3). The guidelines were not written to apply directly to other uses of the relevant technologies, such as for exploitation, biological research or for public display, although they might have some relevance in those settings. \u201cDe-extinction\u201d could be said to have been achieved with the live birth, hatching, or germination of any reasonable proxy of a once extinct species. Such a \u201crevival\u201d, either of a few individuals or by creating a captive breeding population, might by itself have some research, educational, or entertainment value, but the wider success as a conservation tool must consider post-release perfor- mance and the status and persistence of a re-established population, and the wider ecological impacts. The current focus is on vertebrates, especially birds and mammals, reflecting the focus of current and proposed \u201cde-extinction projects\u201d. However, these guidelines are intended to be applicable, as appropriate, to \u201cde-extinction\u201d of any taxon. For example, risk of impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services will be relevant to all taxa. These guidelines should not be construed as endorsing, encouraging, or facilitating the creation of proxies of extinct species for conservation benefit, nor do they assume that proxy creation will inevitably become part of the conservation toolkit. The guidelines do intend to highlight the considerable risks and uncertainties any such projects would entail, and to set out principles which, if adhered to, might head off ill-conceived projects and enhance the net conservation benefits of responsible projects. Framing statement It is now widely believed that technological advances will soon make it possible to produce sufficient numbers of sufficiently geneti- cally diverse individuals to form functional proxies of some extinct species. It is therefore timely to ensure that this endeavour, if it is pursued at all, is pursued responsibly, with minimal harmful impacts, so that demonstrable, explicit, additive, conservation benefits in terms of enhanced ecosystem stability and resilience can be realised. \u201cDe-extinction\u201d, or proxy species creation, as with some current conservation interventions, poses a moral hazard (see also Section III) \u2013 a situation whereby one party takes more risks because another party will bear the costs of those risks. Changing public perceptions could undermine current and future conservation efforts if proxy creation is seen as providing a techno-fix to the crisis of species extinctions and biodiversity loss. Efforts in this arena should be positioned to the public as supporting, not replacing, the conservation of extant species and ecosystems. Conservation prioritisation is a valid means to apportion scarce resources for species conservation, but should not consider techno- logical advances as providing a viable means of even temporarily suspending efforts to avert the extinction of some species in the expectation of later revival, since even if appropriate cryo-preserved samples are kept, the complexity of the original species and its full ecological role and interactions are unlikely to be fully restored. The priority must remain the preservation and enhancement of extant biodiversity, with proxy species creation in an attempt to restore biodiversity being undertaken only when consistent with preserving existing biodiversity 3 IUCN 2013 3 Section III\ufffd Background information \u201cDe-extinction\u201d has captured the attention of sections of the scientific community and the general public alike.

The inevitable advancement and refinement of techniques, such as CRISPR (Cluster Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)-based editing (see Section V.3.), will improve the accuracy and reduce the costs of genome engineering for proxy species creation. Unprecedented progress in this arena seems likely in the coming decade. Ethical and economic issues As an ethical point \u201cde-extinction\u201d represents a form of \u201cmoral hazard\u201d. Moral hazard, initially used in economics, refers to a situ- ation where one party takes more risks because another party, willingly or unwillingly, will incur the costs if things go badly. In the \u201cde-extinction debate\u201d, the moral hazard is that the prospect of \u201cde-extinction\u201d will cause the current generation to believe that any extinct species can be resurrected by future generations, resulting in reduced societal and political support for conservation mea- sures to prevent species extinctions, or situations whereby future generations will inherit any problems caused by \u201cde-extinction\u201d efforts. Such moral hazard issues are unresolved and need to be debated at all levels. Other concerns might arise from a view of the natural world having a well-ordered and unchanging nature, to a charge of the hubris of believing that scientists can improve on nature, through to concern that biotechnologists have insufficient understanding of the things we are manipulating to be able to avoid unacceptable impacts. It is believed that humans have a moral obligation not to render species extinct, but it is unclear if this extends to a moral obligation to resurrect them. It has been argued that humans alive today owe a debt of restorative justice where humans were responsible for past extinctions, although the exact cause of past extinction is often unclear. The counter argument to this line of reasoning goes that species, especially those that no longer exist, cannot be owed a debt of restorative justice. The individual organisms that were wronged by extinction are not alive today and nor are those who caused the extinction, so a debt cannot be paid by those who owe it to those who are due it5. Economic aspects of \u201cde-extinction\u201d include the issue of effective use of financial resources. The technical stages of proxy species creation \u2013 in creating the first few specimens and then managing a captive population \u2013 will have costs. Unless new funding is attracted to proxy species creation by funding sources, which would not otherwise invest in conservation, diversion of funds might be at the expense of efforts to conserve extant species. Concern has been expressed that proxy species creation is being pursued for commercial gain, rather than for conservation bene- fits. Realistically, legitimate commercial elements will likely be involved in \u201cde-extinction\u201d technology development and implementa- tion, but the underlying motives around such support will need to be addressed and should be made explicit from the outset. In balance proxy species creation might have a negative utility via unwise expenditure if projects use funds that could contribute to preventing extinctions happening in the first place or if there is reduced investment in conservation due to the expectation of future technical fixes to current problems; through health concerns if proxy species are vectors for pathogens or provide novel selection pressures for pathogens; due to the deleterious environmental impacts if released proxies become invasive or pests. Although there will be concerns and issues around animal welfare during laboratory, rearing and post-release stages, these are not immedi- ately the focus of these guiding principles. \u201cDe-extinction\u201d efforts could be associated with a positive utility primarily via environmental benefits, but also through proxies as a source of inspiration; for the advancement of scientific knowledge in general; for specific technological advancement, and through educational and cultural values. Assuming humans do not have an overriding ethical obligation to resurrect long-extinct species, ecological, welfare, legal, moral, and socio-economic concerns need to be addressed for the creation of proxies of extinct species to be ethically acceptable. 4 Redford et al. 2014 5 Sandler 2013 4 Section IV\ufffd Technical overview: the three pathways of proxy creation, potential, and limitations Currently three pathways for proxy creation are recognised: selective breeding, cloning, and genome engineering.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0554dc3e-f28c-488f-a4a4-96b8359121c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "0554dc3e-f28c-488f-a4a4-96b8359121c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-ssc-guiding-principles-creating-proxies-extinct-species-conservation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN SSC guiding principles on creating proxies of extinct species for conservation benefit", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-ssc-guiding-principles-creating-proxies-extinct-species-conservation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8ec57f551bc62b6341441f1059d69ef5b6b910f8263fd23b28930bb5d9e0198a"}, "2": {"node_id": "7bc1a96d-732b-429c-b9e1-e19aaa5f5b65", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-ssc-guiding-principles-creating-proxies-extinct-species-conservation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3a2a2046e18f467ea33c66e88450b4f11f3d06ce716dfdb0c1c2423fd9bd6205"}}, "hash": "85b1c45b44e38bc89cbdf2c8f71eb131dfc332a299aa605aa64477190a3f48ba", "text": "1\ufffd Selective back-breeding An extant close relative, descendant, or hybrid form of the extinct species is selectively bred for ancestral traits, relating to geno- type, phenotype, or behaviour (animals), or signalling (plants).

Examples Some domestic breeds of cattle (Bos taurus) have been selectively bred for size and colouration to resemble the extinct Auroch (Bos primigenius) from which they descended6. Plains zebra (Equus quagga) have been selectively bred for pelage colouration and patterning to closely resemble the quagga (E. quagga quagga), a now-extinct subspecies7. It has been proposed that giant Galapagos tortoise hybrids could be selectively bred, guided by genetic screening, to concentrate original alleles in an attempt to restore the genetic integrity of an extinct form8. Potential When the functional role of an extinct form is adequately understood, selective back breeding could have the potential to create a functional equivalent. Limitations Forms derived via selective back breeding might most commonly be phenotypic proxies and perhaps functional equivalents of the extinct form; the degree of genetic similarity might be unknown but is likely to be limited due to hybridisation or the many genera- tions and multiple selection pressures since the descendant form was separated from the original. The greater the genetic differ- ence relative to the original form, the greater the uncertainty over the post-release performance of the proxy. This approach is dependent on there being one or more suitable descendant or related form assumed to retain the genetic potential for expression of ancestral traits or some of the relevant ancestral alleles. There is potential for ongoing hybridisation with related species, with unknown implications. 2\ufffd Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer (Cloning) For mammals, the nucleus of a somatic cell taken from an individual of an extinct species is removed and inserted into the enu- cleated egg cell (cell from which the nucleus has been removed) of a suitable surrogate species. The cell is induced to start to divide and the embryo is implanted into the surrogate host to gestate to term. Cloning is currently most advanced for mammals and amphibians; the first ever clones were of northern leopard frogs in the 1950s.This has been done successfully with many mammal species, with more or less safe results for offspring. The first mammal to be cloned from non-embryonic/non-fetal cells was Dolly the Sheep (Ovis aries) in 1996. Dolly was cared for at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh until her death five months before her seventh birthday. The first threatened species to be cloned was the gaur (Bos gaurus); a baby bull named Noah was delivered in 2001, but died within 48 hours due to common dysentery. The banteng (Bos javanicus) is the second threatened species to be successfully cloned; the first cloned bantang calf was born in 2003 and lived at San Diego Zoo for seven years, dying there in 2010. In 2008 clones of a grey wolf (Canis lupus) were born from somatic cells harvested post mortem. As of early 2015, nearly 20 mammalian species have been cloned using somatic cell nuclear transfer. For birds, somatic cell nuclear transfer currently seems impossible. The problem with cloning birds is that egg cell contains a large quantity of yolk that makes identification of the nucleus extremely difficult, and the female must be killed to obtain a newly ovulated egg because by the time an egg is laid the embryo has already begun to develop on the yolk. Genomic engineering techniques, discussed below, will be needed for birds. Cloning techniques have been developed for plants and amphibians, but is not yet clear whether reptiles can be cloned. If the cryo-preserved cells are gametes then in vitro fertilisation might be possible, thus avoiding the considerable challenges of so- matic cell nuclear transfer, though the use of gestation surrogates would still be necessary for mammals, with the attendant issues 6 Stokstad 2015. 7 The Quagga Project http://www.quaggaproject.org 8 Poulakkis et al. 2008. 5 around interspecies cloning910.

Cloning is suitable currently only when cryo-preserved tissue samples are available, most likely limiting the application of this approach to the resurrection of recently extinct species. Limitations Cloning is currently a relatively inefficient process for many species. In mammal cloning, for example, many eggs are required to derive viable embryos, and many embryo implantations are required to achieve even partial gestation and few live births. Clones in many species have had a tendency to developmental abnormalities and premature aging, leading to suffering and to short lives, which has led to significant ethical concerns and would negate any potential for conservation benefits. Cloning is fully dependent on the availability of intact somatic cells that have been stored appropriately, restricting the application of this approach to efforts on recently extinct species. Finding a suitable surrogate host for mammals, and bird cloning, pose some significant additional technical challenges. Production of multiple clones from one source will not provide any basis for population restoration. Multiple separate successful clones are necessary to ensure sufficient genetic diversity for a founding population. Epigenetic effects, the influence of the rearing environment, the absence of appropriate conspecific learning opportunities, and other factors (e.g. microbiome and inheritance of the mtDNA of the gestational surrogate in interspecies mammal cloning15) could result in the creation of proxies that differ in unknown and unpredictable ways from the extinct form, even as clones of the original. 3\ufffd Genome engineering16 With genome engineering, the genome of the extinct species is first read with reference to many specimens \u2013 likely of skin, bone, feather, seed, spore, pollen, and other tissue suitably preserved in museum collections. If there are gaps in the genome sequence of the extinct form, they can be filled in with the genome of a nearest living relative. The genomes of living relatives will also be se- quenced and cell lines will be created from the cells of a genomically similar extant species. Cells in that cell line will then be edited, using CRISPR/Cas9 or other technologies, to replace important DNA sequences characteristic of the extant species with synthe- sized DNA with the extinct species\u2019 sequence. The nuclei from these cells would then be inserted into a cell capable of forming an embryo, effectively performing somatic cell nuclear transfer. The embryo is implanted into a surrogate for gestation and birth (for mammals). For birds, the cells would be introduced into the reproductive organs of similar extant bird species to produce chimeras that were birds of the extant species that had germ cells from the extinct species. Male and female birds with the extinct species\u2019 germ cells would then be mated to produce individuals with the genome of only the extinct species. This method could also be done with mammals, algae, fungi, and plants, where it might prove easier than cloning. Examples There are no higher-order examples of proxy species creation using this genetic reconstruction and hybridization technique, but in 2005 researchers reconstructed the virus responsible for the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic, recovering material from autopsy samples and from a victim buried in Alaskan permafrost, and using non-coding regions from a closely related influenza virus17.

Potential This is a feasible approach for the creation of proxies of species that went extinct before suitable cell samples could be collected and frozen, but recently enough so that good DNA sequencing is possible. It is made possible by advances in the ability to read and reassemble ancient DNA, and to make rapid, multiple changes in base pairs. It extends back in time the potential of species \u201cde-extinction\u201d to pre-historic extinctions hundreds of thousands of years ago, but not to millions of years. One approach is to use an understanding of the extinct genome to re-engineer extant forms to express specific desirable traits once present in the extinct species, such as cold-tolerant elephants as proxies for woolly mammoths. In creating novel life forms that share an incomplete set of traits with the extinct species, this approach starts to move away from the essence of species re-creation.

The potential of this technique for human gene therapy could rapidly advance the technology and a spin-off benefit might be improvements in the ability to manipulate the genomes of a wide range of animal species, including for the reconstruction of proxies of extinct species. Limitations DNA is a fragile molecule and there are limits to how far back in time it will be possible to go since degradation of ancient DNA cre- ates gaps and uncertainties. The more gaps the greater the proportion of the reconstructed genome that must derive from a near relative. Genome engineering requires a suitable near relative to provide the appropriate gene sequences to fill gaps around the scaffold of the reconstructed genome and, in mammals, to act as gestational surrogates. The resulting hybrids will not be genetically identical to the extinct form, and the expression of hybrid traits might be unpredictable, not least due to epigenetic effects. Significant technical challenges remain, but these are not considered to be insurmountable. 18 The Long Now Foundation http://longnow.org/revive/species/passenger-pigeon/ 19 Shapiro 2015 20 de Souza 2015 7 Section V. Overview of potential benefits and disadvantages of creating proxies of extinct species This section discusses the potential benefits and risks specifically of proxy species creation that involves the environmental release of resulting individuals. This is necessarily a simple list as many of the possible benefits and disadvantages in relation to the cre- ation of proxies of extinct species have little or no published evidence or analysis. Potential Benefits Restore biodiversity Loss or depletion of species from ecological communities can reduce the stability of ecosystems21. In contrast, restoring biodiversi- ty, including through the establishment of populations of proxies of species that were there formerly or which are ecological equiva- lents of such species, or the creation of unique or distinctive evolutionary lineages, might increase ecosystem stability in the face of environmental change, promoting network diversity and reducing loss of other species. Enhance ecosystem function and resilience A defensible objective of proxy species creation for intended conservation benefit is enhancement of ecosystem resilience in the face of changes, the restoration of critical functions lost through extinction, and the re-establishment of ecosystem engineering functions that can serve to reverse changes. Creation of proxy keystone species could support the restoration or maintenance of ecosystem services, including enhancing eco- system resilience in the face of environmental change22. Engage public support The hope of revival of once extinct species unfailingly captures public interest, and for many people the prospect of being able to see proxies of once extinct species could be a source of inspiration and wonder23. Proxies of extinct species successfully restored to a natural environment have potential to become flagship species for conservation, could provide a strong rationale for the pres- ervation or restoration of habitat, and might be a means to reconnect people with the natural world in ways that could translate to conservation awareness beyond just the proxy. Socio-economic impacts Positive socio-economic impacts from released proxies could include direct effects through increased employment in projects or through associated tourism24, and indirect impacts through beneficial effects on ecosystem services and cultural values. Technological advances that could benefit extant species Techniques relevant for proxy species creation, such as reading and reconstructing ancient DNA, allele transfer, and cloning, could be applied to the conservation of extant species25, for example via genetic rescue as a means to increase the genetic diversity of relict populations through the reinsertion of genetic sequences retained only in museum specimens, or through enhanced tech- niques for the captive breeding of threatened species with mating systems that are not compatible with confinement. 21 Dirzo et al. 2014 22 Zimov 2005 23 Sherkow and Greely 2013 24 Whittle et al. 2015 25 Jones 2014 8 Disadvantages Financial and opportunity costs To achieve the desired ecosystem-level goals, a population must be re-established in suitable areas of habitat, entailing translo- cation and post-release care and monitoring. The not-inconsiderable costs required for preparation, transport and release, and post-release management, will fall to conservation management bodies and will require resources, not just money but scarce human resources, that would otherwise be applied to the ex situ and in situ conservation of extant species. Therefore work on proxy species will, to some extent, carry both financial and opportunity costs that must be balanced against expected conservation benefits.

Decreased support for preventing extinctions Public support for species conservation has been built around a sense of urgency and loss. There are valid concerns that even the prospect of species \u201cde-extinction\u201d could negate the powerful message that extinction is forever and lead to reduced support for the conservation of extant species26, especially highly threatened species, because of views that these could subsequently \u201cjust be resurrected\u201d. The precautionary creation of frozen zoos could reinforce a false sense of complacency in the face of impending extinctions. This represents a moral hazard (see Section III) that has been discussed in the context of \u201cde-extinction\u201d without any resolution, but which requires more discussion within the conservation community. Unacceptable suffering by individuals There are severe, well documented welfare concerns in relation to processes around the production of animal clones, including the suffering of new individuals and of gestational surrogates, around the provision of appropriate animal husbandry for proxies of once extinct species, and around post-release survival of animals following translocation into novel ecosystems27. Positive welfare states must be ensured for individuals to meet their physical and psychological needs. Risks to surrogate species Beyond animal welfare concerns for surrogate individuals, the requirement of near relatives for some proxy creation pathways might necessitate use of extant species that are of conservation concern themselves. This is equivalent to the risk to source popu- lations harvested to provide founders for the captive breeding and/or translocation of extant species. Uncertainty about species, behaviour, and post-release performance These guidelines consider that none of the current pathways can fully replicate the offspring that would have resulted from natural mating of the focal species before extinction. Species \u201cde-extinction\u201d is therefore here described as proxy species creation. Proxies of extinct species might constitute novel species28 by having unfamiliar ecological traits and being non-resident (having no recent evolutionary history) in a release area. In addition, there might be a lack of knowledge about the natural population dynamics of proxies, or lack of knowledge over behavioural deficiencies or their mitigation. Invasiveness A proxy species might become invasive if its establishment and growth causes damage to the environment, or to human economy or health. The negative effects of the proxy species might appear only long after its release into the wild. These negative impacts can be due to genetic factors associated with the proxy species creation process, or behavioural factors arising from the rearing environment, or because of ecological and environmental changes since extinction that mean any release will likely take place into an ecosystem where resident species have never encountered the original form of the proxy. Novel disease vectors No organism can be or remain entirely free of infection with micro-organisms or parasites. The release of a species that has been absent from an area, or of a proxy species never previously present, carries risk of spread of disease, particularly from captive fa- cilities. Similarly, specialized parasites or pathogens might have been lost, and released individuals might be vulnerable to diseases they have never before encountered. The samples used to obtain DNA might harbour currently unknown pathogens. New associa- tions with disease-causing agents not previously encountered might make proxy species novel vectors for disease. 26 Pim 2013 27 Wells 2005. 28 Saul & Jeschke 2015 9 Inadvertent resurrection of ancient pathogens Endogenous retroviruses reside in genomes and could be resurrected along with the proxy of the focal species. There is a small but non-negligible risk that any such retroviruses could become exogenous again. Hybridisation with extant forms There is a risk of hybridisation with closely related forms in the release area, jeopardising the genetic, population, or ecological properties of extant species. Hybridisation risk might be increased due to the process by which a proxy species has been created and by the use of surrogates for gestation and early rearing. Ecosystem impacts A proxy species, once placed in the wild, might have major undesirable and unforseen impacts at its destination on other species or on ecosystem functions. The post-release performance and impacts of proxy species will be subject to risk and uncertainty arising from genetic and epigenetic factors, the influence of the rearing environment, and unpredictable interactions with biotic and abiotic elements following release into what will possibly be novel ecosystems. The consequences of ecological replacements using prox- ies of extinct species might be more difficult to predict than if using extant species for which more is known.

Re-extinction There is a risk of project failure resulting in the (re)-extinction of the proxy species. Failure to establish a population of a proxy species might be due to a range of factors, including habitat mismatch, novel pathogens, unexpected inter-specific interactions, conflict with humans, the absence or aberrant expression of critical behaviours in the relation (e.g. behaviours related to foraging, predator avoidance, migration, breeding), and due to structural or physiological impairments (e.g. failure of the parallel restoration of an appropriate microbiome). 10 Section VI\ufffd Guiding principles The IUCN SSC considers that the creation of a proxy of an extinct species, as described in Section II as including environmental release, will pose risks but has the potential to derive a conservation benefit when programmes incorporate the following com- ponents. It is also important to emphasise that none of the guidelines given below addresses the fundamental ethical issues discussed above (see Background). The IUCN SSC strongly encourages dialogue amongst opponents and proponents of \u201cde-ex- tinction\u201d, affected stakeholders, and the public, and the implementation of extremely precautionary policies and enforcement mech- anisms prior to the undertaking of any \u201cde-extinction\u201d effort. Expectation of conservation benefit 1. There should be a priori positive justification for engaging in proxy species creation based on the expectation of a posi- tive conservation benefit, i.e. increasing ecosystem stability and resilience, and/or reducing losses in other species (see Section V). It is inappropriate for the creation and release of a proxy of an extinct species to be considered conservation neutral, as there will be at least some risks/costs in even ideal scenarios. If the objective for the creation of a proxy of an extinct species is the derivation of a functional equivalent able to restore ecological functions or processes that might have been lost as a result of the extinction of the original species, then the positive justification should be ecological, and in its absence \u201cde-extinction\u201d would seem unjustified. Selection of \u201cde-extinction\u201d candidates 2. Alternative ecological replacements must be considered because in many cases a suitable ecological proxy might be found amongst extant species. Moreover, it would most likely be easier, less costly, and quicker to use extant proxies than to engage in the creation of proxies, and there would be more information available to predict ecological impacts. So, not only would the proxy form need to provide the anticipated ecological function, but it would need to do so better (and with less cost/risk) than the translocation of members of an extant species. 3. Selection of candidates should apply criteria in addition to the technical ability to recreate a species, considering among other factors: ultimate conservation benefits, invasive potential, generation time, human/wildlife conflict potential, the po- tential to control populations or reverse releases should unacceptable negative impacts occur, and overall ecological roles. The conservation goal of the programme should be clearly defined before the start, and a full species plan addressing all of these issues should be prepared before any programme is initiated. 4. Early candidate selection should evaluate the possibility to re-establish natural species assemblages through translocation into suitable areas of habitat where the primary threats that led to extinction in the first instance are absent or controllable, with the intention of establishing viable populations. 5. The 2013 IUCN Guidelines for Reintroductions and Other Conservation Translocations provide a suitable, comprehensive, and well-accepted framework to consider feasibility and risks associated with the translocation-related aspects of proxy species creation, with particular focus on recognition of the potential for environmental risks due to unwanted post-release effects. These guidelines should form part of the basis for candidate selection29. Release of proxy species 6. Once legal and other requirements have been addressed then the primary focus of translocation planning, implementation and post-release assessment is the desired performance of the focal species.

The release of proxy species is not entirely different in nature from the translocation of extant species that have been ab- sent from an area due to local extinctions, but might differ in the degree of uncertainty involved, both in its harms and in its benefits. Any release of proxy species should be preceded by an in-depth risk assessment. Risk assessment should make use of the most appropriate tools and should take into account uncertainty, as well as the potential long-term effects of fac- tors of change, including climate change. There are parallels with the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms and the associated methods that have been developed to assess risks and monitor impacts. 29 Seddon et al. 2014. 11 10. Risks involved in the release of proxy species will usually increase as the following increase: o The extent of environmental change since extinction o The time since extinction of the original form o The genetic differences between the original form and the proxy species o The likelihood of unacceptable ecological impacts o The potential for negative impacts on human interests o The anticipated role and degree of critical interactions between the proxy species and others o The extent to which critical behaviours must be learned from experienced conspecifics. 11. The main categories of risk to be considered in relation to the release of a proxy species should be ecological, disease, gene transfer, socio-economic, and risk of project failure. The main categories of potential benefit are ecological, but also socio-economic. 12. A proxy species might have major impacts within a release area on other species and on ecosystem functions; its own performance might not be equivalent to that of the original species. In evaluating risks a careful approach should treat the proxy species as non-native to the release site, even where this lies inside the indigenous range of the original form. 13. A trial translocation, involving confinement facilities and staged releases, should be used to evaluate post-release per- formance, and to enable refinement for future translocations, while retaining the ability to terminate the trial should prior thresholds of unwanted impacts be reached. 14. Disease risk assessment should be part of the early planning phase and subject to periodic evaluation. 15. The risks of hybridisation with closely related species should be evaluated. 16. The probability of either negative or positive socio-economic impacts and public attitudes should be assessed during proj- ect planning and periodically during implementation. 17. Any translocation of proxy species must have an exit strategy should unacceptable impacts occur, entailing removal of all individuals from a release area. 18. The chosen release area should meet the total biotic and abiotic needs of the focal species, at the time of release and for the foreseeable future. Locations and species should be chosen with this requirement in mind. The longer the time since the extinction of the original form the greater the likelihood of environmental change that affects habitat suitability and project success. 19. Released individuals should be tagged appropriately and monitored. 20. Close genetic monitoring of founder stock, released individuals, and wild relatives is required to assess both success over time and potential introgression. 21. The 2013 IUCN Guidelines for Reintroductions and Other Conservation Translocations should be consulted in the plan- ning and implementation of any translocation of proxy species. Criteria for defining success 22. Programmes should include a set of criteria against which \u201csuccess\u201d is assessed. 23. Every \u201cde-extinction\u201d attempt should have clearly defined goals \u2013 a statement of the specific intended result that articulates expected conservation benefit (See also VI.1. Above). 24. For each goal there should be associated tangible objectives that detail how each goal will be realised. 25. Objectives should be developed that relate to the different components of a project. These could include: \u2022\ufffd Considering alternatives to achieve the desired conservation benefit \u2022\ufffd Feasibility studies \u2022\ufffd Project planning and consultation \u2022\ufffd Project implementation and evaluation 12 26. It should be understood that there is a strong possibility of significant differences from the original species, arising due to genetic variation, limited genetic variability, epigenetic effects, genetic stability, associated social and learning deficits, and the potential for altered ecosystem function in changed environmental conditions. 27. Genome-wide assessment and genetic architecture across taxonomic groups and their likely influence on success (above) need to be explored. Avoidance of opportunity costs 28.

Although some of the costs, particularly in the early technical stages, might be met by funding sources that are not ordi- narily available to conservation, proxy creation will likely require access to some level of resourcing that would otherwise be applied to the conservation of extant species; these resource costs must be made explicit, transparent, and understood by all stakeholders so that rational decisions can be made at all stages of project planning and implementation. 30. Evaluation of the costs and benefits of proxy species creation as compared to alternative management strategies to achieve similar conservation goals should be made as part of the early assessment of candidate and project feasibility. This should include consideration of selecting alternative ecological replacements from amongst extant species (see also VI.2). Ethical management of proxy species 31. All efforts should be made to minimise the suffering of individuals, of focal species, of gestational surrogates, and of other affected species, at every stage of the \u201cde-extinction\u201d process There are three options for the management of individuals of proxy species: Maintain in captivity 32. From the perspective of seeking conservation benefits, the perpetual captive management of all individuals of a focal ani- mal species should not be an expected outcome of any \u201cde-extinction\u201d program, but it is understood that some individuals might spend their lives in captivity. 33. Internationally acceptable standards for humane captive management must apply Release 34. Translocation into a suitable area of habitat is a necessary action to realise the conservation goals of proxy species cre- ation, and any translocation must apply conservation translocation best practice as detailed in the 2013 IUCN Guidelines for Reintroductions and Other Conservation Translocations. 35. Any translocation has risks and uncertainties and some post-release mortality is highly likely. These risks should be well understood, communicated to stakeholders and the public, and deemed acceptable in relation to anticipated benefits.. 36. Care should be taken to minimise stress and suffering during all stages of the translocation process. 37. A program of post-release monitoring of individual health and welfare is necessary, and contingency plans should be in place to provide post-release veterinary care as necessary. Euthanize 38. Euthanasia might be an appropriate action for individuals that are not suitable for release or for captive management that contributes to the establishment of wild populations. The conditions under which euthanasia would potentially be applied need to be identified in any project. 13 Section VII\ufffd Legal and Other considerations Legal and legislative implications \u2022\ufffd Legislation tends to categorise the protected status of native species on the basis of risks of extinction throughout the natu- ral or the national range. Proxies of extinct species would initially have no calculable metrics of population decline or range contraction, lacking even a current range. A case could be made that any proxy assumes the historic range of the species for which it is intended to be the functional equivalent, though environmental change might make that unrealistic in some cases. \u2022\ufffd Proxy species will be categorized differently by different authorities, and thus would not necessarily automatically replace extinct species within national or international legislation. \u2022\ufffd Many laws prohibit the release of non-native species. Proxy species might be considered to fit this definition, so that any release would be possible only as an exemption. \u2022\ufffd In addition to endangered species and invasive species laws, many jurisdictions have a range of wildlife and public land management laws that will significantly influence the creation and release of proxies of extinct species.30 International Conventions \u2022\ufffd It is unclear how proxy species be dealt with in e.g. CITES, CBD, or other agreements around biodiversity management or targets, and it is beyond the scope of these guidelines to make convention-specific recommendations. Each proxy species will have to be separately evaluated with reference to each piece of specific legislation. For example, the cloned banteng is considered a hybrid by the US Fish and Wildlife Service and is therefore not considered part of the banteng population; the American Zoo and Aquarium Association however, considers the same animal to be a banteng and includes it in studbook records. Proxy species as Genetically Modified Organisms \u2022\ufffd Proxy species creation using cloning or genome engineering (see Section IV3) will produce genetically modified organisms that will be subject to specific national or international legislation and/or regulation that might limit the ability to move organ- isms across boundaries and to release them into the environment. National regulations \u2022\ufffd National regulations determine the status and degree of protection of organisms within national borders.

Hence, its taxonomic name should reflect that. \u2022\ufffd Internationally accepted guiding principles and standards of taxonomy, when such are available for created proxy species, should be followed. Red Listing and species status implications \u2022\ufffd The Red List criteria can be applied to any taxonomic entity, but apply only to wild populations inside their natural range, or populations resulting from conservation introductions; all individuals in a highly managed state or in captivity are excluded except in as much as a species can be listed as Extinct in the Wild as long as such individuals survive under such conditions \u2022\ufffd Proxy species, therefore, might qualify for listing as Extinct in the Wild on the IUCN Red List31, while all individuals remained in captivity or in a highly managed state, but this could be with the proviso that the proxy has survived beyond some as- yet-to-be determined period of time. It remains unclear how close a proxy would have to be to the original species to fully subsume its representation on the Red List. \u2022\ufffd Before any proxy species are assessed for the IUCN Red List, IUCN SSC should develop standards for identifying such forms on the IUCN Red List. This could be a standard method of naming such forms (e.g. the name of the surrogate host species, followed by the name of the original form or the intended proxy species), in combination with an indication of the genetic method used. 30 Camacho 2015 31 IUCN 2012 14 Section VIII\ufffd The policy context In large part there is a policy vacuum in relation to the specific issue of creating proxies of extinct species for conservation benefit. This is because few examples of such proxies exist, and even fewer where conservation benefits are sought. By necessity there- fore, these guidelines are anticipatory. Nevertheless, there are some relevant policies that apply to particular aspects. Two of the recognised pathways to proxy creation, cloning and genome engineering (see Section V), would result in the production of a genetically modified organism (GMO) as defined in the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (CPB) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD 2000). The importation of GMOs is regulated by the CBD 2000, which regulates the international trade of GMOs with those countries that have ratified the CPB. It is a supplementary agreement to the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity that \u201cseeks to protect biological diversity from the potential risks posed by living modified organisms resulting from modern biotechnolo- gy.\u201d It establishes an Advance Informed Agreement (AIA) process to ensure that countries are provided with the sufficient informa- tion with which to make informed decisions before agreeing to the import of GMOs into their territory. Individuals of proxy species could be classified as Living Modified Organisms (LMOs), defined in the Cartagena Protocol as \u201c\u2026 any living organism that possesses a novel combination of genetic material obtained through the use of modern biotechnology\u201d. The CPB uses the term LMO to distinguish living GMOs from GM products, because the scope of the CPB is the protection of biodiver- sity. IUCN Resolution 3.007 (IUCN 2004) called for a moratorium on further environmental releases of GMOs until these can be demon- strated to be safe for biodiversity, beyond reasonable doubt; and directed the IUCN to support initiatives to ratify and implement the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. The IUCN Guidelines for the Prevention of Biodiversity Loss Caused by Alien Invasive Species (IUCN 2000a) draw on and incor- porate relevant parts of the 1987 IUCN Position Statement on Translocation of Living Organisms and the 1998 IUCN Guidelines for Re-introductions (now replaced by the 2013 IUCN Guidelines for Reintroduction and other Conservation Translocations). The guidelines are concerned with preventing loss of biological diversity caused by biological invasions of alien invasive species, but do not address specifically the issue of genetically modified organisms.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c538e39-08ae-475c-a9f3-9708fad4e8f6": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c538e39-08ae-475c-a9f3-9708fad4e8f6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-ssc-guiding-principles-creating-proxies-extinct-species-conservation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN SSC guiding principles on creating proxies of extinct species for conservation benefit", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-ssc-guiding-principles-creating-proxies-extinct-species-conservation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f1e483ced4afe4d5b7c015233966ab7e60cf34c8abd679b30e5a721591a7ca57"}, "2": {"node_id": "f1fc1290-172d-489a-895d-cc185af94880", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-ssc-guiding-principles-creating-proxies-extinct-species-conservation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2d2bc39eaf5b64d30e477eade5dc1b09c6fe8e9a8e0ee33e2d882e28d64154b8"}}, "hash": "e678c97149a7afd561cf9c3f3ca68fb98bb3c7f7a2cd48649aa87d34f5a4c02e", "text": "Proxy species might fit the definition of \u201calien species\u201d due to genetic differences from the original form and/or where releases take place outside the former indigenous range of the extinct species.

Proxies of extinct species would be classifiable according to IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN 2012, 2014 a). The IUCN Guidelines on the Use of Ex Situ Management for Species Conservation (IUCN 2014 b) present a 5-step decision making process for determining when ex situ management is appropriate. This emphasises a need for clarity over the role of ex situ management in species conservation, which could include the provision of individuals for all forms of conservation translocation. The guidelines also highlight a need for ensuring that the resources and expertise needed for ex situ management are suited to meet the specific conservation role, and are thus relevant to the captive management of proxy species. The IUCN Guidelines for Reintroductions and Other Conservation Translocations (IUCN 2013) provide detailed guidance on the intentional release of any organisms for conservation benefit, and would apply to any proposed release of individuals of a proxy species. These Guidelines have many relevant provisions, including providing a basis for candidate selection, for assessment of the feasibility of releases taking into account species biology, habitat requirements, social feasibility, and regulatory compliance. Guidance is also given on release, monitoring, and ongoing management of newly establishing populations. Particular attention is given to risk assessment, and of specific relevance to the release of proxy species is Section 6.6, where the following is noted: \u2022\ufffd Ecological risk: a translocated species may have major impacts (whether desirable/undesirable, intended/ not intended) at its destination on other species, and on ecosystem functions; \u2022\ufffd Disease risk: as no translocated organisms can be entirely free of infection with micro-organisms or parasites, with con- sequent risk of their spread, disease risk assessment should start at the planning stage, with its depth in proportion to the estimated likelihood of occurrence and severity of impact of any prospective pathogen 15 \u2022\ufffd Associated invasion risk: separate from the risk of pathogen introduction, translocation design should be mindful of the wider biosecurity of the release area: care should be taken that potentially invasive species are not accidentally released; \u2022\ufffd Gene escape: where organisms are moved outside their indigenous range, and there is a risk of hybridisation with close- ly-related species or subspecies, this may possibly result in lower fitness of offspring and/or loss of species integrity. Also, the IUCN Guidelines for Reintroductions and Other Conservation Translocations (IUCN 2013) recommend that any translo- cation includes an \u201cexit strategy\u201d in the case of evidence of undesired and unacceptable consequences, to allow for orderly and justifiable reversal of any releases. The Guidelines for Wildlife Disease Risk Analysis (OIE-IUCN 2014) propose a standardised and consistent Disease Risk Analysis (DRA) framework, that should be applied in any assessment of the disease risks potentially posed by proxies as the best way to analyse risks and generate the insights needed to make informed decisions about where to focus risk management actions.

Es un acto afirmativo, no coercitivo, que se basa en obtener informaci\u00f3n de forma oportuna, en el tiempo preciso y adaptada culturalmente, para ser analizada libremente por quienes ostentan derechos y puedan dar o no una aprobaci\u00f3n. El contar con legislaci\u00f3n que reconozca la necesidad de implementar el CLPI y sobre todo reconocer el derecho de los pueblos ind\u00edgenas y comunidades locales a ser part\u00edcipes de la toma de decisi\u00f3n sobre aspectos que puedan impactar sus vidas, es fundamental pero no suficiente. Podemos decir que ha habido avances importantes en materia de participaci\u00f3n p\u00fablica que inician con la declaraci\u00f3n Universal de los Derechos Humanos y que avanzan paulatinamente pasando por la Declaraci\u00f3n de las Naciones Unidas sobre los Derechos de los Pueblos Ind\u00edgenas, el Convenio 169 de la Organizaci\u00f3n Internacional del Trabajo, el Convenio sobre Diversidad Biol\u00f3gica y la Convenci\u00f3n Marco de las Naciones Unidas para el Cambio Clim\u00e1tico. El CLPI lleva a los pueblos ind\u00edgenas y comunidades locales un paso m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de la mera consulta que muchas veces no contempla el derecho a la r\u00e9plica, los conduce a dar un consentimiento, o no, para avanzar con una obra, acci\u00f3n o proyecto en los lugares donde habitan o gozan de sus derechos. Es por ello que hay aspectos pr\u00e1cticos que deben ser considerados, por ejemplo que la informaci\u00f3n sea proporcionada en forma temprana a quienes pueden dar este consentimiento, como acci\u00f3n vital para que se pueda dar un an\u00e1lisis pertinente. Tambi\u00e9n debe priorizarse el desarrollo de capacidades t\u00e9cnicas y administrativas que ayuden a evaluar la veracidad, implicaciones y alcance de la informaci\u00f3n que se suministrar\u00e1 y as\u00ed alcanzar una acertada toma de decisi\u00f3n. Debe de contarse con sistemas de gobernanza inclusivos que busquen el consenso de la comunidad respetando sus propias normas consuetudinarias.

La consulta se fundamenta en el derecho ciudadano a la participaci\u00f3n efectiva en la toma de decisiones sobre proyectos, medidas, leyes y actividades que puedan afectarles. Mientras que el CLPI, se refiere al derecho de los Pueblos Ind\u00edgenas y Comunidades Locales a dar su consentimiento o no sobre acciones, proyectos, etc. que puedan impactar no s\u00f3lo sus medios de vida, sino aspectos sociales, culturales y econ\u00f3micos del espacio que habitan. Tanto la consulta como el CLPI son derechos reconocidos a nivel internacional y nacional en los pa\u00edses de la regi\u00f3n centroamericana. Recientemente, el mecanismo REDD+ ha abierto una ventana de oportunidad para que los pa\u00edses dise\u00f1en sus propuestas de Consulta y CLPI en el marco de las estrategias nacionales REDD+. Este mecanismo surge en las negociaciones de la Convenci\u00f3n Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Clim\u00e1tico (CMNUCC), como parte de los esfuerzos para mitigar los efectos del cambio clim\u00e1tico, contribuyendo con la reducci\u00f3n de las emisiones globales de carbono provenientes de la deforestaci\u00f3n y degradaci\u00f3n forestal y ofreciendo incentivos financieros para detener o revertir la p\u00e9rdida de los bosques (Climate Law & Policy, 2015). La implementaci\u00f3n del mecanismo REDD+ no solo involucra aspectos t\u00e9cnicos forestales, sino tambi\u00e9n implicaciones sociales, culturales, econ\u00f3micas y ambientales sobre las comunidades locales y pueblos ind\u00edgenas que habitan en los espacios geogr\u00e1ficos en donde est\u00e1n situados los bosques. Esto es especialmente importante en esta regi\u00f3n, donde alrededor del 25% de la propiedad forestal es de las comunidades ind\u00edgenas y rurales (Sunderlin, Hatcher y Liddle, 2008). Las inquietudes relacionadas con los efectos sociales, culturales, econ\u00f3micos y de desarrollo que en general pueda tener el mecanismo REDD+ (Pesketta y Todda, s.f.), llevaron a la CMNUCC a acordar siete salvaguardas que provean un marco de protecci\u00f3n sobre esos posibles impactos en personas y el medio ambiente. Las siete salvaguardas de Canc\u00fan son las siguientes2: 1. La complementariedad o compatibilidad de las medidas con los objetivos de los programas forestales nacionales y de las convenciones y los acuerdos internacionales sobre la materia. 2. La transparencia y eficacia de las estructuras de gobernanza forestal nacional, teniendo en cuenta la legislaci\u00f3n y la soberan\u00eda nacionales. 3.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d26ac78-a2ac-42fb-a8ac-c01c741d7c6c": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d26ac78-a2ac-42fb-a8ac-c01c741d7c6c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/es/resources/literatura-gris/lineamientos-para-la-consulta-y-consentimiento-libre-previo-e-informado", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Lineamientos para la Consulta y Consentimiento Libre, Previo e Informado en el marco de las salvaguardas ambientales y sociales para proyectos REDD+", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/es/resources/literatura-gris/lineamientos-para-la-consulta-y-consentimiento-libre-previo-e-informado", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "539aebc3732fd3dac31949bee2aa988dde95baa05a5439579447371bab63d473"}, "2": {"node_id": "b60a6ec9-462f-407c-b4f9-883114c56457", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/es/resources/literatura-gris/lineamientos-para-la-consulta-y-consentimiento-libre-previo-e-informado", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "159cea9414f9e4f63026f515426ea5cdb0441fdd3140bd92b33455b2ae6d711e"}}, "hash": "ebd23fae04659577f05844774274a8be0a9d7419fccc4c14aef2a35be403a90b", "text": "3.

La consulta se fundamenta en el derecho ciudadano a la participaci\u00f3n efectiva en la toma de decisiones sobre proyectos, medidas, leyes y actividades que puedan afectarle. No es una acci\u00f3n \u00fanicamente informativa, es un proceso de di\u00e1logo, negociaci\u00f3n y acuerdo entre las partes para llegar a decisiones de mutuo beneficio (consentimiento), lo que implica el intercambio y an\u00e1lisis de la informaci\u00f3n, di\u00e1logo, consultas, opiniones, llevadas a cabo con una comunidad local o pueblo ind\u00edgena que garanticen un conocimiento suficiente acerca de un proyecto para poder tomar una decisi\u00f3n informada. El Consentimiento Libre, Previo e Informado (CLPI), por su parte, es la decisi\u00f3n tomada libremente como resultado del proceso de consulta realizado mediante las estructuras locales y normas consuetudinarias de toma de decisiones, y puede ser otorgado (\u201cs\u00ed\u201d) o negado (\u201cno\u201d) en cualquier etapa de un proyecto REDD+.

Existe un ejemplo de referencia obligada sobre los derechos colectivos de los pueblos ind\u00edgenas, particularmente su derecho a la propiedad colectiva, es el caso de la Comunidad Mayangna (Sumo) Awas Tingni vs. Nicaragua14.

Implementando medidas pr\u00e1cticas para una consulta efectiva Estas medidas surgen de la vinculaci\u00f3n de las experiencias obtenidas en la construcci\u00f3n de gu\u00edas y bioprotocolos de Consulta y CLPI en Nicaragua y Guatemala, con las medidas propuestas por la ONU-REDD (2013b), as\u00ed como de la referencia del estudio de caso de Costa Rica19. 1. Construya participativamente la metodolog\u00eda de consulta Para realizar una consulta en actividades y proyectos REDD+, es necesario que las comunidades construyan una metodolog\u00eda junto con la entidad designada por el Estado para realizar la consulta (el Estado es responsable de garantizar y aplicar la consulta). Cualquier metodolog\u00eda que se genere tiene que cumplir con principios y requisitos fundamentales contemplados en la legislaci\u00f3n internacional y nacional, relativos al respeto a la autodeterminaci\u00f3n, la participaci\u00f3n y normas consuetudinarias de las poblaciones ind\u00edgenas y comunidades locales.

La metodolog\u00eda se define y var\u00eda a partir de las caracter\u00edsticas de la comunidad y del asunto que se va a consultar. b. La metodolog\u00eda debe ser consultada y debe ser un acuerdo construido, negociado y consensuado con la comunidad en donde se va a implementar un proyecto, respetando su estructura de gobernanza y toma de decisi\u00f3n, su cultura y cosmovisi\u00f3n. c. El Estado es el responsable de aplicar la consulta, por lo tanto, es sugerido que dentro de la estructura estatal exista una dependencia con experiencia en procesos de Consulta, que ayude a aplicar metodolog\u00edas espec\u00edficas para cada caso, a partir de los principios generales que dan legitimidad a la consulta.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "080ac08b-dfc3-4ac3-9ee0-27a8d94c2c90": {"__data__": {"id_": "080ac08b-dfc3-4ac3-9ee0-27a8d94c2c90", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/es/resources/literatura-gris/lineamientos-para-la-consulta-y-consentimiento-libre-previo-e-informado", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Lineamientos para la Consulta y Consentimiento Libre, Previo e Informado en el marco de las salvaguardas ambientales y sociales para proyectos REDD+", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/es/resources/literatura-gris/lineamientos-para-la-consulta-y-consentimiento-libre-previo-e-informado", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c6331dd2b5183db8540176dfffc15d0d4326a7faa94fbb3a35d889f6ae6b66b1"}, "2": {"node_id": "19bfe14d-5b4e-4cf6-aa8c-7a64d89dc23a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/es/resources/literatura-gris/lineamientos-para-la-consulta-y-consentimiento-libre-previo-e-informado", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7a09ebee5b52680edddf2ac9c0a00f929bdb44bf5d0114e3c219c9fa8744b672"}}, "hash": "c4412fa5468963e736980caa32d8186e552d62d556036d6c46f693a7244d1161", "text": "d.

Implica escuchar y definir las propuestas de los diferentes sectores.

Este es un trabajo importante, al que usualmente no se le da mucho \u00e9nfasis y que es muy necesario para la siguiente fase.

Es principalmente un proceso de intercambio de informaci\u00f3n, an\u00e1lisis claro y transparente, di\u00e1logo y discusi\u00f3n; y la definici\u00f3n de intereses comunes que permitan eventualmente alg\u00fan acuerdo. 2. Defina los resultados deseados de la consulta La consulta es b\u00e1sicamente un proceso que se lleva a cabo para lograr el consentimiento de la poblaci\u00f3n sobre un tema en particular. Sin embargo, el proceso en s\u00ed da otros resultados igualmente beneficiosos, como lo son el fortalecimiento de capacidades sobre derechos y obligaciones de participaci\u00f3n, la gobernanza, la conservaci\u00f3n, el promover la negociaci\u00f3n, el consenso, la apertura de di\u00e1logo sobre temas o asuntos de inter\u00e9s mutuo, etc. En Costa Rica, por ejemplo, durante la fase informativa del proceso de consulta, se analizaron el Convenio 169 y las salvaguardas de Canc\u00fan, y las comunidades ind\u00edgenas interpretaron estos elementos de acuerdo con su realidad y cultura, se fortaleci\u00f3 tambi\u00e9n la participaci\u00f3n de la mujer en los procesos, as\u00ed como la ruta cr\u00edtica de los temas especiales de los pueblos ind\u00edgenas. Como se se\u00f1ala en el documento Evaluaci\u00f3n Estrat\u00e9gica Social y Ambiental de Costa Rica (junio 2015), \u201cla consulta ser\u00e1 un instrumento de consolidaci\u00f3n y cohesi\u00f3n social entre los sectores participantes a partir de la generaci\u00f3n de consensos, objetivos y programas comunes, sectoriales e intersectoriales\u201d (p. 16). Las experiencias territoriales indican que un proceso de consulta contribuye con una mejor definici\u00f3n de las estructuras de gobernanza y toma de decisiones a lo interno de las comunidades, y fortalece su capacidad de negociaci\u00f3n y relaciones de respeto mutuo con el gobierno y otros sectores. Al plantear resultados, se debe determinar por mutuo acuerdo el grado de participaci\u00f3n que tendr\u00e1n las partes interesadas en cada punto del proceso de consulta. En el estudio de caso de la Ecorregi\u00f3n Lachu\u00e1, por ejemplo, se definieron momentos en que dependiendo del tema, algunos grupos de la poblaci\u00f3n recibieron informaci\u00f3n, pero no participaron en la decisi\u00f3n20. Igualmente en Costa Rica, algunas decisiones intermedias en el proceso de consulta son tomadas por los representantes que las comunidades han elegido, y estos son los encargados de llevar la informaci\u00f3n y recibir las opiniones de los miembros de la comunidad. En territorios muy extensos \u2013como la Mosquitia hondure\u00f1a, con 72 000 habitantes\u2013, puede considerarse la toma de decisiones \u201cescalonada\u201d, lo que significa que las decisiones las toman representantes leg\u00edtimos de la comunidad luego de un proceso informativo en asambleas comunitarias.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "871b259b-9cb2-438d-a177-d3a949cbdd87": {"__data__": {"id_": "871b259b-9cb2-438d-a177-d3a949cbdd87", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/es/resources/literatura-gris/lineamientos-para-la-consulta-y-consentimiento-libre-previo-e-informado", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Lineamientos para la Consulta y Consentimiento Libre, Previo e Informado en el marco de las salvaguardas ambientales y sociales para proyectos REDD+", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/es/resources/literatura-gris/lineamientos-para-la-consulta-y-consentimiento-libre-previo-e-informado", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a41f3cd9a674ffa7ba2c825ddd65892736f5ac547de2a30b2afb59d0ea92a728"}, "2": {"node_id": "04b9a054-7889-4600-9ce9-fba772e960fa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/es/resources/literatura-gris/lineamientos-para-la-consulta-y-consentimiento-libre-previo-e-informado", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7c26240ff492a3d69426bc18f573e9d22813b36c6d0132e91e97e1b17fcd2b38"}}, "hash": "435d519c11ade863b235542640bd66ebefc399c416f0e5baa1597ecd3f223151", "text": "Esto debe definirse en funci\u00f3n de costos, tiempos y de acuerdo con las normas de la comunidad, y est\u00e1 relacionado con el principio de proporcionalidad, en el sentido de que los costos y tiempos de llegar directamente a todos los miembros de las comunidades, especialmente en territorios muy extensos y de dif\u00edcil acceso, ser\u00edan muy altos. 20 El estudio de caso de la Ecorregi\u00f3n Lachu\u00e1 se bas\u00f3 en la sistematizaci\u00f3n de la experiencia de consulta interna, realizada en el 2012 ante la insta- laci\u00f3n de un proyecto hidroel\u00e9ctrico en la comunidad Rocja Pomtila. 30 3.

Este mapa de poder debe ser consultado o construido con la comunidad, ya que ellos conocen cu\u00e1les son esos actores relevantes, as\u00ed como los representantes leg\u00edtimos. En Costa Rica, por ejemplo, el Acuerdo Nacional Ind\u00edgena para la Consulta21 define sus representantes leg\u00edtimos y los divide en tres categor\u00edas: a) los establecidas por ley como gobiernos locales ind\u00edgenas (ADIS), b) las organizaciones ind\u00edgenas espec\u00edficas y c) las organizaciones tradicionales culturales.

Aplique el enfoque de g\u00e9nero Los convenios internacionales, leyes y declaraciones que tutelan los derechos de los pueblos y comunidades locales y las directrices REDD+ llaman a considerar la inclusi\u00f3n de hombres y mujeres23, la cual se concreta en la participaci\u00f3n plena, informada y efectiva de hombres y mujeres en la toma de decisiones y en el acceso a beneficios. Eso implica que al igual que los hombres, las mujeres deben discutir y generar sus propuestas de beneficios y tener lugar en la toma de decisiones dentro del proceso de consulta, facilitando condiciones adaptadas a sus necesidades y capacidades particulares. Los beneficios no pueden definirse de forma gen\u00e9rica; m\u00e1s bien debe concretarse el tipo de beneficio, a qui\u00e9n beneficia y de qu\u00e9 forma.

Este an\u00e1lisis no debe limitarse al papel de las mujeres en la sociedad, sino que implica necesariamente estudiar formas de organizaci\u00f3n y funcio- namiento de las sociedades bas\u00e1ndose en las relaciones sociales dadas entre mujeres y hombres Alfaro et al., 1999). Se debe resaltar el esfuerzo realizado durante las experiencias territoriales para proveer espacios que permitieran la participaci\u00f3n activa de mujeres, y rescatar sus contribuciones sin irrespetar las normas consuetudinarias de cada comunidad, lo que se reflej\u00f3 en el proceso y en los instrumentos generados (versiones extensas y populares). 32 La perspectiva de g\u00e9nero se consider\u00f3 una categor\u00eda de an\u00e1lisis para identificar las \u00e1reas donde las mujeres tienen presencia activa en la din\u00e1mica territorial, y los retos y oportunidades para potenciar procesos de Consulta y CLPI m\u00e1s inclusivos. Se les consult\u00f3 directamente c\u00f3mo quer\u00edan participar, se organizaron grupos focales, se hicieron entrevistas en espacios diferenciados y tambi\u00e9n mixtos a mujeres y hombres l\u00edderes, se realizaron din\u00e1micas que promovieran su confianza e inter\u00e9s en el proceso, se tomaron en cuenta sus puntos de vista, se incluyeron en las presentaciones plenarias, todo ello contribuy\u00f3 a una experiencia pr\u00e1ctica de integraci\u00f3n igualitaria de mujeres, hombres, ancianos y j\u00f3venes en el proceso. 5. Defina los aspectos por consultar En el marco de la REDD+, la experiencia indica que la primera consulta es precisamente sobre la metodolog\u00eda de consulta, la cual debe ser construida y consensuada con las partes interesadas relevantes definidas en el paso anterior. Panam\u00e1 es un ejemplo de la importancia de consultar la metodolog\u00eda, ya que la falta de consensos en el proceso de consulta ocasion\u00f3 la detenci\u00f3n del proceso REDD+, con la consecuente p\u00e9rdida de tiempo, recursos econ\u00f3micos y t\u00e9cnicos y, principalmente, la p\u00e9rdida de confianza entre las partes. La consulta es un proceso participativo donde las partes se informan, analizan, opinan y crean consensos; y por lo tanto debe abarcar cada etapa de la preparaci\u00f3n, implementaci\u00f3n, monitoreo y evaluaci\u00f3n en el mecanismo REDD+: el RPP (Paquete de Preparaci\u00f3n hacia REDD+), SESA (Evaluaci\u00f3n Social y Ambiental Estrat\u00e9gica), el Marco de Gesti\u00f3n, ERPIN (idea de proyecto para la reducci\u00f3n de emisiones), el ERP (Programa de Reducci\u00f3n de Emisiones) y el ERPA (Acuerdo sobre Elementos para el Pago de Reducci\u00f3n de Emisiones).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "02cd9672-c684-4487-ac29-cabdf7241b7f": {"__data__": {"id_": "02cd9672-c684-4487-ac29-cabdf7241b7f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/es/resources/literatura-gris/lineamientos-para-la-consulta-y-consentimiento-libre-previo-e-informado", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Lineamientos para la Consulta y Consentimiento Libre, Previo e Informado en el marco de las salvaguardas ambientales y sociales para proyectos REDD+", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/es/resources/literatura-gris/lineamientos-para-la-consulta-y-consentimiento-libre-previo-e-informado", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "235120e8f49ce45f9961839974fac79251d284b7defa67d86e1161aa416bec5c"}, "2": {"node_id": "67574ec4-2241-45b4-bd8a-d374dc14613b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/es/resources/literatura-gris/lineamientos-para-la-consulta-y-consentimiento-libre-previo-e-informado", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "26c39453de6534e3d22c587c8aa5078fb1449c22e2ee01360b6782134006f4a4"}}, "hash": "672eb0bf20c830126c725eabc9834d6265705777dd02c8c86f496f45554b93f4", "text": "En cuanto a aspectos puntuales que deben ser consultados \u2014sin perjuicio de otros que se definan\u2014, en general deben consultarse aspectos t\u00e9cnicos, sociales, pol\u00edticos y econ\u00f3micos: \u2022 Estado actual de los bosques nacionales. \u2022 Marcos institucionales, pol\u00edticos y regulatorios. \u2022 Principales causas y causantes de la deforestaci\u00f3n y la degradaci\u00f3n forestal. \u2022 Derechos y necesidades de los pueblos ind\u00edgenas y otras. \u2022 Tipo y patr\u00f3n de uso de la tierra por parte de los pueblos ind\u00edgenas. \u2022 Derechos sobre la tierra (derechos de uso y propiedad, tradicionales y consuetudinarios), y sistemas de tenencia de la tierra. \u2022 Derechos sobre el carbono. \u2022 Dise\u00f1o de sistemas de distribuci\u00f3n de los beneficios para la distribuci\u00f3n equitativa y eficaz de los ingresos. \u2022 Impactos y riesgos econ\u00f3micos, sociales y ambientales de REDD+ y mitigaci\u00f3n y prevenci\u00f3n de riesgos. \u2022 Dise\u00f1o de sistemas de seguimiento para llevar un registro de los bosques y las emisiones derivadas de la forestaci\u00f3n, as\u00ed como de los beneficios ambientales y sociales comunes. \u2022 Aspectos de gesti\u00f3n forestal y mecanismos para garantizar el pleno cumplimiento de las salvaguardas sociales y ambientales. \u2022 Costos de oportunidad del uso de la tierra. \u2022 Grupos que pueden resultar beneficiados o perjudicados.

Igualmente, se pueden establecer mesas de di\u00e1logo donde confluyan los representantes de las partes. En Costa Rica, los pueblos ind\u00edgenas definieron que su participaci\u00f3n comprender\u00eda tres etapas: a) informaci\u00f3n, que corresponde a una explicaci\u00f3n culturalmente apropiada sobre que es la REDD+ y los avances del proceso; b) la preconsulta, que es el espacio en el cual se desarrollar\u00e1 la discusi\u00f3n anal\u00edtica sobre los temas especiales ind\u00edgenas, salvaguardas y cobeneficios, entre otros; y c) la etapa de consulta como tal, que funge como una validaci\u00f3n final de la estrategia REDD+ y otros documentos. En las experiencias territoriales fue coincidente un esquema de cuatro fases, que conlleva pasos y actividades: I Prefactibilidad de la consulta: esta etapa es donde el Estado presenta el proyecto y se toma la decisi\u00f3n sobre la participaci\u00f3n en la consulta. II Planificaci\u00f3n y aplicaci\u00f3n de la consulta: esta fase inicia cuando la comunidad toma el acuerdo de que la consulta se realice; comprende la planificaci\u00f3n, la formulaci\u00f3n del plan de consulta, la identificaci\u00f3n de actores, el nombramiento de comit\u00e9s, el di\u00e1logo y el intercambio de informaci\u00f3n. III Negociaci\u00f3n y acuerdo: periodo de deliberaci\u00f3n, consulta, opini\u00f3n y acuerdo. IV Seguimiento y control: sobre la base de los acuerdos se formula un plan de seguimiento y control, y se nombran comisiones que operar\u00e1n este plan.

Ello hace necesaria una mediaci\u00f3n intercultural de contenido, de forma y de la metodolog\u00eda en todo el proceso de informaci\u00f3n y consulta a la comunidad. Para definir los m\u00e9todos de consulta y difusi\u00f3n, se debe considerar al menos lo siguiente: \u2022 Las etapas de la consulta (informaci\u00f3n, preparaci\u00f3n y capacitaci\u00f3n, y consulta). \u2022 El tipo de participaci\u00f3n definida de acuerdo con los intereses y el rol de las partes interesadas. \u2022 Las caracter\u00edsticas culturales y sociales de las partes. \u2022 Los resultados planeados para la consulta. Los instrumentos de Consulta y el CLPI a nivel territorial se construyeron bajo el principio de adaptaci\u00f3n, lo que implic\u00f3 primero mapear los representantes leg\u00edtimos de la comunidad; solicitar autorizaci\u00f3n para el proceso de construcci\u00f3n de la herramienta; realizar talleres, grupos focales con mujeres, l\u00edderes y lideresas, y organizaciones; incorporar metodolog\u00edas adaptadas (uso de gr\u00e1ficas, dibujos y elementos visuales con contenidos contextualizados a la comunidad); respetar los tiempos de la comunidad (esto implic\u00f3 entre otras cosas realizar las actividades en funci\u00f3n de tiempos libres de trabajo, actividades religiosas, celebraciones, etc.); disminuir las jornadas de taller en consideraci\u00f3n a sus labores y actividades; consultar la metodolog\u00eda en todo momento; y usar facilitadores o traductores locales en todas las actividades. 35 Otro aspecto importante fue el uso de la metodolog\u00eda \u201caprender haciendo\u201d, la cual permite el alcance de formas de construcci\u00f3n din\u00e1micas y evolutivas, conforme se desarrolla la capacidad de participaci\u00f3n, negociaci\u00f3n y gobernanza de la comunidad. Esto implic\u00f3 ir construyendo con la misma comunidad, devolviendo y validando cada paso del proceso simult\u00e1neamente conforme se fortalec\u00edan los conocimientos en derechos colectivos, Consulta y CLPI; y el levantamiento de organigramas de gobernanza interna, entre otros. La incorporaci\u00f3n de acciones diferenciadas para la participaci\u00f3n de mujeres fue consultada en cada taller, y aplicada respetando las formas tradicionales de relacionamiento entre hombres y mujeres. 8. Contribuya a que las partes interesadas sean capacitadas para participar de forma plena y eficaz en las consultas La consulta, como ya se ha mencionado, no es un simple intercambio de informaci\u00f3n, sino un mecanismo para materializar el derecho a la participaci\u00f3n informada en las decisiones que les afecten, por lo que la informaci\u00f3n, procesos y metodolog\u00edas deben ser plenamente comprendidos por las comunidades para que se pueda considerar una consulta efectiva. Particularmente en el tema REDD+, los contenidos pueden resultar demasiado t\u00e9cnicos y dif\u00edciles de comprender para quienes no est\u00e1n familiarizados, lo que obliga a contextualizar la informaci\u00f3n de manera que sea comprendida por todos.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b9ec8340-5e7a-4b73-90ae-8ca70565c7da": {"__data__": {"id_": "b9ec8340-5e7a-4b73-90ae-8ca70565c7da", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/es/resources/literatura-gris/lineamientos-para-la-consulta-y-consentimiento-libre-previo-e-informado", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Lineamientos para la Consulta y Consentimiento Libre, Previo e Informado en el marco de las salvaguardas ambientales y sociales para proyectos REDD+", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/es/resources/literatura-gris/lineamientos-para-la-consulta-y-consentimiento-libre-previo-e-informado", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "beeeab99da743b8f87b6807921714baaaf02506fa685ab079462d409a69af006"}, "2": {"node_id": "472c8cbf-cff2-477c-83ff-74fbad136b23", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/es/resources/literatura-gris/lineamientos-para-la-consulta-y-consentimiento-libre-previo-e-informado", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7d552b8c4f0691dbefa297d2a1f1871f722c81242c38f0b2fdc417f703781d07"}}, "hash": "6d2b33b5a21759f74de5c68d13ab6f5631be428e492290bcbf4b9d4387b55c64", "text": "En las comunidades ind\u00edgenas y comunidades locales donde la oralidad prevalece como forma de comunicaci\u00f3n, se debe proveer informaci\u00f3n por esa v\u00eda, en el idioma de la comunidad, y utilizar los recursos visuales que permitan el entendimiento de la informaci\u00f3n que se transmita. El caso de Costa Rica provee elementos fundamentales para asegurar esta medida: Desde etapas tempranas, los l\u00edderes ind\u00edgenas expresaron que la complejidad y el tecnicismo del proceso REDD+ ser\u00eda un desaf\u00edo para garantizar que las comunidades ind\u00edgenas contaran con un dominio total de la informaci\u00f3n. Por esta raz\u00f3n, uno de los bloques ind\u00edgenas (i.e. Red Ind\u00edgena Bri-bri Cab\u00e9car) propuso implementar el concepto de mediadores culturales, que fungen como personas ind\u00edgenas que han sido capacitadas en temas relacionados a REDD+, y que tienen la capacidad de brindar la informaci\u00f3n simplificada y en sus propias lenguas. Este proceso, lo implementan mediante los planes de comunicaci\u00f3n participativos, en los cuales se definen los canales de comunicaci\u00f3n adecuados para difundir la informaci\u00f3n, por ejemplo la conceptualizaci\u00f3n de REDD+ desde su cosmovisi\u00f3n. Entre los principales canales de comunicaci\u00f3n se encuentran di\u00e1logos entre la comunidad durante los talleres de pre-consulta, mantas con informaci\u00f3n sobre cambio clim\u00e1tico, la importancia del carbono en los bosques y las actividades REDD+. As\u00ed mismo, se utilizaron dos videos informativos, afiches sobre como los pueblos ind\u00edgenas interpretan el concepto de REDD+ seg\u00fan, su cosmovisi\u00f3n, cu\u00f1as de radio, panfletos y medios de comunicaci\u00f3n locales, tales como carteles y volantes. As\u00ed mismo, se cuenta con un sitio web, redes sociales (Fondo Nacional de Financiamiento Forestal, FONAFIFO, 2012, p. 16). Las experiencias territoriales de construcci\u00f3n de instrumentos de Consulta y CLPI evidenciaron los efectos positivos de propiciar un clima de aprendizaje en dos direcciones: 1) transmitiendo de forma culturalmente apropiada los conceptos de derechos humanos, derechos colectivos de pueblos ind\u00edgenas, negociaci\u00f3n, participaci\u00f3n, consulta, CLPI, etc.; y 2) entendiendo el contexto sociocultural, los distintos saberes, las formas de concebir el mundo y los modos de vida de las comunidades. El resultado de este proceso fue la definici\u00f3n de una metodolog\u00eda de consulta respetuosa de sus normas consuetudinarias y vivencias, donde prevaleci\u00f3 un ambiente de", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8baf7374-7139-4869-8a4c-fa904debe48d": {"__data__": {"id_": "8baf7374-7139-4869-8a4c-fa904debe48d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/es/resources/literatura-gris/lineamientos-para-la-consulta-y-consentimiento-libre-previo-e-informado", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Lineamientos para la Consulta y Consentimiento Libre, Previo e Informado en el marco de las salvaguardas ambientales y sociales para proyectos REDD+", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/es/resources/literatura-gris/lineamientos-para-la-consulta-y-consentimiento-libre-previo-e-informado", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0a66a0dc64620ea6c511b71868c9d225a1da17ff0894bef8613c15db2cbb13ef"}, "3": {"node_id": "f301f41c-cc17-4b5d-bec7-a1c37d43e0cd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/es/resources/literatura-gris/lineamientos-para-la-consulta-y-consentimiento-libre-previo-e-informado", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3754c003bb66e72082764c8418417758470359c7deb109512c38960ba4570986"}}, "hash": "4ffe8b08fff141b13a7059dcc271a938db23bcb1895d83962d90e45ab2b4dbde", "text": "di\u00e1logo y aprendizaje que permiti\u00f3 que ambas partes mejoraran sus conocimientos sobre la otra, y la comunidad queda con la capacidad instalada para participar en un proceso de consulta. 36 9. Realice las consultas La realizaci\u00f3n de las consultas, como ha quedado claro, es responsabilidad del Estado; este debe cumplir el plan de consulta consensuado previamente con las partes interesadas. De modo general, para la realizaci\u00f3n de las consultas, deben tomarse en cuenta, entre otras acciones, las siguientes: \u2022 Disponer de un sistema de informaci\u00f3n que promueva el flujo e intercambio de informaci\u00f3n y di\u00e1logo con las partes. Incluya un mecanismo de retroalimentaci\u00f3n y quejas que facilite la retroalimentaci\u00f3n de las partes y la presentaci\u00f3n de quejas e inconformidades. Este debe considerar diferentes canales (electr\u00f3nicos, telef\u00f3nicos, a trav\u00e9s de mediadores o representantes de la comunidad, etc.) y establecer claramente qui\u00e9nes, c\u00f3mo y los tiempos de respuesta. \u2022 Contar con un sitio web y medios electr\u00f3nicos y f\u00edsicos de difusi\u00f3n de informaci\u00f3n (mensajer\u00eda telef\u00f3nica, aplicaciones, afiches, radio, televisi\u00f3n, folletos, etc.), que sea comprensible para diferentes p\u00fablicos. \u2022 Realizar reuniones con los representantes leg\u00edtimos de las partes interesadas (organizaciones, autoridades, instituciones de gobernanza territorial comunitaria, sectores de la sociedad) definidos en el mapeo. \u2022 Mantener un flujo de informaci\u00f3n constante hacia las comunidades, los l\u00edderes, lideresas y representantes, con volantes, afiches, folletos, etc., adaptados culturalmente. \u2022 Facilitar una relaci\u00f3n cordial, de tolerancia, respeto, inclusividad y participaci\u00f3n en todas las actividades que se realicen. \u2022 Utilizar la mediaci\u00f3n cultural y traducci\u00f3n con personas propias del territorio o comunidad. \u2022 Es importante tener en cuenta que los cambios que se susciten en los acuerdos tomados deben ser consultados entre las partes interesadas seg\u00fan se vayan dando, y dependiendo de los impactos que causen en las condiciones originales pactadas, pueden invalidar el consentimiento y dar paso a un nuevo proceso de consulta.

Taller realizado en Rocj\u00e1 Pomtila, Alta Verapaz, Guatemala. 39 La experiencia en la construcci\u00f3n de instrumentos de Consulta y de CLPI VII Como se ha mencionado, la UICN ha facilitado experiencias territoriales para la construcci\u00f3n de gu\u00edas y bioprotocolos24 de Consulta y CLPI en Honduras, Nicaragua y Guatemala, que definen elementos desde la propia cosmovisi\u00f3n y normas cotidianas ind\u00edgenas y de comunidades locales, para operar un proceso de consulta que respete las normas internacionales, nacionales y consuetudinarias en proyectos, leyes, actividades y programas que se pretendan instalar en estas comunidades. Es importante aclarar que los instrumentos territoriales creados se elaboraron de forma que se adapten a cualquier proyecto, ley, programa o iniciativa que se pretenda instalar en la comunidad, que pueda estar relacionado con el mecanismo REDD+ o con cualquier otro tema. Las gu\u00edas y bioprotocolos describen el contexto geogr\u00e1fico, cultural y de gobernanza, el marco legal internacional y nacional, las estructuras de gobernanza interna y el esquema de toma de decisiones; y constituyen una especie de reglamentaci\u00f3n que facilita a las comunidades la organizaci\u00f3n interna para operar una consulta. En el marco de un proyecto REDD+, los bioprotocolos sin duda facilitan la organizaci\u00f3n interna para la implementaci\u00f3n de la consulta. Para la UICN, constituyen una fuente de primera mano para contextualizar y \u201cponer en terreno\u201d los principios y medidas que se proponen en diversos instrumentos legales y propios del mecanismo REDD+. Los productos generados en el proceso incluyen un documento principal (versi\u00f3n extensa) y cartillas (versiones populares), afiches en espa\u00f1ol y en el idioma propio, que pueden ser entendidos por cualquier miembro de la comunidad o persona externa; de esta manera, adem\u00e1s de las y los miembros", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "02271897-e35d-4cc3-aff3-da7c13317de6": {"__data__": {"id_": "02271897-e35d-4cc3-aff3-da7c13317de6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/es/resources/literatura-gris/lineamientos-para-la-consulta-y-consentimiento-libre-previo-e-informado", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Lineamientos para la Consulta y Consentimiento Libre, Previo e Informado en el marco de las salvaguardas ambientales y sociales para proyectos REDD+", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/es/resources/literatura-gris/lineamientos-para-la-consulta-y-consentimiento-libre-previo-e-informado", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "52fafc53bf54600332069a403e885b378025f581e0aec5ca5200be8c1e4e18f7"}, "3": {"node_id": "3f13dd3a-1812-4df7-891c-35b820a66f84", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/es/resources/literatura-gris/lineamientos-para-la-consulta-y-consentimiento-libre-previo-e-informado", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8c99050f4e456e638d0a2fb50a49cbee31810e65b063f943d3ceafb4947927ab"}}, "hash": "e09f822f8f6a50242721d6d07b6db30b3ae7f909e52ea605b3b01ba3e6211a72", "text": "de la comunidad, tambi\u00e9n las organizaciones, instituciones y empresas podr\u00e1n conocer sobre los derechos, deberes y medidas que conlleva implementar proyectos en una comunidad local o ind\u00edgena.

El proceso de Consulta y CLPI propuesto desde las comunidades Aun cuando las comunidades tienen diferentes estructuras de gobernanza, formas de tomar decisiones, elementos culturales y medios de vida que imponen especificidades, existe una serie de fases, pasos y actividades coincidentes que se han sistematizado en la siguiente gr\u00e1fica para ilustrar c\u00f3mo se consulta una comunidad ind\u00edgena o local (gr\u00e1fica 3). 43 Conclusiones VIII 4 La Consulta y el CLPI no deben verse por el Estado y los proponentes como un tr\u00e1mite m\u00e1s, o una carga presupuestaria y un proceso que atrasa el avance de proyectos, leyes, iniciativas y programas por instalarse en las comunidades. Por su parte, las comunidades no deben verlo exclusivamente como un medio para vetar obras o proyectos, u obtener beneficios que sean desproporcionados o insostenibles en relaci\u00f3n con las ganancias e impactos que generar\u00e1 el proyecto mismo. M\u00e1s bien, la Consulta y el CLPI deben considerarse por parte del proponente del proyecto y del Estado, como un mecanismo que puede dar mayor sostenibilidad econ\u00f3mica, social y ambiental a una inversi\u00f3n, y al mismo tiempo es un mecanismo tendiente a facilitar la participaci\u00f3n ciudadana en las decisiones sobre asuntos que ata\u00f1en a sus comunidades, recursos y formas de vida. 4 Es una oportunidad para que el Estado, la empresa privada y las comunidades trabajen conjuntamente por el desarrollo, y construyan credibilidad alrededor de negociaciones claras y transparentes en beneficio mutuo. Para las comunidades, es un veh\u00edculo para organizar, reorganizar o reglamentar sus procesos internos de gobernanza y toma de decisi\u00f3n.

La Consulta y el CLPI previenen estos conflictos y aseguran la sostenibilidad del proyecto a trav\u00e9s de la participaci\u00f3n efectiva de las comunidades, tanto en la toma de decisiones como en los beneficios que se generen del uso de sus recursos, traslad\u00e1ndoles al mismo tiempo capacidades para monitorear los impactos sociales y ambientales que los proyectos generen. 4 Los procesos de consulta son una oportunidad para mejorar las capacidades de organizaci\u00f3n y gobernanza interna en las comunidades locales e ind\u00edgenas, promoviendo la negociaci\u00f3n interna, la participaci\u00f3n inclusiva y la toma de decisiones con respeto a las legislaciones nacionales y normas consuetudinarias. 4 Un reto importante observado en las experiencias nacionales es la necesidad de establecer y monitorear los mecanismos de distribuci\u00f3n de beneficios, que aseguren de manera sostenible el desarrollo econ\u00f3mico y social, la conservaci\u00f3n ambiental y el progreso en general de las comunidades. 45 Referencias Acuerdo Nacional Ind\u00edgena para la Consulta Ind\u00edgena en el Proceso de Elaboraci\u00f3n de la Estrategia Nacional de REDD+ de Costa Rica San Jos\u00e9.
