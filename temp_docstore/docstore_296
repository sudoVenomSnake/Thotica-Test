Women experience high levels of domestic and gender-based violence, have poor reproductive health and are more likely to experience poverty. While gender mainstreaming is a core strategy of the Comprehensive Reform Program (CRP) to achieve gender equality and women empowerment, there are no effective central mechanisms to coordinate and monitor progress. The common view that girls and women are poor investment leads to discouragement to continue their education, which contributes to higher illiteracy rates for women and girls than boys and men, which directly affect their: \u00b7 Earning levels \u00b7 Ability to access information on their rights \u00b7 Lack of access to employment and promotional opportunities \u00b7 Ability to access essential services such as health clinics Both women and children are prone to domestic violence, rape and sexual violence, which causes serious health problems that include sexually transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS, depression and anxiety relating to stressful environments. Women\u2019s access to health care is not only related to unavailability of health care facilities but can also be related to women\u2019s undervaluation of self and a belief that they are not entitled. In addition, unequal access to resources and control over time, money and transport often hinder women\u2019s access to services. 24 GOAL 4: REDUCE CHILD MORTALITY Progress The under-five mortality rate is the probability (expressed as a rate per 1,000 live births) of a child born in a specified year dying before reaching the age of five if subject to current age-specific mortality rates. The infant mortality rate is defined as the number of infants dying before reaching the age of one year per 1,000 live births in a given year. Although the target relates specifically to under-five mortality, infant mortality is relevant to the monitoring of the target since it represents an important component of under-five mortality. Infant mortality rates measure child survival. The proportion of 1 year-old children immunized against measles is the percentage of children under one year of age who have received at least one dose of measles vaccine. Target 5 MDG Indicators The Master Health Services Plan 2004-2009 will provide the overall direction for all Health services in Vanuatu over the next five (5) years. The Plan focuses on five priorities as follows; \ufffd To base the delivery of Health services on a Primary Health Care Approach \ufffd To improve the health status of the people of Vanuatu \ufffd To improve access to services \ufffd To improve the quality of the services delivered \ufffd To make more effective use of resources The Plan also takes into account the Millennium Development Goals as the Ministry of Health has direct responsibility for a number of them. Health related indicators from the Millennium Development Goals have also been included in the Plan. Problems with data quality exist for some of the indicators, and as data quality improves, the indicators will be updated. 25 Indicator Life expectancy Crude birth rate per 1,000 (Ni-Vanuatu) Crude death rate per 1,000 Total fertility rate (Ni- Vanuatu) Under-five mortality rate per 1,000 live births Infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births Proportion of 1 year-old children immunised against measles Baseline for Vanuatu Females 69 Males 66 (1999) 37 (1989) 9 (1989) 5.3 (1989) 58 (1989) 45 (1989) 66% (1990) Most Recent Status 33 (1999) 6 (1999) 4.5 (1999) 33 (1999) 31 Males 33 Females 27 (1995) 27 Males 26 Females 75% (2001) 66% (2003) 2015 Target na 19 15 100% Target 5: Reduce by two-thirds, between 1990 and 2015, the under-five mortality rate VANUATU MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS REPORT - 2005 reduce child mortality Other indicators being monitored in the Master Health Services Plan 2004-2009 relevant to reducing child mortality include: Indicators for teenage pregnancy have been included here because of the high rates of infant mortality for this age group; but equally important are the high rates of maternal mortality for this group as well (see Goal 5). Under five mortality is declining, with a 43% reduction over the 10 years between 1989 and 1999 for child mortality and 40% for infant mortality. Vanuatu seems on track to achieve the MDG target, given the considerable resources being allocated to reducing infant and child mortality. The next time this indicator can be reliably updated will be from the 2009 population census. This indicator, which relates directly to the target, measures child survival.

Immunization rates from the Ministry of Health Provincial Health Information System for 2003 are included in the above table; however the wide range in rates implies that the data is not complete. The indicator provides a measure of the coverage and the quality of the child health care system in the country. Immunization is an essential component for reducing under-five mortality. Governments in developing countries usually finance immunization against measles and diphtheria, perussis (whooping cough) and tetanus (DPT) as part of the basic health package. Among these vaccine-preventable diseases of childhood, measles is the leading cause of child mortality. Health and other programmes targeted at these specific causes are one practical means of reducing child mortality. The geographical lay-out of the islands and the scattered rural community settlements are regarded as on going challenges for adequate coverage. There are places in the moumtains and coastal areas where the means of communication are limited and people refuse to have vaccinations. These are communities where implementers are unclear about the age of the target group, and experience difficulties to ensure better planning and more successful outreach programmes.

Skilled health personnel include only those who are properly trained and who have appropriate equipment and drugs. Traditional birth attendants, even if they have received a short training course, are not to be included. Measuring maternal mortality accurately is notoriously difficult, except where there is comprehensive registration of deaths and causes of death as is the case in Vanuatu. Several process indicators have been proposed for tracking progress by focusing on professional care during pregnancy and childbirth, particularly for the management of complications. The most widely available indicator is the proportion of women who deliver with the assistance of a medically trained health care provider. (Women\u2019s Maternal Health has wider focus which covers other areas of RH such as Family Planning, Reproductive Tract Infections and quality of and access to Emergency Obstetrical Care. Most of this section provides general information on the goal instead of Vanuatu. Results of the KAP Study analysed by UNFPA (Bill House) in 1999 identifies some of the socio-economic determinants of demographic behaviour, including knowledge and use of family planning as well as unmet need for family planning. For example, the analysis suggests a minimum of 24% of all women of reproductive age in Vanuatu have an unmet need for limiting additional births.

The Ministry of Health estimates that 50-60% of births occur in the home outside the health care system. The 1998 maternal mortality ratio is included here but a target has not been defined based on this as it is based on incomplete information on maternal deaths. Source: Ministry of Health, 2002 Leading causes of maternal death are similar to those reported regionally and globally: postpartum haemorrhage, pre-eclampsia, obstructed labour, puerperal sepsis, and complications of unsafe abortion. Important indirect causes include anaemia and malaria. Consequently, actions to improve the level of emergency obstetric care, as well as improving overall access to health care during pregnancy and childbirth, are priorities. Maternal health will also benefit from strategies that focus on improving nutrition for women and girls, on combating infectious and non-communicable diseases, on addressing reproductive health needs, and addressing issues such as violence against women. Considerable progress has been made in the proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel. Clearly some mothers are more aware of the importance of proper medical care during pregnancy, for births and after delivery. This rate provides an indication of the proportion of deliveries that take place in government managed health facilities. In Vanuatu, there is some concern that not all the population has the same access to high quality health services; which is particularly important in the case of birth as any complications during (and post) delivery must be treated immediately by properly trained medical professionals. In remote island and rural communities in Vanuatu, this emergency care sometimes is not available in time. In 2002, the Ministry of Health reported that 2,118 women had postnatal examinations, 58% of women delivering, indicating that post-natal health services are reasonably well attended by those participating in the \u2018formal\u2019 health system. The indicator is a measure of a health system\u2019s ability to provide adequate care for pregnant women. Concerns have been expressed that the term skilled attendant may not adequately capture women\u2019s access to good quality care, particularly when complications arise. Lack of access to or use of essential obstetric services is a crucial factor contributing to high maternal mortality, particularly emergency services when complications arise.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6a36a7fe-2124-4cf2-9db8-a63bb160490a": {"__data__": {"id_": "6a36a7fe-2124-4cf2-9db8-a63bb160490a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-mdgs-report-2005", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Vanuatu MDGs Report 2005", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-mdgs-report-2005", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7ebbedb61fe5a496497de6c17a2d5f8fe41b3d4f223cc55a77c6e2746f4c9cbd"}, "2": {"node_id": "7ec0a61d-0a04-4423-b739-611a724fe716", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-mdgs-report-2005", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "248895437f59bfb8f893a058b8be6e9e3b08c1f0d12eefed8ba26db1dcc66ef8"}}, "hash": "6eb64d9844612b6af85e154e198a1296b573e7f0ff745a488b41cf297192d31e", "text": "29 2002 5,903 2001 NA NA 2000 0 2,222 1999 0 2,084 1998 2 2,077 1997 4 2,411 Components of the MMR Maternal deaths Live births strong strong strong strong strong strong fair fair fair fair fair fair weak weak weak weak weak weak Tracking Progress Monitoring and evaluation components Data collection capacity Quality of recent survey information Statistical tracking capacity Statistical analysis capacity Capacity to incorporate statistical analysis into policy, planning and resource allocation mechanisms Monitoring and evaluation mechanism Assessment Progress GOAL 6: COMBAT HIV/AIDS, MALARIA AND OTHER MAJOR DISEASES Target 7: Have halted by 2015 and begun to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS HIV prevalence among 15\u201324 year old pregnant women is the percentage of pregnant women", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "135ad017-4ad1-4bb3-a1d0-d88294b91f83": {"__data__": {"id_": "135ad017-4ad1-4bb3-a1d0-d88294b91f83", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-mdgs-report-2005", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Vanuatu MDGs Report 2005", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-mdgs-report-2005", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "228388421d62f019f548534250ebd91ed9770d2ffca46a4f735fe3fe210e4fc2"}, "3": {"node_id": "f99091d8-c9ca-49e4-97e8-934e87f26012", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/vanuatu-mdgs-report-2005", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "77a9a1c117b45fd3a999fa23d48147b68f9c3ad85370f5e9a940b8dd671a9a48"}}, "hash": "29a31584a22899cf278f306012ad6a6678dffffa40221f1e16ea9ee3cb0a53c6", "text": "aged 15\u201324 whose blood samples test positive for HIV.

The condom use rate is used to monitor progress towards halting and reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS, because condoms are the only contraceptive method effective in reducing the spread of HIV, along with abstinence. Because the condom use rate is measured only among women in unions, this indicator needs to be supplemented by an indicator on condom use in high-risk situations. Condom use at last high-risk sex is the percentage of young people aged 15\u201324 reporting the use of a condom during sexual intercourse with a non-regular sexual partner in the last 12 months. Percentage of population aged 15\u201324 with comprehensive correct knowledge of HIV/ AIDS is the share of women and men aged 15\u201324 who correctly identify the two major ways of preventing the sexual transmission of HIV (using condoms and limiting sex to one faithful, uninfected partner, and abstinence), who reject the two most common local misconceptions about HIV transmission and who know that a healthy looking person can transmit HIV. The indicator reflects the success of national information, education and communication programmes and other efforts in promoting knowledge of valid HIV prevention methods and reducing misconceptions about the disease. The contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) is the percentage of women who are practising, or whose sexual partners are practising, any form of contraception. It is usually reported for women ages 15\u201349 in marital or consensual unions. Strictly defined, the number of children orphaned by HIV/AIDS is the estimated number of children who have lost their mother, father or both parents to AIDS before age 15. In practice, the impact of the AIDS epidemic on orphans is measured through the ratio of orphans to non-orphans who are in school.

Because HIV prevalence is not routinely monitored at present among high risk groups, and is not routinely tested at antenatal clinics, the actual extent of HIV infection in Vanuatu is not known. High risk groups include sex workers, their clients (including seafarers and other mobile populations), those who engage in \u201csurvival sex\u201d (those who exchange sex in return for favours, clothing, abusive substances, meals, etc.), men who have sex with men, young people deprived of parental care, and because institutional mechanisms need strengthening, there are concerns about contaminated blood supplies. There are indications, based on the high rates of STIs in Vanuatu, that if HIV begins to spread, it would become a major problem. In generalised epidemics (with prevalence consistently at more than 1% among pregnant women), the infection rate for pregnant women is similar to the overall rate for the adult population. Therefore, this indicator is a measure of spread of the epidemic. In low-level and concentrated epidemics, HIV prevalence is monitored in groups with high risk behaviour (because prevalence among pregnant women is low). No information is available about the population with comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS. However, a number of NGOs have been very active in STI/HIV/AIDS awareness raising and education, with many NGOs contributing towards awareness raising in their general programmes. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the level would be moderate to high in certain areas.

The Vanuatu Family Health Association also present a twice weekly radio programme on issues of reproductive health. Consistent use of condoms in non-regular sexual partnerships substantially reduces the risk of sexual HIV transmission as well as STI transmission. This is especially important for young people, who often experience the highest rates of HIV infection because they have low prior exposure to infection and (typically) relatively high numbers of non-regular sexual partners. Consistent condom use with non-regular sexual partners is important even in countries where HIV prevalence is low, because it can prevent the spread of HIV in circumstances where non-regular relationships are common. Condom use is one measure of protection against HIV/AIDS. Equally important are delaying age at first sex, reducing the number of non-regular sexual partners and being faithful to one partner. A 1998 study found that the level of information on contraception, condom use and safe sex practices was extremely low. The use of condoms was problematic, with females reporting considerable male resistance to using them and being accused of being promiscuous if suggesting condom use. The Ministry of Health has tried to increase availability to condoms through a wide distribution network but there are concerns that this is still erratic. While teenagers and youth might now better understand how HIV is transmitted after the numerous awareness raising activities conducted since the late 1990s, a \u2018Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices\u2019 type survey is required to see to what extent knowledge has improved. VANUATU MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS REPORT - 2005 combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other major diseases 31 Progress VANUATU MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS REPORT - 2005 combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other major diseases The Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (CPR) is increasing, although still just over one quarter of couples are making informed decisions about family planning, birth timing and birth spacing. It is likely that the CPR is in fact higher than that reported through the Ministry of Health and NGO partners in family planning, as sexually active people have access to contraception from private medical practitioners (who do not always provide the information to the Ministry of Health) or buy condoms. The CPR is useful in tracking progress towards health, gender and poverty goals. It also serves as a proxy measure of access to reproductive health services that are essential for meeting many of the goals, especially the child and maternity mortality and HIV/AIDS goals. Contraceptive methods include condoms, female and male sterilisation, injectable and oral hormones, intrauterine devices, diaphragms, spermicides and natural family planning, as well as lactational amenorrhoea (lack of menstruation during breastfeeding) where it is cited as a method. Prevalence of malaria is the number of cases of malaria per 100,000 people, incidence rates apply only to those who have been tested for malaria, not the entire population. Death rates associated with malaria are number of deaths caused by malaria per 100,000 people. The indicator allows highly endemic countries like Vanuatu to monitor disease and death from malaria, which have been increasing over the last two decades due to deteriorating health systems, growing drug and insecticide resistance, periodic changes in weather patterns, civil unrest, human migration and population displacement. Malaria prevention is measured as the percentage of children aged 0\u201359 months (under five years) sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets. Malaria treatment among children is measured as the proportion of children aged 0\u201359 months who were ill with the fever in the two weeks before the survey and who received appropriate antimalarial drugs. Tuberculosis prevalence is the number of cases of tuberculosis per 100,000 people; notification rates apply only to those who have been tested for tuberculosis, not the entire population. Death rates associated with tuberculosis are deaths caused by tuberculosis per 100,000 people. A tuberculosis case is defined as a patient in whom tuberculosis has been bacteriologically confirmed or diagnosed by a clinician. Detecting and curing tuberculosis are key interventions for addressing poverty and inequality. Prevalence and deaths are more sensitive markers of the changing burden of tuberculosis than incidence (new cases), although data on trends in incidence are far more comprehensive and give the best overview of the impact of global tuberculosis control.

The cure rate is the percentage of new, registered smear-positive (infectious) cases that were cured or in which a full course of DOTS was completed. Since tuberculosis is an airborne contagious disease, primary control is effected through finding and treating infectious cases and thus limiting the risk of acquiring infection. The recommended approach to primary control is the DOTS strategy, an inexpensive strategy that could prevent millions of tuberculosis cases and deaths over the coming decade. DOTS is a proven system based on accurate diagnosis and consistent treatment with a full course of a cocktail of anti-tuberculosis drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, streptomycin and ethambutol). DOTS requires government commitment, careful detection, consistent treatment, uninterrupted supply of anti-tuberculosis drugs and a monitoring and reporting system to evaluate treatment outcomes for each patient.

Efforts to eliminate tuberculosis through finding and treating infectious cases need to continue. While the notification rate has declined by 21% there has been an increase in the tuberculosis death rate, implying that either patients are not getting treatment in time or not taking the full course of treatments, or that the treatment regime was unsuccessful.

This target mainly involves three government departments in Vanuatu \u2013 the Department of Forestry which is responsible for the sustainable management of Vanuatu\u2019s forest resources, to achieve greater social and economic benefits for current and future generation; Environment Unit which is responsible for researching, raising awareness, formulating and implementing government policies on the management of Vanuatu\u2019s environment in an ecologically sustainable manner; and the Energy Unit, tasked with identification, implementation, management and evaluation of energy projects, as well as monitoring petroleum and electrification activities in Vanuatu. Government has clearly recognised the importance of sustainable development and environmental resources but the process of integration is a major challenge. Vanuatu is a predominantly agrarian society, and 80% of its population depends directly on agriculture for their livelihood, through subsistence production30. Vanuatu is an island nation and hence has a considerable coastline in relation to its area. Ecologically sustainable forest management involves balancing use of forest resources with the maintenance of the ecological processes that sustain forests ecosystems, the conservation of the biological diversity associated with forests and the protection of water quality and associated aquatic habitats. The principal national goal for the forest sector is to achieve greater social and economic benefits for current and future generations31. Forests cover approximately 35% of total land area, down from 70% in 1980; 40% is taken up by other vegetation including commercial plantation and smallholder agriculture and 23% in other uses. The National Forest Policy aiming at achieving Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) highlights the key roles as outlined in the SFM. According to the National Forest Policy (1997), the national sustainable yield is 68,000 cubic meters. Vanuatu remains under threat over the loss of its biodiversity due to clearing of vegetation and agriculture activities and poor management of land and water systems, such as clearing and over-use of land within water catchment, over-extraction of water, wild domestic stock fouling rivers, streams and springs and impact of introduced species such as the Tilapia and Gampusia (western mosquito fish) in particular, and the distribution and abundance of native fauna.

Information is very scare in relation to forested land area. Inventory is done infrequently due to the costs involved. There is need for an updated forestry policy with an emphasis on promoting sustainability in utilization of resources. Vanuatu\u2019s fragile ecosystems and social environment are under stress due to factors such as natural disasters, rapid population growth, changing lifestyles and consumption pattern. Depletion of sea resources and concentrated near-shore fishing is causing severe damage to community-based seas resources. Vanuatu is prone to natural disasters. OCHA33 ranks Vanuatu twelfth in the whole Asia Pacific Region for the frequency and severity of its natural disasters. On average, one damaging cyclone passes through its waters every year, and periodic larger events like Uma (1987) and Prema (1993) caused extensive damage. On worst affected islands they render thousands homeless by damaging houses, schools and public buildings, flooding gardens and destroying most commercial and subsistence crops as well as coastal vessels on which fishing and transport depend. Many constraints exist in Vanuatu in the development of renewable energy including the lack of resources and political will to push through non-renewable energy and conservation plans34. A priority activity for the Environment and Energy units is to integrate sustainable environmental management into national and provincial development planning as well as harmonising all of the applicable legislation to ensure that issues such as environment impact assessments are standardised across all sectors \u2013 currently different legislations have different procedures and standards for ensuring sustainable environmental management. Efforts to mainstream sustainable environmental management are further complicated by the different planning and policy frameworks which environmental management spans. At the national level is the Prioritised Action Agenda while at the provincial level there are the Rural Economic Development Initiatives and each sector (health, education, agriculture, tourism etc) has their own strategic plans. Only once a coherent framework is achieved, applicable at all levels of administration, can meaningful targets and indicators be developed and monitored for sustainable development and environmental management fully mainstreamed. Challenges 33 UN Office - Humanitarian Affairs (UNDP, Suva) 34 Barbados Program of Action +10, National Assessment Report (page 41) 36 Challenges remain in relation to the ecological sustainability of forestry logging. Currently there is no benchmark to determine the effect of ecological sustainability in relation to logging. Though logging re-entry will remain an important indicator for sustainable logging, national land tenure system hinders this process to be effectively practised and land is turned into other different land use thus the investments from the Government Forestry Institution and Logging Investors appears as wastages. Challenges also remain with over-harvesting of resources (fish, shellfish, crabs, coconut crabs and other marine edible species) for home and commercial use. New and sophisticated fishing technologies contributing to increases in catches are affecting other marine species also. People move to coastal areas to have access to sea and commercial activities thus putting pressure on coastlines, thus the decline in the traditional respect for resources management systems and disregard to conservations and control of government. The main problem therefore remains where there is increased pressure on natural resources. Increase in population results in overexploitation of commercial resources due to the need for cash income, which leads to disrespect of local community leaders and their resources management decisions. Vanuatu\u2019s PAA stresses the importance of sustainable environmental development. The Environmental Management and Conservation Act No. 12 of 2002 enables Vanuatu to maintain environmental quality through the sustainable management of natural resources for the security and benefits of present and future generations35. The public is being educated and made more aware of the value of energy conservation, particularly fossil fuel and biomass energy, which are costly and harmful to the environment. The Energy Unit is commencing a major series of renewable energy projects, aimed at harnessing alternative forms of energy including solar and hydro projects, throughout Vanuatu and particularly in remote rural areas. A National Biodiversity Conservation Strategy was established in 1999 to coincide with the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) that was ratified and came into force in March 1993, to conserve and manage biodiversity and establish mechanisms that are affordable, culturally appropriate and within the people\u2019s capacity to implement36. The government\u2019s forestation and reforestation efforts began in 1993 with the \u201cFree Seedling Program\u201d on a collaborative effort with the Vanuatu\u2019s Chamber of Commerce & Industries.

Traditional measures have also been in practice with support and advice from the Government agencies such as Environment Unit and Fisheries Department to protect coastlines such as banning of fish harvesting for certain periods, banning of coral and sand mining from beaches, and the preservation of mangroves and sea-grasses in some areas. All land belongs to indigenous Ni-Vanuatu. Government does not own forestland.

One major initiative is the training of logging operators, and the establishment of the Licensing Schemer to improve forest operators\u2019 standards. Traditionally, reforestation has been going on by communities, with the government and development partners\u2019 assistance. With the \u201cYear of Sustainable Forest\u201d in 2002, commercial reforestation has been ongoing over the last three years, and the department has recorded that more than 300 hectares have been established throughout Vanuatu between 2002 and 2004. All aspects of forestry management, conservation, forest development, industrial utilization, and all research, extension, training, education and forest administration all supports the government\u2019s goal towards sustainable forest management. Effective community and NGO partnerships exist for sustainable environmental management and interventions. While some traditional practices might impact adversely on the environment, communities are very aware of their reliance on marine and terrestrial ecosystems for their livelihoods. For example, the Environment Unit received donor funding to control invasive species in the coral reefs of Santo. These funds were disbursed to the Department of Fisheries who contracted local communities to eradicate the pest. Safe and reliable drinking water is a critical national issue. There is disparity between provision of water in rural and urban areas. In urban areas, 49.6% of households have piped water directly to their own household use, whereas in rural areas, the main source of water comes from rivers and springs. Where there is piped water in rural areas, this is usually shared (about 19.3% according to the 1999 Census). Sanitation has improved from 1989 to 1999, with more facilities in the urban than rural areas. The challenges facing rural water systems including old and poorly situated communal tanks and pipes, often dry in dry seasons, means families walk long distances to secondary water sources. Problems in the urban areas include old dilapidated water systems that do not have the physical capacity to service the large number now living in urban areas; water pollution through human waste and inadequate disposal of household rubbish, the grossly inadequate sanitation facilities in the hastily erected and overcrowded squatter settlements. In some areas, up to twenty families share the communal standpipes, making the potential for transmission of communicable Introduction 38 strong strong strong strong strong strong fair fair fair fair fair fair weak weak weak weak weak weak Tracking Progress Monitoring and evaluation components Data collection capacity Quality of recent survey information Statistical tracking capacity Statistical analysis capacity Capacity to incorporate statistical analysis into policy, planning and resource allocation mechanisms Monitoring and evaluation mechanism Assessment Target 10: Halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation Challenges strong strong strong strong strong strong fair fair fair fair fair fair weak weak weak weak weak weak Tracking Progress Monitoring and evaluation components Data collection capacity Quality of recent survey information Statistical tracking capacity Statistical analysis capacity Capacity to incorporate statistical analysis into policy, planning and resource allocation mechanisms Monitoring and evaluation mechanism Assessment diseases in the communities very high.

Programmes of development include direct feed system, indirect gravity feed or drilling of boreholes with hand pump systems. The use of hand pumps has increased in the last couple of years, many funded by Vanuatu\u2019s development partners. A project to highlight is the water catchment management plan for the Tagabe river at the informal settlement at Black Sands where the Environment Unit is working with the community, land owners, provincial government and the water utility to introduce a water catchment management regime (including sanitation) in a water catchment where an informal settlement is established which is outside the municipal boundary and land owners, because of their customary land ownership title, do not have to comply with any building, sanitation, water, access or other regulations. Initiatives and Responses VANUATU MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS REPORT - 2005 ensure environmental sustainability Up to 30 or 40% of urban population already live in informal settlements in and around the boundary of Port Vila and Luganville, Vanuatu\u2019s two main urban centres. These settlements will continue to grow while migrants continue to live on illegal land, with usually only one person in the family earning an income, while the labour market cannot absorb the growing supply of urban labour. The major group of people in these settlements are from the outer islands of Vanuatu, or outer rural areas of Efate or Santo who have not been able to find a job immediately and so cannot afford to pay rent. With most informal housing situations, families erect settlements based on verbal arrangements, thus living in high risk situation with regard to poor health and natural disasters.

Living conditions in these settlements are generally sub-standard, as they are composed mostly of one-room dwellings, with little space. Many dwellings do not shelter from rain and are at very high risks during cyclone seasons, with no water supply and poor toilets and sanitation, making settlers susceptible to diseases and breeding of mosquitoes. The Government with the assistance of the World Bank has made consultation on the extension of the urban Port Vila but up to now no firm decision has been made on proposed extended boundary. Challenges 40 The primary purpose of Goal 8 is to build an MDG-partnership between rich and poor countries. It fundamentally calls for more and better development assistance, a more open and fair framework for trade, and a new international financial architecture, facilitating developing countries achievement of the MDGs. The 2002 Monterrey Conference on Financing for Development resulted in commitments from major donors to start to reverse the decline in official development assistance and focus more on poverty reduction, education and health to help countries realise the goals of the Millennium Declaration. Commitments and targets relevant to achievement of the MDGs were also adopted through the Doha Ministerial Declaration (November 2001). These initiatives were further reinforced by the Rome Declaration on Harmonisation in 2003, which sets a \u201cway forward.\u201d Under the Rome Declaration, activities were identified to enhance harmonisation and further develop global partnerships for development that have implications for Vanuatu including: \ufffd the establishment of a definitive development framework reflective of country development priorities for both the medium and long term, within which the MDGs would form a basis for monitoring development progress; \ufffd development of a consultative mechanism within government systems for enhanced engagement of development partners; and \ufffd institutional reforms (that may entail a review of fiduciary standards, accountability frameworks and financial management systems), which will enable increasing reliance by development partners on country systems.37 Official Development Assistance (ODA) Vanuatu is heavily dependent on ODA both in terms of financing development priorities and technical assistance and capacity building. Cash grants and aid in kind represented 26% of the 2004 government budget appropriation (30% in 2001). Unfortunately it is not possible to get accurate figures on the total ODA received in Vanuatu, particularly the significant contributions made to and within the NGO and church sectors.

The level of foreign investment in Vanuatu has declined from an annual average of 27% contribution to GDP from 1987 \u2013 1995 to about 20% in recent years. Reforms aimed at improving private sector investment do not seem to have resulted in a thriving business environment, although government has intervened in some investment schemes, particularly those involving the sale (lease) of large areas of land (in some cases islands) because correct procedures had not been followed (such as environmental impact assessments). \u201cThe cost of doing business in Vanuatu is high for several reasons including: lack of benefits from economies of scale due to the smallness of the market; regulatory barriers to entry providing incumbents with market power; natural monopolies that raise the prices of their services above the marginal cost of provision; and macroeconomic risks including exchange rate risk that leads to higher risk premium on domestic investment.\u201d38 Foreign direct investment is facilitated through the Vanuatu Investment Promotion Authority (VIPA) \u2013 a \u2018one stop shop\u2019 approach to assist investment registration, licensing, visa and other requirements. Some tariffs have been significantly reduced to encourage investment and legislation which gave nationals exclusive rights to some investment types have been annulled. At the same time evaluation of investment proposals has been strengthened in line with social and environmental protection goals. Barriers to Vanuatu effectively trading with the rest of the world are both technical and a result of a lack of productive capacity. For example, Vanuatu has free access to the European Union market but because it is unable to meet the technical entry requirements of these markets in areas including health protection, animal or plant life or the environment, exports are limited.

As a least-developed country (LDC), Vanuatu already has duty-free access to Australia, New Zealand, the United states and the 25-member European Union. Whilst much focus has rightly been placed on World Trade Organisation membership and formulating a position for the Economic Partnership Agreements with the European Union (for example see Grynberg and Joy (2000), Gay (2003), Gay (2004)) there has been a relative lack of attention to domestic trade policy. Vanuatu\u2019s task is therefore one of designing domestic trade policy in such a way as to raise domestic production for both home and foreign markets. In addition, the ratification of other regional and bilateral agreements such as the Pacific Islands Trade Agreement (PICTA), the Pacific Closer Economic Relations Agreement (PACER) and the Melanesian Free Trade Agreement has lowered tariffs and associated government import tax and duty revenues. Preferential access to the Australian and New Zealand markets is ensured under the SPARTECA agreement, with some concerns about this eroding due to cheaper priced commodities from other markets, particularly Asia. Economic development in Vanuatu is hampered by the small size of the local market combined with the high cost of inputs (land, labour, capital and utilities), aggravated by the geographical fragmentation of the country, weak infrastructure for roads, ports and airports, shortages of skilled labour, large variability in access to services between urban and rural areas and erratic outputs from the agricultural sector (because of poor market access, storage and transport difficulties, natural disasters, the informal nature of production and custom obligations). In real terms Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has not improved significantly since 1997. Economic Development 43 VANUATU MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS REPORT - 2005 develop a global partnership for development Tourism and agriculture, as well as retail trade, hotels and restaurants, make up the majority of the productive sectors of the economy. This reflects the highly dualistic nature of the economy with most of the 80% rural population involved with subsistence agriculture. Primary sector production varies markedly from year to year because of bad weather conditions, international commodity prices and export restrictions on products like kava.

The persistently high budget deficit in the mid- to late-1990s, slow and negative growth in economic activity and the depreciation of the Vatu against major currencies have contributed to increases in government debt, with debt reaching about 40% of national income in 2001 (bearing in mind that national income at the same time was contracting). In part, this was the cumulative result of successive governments from the mid- to late-1990s borrowing both domestically and internationally to finance budgets. Another significant contribution is the loss of revenue from import duties and taxes, required for entry into the WTO and other regional trade agreements, which the government has to some extent off set by the introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT). However, much of this is external debt from concessional loans from donor agencies and external borrowing is now curtailed. Source: Vanuatu National Statistics Office The Comprehensive Reform Program (CRP) and its current transformation of the Prioritized Action Agenda (PAA) contain national level planning and policy direction from a \u2018top down\u2019 approach. The initial CRP framework was mainly based around strategies for economic development and improving governance. The next step in this planning process is to develop a Medium Term Development Strategy, linking the development objectives with budgetary resources and to refine the PAA statements so as to include priority policy initiatives in the medium term at the provincial level, incorporating the strategies identified in the Rural Economic Development Initiatives (REDI), widened to incorporate all sustainable development issues with strategies and policies to mainstream and integrate women, youth, the very poor and environmental management. This would result in a \u2018bottom up\u2019 approach to sustainable development planning. The government\u2019s response to the problems of political instability leading to changes in government along with policy and public sector personnel and the lack of long- term economic strategy impeding long term business investment was the introduction of CRP. The challenge is to separate policy from political instability for the formulation and implementation of long-term policies.

The number of government ministries has been reduced, several state owned enterprises were restructured or sold, as well as tax and tariff systems were revised. A key aspect of good governance is fair and impartial dispute resolution, and in Vanuatu where government mechanisms in this area fail (or are not possible in remote island areas), it is typically traditional chiefs and church communities which bring about conflict resolution. Official development assistance (ODA) comprises grants and loans to developing countries that are undertaken by the official sector with promotion of economic development and welfare as the main objective and at concessional financial terms (if a loan, having a grant element of at least 25%). Technical cooperation is included. Grants, loans and credits for military purposes are excluded. The World Summit on Social Development at Copenhagen in 1995 suggested the possibility of \u201cmutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate, on average, 20% of ODA and 20% of the national budget, respectively, to basic social programmes\u201d. These programmes comprise basic education, basic health, population and reproductive health programmes, and poverty- focused water and sanitation projects. ODA to basic social services includes aid for primary education, basic life skills for youth and adults and early childhood education; basic health care, basic health infrastructure, basic nutrition, infectious disease control, health education and health personnel development. Untied bilateral ODA is assistance from country to country for which the associated goods and services may be fully and freely procured in substantially all countries. Tying procurement from aid contracts to suppliers in the donor country reduces its cost effectiveness. Recognising this, OECD/DAC member countries have raised the share of their aid that is untied. The share of untied aid to the least developed countries has risen relatively slowly, but the situation is likely to improve with the implementation of the new Recommendation on Untying Aid to the Least Developed Countries. The UN recommends that countries themselves compile statistical indicators for ODA instead of relying on OECD estimates.

This conclusion is based on the ODA received from major donors and more information is required about ODA flows to both government and non government organisations in Vanuatu. Vanuatu\u2019s negative trade balance (from its reliance on imported goods and narrow export base) as a proportion of GNP is decreasing. This is an indicator of the pressure on the Vanuatu economy from its trade imbalance with the rest of the world. Because of the high trade deficit, this figure is high, although there have been some improvements since 1990. The available data show debt service is a low percentage of exports, indicating that debt levels are sustainable by international standards. To gain a more complete picture of the sustainability of debt payments, it is useful to look at other indicators, such as the ratio of total debt to gross national income (40% in 2001), the size of international reserves relative to total debt (for the past three years maintaining a healthy balance), and debt maturing within a year\u2019s time. However, government initiatives for financial reform and a tight fiscal policy have stabilised debt levels (with external debt being mostly from concessional loans). National economic growth has not increased at the same pace as population growth or people\u2019s aspirations for sustainable livelihoods. It is imperative that government develop and implement targeted strategies to create economic opportunities in rural areas while managing aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. 40 Note that indicators relevant for the national MDG reporting have been included; those for developed country assistance etc are available from the 2004 Pacific Islands Regional MDG Report and other agencies such as OECD, the UN and the ADB.

The high proportion of the population under the age of 25 years has put considerable pressure on resources for basic social services including health and education. The education system is under considerable pressure to deliver education beyond primary level to youth for both higher academic as well as vocational qualifications. Youth struggle within the education system to advance to senior levels because of the limited number of places available and struggle to enter the work force which is capable of \u201cemploying at most only 15% of new entrants into the labour force every year [estimated to be 3,500 students leaving the education system annually].\u201d41 This has contributed to high rates of unemployment as well as underemployment particularly in the urban areas where, unlike in the rural areas, limited access to land means that the conventional means of income generation through agriculture or other \u2018land based\u2019 activities do not exist. \u201cThe system of selective screening - albeit based on merit - into secondary schools has created a problem that, if not properly handled, could spell real problems for Vanuatu. Primary education is provided for the first six years, and has recently been extended to eight years. After this, 20% of any age group continues to secondary school while 80% aged 14 years becomes the \u2018drop outs from the education system. A small proportion of this group can get into technical training institutes but the majority adds to their kinds in the villages. The Vanuatu Agricultural College is a massive investment attempting to address the \u2018 drop out\u2019 that traditionally join the \u2018walkabouts\u2019 in society.\u201d42 Here unemployed is defined as the proportion of youth looking for work divided by the workforce, which includes subsistence activities. The indicator monitors the degree to which the youth labour force is utilised in the economy and therefore serves as a measure of the success of strategies to create jobs for youth.

The table below shows the economic activities of those aged 15 - 24 years, with the most significant activity being subsistence farming for 48% of youth. Of utmost concern is the conclusion that 33% of youth are not working and not looking for work \u2013 not able to get jobs nor to be subsistence farmers, this group has bowed out of the labour market. This group comprises women who are working in the home as well as those who are at school or other training or are unable to work because of long term illness or disability.

Clearly, strategies to create jobs for youth have not succeeded; and given the absorptive capacity of the current labour market it is doubtful that there will ever be enough jobs of suitable skill levels for youth. Providing youth with appropriate skills to work is also a major challenge, with a shortage of skilled professional and technical people on one hand, and on the other, an education and training system which cannot cater for the number of students nor the skills required. A full labour force survey is required to find out the level of underemployment, joblessness, employment history and skills of all working age people but particularly for youth. This information could then be matched against an assessment of the labour market and the likely future demands for labour to identify opportunities to improve youth employment rates and the type of jobs they are likely to get.

Key tasks are the formulation of curriculum and desired outcomes of years 7 and 8 and defining the education and other pathways for graduates after year 8. Government is planning to move to the \u201cyear 8\u201d structure from the beginning of 2006. Government has recognised the need to improve the delivery of vocational education and training both in terms of the geographic coverage and course curriculum. The mandate of the Ministry of Youth Development and Training mainly concerns non- formal vocational education (such as Vanuatu Community Certificate courses) and training while the Ministry of Education\u2019s formal training centres are the Vanuatu Institute of Technology (VIT), the Vanuatu Institute of Teacher Education (VITE) and the Maritime College. Government is also in the initial stages of implementing an open and distance education policy to improve access to education services at all levels of schooling. The Department of Women\u2019s Affairs (DWA) recently conducted a feasibility study of distance learning options to encourage more women to carry on to tertiary studies in Vanuatu, and various options were identified to improve the number of women proceeding to tertiary level studies, discussed under Goal 3. Initiatives and responses The proportion of population with access to affordable, essential drugs on a sustainable basis is the percentage of the population that has access to a minimum of 20 most essential drugs. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed the Model List of Essential Drugs, which is regularly updated through widespread consultations with member states and other partners. Progress in access to essential medicines is thus the result of combined effort by governments, strategic partners such as United Nations agencies, public-private partnerships, non-government organisations and professional associations. Millions of people die prematurely or suffer unnecessarily each year from diseases or conditions for which effective medicines or vaccines exist. Essential drugs save lives and improve health, but their potential can only be realised if they are accessible, rationally used and of good quality. No reliable data is available for this target in Vanuatu.

Access is expensive, with high monthly internet \u2018plan\u2019 charges in addition to charges for telephone calls. TVL provides a free service to schools but not to other not for profit organisations. The rural population of Vanuatu lacks access to very basic services (in 1999, only 34% of all households used electricity for the main type of lighting, 61% urban and 7% of rural households; and even for some, access to utilities in urban centres of Port Vila and Luganville is so expensive that it is prohibitive. Disparities in access to technology are likely to continue to grow, particularly between urban and rural populations, and even more so in an archipelago like Vanuatu. These indicators are important tools for monitoring progress towards Goal 8, because effective communication between those involved in the development process is not possible without the necessary infrastructure. Personal computers and telephones allow people to exchange experiences and learn from each other, enabling higher returns on investment and avoiding problems of duplication or missing information. The use of information and communication technologies can make governments more transparent, thereby reducing corruption and leading to better governance. It can help people in rural areas find out about market prices and sell their products at a better price. It can also overcome traditional barriers to better education by making books available online and opening the door to e-learning.

However, given the low rates of electricity available and access to telephones, particularly in rural areas, the levels for these indicators would be very small. For a predominantly rural population with relatively low literacy levels, limited access to electricity and utilities, computer use is understandably low.

Tremendous progress has been made in terms of human and economic development over the last couple of decades. However, this progress has come at the cost of the biodiversity and ecosystems that support millions of lives and livelihoods in the region. Biodiversity is in decline in all types of ecosystem existing in the region, particularly in forests, rivers and oceans. The rate of species loss is almost twice the global average, and the occurrence of natural and man-made disasters, exacerbated by climate change and shocks, is increasing at an alarming rate. In the Pacific, the very existence of some nations is threatened by sea level rise. Yet, far from succumbing to these challenges, the countries of the Asia Pacific region are rising to the task of harnessing the positive opportu- nities provided by biodiversity and natural ecosystems, as catalysts for sustainable development. In recognizing the real value of biodiversity and ecosystems \u2013 in relation to secure livelihoods, food, water and health, enhanced resilience, conservation of threatened species and their habitats, and increased carbon storage and sequestration \u2013 they, together with the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), are drawing on the potential of nature to achieve multiple development dividends. UNDP and GEF are thus delighted to present this publication \u2013 \u201cBiodiversity for Sustainable Development: Delivering Results for Asia and the Pacific\u201d \u2013 which showcases the ground-breaking work that has taken place in recent years in this vast and disparate region to conserve land, water and ocean resources while adapting to climate change, enhancing local capacity, and generating sustainable livelihoods. The publication highlights case studies and examples of initiatives, from the eastern tip of Asia to the far reaches of the Pacific Ocean, which have expanded and strengthened protected areas, integrated biodiversity and ecosystem management into key economic sectors including tourism, agriculture and fisheries, and supported ecosystem- based adaptation to, and mitigation of, climate change. This work has been reinforced by initiatives focusing on access to clean and afford- able energy and improved energy efficiency, empowering women, and ensuring effective risk management and resilience building. In total, since 2000, UNDP and GEF have carried out work over 10 million hectares in 13 countries to improve production practices in agriculture, fisheries, forestry, tourism and extractive industries, to conserve biodiversity while driving economic growth and generating jobs. A total of 459 marine and terrestrial protected areas and indigenous and community conservation areas\u2014covering 64 million hectares in 19 countries\u2014has benefited from UNDP-managed GEF investment in governance, management effectiveness and livelihood generation. Going forward, as the international community identifies the priorities and Sustainable Development Goals for the post-2015 development agenda, as well as a new climate change regime for the post-2020 period, UNDP and GEF commit to further support countries in the Asia Pacific region in responding to the challenge of sustainable development by intensifying actions for the effective maintenance and protection of natural capital.

Ultimately, it all comes down to securing the essential natural capital of the nations and the world. Natural capital represents 25 percent of total wealth in developing countries. Therefore attenuating biodiversity loss is a critical strategy for mitigating poverty and achieving sustainable development. Biodiversity can provide an important safety net for the poor. I believe there are two key factors that determine success or failure of human societies to manage biodiversity and reduce poverty: 1. Strength of environmental governance systems: putting in place policies, regulations and effective institutions to support accountable decision-making systems and protect property rights. 2. Ability to address market failure: changing the trajectory of markets to account for and correctly value ecosystem goods and services in financial transactions. UNDP\u2019s ecosystem and biodiversity programme is designed to address these factors by removing barriers to country action to address the root causes of biodiversity loss and improve the state of biodiversity over the long-term. I was trained as an economist. But you don\u2019t have to be an economist to realise that it simply does not make sense to grow the economy \u2013 accumulate financial wealth, increase physical assets \u2013 if this growth depletes your natural capital beyond the threshold of being able to support our life. It is a housekeeping fundamental; all accounts must be healthy. If the biodiversity and ecosystem account is in the red, how can we justify calling the growth progress? How can it be development? Globally, through management of 512 projects on ecosystems and biodiversity with US$1.5 billion infunding from the GEF and other sources, and co-finance of US$3.5 billion, UNDP\u2019s ecosystems and biodiversity programme has been successful in: impacting over 2,000 protected areas in 85 countries, covering 272 million hectares; undertaking interventions in pro- duction sectors and development planning in 38 countries, covering 244 million hectares; and promoting ecosystem-based adaptation to or mitigation of climate change in 71 countries. In addition to this portfolio of projects, UNDP also implements two programmes focused at the local level\u2014the GEF Small Grants Programme and the Equator Initia- tive partnership\u2014that are working with indigenous peoples and local communities on ground-breaking work in biodiversity conservation and sustainable development.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "48597d8e-303f-48a1-8e78-f4ca4984b824": {"__data__": {"id_": "48597d8e-303f-48a1-8e78-f4ca4984b824", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Biodiversity for Sustainable Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c0479b663c4fa4ab278659fa21aa9e79525c02e4beb7e6f3291f3665aca2e6c9"}, "2": {"node_id": "34019891-43a4-4d60-849c-f7f2df1fe258", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6cd6123a258dcceef34100eae1942c033df56b6c77122c5a65a529c39d9f3a23"}}, "hash": "718ddc706f2edef14e87e4f74ea7697934835b1d7b1d68a61be2f76d979d7794", "text": "Nomads with their yak herds roam across the snow-carpeted hills of the Tibetan plateau that are their home.

Though we may not realize it, each of these people shares a common bond in a very real, tangible and vital way \u2014 each depends on ecosystems and biodiversity. The nomadic herd- ers have lived in the high mountain landscapes of Central and North Asia for millennia, relying on pasture to graze their livestock for their main livelihood. Rice farmers in Lao PDR rely on agro-biodiversity to secure their crops from threats from climate change and disease. In New York, all 8 million residents, along with the 47 million annual visitors, rely on protected areas in upstate New York to supply their drinking water day in and day out. The tour guide in the Western Ghats is soon to become part of her country\u2019s nature-based tourism industry, which contributes to the local and national economy. The fisherman in Kiribati relies on the Phoenix Islands Marine Protected Area to supply his family with daily protein. In Bhutan, nature contributes to spiritual fulfilment and the concept of protected areas has existed for thousands of years, as sacred sites. As these examples illustrate, ecosystems and biodiversity provide us with a home, food, water, medicine, livelihoods and jobs, money, knowledge, and inspiration and equip us to cope with disasters and climate change impacts.

As the Malaysian govern- ment also put it so aptly in its official biodiversity conserva- tion logo: \u201cMy Biodiversity - Life, Heritage and Future\u201d. While biodiversity provides the foundation on which all life depends, including human societies, it is particularly impor- tant to the 2.7 billion people \u2013 more than a quarter of the world\u2019s population \u2013 who survive on less than US$2 a day. As much as 70 percent of the world\u2019s poorest people de- pend critically on biodiversity to provide them with life\u2019s most basic necessities, including food, water, shelter, medicine and their livelihoods. UNDP\u2019s core mission is to contribute to the eradication of extreme poverty and the reduction of inequality and exclusion: if this is to be achieved, the integra- tion of biodiversity and ecosystems management into the development and poverty reduction agenda is vital. And this is exactly the reason why UNDP works on ecosys- tem and biodiversity, managing an ever-increasing US$1.2 billion portfolio. In 2012, at the 11th Conference of Parties of the Conven- tion on Biological Diversity in India, we launched the UNDP Biodiversity and Ecosystems Global Framework 2012-2020. As illustrated in the diagram on the right, the framework comprises three signature programmes, to respond to coun- tries\u2019 demand for support on Policy, Finance and Capacity: 1. Integrating biodiversity and ecosystem management into development planning and production sector activities to safeguard biodiversity and maintain ecosystem services that sustain human wellbeing. 2.

However, despite much progress in environmental protection, the region is losing the integrity and productivity of its lands and seas. The Living Planet Index, published biennially by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and its partners, reports that biodi- versity is in decline in all types of ecosystem examined in the Asia Pacific region, including forests, rivers and oceans. The rate of species loss is about twice the global average. Data have shown that the region is depleting natural assets at an unsustainable rate: water scarcity is increasing; tropical forests are shrinking; and climate change is worsening these threats. The risk of natural disasters \u2013 exacerbated by climate change and economic shocks \u2013 magnifies existing vulnerabilities. Since 2000, UNDP\u2019s Ecosystems and Biodiversity (EBD) pro- gramme has achieved substantial results through its manage- ment of more than 160 GEF-financed projects in Asia Pacific. Work has been carried out over more than 10 million hectares in 13 countries to improve production practices in agriculture, fisheries, forestry, tourism and extractive industries, to conserve biodiversity while driving economic growth and generating jobs. A total of 459 marine and terrestrial protected areas and indigenous and community conservation areas\u2014covering 64 million hectares in 19 countries\u2014have been impacted through UNDP-supported GEF-financed projects. Sustainable forest management measures and ecosystem-based adaptation and mitigation interventions supported by UNDP with GEF finance are also under way in the Asia Pacific region. UNDP-GEF currently supports a portfolio of 104 ecosystems and biodiversity projects in Asia Pacific, which are at various stages of the project cycle. In addition to this portfolio of pro- jects, UNDP also implements two programmes focused at the local level\u2014the GEF Small Grants Programme and the Equator Initiative. In the Asia Pacific region as of 2013, 29 UNDP supported GEF financed projects are working to integrate biodiversity and ecosystem management into development planning and production sector activities that target the agriculture, extrac- tives, fisheries, forestry and tourism sectors, directly impacting an area of over 8 million hectares. UNDP is currently working in more than 300 protected areas in the region, impacting a total of more than 45 million hectares. This work primarily supports strengthening of protected areas so that they are better managed and sustainably financed, but it also supports strategic expansion of existing protected area networks. A total area of more than 167,000 hectares is directly impacted by ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) interventions in the region, in ecosystems ranging from the mountainous to the marine, bringing benefits, such as water security, to the nearby communities. UNDP country offices, jointly with national governments and partners in the region, manage and monitor implementation of these projects. The UNDP Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific has 24 Country Offices as well as Regional Service Centres in Bangkok and Suva, covering 37 countries and territories. These Regional Service Centres support project formulation, implementation, monitoring and reporting and provide policy advice. This publication presents results and success stories from UNDP\u2019s work with ecosystems and biodiversity outcomes in the Asia Pacific region. The majority of work presented is supported with grant financing from the Global Environment Facility Trust Fund (GEF). Apart from the GEF, major funding sources include the Adaptation Fund, Least Developed Coun- tries Trust Fund and Nagoya Protocol Implementation Fund, also administered by the GEF; the European Union, German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety, Government of Norway, Govern- ment of the Netherlands, SNV Netherlands Development Organisation, Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation SDC, World Wildlife Fund. The projects presented represent a range of approaches being adopted to implement UNDP\u2019s Global Ecosystems and Biodi- versity Framework 2012\u20142020. In addition, achievements are also presented from other core and bilaterally funded regional work and UNDP environment programmes that also contribute to biodiversity management, including the UNDP-UNEP Poverty Environment Initiative (PEI) and the UN Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (UN-REDD Programme), a collaborative initiative of UN FAO, UNEP and UNDP.

UNDP, with GEF financing, is working with the Government of Qinghai Province to improve the management of the protected area system that harbours the important headwaters of the Tibetan Plateau Photo: Marc Foggin Green pasture surrounds craggy ridges and snowy peaks rising high above deep meandering valleys, where three great rivers \u2013 the Yellow, Yangtze and Mekong \u2013 wind away from one another in the centre of the Tibetan plateau. This is Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve, known as the Three Rivers Reserve, in China\u2019s Qinghai province. Larger than England and Wales combined, this is the Earth\u2019s highest and most extensive wetland protected area. It is home to the snow leopard, Tibetan antelope, wild yak and black-necked crane; all threatened with extinction. It is also home to 200,000 people. These people, and the nearly 600 million more living downstream, rely on this fragile environment to meet their basic needs and generate local livelihoods. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), with finance from the Global Environment Facility (GEF), is working with the government of Qinghai to improve management of the Sanjiangyuan region. The protected area system in the province is at significant risk from illegal mining, poaching, overgrazing, infrastructure development and climate change. The project is addressing these challenges by building institutional and staff capacity to strengthen environment- related policies and enforcement, and working collaboratively with local Tibetan herding communities to strengthen conservation and sustainable use of local natural resources. While only in its first year of implementation, the Qinghai Biodiversity Conservation Project has already begun to engage actively with multiple high level and grassroots stakeholders through targeted workshops, meetings and field trips.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a89d147b-a469-424c-9051-811f38f4b0b3": {"__data__": {"id_": "a89d147b-a469-424c-9051-811f38f4b0b3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Biodiversity for Sustainable Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6d2d50ba321603ccf6a916b2b02780c16783de53e0fb94510e9e0d1f10cb14f3"}, "2": {"node_id": "5f3a5e49-cc48-4d90-a44e-afffd0b25ad3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8ec8051e3dc47098b57a7b09676750dc3f6c718de4036f34ff1090563a067891"}}, "hash": "6e51d2df2a1dd802f350f61e21b53ec26bb6f9fe0586ee64a29304a7665cfb6f", "text": "This is consolidating the ex- tensive groundwork that has been laid over the past decade for a people-friendly approach to biodiversity conservation in the region\u2019s high altitude grasslands and wetlands.

They protect intact ecosystems from being destroyed and degraded by over-exploitation, pollu- tion, and conversion to agriculture and urbanization. They provide critically important homes for fauna and flora, and act as storehouses of biodiversity. They also secure benefits that humanity depends on by conserving water supplies, combating soil erosion, buffering people from the impacts of climate change and bolstering economies through tourism and sus- tainable supply of resources. A comprehensive, effectively governed and eco- logically representative network of protected areas is crucial to maintain the health of Asia Pacific\u2019s landscape and contribute to the sustainable hu- man development of the people that share it. Since 2000, UNDP supported GEF financed projects have impacted 64 million hectares of marine and terrestrial protected areas in the region. 19 Biodiversity for Sustainable Development 20 21 HOME All GEF financed, UNDP supported protected area projects aim to strengthen \u201cmanagement effectiveness (ME)\u201d. What is management effectiveness and what must we do to improve it? The items on the wish lists opposite are typical of the types of action needed! UNDP gauges quantitative progress towards achieving ME using the Management Ef- fectiveness Tracking Tool (METT), which was developed by the World Bank and World Wildlife Fund (WWF) in 2003. It comprises a set of 30 questions that are key for ME improvement. These questions range from legal and regula- For example: \u2022 In the Maldives, a UNDP GEF project surpassed its original aim to create three marine protected areas in Baa Atoll, by establishing six marine parks that together cover over 3,700 hectares of ocean and under-represented coral reefs. These coral reefs play an important role in distributing and maintaining biodiversity throughout the Indian Ocean. \u2022 The advocacy efforts of a UNDP GEF project in Mongolia\u2019s Altai Sayan Mountains have led the government to designate 12 new protected areas, which harbour globally significant biodiversity and under-represented steppe grasslands. \u2022 In the Philippines, which harbours some of the most unique and threatened biodiversity in the world, UNDP is supporting the government to expand coverage of Key Biodiversity Areas in the national protected area network. tory issues to the existence of management plans, adequacy of budget and staffing and skill levels, equipment, relationships between park residents and neighbours, and the state of the natural and heritage values of parks. METT works as a checklist to enable park authorities to tackle ME in a comprehensive and practical way. \u201cExperience has taught us that efforts to im- prove ME on the ground cannot be completed without improvements at the systemic and insti- tutional levels. Without change at these levels, good work done at the local level is likely to be short-lived,\u201d says Yoko Watanabe, GEF Senior World leaders recognise that the current global protected area network is not enough to meet our needs. In 2010, they agreed on targets to expand protected areas to cover at least 17 percent of land and inland areas and 10 percent of oceans by 2020. As part of this effort, UNDP works with governments to expand and strengthen protected areas across a wide range of ecosys- tems that harbour globally significant biodiversity. These include currently under-represented marine, freshwater and grassland habitats, and areas that are important for providing ecosystem services.

Earlier projects contributed to strengthening parks, such as the 4.4 million hectare Great Gobi Strictly Protected Area (SPA) in the south, the half million hectare Dornod Mongol SPA in the Eastern Steppe, and the 600,000 hectare Altai Tavan Bogd National Park in the far west.

NEW WAYS TO MANAGE PROTECTED AREAS \u2013 INNOVATION IN THAILAND White-handed gibbon (Hylobates lar) in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand Photo: Annabel Paxton \u201cWhat\u2019s out there?\u201d A question asked since the beginning of human history. Sabre tooth cats, life on distant planets? Usually nobody is sure and answers are vague. But as far as protected area managers are concerned, the question is key. What\u2019s out there in the protected areas? And the answer needs to be accurate. You need to know what\u2019s what and what\u2019s where to protect anything effectively. Many PAs are not foot friendly. Crags, limestone karst ups and downs, thick forest, lots of leeches! And the wildlife is shy. Solution? Bring on the camera traps! These simple devices are made from a point and shoot camera fitted with a motion or infrared sensor to trigger a photograph when they detect warmth or movement nearby. Many camera traps can be set in a \u2018grid\u2019 across a piece of forest, or other key habitat, to continuously record the animals present at each site, and how they use the area. UNDP\u2019s partners use camera traps to collect information on wild animals and how they use their habitat to inform conservation decisions. For example, the Malaysian Depart- ment of Wildlife and National Parks (DWNP) uses camera traps to survey protected forest within two national parks in Peninsular Malaysia. In the Taman Negara National Park, 200 camera traps monitor three different areas and have re- corded 70 different species, as well as ten individual tigers. Once the traps are set up, they operate continuously for RIGHT : Male Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) photographed by camera trap in Belum Temenggor Forest Reserve, Malaysia, UNDP\u2019s project site Photo: Malaysian Department of Wildlife and National Parks two months before staff returns to recover the data.

Extinction looms. UNDP works in tiger landscapes in seven countries in direct support for the Global Tiger Recovery Programme under the World Bank coordinated Global Tiger Initiative (GTI). With funding from the GEF, the tiger landscape projects support strengthening of frontline enforcement actions within and around protected areas. They support protection and enhancement of natural habitats that can ensure healthy prey population and necessary corridor move- ment of tigers. In addition, these projects provide targeted support to make the economic case for increased investment in protected area management and forest conservation, as well as establishing and implementing national sustainable financing plans. Tiger conservation is not just about tigers. It\u2019s about national development. When we pro- tect the natural habitat of the tiger, we protect the forests that provide water and regu- late water flows, regulate the climate and produce clean air, generate livelihoods for people and constitute major tourism assets. We must also strengthen governance systems to ensure effective enforcement from source to market to conserve species threatened by illegal and unregulated trade. The plight of the tiger represents the tip of an enormous iceberg \u2013 the US$7.8 to 10 billion a year illicit wildlife trafficking industry combined with fast economic growth and prosperity in consumer countries is generating rapidly growing demand and consumption. Illicit wildlife trafficking is said to be worth US$7.8 to 10 billion a year. Asian countries are both major consumer and transit countries of illegal wildlife products and derivatives, including ivory and rhino horn from Af- rica. Many Asian species are also under heavy poaching pressure \u2013 tigers, snow leopards, pangolin, tortoises, orchids, to name a few. Strengthening the anti-poaching capacity within protected areas and nations as a whole is critical for securing the magnificent and globally significant biodiversity in Asia. Even if we secure natural habitats, we know from experience, whether it is the dodo or the giant Steller\u2019s sea cow in the Bering Sea, that hunting pressure alone can decimate or extirpate wildlife populations. With this recognition, many protected area projects supported by UNDP focus on promoting wildlife trade surveillance and building the response capacity of conservation agencies and stakeholders to prevent the illegal trade of endangered species. These include establishment of wildlife crime intelligence units to control and analyse intelligence data, and increasing capacity for wildlife crime monitoring, interception and conviction at the regional and site levels.

It is also the last refuge of the Asiatic or Iranian cheetah, a formerly abundant species that once ranged from Arabia as far east as the Indian Subcontinent. Classified by the International Union for the Con- servation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species as Critically Endangered, current population estimates are no higher than 75 animals, mostly living in the harsh and arid eastern and central plains of the Dasht-e Kavir desert plateau.

This landscape is almost the final refuge of the Tonkin snub-nosed monkey, one of the world\u2019s most threatened primates, listed as Critically Endan- gered by IUCN. Without coordinated management of the entire forest complex this species will almost certainly become extinct. The main threats to biodiversity in the area come from habitat frag- mentation, large-scale infrastructure development, illegal hunting, over-exploitation and livestock grazing. In response, a landscape conservation strategy for the area was developed through the \u201cCreating Protected Areas for Resource Conservation using Landscape Ecology\u201d (PARC) project in Viet Nam. The project was the first supported by UNDP with GEF finance in the country, and was implemented from 1999-2004. It piloted a landscape ecology approach for conserving the country\u2019s diverse biological heritage in the complex and Yok Don National Park. Yok Don National Park protects a seasonal habitat that is important for large mammals and birds. Therefore, conservation of suitable habitats outside the park borders is essential to ensure the con- tinuity of migratory pathways. Biodiversity surveys during PARC Project recorded 102 mammal species (including 51 bats), 327 bird species, 41 reptile species and 28 amphibian species from the Conservation Complex. Thirty-four of these species are listed as nationally or globally threatened. PARC identified priority habitat areas in the wet and dry seasons and management needs for long-term conservation. Based on this information, a multiple-use conservation strategy was produced that includes proscribed management of the wider landscape. Other achievements of the project include a hunting gun exchange programme in Ba Be and Na Hang Districts, which resulted in over 1,000 guns being turned in, and new guard posts, monitoring sta- tions and information centres. DID YOU KNOW? The tonkin snub-nosed monkey was presumed extinct before its rediscovery in 1989. There are thought to be fewer than 250 adults of this striking primate remaining in the wild.

The world is seeing them in a fairer light, understanding their immense contribution to the conservation and management of locally and globally significant biodiversity. Miles away in the highest peaks of the Northern Philippines, the project has contributed to resolving conflicts over land among indigenous groups. A long standing dispute between the Banao and Balatoc people within the Balbalasang-Balbalan National Park about each other\u2019s claim to about 2,000 hectares of forested land that overlapped their ancestral domains was resolved. Through the project\u2019s introduction of the ICCA concept and series of dialogues with both tribes, the two have declared a truce and renewed a peace pact. Over its lifetime, NewCAPP aims to expand the Philippine\u2019s protected area system under new management regimes, includ- ing ancestral domain ICCAs as well as local government- and community-managed areas. About 120,613 hectares are in various stages of establishment as conservation areas (both ICCAs and LGU-managed) in 400,000 hectares of Key Biodiversity Areas covered by the project. It is also building capacity to manage these protected areas effectively. In the nearby Zambales Mountain Ranges, a tribal leader was able to interact with fellow international ICCA advocates at the Confer- ence of the Parties (COP) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in India last October 2012. Ayta Abellen leader, Salvador Dimain of Cabangan Zambales, presented his people\u2019s traditional knowledge systems and practices, which support the protection of their sacred forests as sources of water, food, and medicine. The Philippines has been at the forefront in recognizing ICCAs and their role in biodiversity conservation, elevating them nation- ally through the National ICCA Conference in March 2012, and internationally through the 11th CBD Conference of the Parties in Hyderabad, India 31 Biodiversity for Sustainable Development Menuv\u00f9 children in traditional dress Photo: DENR-PAO/NewCAPP/UNDP 32 HOME PAPUA NEW GUINEA COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND EDUCATION SUPPORTS WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT IN Papua New Guinea (PNG) supports an estimated 5 to 7 per cent of the world\u2019s biodiversity in its rainforests, reefs, swamps and grasslands.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c8303f2f-1660-4217-8eb3-46b94d7f32c7": {"__data__": {"id_": "c8303f2f-1660-4217-8eb3-46b94d7f32c7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Biodiversity for Sustainable Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7b0b8e2b53bfe2b14dd9bc270342f9bc28a62fc463e3de67217467d8befe333f"}, "2": {"node_id": "822800f3-6fe6-4e77-b4bb-02fae17c349a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9439a291af02e770316cc7ada551e4bf52d3196a6198710e9801f62422b1750e"}}, "hash": "cb061112870ca7bb8fc6b16dbd8c1a4c841f946aad28ccc39998543ef47e80dd", "text": "From the world\u2019s tini- est frog, the \u2018Pinocchio\u2019, to one of the world\u2019s largest birds, the southern cassowary, a unique array of species have evolved here in isolation \u2013 about one in five of which are found nowhere else on earth.

Bismarck-Ramu lies in the heart of PNG, plunging from the country\u2019s highest point at 4,500m among the jagged peaks of the Bismarck mountain range, down through primary forests to the floodplains of the Ramu River on PNG\u2019s northern coast. Drawing on documented lessons learned from earlier projects in PNG, the UNDP supported GEF financed \u201cBismarck-Ramu Integrated Conservation and Development Ini- tiative\u201d (1995-1999) took a strongly participatory approach that emphasised community development, education and empower- ment. The project trained local people as community development workers and deployed them in small teams to meet with clans in Bismarck Ramu. The community development workers focused on establishing a relationship with the communities through a carefully designed seven-step engagement programme that involved introductions, mutual story-telling exercises, community mapping, discussions of community aspirations and needs, ex- ploration of possible solutions, visioning and development of ac- tion plans to implement solutions. This was complemented by an education and outreach programme in communities, schools and churches, implemented by different staff, which aimed to raise awareness of the value of the environment to local livelihoods. Only once communities had indicated their interest in conserva- tion to the community development teams, and had sought out the DEC Conservation Area Manager themselves to obtain infor- mation and invite him to visit them, were potential options for setting aside land for conservation discussed. Visits were then arranged to discuss the clans\u2019 motivations for wanting conserva- tion, the different options for reservation and which the com- munity wished to adopt. All clans selected to establish Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs). The project then worked with the clans to fulfil the requirements needed for declaration of their WMAs \u2013 to establish the boundaries of the area, a committee and rules to manage it, to submit a formal request to DEC for declaration, approval and gazette of the WMA. When the project ended, over 120,000 hectares of land had been designated by their traditional owners (thirteen clans from the Sepu area and four clans from the Foroko/Brimde area) as WMAs. As a result of the project\u2019s awareness-raising efforts, another village further out on the Madang coast decided to establish their own marine WMA as a no fishing zone. 33 Biodiversity for Sustainable Development Papua New Guinean man in tribal dress Photo: Joel Scriven Over the past seven years, the \u2018West- ern Terai Landscape Complex\u2019 project in Nepal has worked with the government and communities to build the basis for a landscape approach to conservation, which has helped to safeguard the area\u2019s biological wealth and its vital ecological functions. Nepal\u2019s Western Terai is an important home for globally significant biodiversity: dense riverine forest harbours Bengal tigers; rhinos live in its swampy grasslands; and vast, tall stands of sal, the Terai\u2019s most common tree, shelter huge herds of blackbuck deer. Prior to the project, two areas of this forest were legally protected \u2013 the Bardiya National Park and the Suklaphanta Wildlife Reserve. Adjoining areas of productive forest act as \u2018corridors\u2019, enabling large migratory mammals to pass from Nepal\u2019s protected areas, to protected areas in India. These forests also reduce the effects of floods, prevent soil erosion and help maintain a high quality water supply for the one million people that live in the Western Terai. But logging, conversion of forest to farmland, over-grazing and uncontrolled forest fires were all degrading this landscape, re- ducing and fragmenting the forest and threatening to encroach on the national park and wildlife reserve. The project developed policies to guide integrated planning at the landscape level and worked with local communities to manage the Terai\u2019s forests and wildlife. Through the project, 10,375 people from local communities and government were trained in a range of activities, including conservation, sustain- able forest management and improved livelihoods to enable them to conserve both the productive and protected landscape. The project was implemented by Nepal\u2019s Ministry of Forests and Soil Conservation and supported by multiple partners, including UNDP, GEF, Netherlands Development Organisation (SNV) Nepal, WWF Nepal, Local Initiatives for Biodiversity Research and Development, Biodiversity International, and the Nepal Agricultural Research Council.

This involves UNDP working with govern- ments, producers and communities to integrate biodiversity and ecosystem management within and far beyond protected area limits. UNDP supported GEF financed projects have directly impacted a total landscape area of more than 60 million hectares since 2000 in Asia Pacific alone. The landscape approach involves coordinating management of a mosaic of land and marine activities \u2013 including protection, restoration, subsistence use, and encouraging biodiversity and ecosystem friendly production in a wide range of sectors, from agriculture, forestry, fisheries and mining to tourism. A holistic landscape approach is far more effective in keeping high value biodiversity areas that sustain vital ecosystem services intact than simply concentrating solely on a single protected area. LOOKING ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE: MANAGING BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEMS WITHIN AND BEYOND PROTECTED AREAS NEPAL\u2019S WESTERN TERAI : INTEGRATED PLANNING AT THE LANDSCAPE LEVEL 34 HOME 35 Biodiversity for Sustainable Development Greater one-horned rhinoceros, (Rhinoceros unicornis), Nepal Photo: Utopia_88/Shutterstock.com 36 HOME The project\u2019s advocacy efforts have led the government to establish three areas of Protected Forests (totalling 130,565 hectares) within all three corridors in Western Terai and to develop management plans to govern their sustainable use. This is the first time that this category of protected area, which preserves the forest while allowing for some traditional and sustainable use, has been used in Nepal. A Protected Forest Manager and a number of Rangers have been employed to implement the management plans. With project support, the participation of local communities in forest management has more than doubled. More than 73,612 households are now involved in participatory forest management systems through 387 Community Forest User Groups. These groups work in the buffer zones of the protected areas to mobilise their own resources to imple- ment biodiversity-friendly initiatives. To strengthen the wildlife reserve and national park, which are priority areas for biodiversity, the project has helped establish District Forest Sector Coordination Committees. These committees control encroach- ment on protected areas of forest, illegal hunting and poaching and help govern forest user groups. Critical habitats have been restored, including 914 hectares of grass- land within protected areas and 37 wetlands within and outside of protected areas. The project has also produced conservation plans for two mammals, seven plants and 106 local varieties of crops. The project has worked to integrate biodiversity and ecosystem man- agement into planning and production practices in the Western Terai by revising 51 Community Forest User Group plans. These aim to promote biodiversity friendly activities, help communities to adopt new trades that reduce pressure on forests and other natural habitats, and establish anti-poaching groups. Almost 400 households have become involved in cultivating medicinal and aromatic plants, generating a total income of Nepalese Rupees (NRs) 5.4 million (US$ 63,529) in 2011, and reducing their reliance on the forest. This holistic approach has brought tangible results. Forest cover in the Western Terai has increased by 260 km2 and in the Churia Hills by 48 km2. Populations of tiger, swamp deer and blackbuck have increased and rhino populations are stable. Of 4,759 families involved in income-generating activities though seed grant support, more than 75 percent are still active. After the project\u2019s livelihood interventions, net annual household income of the forest dependent households increased by NRs 7,428 (approximately US$ 87) against the project target of NRs 3,887 (or about US$ 45). Efforts to revive eco-tourism in the national park and wildlife reserve saw tourist numbers grow more than eight-fold (over the 2006 baseline of 1,191), benefitting both the protected areas and the enterprises and communities living around them. As a result, the Government of Nepal has endorsed the landscape management approach for the first time (in its tenth National Develop- ment Plan). The Landscape Support Unit in the Ministry of Forestry and Soil Conservation, which the project helped to establish, has provided national level support for this holistic approach.

With these objectives in mind, the project amassed a huge amount of existing data, filling gaps where necessary, and gathered new supplementary information in co-operation with NGOs, government agencies, local communities, herders, miners, scientists and businesses. The result was that the many pieces of the vast Altai jigsaw \u2013 from new road developments to pasture degradation driven by unsustainably large goat herds fuelled by Kashmir demand and damaging government subsidies \u2013 came together to create a comprehensive picture of the Altai landscape. Contained within the Strategy are details of flora and fauna, topography, meteorology, demographics, legal mat- ters, conservation gaps and solutions to fill them, all supported by an abundance of maps, charts, graphs and survey results. In short, it is an \u201call you need to know and all that needs to be done\u201d guide to one of the largest and most biodiverse regions in Asia. The Strategy has already been approved by national Government and has been adopted by the regional Governments of Uvs, Khovd, Bayan Oigii and Gobi Altai as a working blueprint for landscape biodiversity conservation. And with the Strategy, a practical land use plan was born to provide for the needs of both wild species and people living there; a plan, in the words of the Strategy, \u201cto be followed and championed by government, developers, non-governmental organisations and local residents.\u201d CONNECTING LANDSCAPES IN BHUTAN AND MALAYSIA: CREATING AND STRENGTHENING BIODIVERSITY CORRIDORS AND NETWORKS Humans strive for an ever more interconnected world. The same is important for biodiversity. As uncoordinated development and habitat conversion fragments landscapes into smaller and smaller patches of natural habitat, conserved areas risk becoming islands isolated from each other by roads, fences, farmlands and urban development. Without connections between natural habitats, many migratory species are unable to travel the long distances they need to survive or to find an unrelated mate. Fragmentation reduces genetic diversity and disrupts ecological processes and vital ecosystem services. Linkages among natural habitats are particularly important in a changing climate \u2013 to ensure species have a wide range of options to migrate and shift ranges. UNDP, with GEF finance, supports countries to increase landscape connectivity. UNDP sup- ported projects have helped to establish and strengthen the management of \u2018corridors\u2019 and \u2018buffer zones\u2019 that connect protected areas, to allow species to move and genes to flow more easily between them. UNDP\u2019s support has piloted the corridor con- cept in Bhutan, to strengthen the protected area network and support conservation of threatened species, such as the tiger. Bhutan is internationally recognised for its commitment to conservation \u2013 the Kingdom maintains 70 percent forest cover, has conserved almost half of its territory in 11 protected areas and pledged to create conservation corridors to connect them. But in 2003, these corridors had not been tested or operationalized on the ground.

As a result of the project\u2019s work, forest corridors are afforded greater priority for sustainable management than the rest of the Bhutan\u2019s government-managed reserve forest. It has also strengthened links among staff in Forest Divisions and protected areas. \u201cLINKPA has helped to implement the Corridor Management Plan. Corridors are important to support the protected areas network. There is a clear need to operationalize the corridor policy officially declared over 10 years ago, supported by the thorough regulations and management arrangements recommended in 2010,\u201d says Vijay Moktan, Conservation Director of WWF Bhutan. He adds that \u201cwithout a good corridors system to connect fragments of habitats, it will be difficult to maintain the tiger population \u2013 let alone increase it.\u201d By creating linkages among key habitats, it is expected that the corridors will contribute towards increasing Bhutan\u2019s tiger population to reach targets set under the National Tiger Recovery Programme. An essential element of this work has been support to enhance the livelihoods of communi- ties living in the corridors who are dependent on natural resources. The project promoted ecotourism to generate income, supporting tourist trails and homestays and promoting a local mushroom festival as tourist attraction. \u201cMost of the communities living in these in- between spaces of corridors are among the poorest and the most vulnerable,\u201d says Tashi Dorji, former project manager of LINKPA; now Programme Analyst at UNDP Bhutan. \u201cThis is why corridor management needs to explicitly incorporate integrated conservation and development projects and mechanisms for sustainable utilization and income generation opportunities. It will be important to build on the LINKPA lessons in future.\u201d UNDP is also supporting the Government of Malaysia to improve connectivity among the remaining forests of Peninsula Malaysia. These forests serve as natural \u201cwater towers\u201d for Pen- insular Malaysia and neighbouring Singapore because of their water catchment function and also harbour an array of large mammals, includ- ing the Critically Endangered Malayan tiger. But forest degradation, infrastructure development and conversion to agriculture has left them in- creasingly fragmented \u2013 degrading the quality of tiger habitat and undermining the integrity of the landscape and its ability to sustain a supply of water to people in Malaysia and Singapore. This project, which began implementation in 2014, will conserve biodiversity and ecosystem services in three critical landscapes of the Central Forest Spine (CFS), by supporting the country\u2019s Central Forest Spine Master Plan to restore connectivity between forest complexes. The project will create corridors, rehabilitate degraded forest and improve forest landscape management to increase linkages among the forest complexes and improve the integrity of the landscape. It will also strengthen national and local institutional frameworks for forest management and law enforcement, and dem- onstrate sustainable financing mechanisms to sustain conservation of the linkages and reflect the value of ecosystem services in land use planning. Connected forests in the CFS mean improved habitat for wildlife and sustained water supply for people. A more interconnected natural world with benefits for people and wildlife!

The Northern Plains region of Cambodia, once described as the Serengeti of south east Asia due to the abundance of wildlife, is still home to many species, 40 of which are listed as Endangered by IUCN. Like many areas in the region, it is at an eco- logical crossroads. The country as a whole has witnessed war, the Khmer Rouge genocide, rampant deforestation and a wholesale, if piece meal, assault on its natural resource base. With the exception of deliberate criminal enterprises \u2013 for example, organised poaching and traf- fic in wildlife and tropical hardwoods \u2013 much environmental damage is driven by poverty, necessity and perhaps most crucially, a lack of options for local people. Once seen as unrelated, and sometimes even in conflict, conservation and local economic development are increasingly being recognised as being interdependent and fundamentally symbiotic. LINKING BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEMS MANAGEMENT WITH ECONOMIC GROWTH 42 HOME CALM IN CAMBODIA: GENERATING SUSTAINABLE LIVELIHOODS THROUGH BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION The Conservation Areas through Landscape Manage- ment (CALM) project sought to empower local people. This UNDP supported, GEF financed, grassroots oriented biodiversity conservation initiative involved the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and local NGOs, the Government of Cambodia, indigenous farming, fishing and forest dwelling communities\u2026 and the birds. During the project\u2019s six-year lifespan, 5,000 local residents and government officials were trained to participate in conservation planning processes, man- age their natural resources sustainably and expand their livelihood options. 32 community-based organisations (CBOs), including five indigenous representa- tion committees, were created to manage their immediate natural environments and land use plans were designed in 12 areas in the Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary, the country\u2019s largest protected area (4,025 km2). This involved the designation of 30,000 hectares of land as either \u2018community use\u2019 or \u2018sustain- able use\u2019 zones. Fifteen villages within the Preah Vihear Protected Area developed forest plans thereby securing ownership and control of their own natural resources manage- ment. A clear demarcation between communal land and adjoining forest was made to prevent confusion and inadvertent incursion into fully protected areas. 43 Biodiversity for Sustainable Development Community members get on-site training in wildlife protection in Tmatboey conservation area in Preah Vihear province, northern plains of Cambodia Critically Endangered white-shouldered ibis (Pseudibis davisoni) Photo: Ashish John/WCS Cleaning the Ibis Rice Photo: Eleanor Briggs/WCS Photo: Sok Sony/WCS 44 HOME Ecotourism initiatives were supported by WCS and a local NGO partner and are currently thriv- ing.

The huge bird, largest of the ibises, is a prin- ciple ecotourist draw, as are other wetland birds such as the equally Critically Endangered white-shouldered ibis. It is also helping rice farmers.

Tick the lot. In 2013, CNN ranked Tioman, which is part of a 69-island archipelago off the east coast of peninsular Malaysia, one of the world\u2019s top 100 Best Beaches. But Tioman and its sister islands were, and to a degree still are, at risk of becoming a case of Paradise Lost. Tourism is an economic staple but the principle assets of the archipelago \u2013 the exquisite and varied marine life \u2013 were being degraded by a combination of factors. Tourist activities and the tourism service sector were ironically a major problem prompting damage to coral caused by reckless anchorage, litter accumulation on beaches, spear guns, pollution and irresponsi- ble or na\u00efve purchases of shells and coral souvenirs. Although Malaysia\u2019s Marine Parks cover 42 of these islands, illegal fish- ing incursions in protected waters by both locals and raiding vessels from elsewhere in the country and from other nations were denuding resources and threatening a biodiversity-rich environment of global significance. The Department of Marine Parks Malaysia (DMPM) staff and the villagers were in an uncomfortable situation. Local com- munity members initially saw the DMPM staff as police. In the words of DMPM officer, Che Mohd Khir B Omar, locals felt sidelined and \u201ccaught in the middle between the need to earn an income, the restrictions, and limited options to earn income from other sources.\u201d There was, at first, he explains, \u201clittle interaction between conservation authorities and locals\u201d. This has changed and quite dramatically as the GEF financed and UNDP supported project \u2018Conserving Marine Biodiversity Through Enhanced Marine Park Management and Inclusive Island Development\u2019 provided six years of solid support from 2007 to 2013. The project was characterized by a complex bit of diplomacy and a \u2018meeting of minds\u2019, and involved expansion of the marine parks system, strengthening of law enforcement capacity, community involvement, educational outreach by community groups, international conservation and development bodies, local businesses and the tourists themselves. Marine park management has improved dramatically with 156 more staff fully trained in conducting patrols, with authority to arrest transgressors and an enforcement manual implemented thanks to project support. Two new marine parks were desig- nated, expanding Malaysia\u2019s marine protected areas system by an additional 6,400 hectares. Marine park management plans have been developed for all three targeted islands through a process that drew on information provided by committees of representatives at the community, state and national level. A coral reef bleaching response plan was also developed and implemented to help reduce the impact of coral bleaching events on the marine parks\u2019 reefs.

Ecosystem-based adaptation helps vulnerable communities increase their resilience, and the resilience of the ecosystems on which they depend. In the Asia Pacific region, expanding and connecting protected areas to conserve intact forests, wetlands, mangroves and coral reefs will provide a natural buffer for vulnerable communities against disasters intensified by climate change. Papua New Guinea (PNG) has become one of the first countries to incor- porate climate change adaptation strategies into their gap assessment of the country\u2019s national protected area system. Developed by PNG\u2019s Department of Environment and Con- servation (DEC) and The Nature Conservancy (TNC) with a grant from the UNDP supported and GEF financed \u2018Early Action Grant Project for Protected Areas\u2019 initiative, the assessment provides a clear blueprint for developing a climate-resilient network of terrestrial protected areas across the country. Member nations of the Convention on Biologi- cal Diversity (CBD) have agreed to establish protected area networks that represent the country\u2019s ecosystems and biodiversity. Gap assessments are used to identify \u2018gaps\u2019 in the current protected area network \u2013 where important ecosystems and/or species occur that are not currently covered by effective conservation measures. They involve mapping and comparing the current status of biodiversity with the current status of the protected area network. The resulting analysis can be used to design expanded protected area networks that are more effective at conserving representa- tive ecosystems and biodiversity and meeting specific conservation goals. Climate change is expected to cause rapid changes in biodiversity distribution and abun- dance, so shifting the map. But the precise nature of climate change impacts and their effects is uncertain. PNG\u2019s gap assessment has incorporated three strategies for integrating climate change ad- aptation into national protected area planning. In addition to mapping and considering the distribution of ecosystem types and status, endemic species, planning units and the current protected area network, the assessment also set out to achieve the following: 1.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0f792be2-794c-4b7e-916e-a06a387fa28c": {"__data__": {"id_": "0f792be2-794c-4b7e-916e-a06a387fa28c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Biodiversity for Sustainable Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8716234534ca9ada1ff5aac5dcce922b2810412718c50ae7652633908e800ec3"}, "2": {"node_id": "a241d610-6612-4ae9-9206-25478b33cc6e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d6f91d99daf1923fd71c1f727f2a155ddeaeba7b813407adbab28fbe58bbc8ae"}}, "hash": "6166e1aa253a61927906142c08d6f1db38b24566c14b1774b1374d2b18eda865", "text": "Conserve diversity of land systems.

Protect \u2018climate refuges\u2019. When changes in climate outpace the natural capacity for species to adapt, biodiversity is lost. And the likelihood, speed and extent of climate-driven changes are likely to be uneven. Places where climate changes are least severe are likely to serve as a \u2018refuge\u2019 for species and habitats marginal- ised by ecological changes elsewhere. Using models of projected climate change impacts, the assessment identified areas where envi- ronmental conditions \u2013 for example, available water capacity, average temperature and hot- test months \u2013 were expected to remain most similar to their current state. To improve the scope for natural adaptation and buy time to help improve the broader ecosystem\u2019s ability to cope with climate driven changes, the assess- ment aimed to protect these climate \u2018refuges\u2019. This significantly reduced the overall amount of climate change that habitats in the identified protected areas are predicted to experience. 3. Prioritise connectivity across habitats and landscapes. Increasing geographic connectivity among protected areas at the landscape level is a common climate change adaptation strategy. To increase the likelihood that species popula- tions will remain connected to suitable habitat as the climate changes, the assessment priori- tised connectivity among both habitats \u2013 cooler and warmer, drier and moister \u2013 and protected areas. It did this by prioritising protection of lo- cations with high environmental heterogeneity while maximising connectivity at the landscape level. Explicitly considering environmental het- erogeneity between adjacent areas resulted in protected area networks with 40 percent more internal environmental connectivity. The resulting climate-ready gap analysis pro- vides a clear map of priority areas for conserva- tion, based on the number of times each was selected according to the criteria prioritised. Because climate change projections alone do not drive the selection of protected areas, as targets for all conservation features are still being met based on current knowledge of biodiversity distribution, the solutions represent potential \u2018no regrets\u2019 measures. According to the authors of the assessment, in many other countries, these strategies could be implemented immediately with current data and expertise typically available during national conservation assessments. They represent defensible ways to guide national conservation priorities given current uncertainty in our ability to predict climate changes and their impacts. The project also includes a plan to integrate protected areas into the wider landscape, seascape and sectoral plans, as well as devel- oping a comprehensive legal framework. The next step will be to create the protected areas. \u201cAs we move forward, the conservation priority areas identified in this report represent key components of a national conservation plan to help shape a bright future for the people and the biodiversity of this extraordinary country we call our home. I look forward to seeing these areas, not on paper, but as a tangible reality across our nation,\u201d says Dr. Wari-lea Iamo, Former Secretary of the Department of Environment and Conservation. \u201cAs we move forward, the conservation priority areas identified in this report represent key components of a national conservation plan to help shape a bright future for the people and the biodiversity of this extraordinary country,\u201dDr. Wari-lea Iamo, Former Secretary of the Department of Environment and Conservation The UNDP supported, GEF financed \u2018Early Action Grant Project for Protected Areas\u2019 programme (active from 2008 to 2013), which funded this work in PNG, was designed in direct response to the CBD\u2019s Programme of Work on Protected Areas.

In the 1980s, the UNDP-funded and FAO-executed \u201cAssistance for the Establish- ment of the Wildlife Institute of India\u201d project supported the formation of the WII at Dehra- dun in 1982, with a mandate to build capacity through training, education and research in wildlife conservation. Ongoing support provided by the project enabled the nascent institute to build up a distinguished faculty through rigorous training and state of the art research, to broaden its research, teaching and training base, and to equip itself with advanced computers, labora- tories and field equipment. The WII successfully became an autonomous institute under the Ministry of Environment and UNDP-supported negotiations in 1994 led to the 1995 Mekong Agreement (Agree- ment on the Cooperation for the Sustainable Development of the Mekong River Basin of 5 April 1995). From 1993 to 1995, UNDP provided extensive support and facilitation for drafting, negotiation, ratification and adoption of this agreement, which established the Me- kong River Commission (MRC) and the MRC Secretariat (MRCS). The MRC is the only inter-governmental agency that works directly with the governments of Cambodia, Lao PDR, More recently, the European Union- UNDP-China Biodiversity Programme (ECBP), a joint initiative by the EU, UNDP and the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP), has provided support to strengthen policies, guidelines and capacity to implement the Convention on Bio- logical Diversity in China. The programme has combined policy dialogue and development, institutional strengthening and awareness-raising with a set of 18 field projects that helped improve biodiversity conservation and management at all levels across middle and western China. Implemented from 2005 to 2011, many activities under the programme supported strengthening of the overall capacity of institutions housed under China\u2019s MEP and the Foreign Economic Cooperation Office (FECO), which imple- mented the ECBP. At the national level, the programme focused on incorporating biodiversity into central govern- ment policy. For example, ECBP provided financial Between 1970 and 1982, UNDP funded about 35 projects totalling US$ 12 million in support of wildlife and national parks management in the Asia Pacific region. These projects were funded by UNDP in its then capacity as the central funding organisa- tion for technical cooperation in the United Nations (UN) system, and executed by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). This support contributed to the establishment and strengthening of many wildlife reserves and national parks in Afghanistan, Myanmar (then Burma), India, Indonesia, Iran and Nepal. Through country projects and targeted support, UNDP helped to establish organisations that play an instrumental role in biodiversity conser- vation and sustainable ecosystem management in the region: the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) and the Mekong River Commission (MRC).

This is being applied in demonstration wetland protected areas in seven projects under China\u2019s Main Streams of Life (MSL) \u2013 The Wet- land Protected Area System Strengthening Programme. The index assessment is done through a scorecard with a set of questions under three headings: habitat conditions, species welfare and socio-economic context. Protected Area managers, with specialist support, are expected to identify main threats and locally specific suitable indicator species to be monitored for the BHI. Elements under the three headings are as follows. Wetlands not only harbour biodiversity, but also provide essential ecosystem services for wildlife and human populations in areas far beyond. Connected with waterways, they are also susceptible to pressure from distant influences, including pollution, water extraction and water diversion. In Malaysia, in a new project to improve connectivity in the five million hectare Central Forest Spine (CFS) landscape running through Peninsular Malaysia, the Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII) is being piloted. BII was developed to meet the requirements set out by the CBD to provide an integrated measure of biodiversity. To date, the BII has been used to illustrate the state of biodiversity in Southern Africa during the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA), and has also been adapted and adopted for use in Norway, British Columbia, and for global analyses. It combines datasets comprising land cover, land use, species richness and abundance and impact factors on biodiversity, and synthesises them into a single, integrated index in a scientifically rigorous way. The BII is thus able to indicate the state of biodiversity in a given area, with high sensitivity to increased or decreased pressure on biodiversity as well as responses to the pressure, at a timescale relevant to policy decisions. The CFS is increasingly fragmented due to pressures that are mainly due to habitat loss to land use change. The proposed response to be supported by the project is the implementation of the interconnected system of PAs and corridors. This makes the BII an ideal indicator for the project. In addition, most of the necessary data sets are already available in Malaysia, which makes it feasible to monitor. Information for the BHI can be collected by monitoring a set of variables through day-to-day management actions to safeguard the health of wetland ecosystems. With this index, PA managers are able to gauge the dynamics of constantly changing biodiversity and ecosystem health, just as an investor may follow an endlessly changing financial index. Beyond projects, in order to achieve the national targets that are aligned with the Aichi Targets, countries need to have a robust framework to monitor the state of biodiversity. Countries need to have people on the ground to observe species numbers, movement, vegetation and threats. Countries need specific indicators that show changes in the state of species or elements of biodiversity. However, countries also need a couple of synthetic indices that can speak to the policy makers. For actual changes to occur to reverse the ever-increasing trends of biodiversity loss, conservation practitioners need to be able to communicate in five minutes what the state of biodiversity is and what needs to be done. We need brevity and executive summaries! UNDP-GEF support for these indices provides the opportunity to test the indicators in a country- and area-specific context. This supports future upscaling and provides an essential component of biodiversity monitoring. HOW HEALTHY IS YOUR HOUSE ? EVERYBODY NEEDS TO KNOW. THESE MEASURES ACT AS ESSENTIAL SURVEYORS!

Exactly the same thinking needs to apply to monitoring the health of our larger home \u2013 ecosystems and biodiversity. Working on biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management projects, we often struggle with indicators to show the results of ef- fective biodiversity management and improvement. Trends in species numbers, coverage of protected areas, and forest cover (to name a few) may indicate biodiversity and ecosystem health, but only very partially. In order to have a more integrated measure of biodiversity \u2013 to really assess the general health of biodiversity in a given area \u2013 we are try- ing two kinds of index through GEF financed projects in Asia. These two indices have features in common. They are sensitive to pressure, are feasible and cost-effective to implement and sustain, and are unambiguous, simple and clear. 54 HOME Western tarsier, (Tarsius bancanus) Sabah, Borneo Photo: Frans Lanting 55 Biodiversity for Sustainable Development FOOD & WATER Biodiversity provides the critical foundation for sustainable development and human wellbeing. At the simplest level, it underpins the ecosystem functions that provide us with the basic resources needed for our survival, including food and water. The security of water and food resources in the Asia Pacific region has been compromised by decades of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation, driven by economic development. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates that 75% of the countries in the region are facing an imminent water crisis, and in terms of food security, over 20% of the world\u2019s undernourished populations live in South and South-west Asia. Going forward, the effective climate-smart management of \u2018biodiversity and ecosystems for sustainable development\u2019 is a regional priority. Photo: happystock/Shutterstock.com 58 FOOD & WATER The security of the world\u2019s food supply is being compromised as more farmers rely on fewer and fewer varieties of crops and livestock, eroding agricultural biodiversity. UNDP works with countries in Asia and the Pacific to increase the genetic diversity in crops and livestock to secure the future of agriculture against increasing threats from climate change, pests and disease. Sustaining the health of agro-biodiverse ecosystems is fundamental for future food security. SECURING THE FUTURE OF AGRICULTURE IN ASIA PACIFIC On a farm in Hainan province in China lies a patch of land where scruffy wild plants grow in sparse tufts. It may not look like much next to the lush green rice crops that carpet the fields on either side, but this apparent scrubland could hold the key to food security for people that rely on the major grains grown in this area. These plants are wild relatives of rice that farmers in Hainan are now voluntarily protecting on their farms, next to fields of cultivated rice, as part of an effort to conserve the country\u2019s precious agricultural biodiversity. Agricultural biodiversity or \u2018agro-biodiversity\u2019 is the world\u2019s insurance policy against threats to food security, including climate change, pests and disease. It includes all compo- nents of biological diversity relevant to food and agriculture. Traditional crop varieties, locally developed over centuries, are storehouses of genetic diversity. Wild relatives of crops possess characteristics that could come in handy in the future. While not generally edible themselves, some are salt tolerant, high in protein or resistant to drought, flood, pests and disease. Conserving these genetic characteristics is essential to guard world agriculture from untold numbers of pests and diseases and the threat of increased drought, flood and sea level rise under climate change. But as farmers abandon traditional seeds for new hybrids, and as wild crop relatives are threatened by habitat loss and degradation, this genetic diversity is being eroded. In the last century, an estimated 75 percent of crop diversity has been lost from the world\u2019s fields as farmers have aban- doned their multiple local varieties for genetically uniform high yield varieties. As world agriculture relies on fewer and fewer varieties, the need to preserve genetic diversity of crop species and domestic animals for future generations becomes increasingly urgent. Because the Asia Pacific region is the origin of so many important agricultural crops and contains extensive agro- ecosystems of such high conservation value, UNDP and its partners have developed a suite of GEF financed projects to protect agricultural heritage and its associated biodiversity, cultures and livelihoods. These projects include efforts to conserve plants in fields as well as in seed and gene banks, enabling wild crop species to evolve in changing environments and providing useful information about these species in their natural environments.

The project, led by China\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture, has established 72 integrated conservation sites (8 project target sites and 64 replication sties) for these wild relatives across 15 provinces. A key innovation lies in the project\u2019s demonstration of a new in situ approach that incentivizes farmers to maintain conservation areas for wild crop relatives that are inte- grated next to their own cultivated crops. Farmers create conservation areas in return for project investment in infrastructure and goods that enhance both community and individual farming livelihoods. In addition, 273 farmers have been given interactive training on wild crop relative conservation and improved production practices. Farmers now understand the benefits of wild crop relatives and have become enthusiastic about conserving them. Provincial experts report that there has been a visible improvement in the density, spread and variety of wild crop relatives at the conservation sites over the project\u2019s lifetime from 2007-2013. Threats to the conservation areas have been reduced by 67 to 80 percent according to the project\u2019s threat assessment. Incomes have increased at the project\u2019s demonstration sites and in Yunnan province, overall incomes have increased more than four-fold. In the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), UNDP is partnering with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and FAO to support conservation of agro-biodiversity at both the local and national level. With project support, the country\u2019s National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan is being updated to pay special attention to sustainable use and conservation of agro-biodiversity. The project is reviewing relevant national policies and laws and has made recommendations to incorporate sustainable use and conservation of agro-biodiversity in the Agriculture Law, Forestry Law and Land Policy. In addition, the project is working with provincial government and local stakeholders to develop provincial Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans. These will allocate conserva- tion areas for maintaining agro-biodiversity on the ground. Xieng Khoung province has already allocated 300 hectares of forest for conservation of medicinal plants. Over its lifetime, the project aims to allocate 100,000 hectares of land for conservation areas. In Bhutan, UNDP\u2019s support has helped farmers to re- claim virtually forgotten traditional crop varieties while diversifying their income. In total, 555 farmers at 18 sites benefitted directly from the project, receiving training on improved agricultural practices to enhance production, increase income and conserve native varieties such as buckwheat, barley, soybean, maize, rice, and native breeds of yak, poultry, pigs, sheep and horses. Bhutan\u2019s National Gene Bank was also significantly expanded to hold a vast number of crop and animal genetic resources for research and future use, enhancing national capacity for ensuring crop and breed diversity.

While seven of the Vavilov Centres embrace more than one country, China is the only country to stand alone in its own right. Among its 136 endemic Wild Relatives of Crops (WRC), it has brought the world onions, cherries, peaches, hemp, sugar cane, and, most significantly, rice, soybean, millet and wheat. China is not just the birthplace of these varieties but also the repository of WRC genetic diversity, a living botanical library that if lost cannot be replaced. Those plants behind the fences might look like weeds, but they are far from that! With this in mind, in 2001, China began carrying out in situ conservation of WRCs through use of a single methodology: \u201cphysical isolation.\u201d This consisted of setting up guarded enclo- sures around the areas where WRCs occur, which are generally located very near to or within rural settlements. However, this made the sustainability of such conservation sites questionable. Maintenance of the site proved too costly, requiring investment for the fencing enclosure and a small watch station needing upkeep and salaries for staff.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "df8c6c44-e3b0-440f-9919-1de277ee1b12": {"__data__": {"id_": "df8c6c44-e3b0-440f-9919-1de277ee1b12", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Biodiversity for Sustainable Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ed72c848ffac5eede4daa077a99f6907a3b4bbb3b7fb8f3207c3f547e3b1e5e4"}, "2": {"node_id": "2caaf9a3-9ad2-4de2-997a-e1869285f178", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d62f82d3e0697f51efba90c0c52fb667453401837ff037bc5ace0eef71ca0edd"}}, "hash": "93ce5f52a04d09e8b089aeb1c2eaa7a11565e1dde604fc69f4a3f247714b4b39", "text": "In response, the Government, through the UNDP supported GEF financed \u2018Conservation and Sustainable Utilisation of Wild Relatives of Crops\u2019 Project introduced the new \u2018Main- streaming-in-Agriculture (MiA)\u2019 approach to conservation.

The project has succeeded in demonstrating the approach at eight sites located in rural vil- lages in eight provinces. More than 80 percent of the farmers who had land in the eight sites (1,172,968 hectares of agricultural landscape) FOR YOUR BUCK\u2014 CONSERVING TRADITIONAL CROPS IN BHUTAN have changed their economic activities, re- ducing negative impacts on the WRCs, while increasing their income between 5 and 48 per- cent. The area protected for WRC conservation in the eight sites has been not reduced since the project ended and in many of the areas, an increase in the density and spread of the conserved plant was clearly observed. The secret of success was the project\u2019s strategy to mainstream WRC conservation into the rural development and poverty alleviation activities of local government agencies. The project worked with local government officials and communi- ties to design incentive mechanisms suited to each local context. The mechanisms focused on improving farmer livelihoods by supporting sustainable alternative sources of income generation or improving existing livelihoods. Support generally consisted of investment in public works, such as roads and irrigation in- frastructure, as well as individual or small group support, such as grants for greenhouses, sheds for animals, access to improved varieties of crops, or micro-credit interest reduction. Seeing support that directly improved their daily lives and livelihoods, farmers embraced the concept of protecting the WRC sites. \u201cThe project\u2019s strategy was to embed WRC conservation in rural development,\u201d says Dr Qingwen Yang, Chief Technical Adviser for the project. \u201cIt is worth noting that the majority of the incentives were financed through local government budgets allocated for agricultural development, poverty alleviation and water resource management.\u201d In Guangxi province\u2019s site, for example, the in- centive demonstration project actively involved over 20 departments of local government. Li Kedi, a local government official says: \u201cThe key to the involvement of these departments has been establishing the clear link between WRC conservation and the work of Chinese agricul- tural scientist, Yuan Longping, who developed the first hybrid rice variety and demonstrated how the conservation of wild crops can improve food security.\u201d One of the happiest moments in Phurba\u2019s life was cooking traditional buckwheat noodles and pancakes for the Bhutanese Royal Wedding in 2011. \u201cIt was very special to see the King and the Queen in real life and to actually do something for them. I was so proud that our local buckwheat was valued by others and placed on the royal table.\u201d For her, the revival of this once virtually abandoned traditional crop has changed her life; before, she worked hard in the fields and tended her family. In Bumthang Valley, farmers have abandoned buckwheat for other cash crops, such as potatoes, when access roads opened the area to trade. Bhutan\u2019s wealth of national agro-biodiversity underpins the country\u2019s food security. It also provides genetic resources that may become beneficial and profitable in the future. Much of this diversity is held in traditionally cultivated varieties of crops, such as buckwheat. Alarmed by the decline of buckwheat production, Phurba and 14 other farmers formed the Bumthang Buckwheat Group in 2009, supported by the District Agricultural Office and the National Biodiversity Centre. With the UNDP supported GEF financed \u2018Integrated Livestock and Crop Conservation\u2019 Project (ILCCP), and the National Biodiversity Centre, the group worked on value-added product development and diversification; cakes, biscuits, and pizzas, as well as more traditional products such as buckwheat noodles and pancakes. The group soon opened a shop in 2011.The project supplied baking equipment, skills training and health benefit information. Buckwheat prices rose three-fold over five years and sales of flour, cakes and biscuits now bring the group a steady income.

Buckwheat wine is the next plan and has \u201cgood market potential,\u201d ac- cording to Sonam Tobgay, Chairman of Bumthang Buckwheat Group. To create opportunities for more farmers, the project also created a community seed bank to conserve buckwheat and other traditional crop varieties from the Dzongkhag area. \u201cWe distributed buckwheat seeds for free to those farmers wanting to grow the crop again and plan to introduce a price guarantee scheme,\u201d notes Gaylong, the District Agricultural Officer. Bumthang\u2019s buckwheat exemplifies the biodiversity wealth of Bhutan and its close relationship with local livelihoods. Buckwheat is just one of several traditional crop and livestock varieties that the project helped farmers to reclaim and conserve through supply chain development in 18 sites spanning eight districts. Others promoted under this effort included traditional varieties and breeds of barley, soybean, maize, rice, yak, poultry, pigs, sheep, Nublang \u2013 a local cattle breed \u2013 and horses. The project targeted some of the poorest communities, living in the most remote regions of Bhutan, with 555 farmers benefitting directly from its efforts. The project also expanded the National Gene Bank to hold a vast number of crop and animal genetic resources for research and long term use, and trained gene bank staff and extension offic- ers at local governments, resulting in enhanced national capacity for ensuring crop and breed diversity. According to traditional Bhutanese belief, buckwheat is one of the nine essential grains that Lord Buddha gave to mankind. Properly managed they will to continue as foundations for realizing high Gross National Happiness. In addition, in Guangxii, threats to a site that is home to a wild rice variety had been logging of pine for fuel and eucalyptus planting in the surrounding forest areas, which was affecting water resources. Water diversion from the area for rice paddies elsewhere was also a major issue. As an incentive mechanism for WCR conservation, an irrigation system was provided that increased rice production. A road was also constructed that supported increased production of crops, such as watermelons, by providing more efficient access to transport for shipment. Biogas digesters were introduced as an alternative fuel source so that villages did not need to cut down trees. And communities have stopped planting rice paddies in the buffer area to aid the protection of WRC.

An estimate of the economic value of wetlands per geographical region around the world indicated that Asian wetlands have the highest economic value at US$ 1.8 billion per year Wetlands come in many forms \u2013 rivers, lakes, mangrove forests, swamps, marshes, coastal floodplains, flooded forests and rice fields. These ecosystems provide essential services. As well as supplying and purifying water, they provide food, reg- ulate the climate, control floods, protect coastlines and are invaluable centres of biodiversity. But the world\u2019s wetlands are being lost and degraded faster than any other ecosystem, driven by conversion and development, water withdrawal, over-exploitation, pollution, drought and climate change. With finance from the GEF, UNDP supports projects in 10 countries in the Asia Pacific region to conserve, sustainably use and restore wetland ecosystems. In Iran, where competition for water resources and persistent drought severely threaten the country\u2019s wetlands, UNDP has worked with the government, NGOs and local communities to pilot strategies to address these pressures. The project developed integrated wetland management plans for wetlands at three demonstration sites \u2013 Lake Uromiyeh Basin, Lake Parishan and Shadegan wetland \u2013 through a highly participatory process that lasted over two years and drew on inputs from community, local, pro- vincial and national levels, 10 NGOs and 12 commu- nity-based organisations. Replication of the project\u2019s accomplishments speaks to its success. Integrated wetland management plans are now being rolled out to another 50 wetlands across the country. With project support, farmers living in and around the three demonstration sites were trained in sustainable agriculture techniques that use less water, control evaporation and have increased yields. At Lake Parishan, volunteers were trained as local eco-tour guides, a visitor centre was built to accommodate tourists, and women were given equipment to develop non-water dependent trades. Diversification of livelihoods reduces pressure on the wetlands and makes villagers more resilient to external shocks, including droughts. Lake Parishan locals are also helping to conserve key species around the wetland. \u201cSome fish species had all but disappeared from the project\u2019s pilot sites. We have taken action to save them by creating several conservation ponds beside the wetlands to ensure their survival through periods of drought,\u201d explains Mr. Yaghoobalipour of the Fisheries Organi- zation. More than 100 students, teachers and local villagers were trained to monitor otters living in the wetlands and were involved in developing a conser- vation plan for this important species. MANAGING AND RESTORING PRECIOUS WETLANDS IN IRAN AND NEPAL 65 Biodiversity for Sustainable Development Persistent drought and water withdrawals have reduced Lake Uromiyeh to 40 percent of its original size in recent decades. The project developed a drought risk management plan for the basin\u2019s wet- lands. Drawing on the experiences of other coun- tries facing similar problems, this plan established a framework for allocating water rights to each of the provinces surrounding the lake during droughts. It also included provisions on how to optimize water consumption and enforce these rights. In Nepal, the \u2018Conservation and Sustainable Use of Wetlands\u2019 project demonstrates that collaborative management and sustainable use of wetlands can improve both livelihoods and habitats for wildlife. Focusing on two priority wetlands, the Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve and Ghodaghodi Lake Area, the project restored 102 hectares of wetlands, mapped seven critical wetland sites and constructed a sluice gate at one of the sites to regulate water levels. It provided small loans to local community groups to help them adopt new trades, including poultry, goat, fish and pig rearing, leaf-plate making, vegetable farming and bicycle repairing. As a result, the incomes of 463 wetland depend- ent households have improved significantly. Com- munity members who adopted these practices have increased their incomes by between 25 percent to almost 90 percent over the baseline average income. Cumulatively these efforts have positively impacted local wildlife. A recent census of wild water buffalo \u2013 the flagship indicator species of Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve \u2013 showed an increase of 18 percent com- pared to the previous census. Similarly, the cotton pygmy goose, an indicator waterfowl of Ghodaghodi Lake Area, has increased by 19 percent compared to last year\u2019s record.

Siberian Cranes, Fereidunkenar Wetland, Mazandaran Province Photo: Ali Mohajeran 66 FOOD & WATER CONSERVING ECOLOGICALLY CRITICAL AREAS IN BANGLADESH\u2019S VAST WETLANDS \u201cLess water, more yields!\u201d exclaims Mohammad Sharifi Moghaddam, a wetlands conservation project consultant and instructor for the sustainable agriculture initiative around Lake Parishan near the main South Western Iranian city of Shiraz. Most families living in the villages surrounding the wetland have been involved in farming for generations. Today, as family and plot sizes expand, rainfall decreases and water overuse has become ubiquitous, farming has become much more challenging \u2013 and more of a threat to the environment. Unsus- tainable agriculture and inefficient irrigation methods are one of the main causes for damaging wetlands. Since 2010, the \u2018Conservation of Iranian Wetlands\u2019 project has helped farmers adopt new water management techniques that use water more efficiently, so preserving the wetlands. These techniques, com- bined with simple agricultural methods such as composting and not tilling the soil, have boosted crop yields. The UNDP supported GEF financed project was conducted by the Departments of Environment and Agriculture. Villagers around Lake Parishan and the project\u2019s two other pilot sites are now acutely aware that preserving the wetland means more than saving the environment. In the long term, it means saving their economic livelihood. A field farm school was set up as a demonstration site for nine dif- ferent agricultural and water management techniques. Participating farmers work on the pilot site and replicate these sustainable methods in their own farms. These techniques offer an important alternative to traditional flood irrigation and the use of chemical fertilizer, which both use vast amounts of water. Locally made compost requires nearly two times less irrigation than chemical fertilizers, which need to be sprayed around the wetland. Using the sustainable techniques introduced by the project, farmers save 42 percent of water previously needed. These techniques have also significantly increased yields, more than doubling average yields for common crops such as tomatoes or watermelons, from 70 to 148 tonnes per hectare. Mr. Ali Reza Cheraqui, Coordinator of the Sustainable Agriculture Pro- ject and Expert in Kazeroon\u2019s Department of Agriculture explains that: \u201cWhile it is of immense benefit to the wetland, ultimately, the project speaks to farmers in the language of money. It makes business sense for them to work more sustainably: their risk margin is small, so are their plots. They need the field farm school to demonstrate that these techniques will actually work for them before adopting them on their own farms. This pilot has more and more participants for a simple reason: sound environmental management means better business opportunities now and in the future. At first, neither farmers nor the Ministry of Agriculture was acquainted with this kind of approach, so it took some work to implement, but the results are speaking for themselves and have far exceeded our expectations.\u201d In an effort to expand further the adoption of sustainable farming techniques, and to involve more women in community development, the project has formed a group of 11 women facilitators from villages around the wetland. These women learn about new crop management techniques and extend their use in their own communities. The group has also constituted a micro-credit fund with seed money from the wetlands conservation project (IRR 20 million) and use their own sav- ings to purchase the equipment necessary, such as egg incubators, to develop alternative livelihoods producing and selling natural composts. The sustainable farming initiative around Lake Parishan has been so successful that it has already been replicated around the Lake Uromiyeh Basin, and leveraged funding from government. In 2012, the project, which was implemented in 72 hectares of farm lands, resulted in 50 percent reduction in water consumption, 44 percent reduction in usage of chemical fertilizers and poisons, and an 18 percent increase in farm performance in a pilot site around SiranGuli wetland (one of Uromiyeh\u2019s satellite wetlands).

UNDP and the Government of Bangladesh teamed up to manage mounting threats to the coun- try\u2019s important wetlands through the UNDP supported GEF financed \u201cCoastal and Wetland Biodiversity Management at Cox\u2019s Bazar and Hakaluki Haor\u201d project, implemented from 2002 to 2011. The project worked in four of eight sites especially designated as \u2018Ecologically Critical Areas\u2019 (ECAs) \u2013 wetland sites that harbour sig- nificant biodiversity but where degradation has reached or threatens to reach a critical state. The project has successfully developed and demonstrated a collaborative system for managing these ECAs on the ground, with the Bangladeshi Department of Environment, working in partnership with local people, other government agencies, NGOs and ECA coordinating committees. Through 72 Village Conservation Groups (VCGs) established across the sites, 3,267 local people have become actively involved in protecting, restoring and sustaining the wetlands of the ECAs, including replanting of mangroves in the coastal wetlands of Cox\u2019s Bazar and swamp forests around the seasonal freshwater lakes of Hakaluki Haor, so regenerating habitats. VCGs have also taken an active role in sand dune stabilization, turtle and fish conservation, and anti-poaching measures, with 138 members trained and deployed as conservation guards. With training in alternative trades and small loans, communities have adopted more sustainable livelihoods, including livestock rearing, homestead gardening, fish selling, tailoring and improved horticulture and agriculture. Collectively the project\u2019s efforts reduced violations of ECA regulations by 70 percent over its lifetime, according to field reports. Hunting of waterfowl has ceased in Hakaluki Haor and turtle mortality has been greatly reduced at the ECAs in Cox\u2019s Bazar. Conservation management plans and zoning schemes were developed for the sites, though extensive survey work and local community partici- pation, and used by the Department of Environment to govern decision making. The groundwork and experience gained through the initiative will provide valuable lessons to inform the planning and management of four new ECAs established during the project. The Government of Bangladesh will follow up this with another project, the \u2018Community Based Adaptation in Ecologically Critical Areas through Biodiversity Conservation and Social Protection\u2019 funded by their Climate Change Trust Fund. This will build on the ECA management model and incor- porate climate change adaptation measures.

Notable for its high levels of endemism (particularly aquatic species of mollusk and fish), its abundant birdlife, physical beauty and the rich cultural tradi- tions of the ethnic minority groups that make its shores and waters their home, Inle is currently under consideration for UNESCO World Heritage Site designation. It is also a lake in trouble. Poor rains in recent years, combined with other climate change impacts, may be two contributing factors to a fall in water levels and surface area shrinkage. But the driving force behind Inle\u2019s woes is primarily anthropogenic. For example, the local custom of constructing large floating gardens on earth-covered weed platforms has unintentionally resulted in land reclamation as the gardens take root in its shallows. Fertilizer and pesticide run-off from both these gardens and shoreline agriculture is also an issue, along with sewage emanating from households, most of which lack sanitation. Sediment is being washed down from surround- ing hills, which are being deforested. Alien species introduced to fuel fisheries yield and water hyacinth infestation are also major concerns. The challenges facing Inle\u2019s environmental integrity and to the sus- tainable livelihoods of local communities are formidable.

It promotes multi-country cooperation for the management of these shared ecosystems through sustainable, integrated and ecosystem-based approaches. Since 1991, UNDP\u2019s IW programme, financed by the GEF, has sup- ported countries to deliver a cumulative portfolio of projects of US$ 98.11 million in the Asia Pacific region. These initiatives address agreed environmental and water resource concerns facing regional waterbodies. The programme builds institu- tional and system capacity at the national and regional levels for the management of significant shared marine, coastal and freshwater resources. This is vital for the billions of people who depend on these ecosystems for their livelihoods and security. In the Yellow Sea Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) \u2013 one of the most affected by human development \u2013 countries bordering the ecosystem have agreed on tangible targets to reduce fishing and pollution dis- charge into the marine environment. With UNDP support, these nations have introduced sustainable marine aquaculture practices that are more profitable and less environmentally damaging compared to traditional methods; they have approved a network of new marine protected ar- eas; and agreed to establish a regional monitoring network for better understanding of the status of the marine environment and to inform \u2018adaptive management\u2019 in the Yellow Sea.

When I visit a place I try to imagine what the area or town looked like a hundred years ago and how the people lived. What was life like for the \u2018king\u2019 of the castle, the carpenter or the blacksmith in a medieval town? But what did natural areas look like? Were they just vast untouched wildernesses, devoid of people, or were they already being altered or managed in some way by the humans that shared them? The answer is perhaps surprising. Throughout history, humans, especially those that depended on natural resources for their wellbeing, have stewarded the land and conserved natural resources, including biodiversity. For example, communities of the Arabian Peninsula have practiced Hima, a traditional system of resource tenure, for more than 1,400 years. Hima literally means \u201ca protected place\u201d and is believed to be the most widespread and longstanding traditional conservation institution in the Middle East (and perhaps on Earth). On my recent professional introduction to the Pacific, I learned that a similar, albeit less well-known traditional system exists for conserving marine and coastal natural resources. Depending on which country you visit, the system is called by different names \u2013 \u201cra\u2019ui\u201d in the Cook Islands, \u201ctabu\u201d in Fiji, \u201ckapu\u201d in Hawaii, and \u201cbau\u201d zones in Palau.

When the community noticed that populations of kai- koso clams, a staple food source, were declining from the mud flats around their village, they declared a ban on harvesting from inshore by Johan Robinson Regional Technical Adviser, Asia-Pacific waters over these mudflats for three years, building on the tradition of \u201dtabu\u201d prohibitions. After seven years of local community management, the clam popula- tion has rebounded and village incomes have risen significantly with increased harvests. The success of the Ucunivanua LMMA spread rapidly, and a support network \u2013 the Fiji Locally Managed Marine Area Network \u2013 grew from this. By 2009, the network had expanded to include 250 LMMAs, covering some 10,745 square kilometres of coastal fisheries, more than 25 percent of Fiji\u2019s inshore area. In 2002, the network won the Equator Initiative Prize in recognition of this achievement. Well-managed LMMAs (and other marine reserves) can support healthy fisheries and secure livelihoods for local fishermen. They can also help degraded ecosystems and depleted fish stocks to recover. With over three billion people depending on marine and coastal biodiversity for their livelihoods, establishing an effective network of LMMAs represents a key strategy for poverty alleviation. UNDP is supporting expansion and strengthening of LMMAs in the Philippines, and (through the Ridge to Reef Programme supported by GEF and UNDP) in the Cook Islands, Federal States of Micronesia and Fiji. The Ridge to Reef projects work with a range of partners to promote integrated management of natural resources in these archipelagos \u2013 from water catchments through to the sea. This will include support- ing local communities and organizations to establish and strengthen networks of LMMAs to maximize their ecological viability. The projects will build the capacity of local people and organisations to effectively manage LMMAs. The projects will also support piloting of innovative revenue generation schemes for LMMAs to help them become finan- cially sustainable. We hope that this support to local communities and traditional management practices will contribute to an LMMA legacy that future generations can look back on with pride!

In short, we improved our standard of living,\u201d says Sunyoto (52), a farmer and Treasurer of a local marketing group speaking in an August 2013 interview published by Kompas newpaper. Indonesia comprises approximately 190 mil- lion hectares of land area of which 133 million hectares are classified as forest. This tree cover serves as crucial watershed, but forest degra- dation is ongoing and of 17,000 watersheds nationwide, approximately 3,000 are currently considered to be in a critical condition. Deforestation, particularly in mountainous areas, has negative effects both upstream and downstream in the form of seasonal floods or drought, and results in erosion and deadly landslides. Agriculture and food security for the 52.4 percent of Indonesians living below the poverty line on less than US$ 2 a day is also negatively impacted. In addition, fisheries and marine ecosystems also suffer with corals and fish nurseries swamped by sediment run-off. The SCBFWM Project\u2019s objective is to catalyse the impact of the Government of Indonesia\u2019s new programmes on community based forest management, reforestation and afforestation, and is designed to \u201caddress the root causes of deforestation related to poverty, unequal distri- bution of benefits and weak law enforcement due to lack of inter-sectoral co-ordination and collaboration.\u201d 282 watersheds have been prioritized at government level for restoration. These are located in 400 districts in 32 provinces. The government\u2019s professed goal is to plant a bil- lion trees, an initiative sustained by massive overseas financial support (over US$ 1 billion in the last two decades). To date 1,561,000 seedlings have been planted in the six watersheds targeted as pilot sites by the SCBFWM project. Seedling planting is not always a guarantee of success \u2013 some seedlings, particularly those of favoured fruit or nut trees, are subsequently removed by locals and replanted by their houses. Other seedlings, if improperly planted or planted in the wrong location on degraded land, wither and die. But despite these failures, satellite image analysis shows a forest cover increase in the project pilot watershed sites of 576 hectares. 72 community based organisations have been formed under SCBFWM, including women\u2019s groups, and emphasis is firmly placed on incentivizing people to engage in watershed management by offering tangible benefits for good practice. These come in different forms. Electricity is one clear example; employment is another. Raising and selling seedlings, for example, has generated US$ 3.8 million for the Dahlia women\u2019s group in Suranadi village. The guarantee of a clean and reliable water supply due to the provision of pipes and the reduction of sediment in reservoirs has enabled women elsewhere to devote less of their lives search- ing for safe water and more of their time to generating income through small scale private enterprise such as operating food stalls. Education is another benefit \u2013 793 community members have received training in fields such as tree nursery management, non-timber forest products development, administration, financial management and agro-forestry. 575 govern- ment officials have also received training in watershed management. The project has facilitated public discussion and consultation at the national level and, as a result, legislation has been enacted such as the Government Regulation Concerning Watershed Management (2012). 73 Biodiversity for Sustainable Development Madakaripura Waterfall, East Java, Indonesia Photo: James Jones Jr/Shutterstock.com RIGHT: Community members conducting rapid hydrologi- cal appraisal in the buffer zone area of Rinjani Mountain National Park, West Nusa Tenggara Photo: Eliza/UNDP SCBFWM Project FAR RIGHT: Many local farmers living in the buffer zone of Bukit Barisan Selatan national Park are coffee farmers Photo: Gandhi/UNDP SCBFWM Project 74 FOOD & WATER THE POWER OF WOMEN: INTEGRATING GENDER INTO ECOSYSTEM AND BIODIVERSITY MANAGEMENT by Doley Tshering Regional Technical Adviser, Asia-Pacific The Coastal and Marine Biodiversity in Sindhudurg project has looked at ways to encourage alternate livelihoods for fishing communities, particularly women.

This is how most women in my village begin their days. After breakfast, she and other women tend crops, walk to the forests to collect more firewood or leaf litter, and travel far to bring water to irrigate the fields. Women play a pivotal role in natural resource management; they ensure the wellbeing and very survival of many rural families. Despite the fact that women also play a vital role in the conservation, management and sustainable use of biodiversity, their contribution is often overlooked. Women stand at the heart of the food-water-energy nexus. For effective natural resource management, women must be seen and heard. They are the cornerstones of equitable and effective conser- vation strategies, and have the power to make a project thrive rather than wither. This is why UNDP-GEF follows a proactive approach to ensure the integration of gender considerations into the design and implementation of all ecosystem and biodiversity projects. ENGENDERING PROJECT DESIGN During the early design stages of a project, UNDP identifies stakehold- ers and interests so as to embrace as wide a variety of views and options as possible and ensure adequate balance in terms of gender input and protection efforts; empowering communities to take advantage of opportunities for economic incentives particularly for women, who are the main users and managers of forests; and the creation of village conservation committees to voice women\u2019s opinions and encourage the involvement of women resource users in the project. In other cases, positive gender interventions have emerged naturally because women were closely involved in project planning. For example, the \u2018Linking and Enhancing Protected Areas in the Temperate Broadleaf Forests Ecoregion of Bhutan\u2019 (LINKPA) project which supported the sustainable conservation of the temperate forest and mountain eco- systems in Thrumshingla National Park and its corridors, had several gender directed activities, such as providing grant support to a local women\u2019s weaving association (yathra weaving) and providing support for roofing materials in households headed by women. Similarly, in the case of the \u2018Gulf of Mannar Marine and Coastal bio- diversity\u2019 project in India, it was recognized that women from fisher communities held the key to improving local economic conditions and enhancing marine biodiversity conservation. As a result, 2,341 self-help groups were formed comprising 34,699 members, more than 1,800 of which (>76.7 percent) were women\u2019s groups with 27,413 (79 percent) women members. GENDER SENSITIVE MONITORING AND EVALUATION Projects can only understand and measure gender equality when the right questions are asked, for example, by including sex-disaggregated data in baseline and other surveys. The Nepal Western Terai project adopted Gender and Social Inclusion (GESI) disaggregated data in its reporting. In addition, the project also employed a GESI specialist for the terminal evaluation to ensure that these issues were examined in greater detail. The same project has promoted the use of wellbeing and wealth ranking exercises to better target pro-poor interventions. As a result of the integration of gender considerations in projects around the world, an increasing number of women and their families are able eat their food warm. participation. Women are an essential part of this equation, and where they may not normally be involved in public debate, efforts to listen to their concerns and suggestions must be made. Equally, it is important to build the skills and capacities of both male and female project staff to implement projects. The identification of gender \u201cchampions\u201d within Country Offices means that \u2018gender expertise and priorities\u2019 can be embedded into project design and management. MAKING THE CASE FOR GENDERED INTERVENTIONS The basic premise for integrating gender in ecosystem management and biodiversity conservation initiatives is that it not only advances the equity agenda, but also improves efficiency and effectiveness. For example, during the project preparation phase for the UNDP-GEF project \u2018Western Terai Landscape Complex Project in Nepal\u2019, signifi- cant gender and ethnic disparities with regard to access to resources, benefits and decision-making were identified. Assessments showed that female literacy stood at around 16 percent in Bardia and Kailali villages (project pilot sites) compared to 42-45 percent for male literacy. As a result, gender and social inclusion were accorded a high priority in the project.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01075632-466e-42c4-8d73-4707f61cc354": {"__data__": {"id_": "01075632-466e-42c4-8d73-4707f61cc354", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Biodiversity for Sustainable Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "53dabd5dae7514c0fba3e5adfcd8516c4c63851d25ef20fe39e21478705dd5de"}, "2": {"node_id": "df663461-2fb2-46cc-b0fc-211aaea79579", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "95c8b434caf0f7406122dd7efa4c486a3e31694b52f8eaaa7da6d8488290a4bb"}}, "hash": "fa66fcf5dccca607b3b32829624a9964413acd8e481e4171743097af86f9d6be", "text": "As a result, gender and social inclusion were accorded a high priority in the project.

Yet they are being degraded rapidly as a result of logging, conversion to agriculture, development and unsustainable extraction for firewood. UNDP, with GEF finance, has teamed up with the Forest Administration, The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Cambodia, NGO \u2018Group for the Environment, Renewable Energy and Solidarity\u2019 (GERES) and local communities in an initiative designed to help communities manage and use the for- est sustainably while improving their livelihoods. Launched in 2011, the project combines traditional community forest management with efforts to reduce demand for firewood by promoting energy efficient cookstoves. With project support, 30 community forests are being established. Communal land use plans are being developed by the project in four communes to coordinate use of the forest by different communities in a sustainable manner. \u201cThe project is developing management plans for the 30 community forests covering a total area of 11,310 hectares, through a consultative process that involves 8,167 families. These plans also aim to increase the area of woodlots managed by local communities to produce sustain- able charcoal, so that they generate income from the forest while using it sustainably,\u201d said Mr. Khorn Saret, Deputy Director of Department of Forest and Community Forestry, Forest Administration, The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. Through the project\u2019s support, the institutional process for allocating for- est to communities is being streamlined and refined, to make it quicker for the government to declare these areas and develop participatory plans for their management. Once these local communities begin managing their own natural resources, they are able to obtain benefits from using them sustain- ably. Business plans, as part of the Community Forest Plans, are being developed to support community income generation. Studies conducted through the project\u2019s support have identified a number of potential products with good business potential to generate income for the communities through sustainable forest management. These include fuel wood, charcoal, timber, and non-timber forest products such as honey, rattan and bamboo. At the same time, the project is providing training to build the capacity of government staff and local people to implement sustainable practices. So far, 1,328 people have been trained and have actively participated in their community forest development and management planning. At the same time, the project aims to reduce demand for fuel wood from forests by promoting use of improved cookstoves that are more energy efficient and require less firewood or charcoal. An estimated 84 percent of Cambodian households rely on firewood and charcoal for cooking. Unsus- tainable woodcutting contributes to forest degradation. To help tackle this, in addition to the sustainable community managed forests being established, support has been provided to train local people to produce improved cookstoves in Kampang Chhnang province. The training has enabled local women to take up cookstove production, reducing wood consumption and increasing their income. Sous Chamroeun is 24 years old and lives with her family who are rice farmers. After attending a cookstove training provided by the project, Sous and her cousin Kong Saren started making improved cookstoves in 2012. Today the stoves make a substantial addition to the monthly income of the family. Depending on how much time they have to spend in the rice fields, Sous and her cousin make from 75 to 250 improved cookstoves per month, which she sells to retailers for 3,000 Riels per stove (approximately US$ 0.75).

IN MICRONESIA - PROMOTING THE CHEEF BENEFITS OF LOCAL FOODS Spread across 2,500 kilometres of the north-western Pacific Ocean, just above the Equator, the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) consist of the four states of Chuuk, Kosrae, Pohnpei and Yap and their more than 600 widespread islands\u2014only 65 of which are currently inhabited. In recent years, as these isolated communities have faced the modern pressures of globaliza- tion, they have experienced dramatic changes in consumption, which have led to a range of nutritional disorders. By 2008, it was estimated that 73 percent of the dietary intake of communities living in FSM came from imported food products, leaving the nation with a highly negative food trade balance, and vulnerable to global food price fluctuations and disruptions to food transport. This was accompanied by increasing neglect of traditional food systems, lifestyle changes and reduced levels of exercise. A World Health Organization (WHO) STEPS assessment in the same year reported that 32 percent of Pohnpei adults had Type 2 diabetes. However, recent studies have also identified locally grown (and globally important) staple foods that could help alleviate vitamin deficiencies and anaemia, including bananas, taro and pandanus. These carotenoid-rich foods can help protect against diabetes, heart disease and some cancers. The planting of rare diverse cultivars therefore provides a local solution to a range of develop- ment challenges\u2014from conserving biodiversity to providing reliable and resilient local food supplies, and meeting healthcare goals to generating new opportunities for sustainable livelihoods. The global GEF Small Grants Programme, implemented by UNDP, has been active in the Pacific region since 2004. Grants of up to US$50,000 are awarded to local non-govern- mental and community-based organizations to conserve and restore the environment while enhancing people\u2019s wellbeing and livelihoods. SGP embodies the very essence of sustain- able development by \u201cthinking globally, acting locally\u201d, demonstrating that community action can maintain the fine balance between human needs and environmental imperatives. In 2005, SGP awarded a grant for US$50,000 to the Island Food Community of Pohnpei (IFCP) to undertake activities in the village of Mand. Working initially in Madolenihmw Municipality at Mand Community Project for Agricultural Biodiversity Conservation in the north east of the island, a series of small demonstration projects set out to improve tra- ditional food production and consumption and build awareness of healthy local foods, while improving community livelihoods. From small beginnings, the project achieved impressive results with global and local benefits. Through ground-breaking scientific analysis of the nutritional value of local traditional foods, ICFP has shown that the cultivation and consumption of local agro-biodiversity can improve public health. This in turn has led to increased household biodiversity and greater dietary diversity in local communities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6187ba8d-0431-4f01-aa36-d65d57457429": {"__data__": {"id_": "6187ba8d-0431-4f01-aa36-d65d57457429", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Biodiversity for Sustainable Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b0de6bb2ecd7574b127bcde3c702e6a0601142867daef16599f04e51fd240a16"}, "2": {"node_id": "3aae7b84-b0e0-4ac3-806b-ed9896ae1659", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "70ad540a8d07edd1bc81e639225e21d3959ca8d326b6806d735efca92c42c6ff"}}, "hash": "2b054ef9db40cd9fa587b52f7dd6477e569e215ce44994b8a844b6e829b070d1", "text": "This in turn has led to increased household biodiversity and greater dietary diversity in local communities.

More than 100 herit- age cultivars are now grown and managed by local farmers, including most local varieties of giant swamp taro, banana, and pandanus. The genebank, IFCP and the partner communities have become suppliers of these rare species to a number of farmers island-wide and planting materials have been distributed nation-wide to enable other communities to grow rare cultivars, which are more resilient to the effects of chang- ing climate regimes. Through this success, the project has been able to influence food policy development at multiple levels\u2014governmental, community IFCP is an NGO that works to educate the people of Pohnpei about the relationship between diet and health, and to help generate economic benefits and strengthen cultural identity by using local foods. and individual. The \u2018Let\u2019s Go Local!\u2019 slogan has organically been adopted by government departments, schools and community events, and IFCP served as the key advocate for the new Presidential Proclamation on Food Se- curity 2010. This encourages all government- sponsored events to cater using healthy, local foods. Several state departments have now banned imported foods from their offices, and IFCP has been instrumental in the considera- tion of the soft drink tax bill. At the community level, IFCP is currently driving the implementation of the Local Food Policy for community events and activities. At least 10 churches, CBOs, schools and private busi- nesses have agreed on \u2018local food only\u2019 policies. With a second SGP grant, the project has also catalysed the development of a small food processing industry using locally designed, affordable energy efficient equipment, such as smokeless charcoal ovens and solar dryers to support sustainable livelihoods. Only climate resilient local foods are processed to decrease the reliance on imported foods on the small islands and prevent the loss of indigenous knowledge on biodiversity. \u201cBy supporting local food growth and value- added production, such as taro flour and banana chips, we are building healthy and resilient communities that are self-sufficient and less vulnerable to global social pressures,\u201d explained Dr. Lois Engleberger, Executive Director of IFCP. \u201cWe are working directly with the Pohnpei Women\u2019s Council and their member groups to improve women\u2019s health and livelihoods by training them in the energy-efficient food preparation of biodiverse food crops.\u201d IFCP has now moved on to work with the rural communities of Salapwuk and Rohi, and the urban Kapinga village in the centre of Pohnpei. These communities have invested in smokeless ovens and learned about the benefits of local food through the CHEEF initiative. In 2011, the FAO endorsed the IFCP approach through the publication \u2018Let\u2019s Go Local!\u2014 Guidelines for Promoting Pacific Island Food\u2019, a step-by-step guide to replicating the IFCP initiative. Both WHO and FAO recognized the transferability of the initiative and IFCP has begun supporting the development of local initiatives in 3 other FSM states and regionally in Palau, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Marshall Islands and Kiribati. In 2013, IFCP won the prestigious WHO Healthy Islands Recogni- tion Best Practice Award, and has successfully leveraged US$100,000 to continue funding the project with a competitive grant from the United States Forest Service. 79 Biodiversity for Sustainable Development Photos: GEF SGP Micronesia Development challenges in Asia and the Pacific are as diverse and complex as the region itself.

They regenerate the soil, pollinate food plants and crops, and provide the genetic pool of traits that will be needed to adapt our food systems under changing conditions and keep them resilient to pests, disease and climate change. Ecosystems store, supply and cleanse water. DID YOU KNOW? \u2022 About 100,000 species of insects, as well as birds and mammals, pol- linate more than two-thirds of food plants and are responsible for more than one-third of the world\u2019s crop production. \u2022 Globally, fish provides about 3 billion people with almost 20 percent of their intake of animal protein. In areas of Asia Pacific, fish is even more important; accounting for half of total animal protein intake in Bangla- desh and some small island developing states, and 50 to 80 percent in countries of the Lower Mekong River Basin. \u2022 The Himalayas are often called the \u201cwater towers\u201d of Asia. This collec- tion of snow-clad mountains and glaciers feed rivers, including the Indus, the Ganges, and the Tsangpo-Brahmaputra, which supply water to 40 percent of the planet\u2019s population. SUPPORT LIVELIHOODS AND ECONOMIC SECTORS Billions of livelihoods and many economic sectors, including water supply, agriculture, fisheries, forestry, health, nutrition, energy, trans- port and tourism, depend on biodiversity and ecosystem services. DID YOU KNOW? \u2022 The world\u2019s fisheries provide a source of livelihood and income for millions of people. Commercial capture fisheries had an estimated value of US$ 274 billion in 2007 and recreational fisheries are worth some US$ 190 billion to the global economy. \u2022 Ecotourism generates significant employment and is now worth around US$ 100 billion per year. Many tourism businesses rely fully or partially on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Whale watching alone was estimated to generate US$ 2.1 billion in 2008, with over 13 million people undertaking the activity in 119 countries. \u2022 Genetic diversity is central to the seed industry. Its 10 top compa- nies had commercial seed sales of US$ 15 billion in 2006. \u2022 Insects and other animals that carry pollen between crops, es- pecially fruit and vegetables, are estimated to be worth more than US$ 200 billion annually to the global food economy. PROTECTION A range of ecosystems act as buffers against natural hazards, providing valuable yet under-utilized assets for climate change adaptation, enhanc- ing natural resilience and reducing the vulnerability of people to floods and the effects of land degradation. DID YOU KNOW? \u2022 The largest mangrove forest in the world, the Sundarbans, stretches along the coasts of Bangladesh and India and protects millions of people living along this coastline from the worst extremes of storms and cyclones. \u2022 Planting and protecting nearly 12,000 hectares of mangroves in Viet Nam cost just over US$1 million. But it has saved annual expenditures on dyke maintenance of well over US$7 million. PHARMACIES 80% of people living in rural areas in developing countries rely on traditional plant-based medicines for basic healthcare, according to an estimate by the WHO. But many modern prescription drugs are also derived from substances found in plants, animals and fungi; either directly or by providing biochemical models or templates used to make synthetic compounds. DID YOU KNOW? \u2022 The alkaloids that cure the cancers Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and acute childhood leukaemia are derived from the rosy periwinkle, a plant indigenous to Madagascar. \u2022 A drug that made organ transplants viable \u2013 cyclosporine \u2013 was obtained from an obscure soil fungus found in Norway (Tolypocla- dium inflatum). \u2022 Marine sponges are rich sources of anti-cancer chemicals \u2013 many of these chemicals are tumour suppressants and some have already been approved for treatment of cancer. WHY BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEMS ARE CRUCIAL FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT Ecosystems and biodiversity provide our food, water, fuel, medicine and shelter. They shield us from natural disasters and reduce our vulnerability to climate change. They create the very air we breathe, recycle nutrients, control pests and generate the soil in which our food is grown.

This vibrant and amazing web had endured and evolved for millennia, with human beings safely nestled within it. But as this region has developed rapidly, many people have come to forget how completely their lives depend on priceless natural resources. So much of the development in this region, and the aspirations of its people, seems set on getting as far away from nature as possible. People aspire to concrete houses in urban cities to get away from the wood and dirt of rural life, to cars that seal them away from their surroundings as they travel, and to air conditioning that insulates them from the heat and dust carried by nature\u2019s breezes. Many of our young aspire to creamy pale skin as a sign that they no longer toil in the outdoors, as their parents and grandparents did. All of these aspirations are valid and worthwhile. The desire for a better, more comfortable life for our families has motivated amazing progress and improvements in welfare for all of us. But in striving to \u2018get away from nature\u2019, people sometimes forget how irreplaceable nature is for all of us. And how essential sustaining ecosystems and biodiversity is to sustaining progress \u2013 nature not only provides our life support; it underpins livelihoods of millions of people and economic activity. The richest, most urbanized sophisticate in the high-rises of Singapore, Shanghai or Bangkok depends on nature every bit as much as a poor farmer in India or tribal woman in the highlands of Papua New Guinea. The water we all drink, the air we breathe and the food we eat can all only come from the web of life around us. The only difference is that increasing sophistication may lead us to overlook this crucial connection.

What is gained is too easily measured, but what is lost is overlooked. Re-establishing this connection has been the central purpose underpin- ning UNDP\u2019s environmental work over the last 40 years. All our various approaches and strategies point to this same goal: rebuilding the link between people and their environment. Better development planning systems and policies that guide what governments do; or valuation and financing work to influence how money is spent; or livelihoods, awareness and community engagement initiatives to reinforce the direct connection between people and their ecological home. As demonstrated in these pages, UNDP supports the governments, economies and societies of this region to use their skills, resources and technical knowledge to protect their natural wealth. Different ap- proaches with the same underlying goal: reflecting the real value of ecosystems and biodiversity to humanity and shifting to sustainable models of development that sustain the region\u2019s life support system. Protecting ecological infrastructure is fundamental to support liveli- hoods and to meet country development priorities, including food and water security and resilience against shocks. We must remember our unavoidable dependence on the ecosystems around us. Only by restoring this connection will the people of this region protect their ecosystems. And it\u2019s only by protecting their ecosystems that the peo- ple of the Asia-Pacific will be able to thrive and prosper in the future.

Protected areas need to earn money to support their existence and they must be recognized for their monetary value. But making money can never be the purpose of their existence. If it is all about cash, the whole point of a national park\u2019s existence would decay and become meaningless. The value of the park lies in the biodiversity and ecosystem services it provides to support human development. Underfunding of protected area systems is a universal phenomenon. In Mongolia, for example, the government invests US$ 2.9 million to develop and manage a vast 27 million hectares of national protected areas.

Undervaluation of protected areas is thus one of the main causes for under-investment by governments worldwide. Policy mak- ers are failing to understand that protected areas make vital economic contributions, as national tourism assets, as the providers of watershed services, by maintaining water resources and regulating water flows, and by providing people with basic food and materials. The value of these invisible and largely unnoticed services is phenom- enal. A 2010 Conservation International (CI) study estimated that the value of the natural systems of Qinghai Province, China, is between US$ 385 billion and US$ 9 trillion each century. The province, in particular the vast 15 million hectare Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve is one of the source areas for the Yellow, Yangtze and Mekong rivers, underpinning water provision for drinking, irrigation and industry supporting over a billion people. Yet, the field operation budget for the park is less than US$ 100,000 per annum with just a handful of staff. THE PRICE OF PARKS - FINANCING PROTECTED AREAS Another underlying problem for insufficient financing of protected areas is the fact that park managers or agencies don't know exactly what is required to manage parks to meet conservation and manage- ment objectives. This means there is no clear basis for motivating for increased funding. No request, no results. And definitely no funding. \u201cParks staff are typically not business-minded people,\u201d says Oyuntulkhu- ur Bandi, the project manager for the GEF financed \u2018Strengthening the Protected Area Network\u2019 project in Mongolia. \u201cThey are more focused on conservation work on the ground, but now they also need the skills for ensuring adequate finance for their work. They need to become savvy in showing what parks can do for the society and economy and what they need for the upkeep of the parks.\u201d CONSERVATION IS A SERIOUS BUSINESS AND PAS NEED TO MEAN BUSINESS! In order to develop capacity for management oriented budgeting, a range of GEF financed projects are supporting development of park business plans. Detailed business plans aim to cost actual biodiversity and the management actions required to manage it, and to clarify how much human and financial resource is needed to achieve the park\u2019s intended outcomes. It also looks at the revenue generation potential of protected areas to gauge how the necessary costs can be met for basic and optimal management scenarios. \u201cThe spreadsheet we used was fantastic. All protected area informa- tion, such as functions and programme areas, work responsibilities, staff information and financial data, were integrated,\u201d explains Gou Xiaocheng, a manager at the Taohe National Nature Reserve. \u201cIt is designed to guide staff in costing different essential management activities. For example, how much will it cost to conduct an adequate level of law enforcement patrol? How many days of rangers\u2019 time, how much for petrol, vehicle maintenance and over time allowances? And so on. The spreadsheet specifies the required staff, operational resources and one-off investment costs needed to complete work programmes at the current, basic and optimal scenarios. It identifies funding gaps and revenue opportunities, and finally discusses the economic benefits of the protected area.\u201d There are many different ways for filling financing gaps. The Financing Plan for the Mongolia\u2019s Protected Area system lists the following as having high potential for the country to achieve financial sustainability: better capturing of revenue and revenue retention, introduction of land use fees, introduction of tourism and other concession systems, and mining biodiversity off-sets. The Protected Area Administration Department is currently looking into different options. Various new financing mechanisms for protected areas have been successfully established through GEF financed projects around Asia. The \u2018Upper Mustang Biodiversity Conservation Project\u2019 in Nepal, which ended in 2007, has succeeded in establishing an agreement with the Government to plough back 60 percent of Upper Mustang tourism entry fees into the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation for use on conservation-linked community development activities over the long-term.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "90558506-768e-4242-8086-e008a29ce726": {"__data__": {"id_": "90558506-768e-4242-8086-e008a29ce726", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Biodiversity for Sustainable Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "365ed1f0feec97fe2bd12ac7ab4695f7c1b1947e3d8882dd81db190cc2dbbf34"}, "2": {"node_id": "d1cd0125-32a9-4c5e-954a-458147e2e498", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a3b9c857f1851e82668b171f09a0bf7cf79f1d00539566309de2f408b9039cf1"}}, "hash": "2c80296da4db7530af2dfff2708b55dfcf07b7b926b73245cc4899955288a941", "text": "With support of the GEF-financed \u2018Biodiversity Management in the Coastal Area of China\u2019s South Sea\u2019 project, which was completed in 2012, sustainable financing mechanisms have been developed to sup- port the operational recurrent costs of the Sanya National Coral Reef Nature Reserve in Hainan Province, China.

Protected areas make vital economic contributions as national tourism assets. Photo: Ethan Daniels/Shutterstock.com In Thailand, the country\u2019s growing population and rapid economic development is putting increasing pressure on biodiversity both inside and outside protected areas. To promote biodiversity-responsible business, UNDP is working with the Biodiversity-based Economy Development Office (BEDO), a public organization under the Govern- ment of Thailand mandated to promote biodiversity conservation in production landscapes, improve local community knowledge of best practices for sustainable production, and enhance biodiversity-based economic development. The UNDP supported GEF financed \u2018BEDO\u2019 project began in 2013 and aims to help BEDO to integrate biodiversity conservation into produc- tion and marketing of agricultural, forestry and fishery business, in order to create community incentives to conserve and enhance biodiversity while generating income. This is achieved by supporting the develop- ment of biodiversity-friendly businesses, piloting community-based social enterprises, and mainstreaming biodiversity business into the supply chains of high value consumer markets. Though only in its early stages of implementation, the project has already set up a \u201cBioEconomy Academy\u201d (BEA), an initiative for developing and supporting biodiversity business in Thailand, working with BEDO and law firm Rouse. The Academy provides training and organises workshops for local communities throughout Thailand to promote the use of intellectual property and legal tools to help protect the country\u2019s biodiversity and traditional knowledge. \u201cWe are delighted to be working through this project to launch the GROWING A SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE BIODIVERSITY -BASED ECONOMY IN THAILAND BioEconomy Academy, which resonates strongly with BEDO\u2019s vision for a thriving and sustainable bio-economy underpinned by empowered local communities,\u201d says Wutthipong Sommanas, acting Executive Director of BEDO. Housed within the Academy is a permanent exhibition of Thai in- digenous products and traditional knowledge and a biodiversity law library. It is hoped that these and the project\u2019s wider training work will help raise awareness of the value of biodiversity and how community enterprises may protect it. Fabrice Mattei, executive and Thailand country manager at law firm Rouse, who are partnering with the project on the Academy, adds: \u201cThrough the BioEconomy Academy, we plan to empower Thai busi- nesses and local communities by helping them to understand and ex- ercise their Intellectual Property rights.\u201d The project is also establishing a Bio-economy Forum to enable policy dialogues and raise awareness among the general public. The project, working through BEDO and other partners, has also de- signed and developed a \u201cBio-responsible product label\u201d to strengthen community-based social enterprises. This certification label will be awarded to products that meet the certification\u2019s standards according to how eco-friendly they are, whether they use local ingredients and other criteria. The project has consulted with local communities at four pilot sites \u2013 Ranong, Phang Nga, Kanjanaburi and Prachinburi \u2013 on biodiversity-friendly product development for community based social enterprises and plans to launch pilot products in 2014. 89 Biodiversity for Sustainable Development The BEDO project has consulted with local communities on biodiversity-friendly product development for community based social enterprises.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "421d44fc-f0a9-43fe-9152-2072871a4e9d": {"__data__": {"id_": "421d44fc-f0a9-43fe-9152-2072871a4e9d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Biodiversity for Sustainable Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5441634f0a3a6ad2769f6be40b34b18ce56aa4de1789577b371fa35acb920ea8"}, "2": {"node_id": "9f9054a6-5c5e-4c99-83ca-d47a4bd5ee6a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "87618f62da2c7b038b8d3ca06ef35359dafc0db01213130010c7f650ce1c5472"}}, "hash": "ad412a267d82c0c21a09b6cafb65db9a42d13d904b3b429358b8dfb9fdace89c", "text": "Some of the potential products identified for development under a \u201cbio-responsible product label\u201d include shrimp paste, eco-tourism and charcoal.

UNDP support entails not simply updating NBSAP documents\u2026 A \u201cNew Generation of NBSAP\u201d is the slogan of the UNDP support. The aim is to ensure that NBSAPs integrate the value of biodiversity into national and local development and poverty reduction strategies; provide a concrete plan for mainstreaming biodiversity into development and sector planning; develop a plan for creating incentives and removing harmful subsidies; establish a clear plan for mobilis- ing the necessary financial resources for effective implementation; and incorporate challenges and opportunities linked to ecosystem-based adaptation and resilience. To support countries around the world working on the NBSAPs, share knowledge and experiences and provide peer review services, an NBSAP Forum has been established (http://nbsapforum.net) in close collaboration with the UNEP and the CBD Secretariat. Linked to the NBSAP programme, the European Union, Switzerland and Germany have funded a Global Biodiversity Financing project, known as BIOFIN, including Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines as several of the initial 12 pilot countries. The global biodiversity financing workbook was developed under this project as the tool for the participating countries to assess policy and practice drivers of biodiversity and ecosystem change; assess current investment in biodiversity and the costs of implementing NBSAPs; and to develop a resource mobilisation plan. The BIOFIN project focuses on direct engagement with Ministries of Finance and national development planning agencies. By bringing these critical actors to discus- sions on biodiversity management and financing, the project assists countries in transforming national biodiversity finance, enabling them to implement their NBSAP and achieve the Aichi Targets. \u201cNBSAPs are more than a set of plans,\u201d says Jamison Ervin, the UNDP senior adviser for the NBSAPs project. \u201cThey are pathways to national and global sustainable devel- opment.

Home to about 5 percent of the world\u2019s coral reefs, which equates to 250 species of coral teeming with over 1000 species of fish, the Maldives is rich in biodiversity. This biodiversity forms the bedrock of the Maldivian economy. An economic valuation study, commissioned by the UNDP supported GEF financed Atoll Ecosystem Conservation (AEC) project, has recently determined that the biodiversity of atoll ecosystems underpins at least 71 percent of national employment, 89 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 98 percent of ex- ports in the Maldives.

In Asia-Pacific, PEI has programmes under way in five countries and provides technical support to four oth- ers. The programme has supported Ministries of Planning and Local Government to integrate poverty, environment and climate issues into their planning processes and to work more closely with Ministries of Environment. In Lao Peoples\u2019 Democratic Republic (PDR), PEI works with the government to improve the management and quality of invest- ments, so that they take account of environmental and social considerations. The economy is driven by high inflows of foreign direct investment mainly into natural resource sectors. Natural resource-based growth is putting pressures on traditional livelihoods and valuable natural assets, including the country\u2019s forests and POVERTY ENVIRONMENT INITIATIVE: GREENING INVESTMENTS IN LAO PDR UN-REDD PROGRAMME: CALCULATING THE REAL ECONOMIC VALUE OF FORESTS IN MONGOLIA Few people deny the value of housing, roads, energy, water treatment plants and other built infrastructure to national economies and human wellbeing. But the goods and services that nature\u2019s infrastructure provides are often less well understood and markets generally fail to account for their real value, or the real costs of losing them. A study conducted by UNDP through the UN-REDD Programme for the Government of Mongolia highlights the hidden value of Mongolia\u2019s forests to the country\u2019s economy. This work \u2013 funded by the UN-REDD programme, which is a United Nations (UN) collaborative programme jointly implemented by UNDP, FAO and UNEP \u2013 formed part of Targeted Support requested by the Government of Mongolia to assist the country to prepare for the implementation of REDD+ activities, including reducing deforestation and degradation, restoring, conserving and sustainably managing forests. The study found that forests are worth around US$ 310 mil- lion (MNT 431 billion) a year to Mongolia\u2019s economy and people. Unfortunately, as is the case in many other countries, most of these important values remain \u201cinvisible\u201d in official development statistics because the monetary worth of the environment still tends to be calculated just in terms of the raw materials and physical products that it yields. The value revealed through the study is many times that recorded in official GDP figures. The recorded GDP share of the forest sector is currently recorded at less than 0.5 percent; at about USD 40 million or MNT 70 billion. By explicitly considering the multiple services provided by forests \u2013 in terms of timber and fuelwood, wild plants and animals, pasture, tourism, watershed protection and climate change mitigation \u2013 the study helps to paint a more complete picture of the real value of Mongolia\u2019s forest sector. For example, just the net value-added to rural households from fuelwood use, wild foods and other non-timber forest products and forest grazing is equivalent to more than 12.5 percent of recorded per capita GDP.

PEI works with the government to develop and implement tools, mechanisms and strategies designed to increase the proportion of quality investments in the country, those that minimize impact on the environment and maximize local benefit. The overall goal of this work is to help achieve more inclusive and sustainable green growth. For example, a cost benefit analysis conducted by PEI of four different land use practices examined the social and environmental implications of on-going rapid changes in land use from traditional practices to com- mercial agriculture. The results of the study will support development of guidance on Environmental Impact Assessment for the Agriculture and Forestry Sector to conduct environmental and social impact as- sessments required under national legislation. In collaboration with the government, PEI is also developing a number of tools and standards, including model contracts for concessions and environmental and social obligations for commercial agriculture and forestry, which should support better ecosystem and biodiversity management and social protection once implemented. 95 Biodiversity for Sustainable Development Photo: Poverty Environment Initiative Lao PDR / UNDP Lao PDR Photo: Seng Kit/Shutterstock.com 96 WORK & MONEY The natural world harbours vast potential biological wealth for discovery and human development. A myriad of industries \u2013 pharmaceutical, biotechnology, seed, crop protection, horticulture, cosmetics, fragrance and flavour, botanicals and food and beverage sectors \u2013 use genetic resources from plants, animals and micro- organisms for research and development of commercial products that generate substantial benefits. In 2006, the biotechnology industry had a market value of US$ 70 billion. But the custodians or providers of genetic resources \u2013 the countries, local communities\u2019 and indigenous peoples\u2019 territories that house most of the world\u2019s biodiversity \u2013 are often not business oriented. They have often not been compensated for providing or safeguarding these resources. In 2010, Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity agreed to the \u2018Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-Sharing\u2019, making the access and benefit sharing from the use of genetic resources a matter of inter- national law. This landmark international treaty aims to achieve fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources, so that both the providers and users benefit from royalties, research results and other gains from their commercialisation. The agreement also aims to provide that a portion of the benefits will be invested in conservation, to preserve the resources and others yet undiscovered. The UNDP supported GEF financed \u2018Access and Benefit Sharing\u2019 (ABS) projects assist countries to implement the Nagoya Protocol by building the capacities needed to access, derive and equitably share benefits from the nature-based products that they house. By estab- lishing standardised conditions for access to genetic resources and helping to ensure benefit sharing with the country of their origin, this work aims to create greater legal certainty and transparency for both providers and users of genetic resources. UNDP is currently supporting Malaysia and Fiji to implement projects in this field. In Malaysia, UNDP work began in 2010 with a project funded through UNDP \u2018Target Resource Assignment from the Core\u2019 (so-called TRAC funds) and the Government of Malaysia, supporting the development of a draft ABS bill. With GEF finance, a full national regulatory and institutional framework on ABS is being developed, including a national law and spurring regulations and financial mecha- nism to reinvest funds from ABS agreements back into biodiversity conservation. The project also includes building national institutional and stakeholder capacity for implementation of ABS through training programmes, creation of an information gateway for knowledge sharing on ABS, and awareness raising with researchers, industry, indigenous and local communities. In addition to fulfilling the provisions of the Nagoya protocol, Malaysia is using this project to advance pilot projects on bio-prospecting with fair and equitable benefit sharing provisions, Prior Informed Consent processes (PIC) with indigenous and local communities implemented in accordance with community protocols, and the dissemination of best practices on ABS agreements and PIC processes at regional level. \u201cThis project is", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5aca522-4b80-4dbd-b5a1-02f6aa6d5a63": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5aca522-4b80-4dbd-b5a1-02f6aa6d5a63", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Biodiversity for Sustainable Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3c6e4c52967a3e7334ef707df946d5a26efa8a66a132da59e2ca06aa66ce2096"}, "3": {"node_id": "14c98eb9-c5e1-48d8-89e3-7697539359fa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "04fdecd7be1c24992cd702fb66ba664c5e5cd5548cba34f42cde9d754197f1df"}}, "hash": "dcdc21924ef13ec84ffd8e6753c3fc21ab3ea980bc8e94b7a5c83ee249813647", "text": "timely as the government promotes \u2018bio-economy\u2019 under the New Economic Model (NEM), 2010.

The project aims to make ABS operational by linking bio-prospecting with marine conservation actions in conjunction with local communities. The project aims to strengthen incentives for conservation at both com- munity and government levels. The project will assist the government to develop and clarify relevant roles, procedures and administrative systems for ABS agreement negotiations between the government, communities and relevant institutions, including roles and responsibili- ties of the government institutions at the sub-national level. The project will strengthen overall national capacities on: negotiations; instituting engagement processes; advertising bio-prospecting initiatives; satisfy- ing the customary requirements for development; and, monitoring of benefit-sharing and bio-prospecting projects. UNDP supported ABS projects are also being initiated in Bhutan and the Cook Islands with finance from the Nagoya Protocol Implementation Fund, and in China and Viet Nam with GEF finance. Ultimately, these investments in implementing the Nagoya Protocol on ABS nationally should mean both providers and users of genetic resources are able to fairly and equitably share in nature\u2019s bounty.

Many of the 1.2 billion people living in severe poverty, on less than US$ 1 a day, depend directly on nature for food, clean water, fuel, medicine, shelter, and reduced vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters. Dependent on ecosystem goods and services for their livelihoods and subsistence, the poor stand to suffer the most from ecosystem degradation. UNDP supports countries to stimulate job creation and safeguard biodiversity by promoting nature-based tourism initiatives, sustainable harvesting livelihoods and \u2018biodiversity-friendly\u2019 business that generate income for local communities.

A UNDP supported initiative \u201cSustainable Livelihoods Support to the Core Areas of the Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve\u201d has worked with local people to help reduce their impact on this complex ecosystem. The programme aimed to help residents develop new, more sustainable alternative incomes and introduced affordable technologies to help them use natural resources more efficiently. Working through UN Volunteers (known as UNVs), the programme helped residents to establish self-help groups. The Self Help groups started with a handful of families who were given access to savings and loan schemes that enabled them to adopt alternative sustainable livelihoods, such as household fish farming, livestock rearing, and making handicrafts from weeds growing naturally in the lake. More than 500 families became involved in 25 self-help groups, each supported by a UNV. This support enabled members to avoid expensive commercial moneylenders and manage the loans themselves, greatly reducing costs, and resulting in substantial profits or savings and reinvestment back into the group funds. Some of the groups increased their initial investment funds four-fold and at least 15 have become totally self-sustaining. Total group savings increased to over Rial 400 million (US$ 50,000+) and almost half of all group members increased their incomes by US$ 40 to US$ 150 per month. The majority of members were women, who are often the keepers of the family finances. The project developed the leadership capacities of the members and established a platform for other donors to replicate the success in other areas of the Tonle Sap. The self help groups also provided useful starting points for spreading awareness of eco-friendly practices. Fishing and fish farming have been the mainstays of life on Tonle Sap for centuries, but local shops had been selling unsuitable chemicals to treat fish diseases. Not only did the toxins remain in the lake after use, harming biodiversity, but they were also harmful to human health. People from the self help groups were informed of the dangers and also given classes to enhance their existing fishing knowledge. The project team and Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports also succeeded in introducing the first environmental education curriculum, training programme and eco-clubs in Cambodia\u2019s schools. Through these initiatives, 255 teachers have been trained and curriculums developed to increase environmental awareness. Villagers were trained in efficient techniques for mushroom farming, and 36 families set up floating vegetable gardens. Both initiatives, using technical advice from the UNVs and local agricultural schools, aimed to reduce the impact of overfishing on the local environment. Cookstoves distributed via the self-help groups used up to 40 percent less wood than the traditional variety, last longer and are safer. Ecotourism was also piloted in village of Peak Kantel, in conjunction with Osmose, a local NGO. Local families were trained in hospitality skills and given equipment to set up. Around 100 paying visitors so far to the ecotourism site have boosted the village\u2019s income.

These projects identified an opportunity to in- centivise local people to conserve the markhor by developing a carefully designed, monitored and controlled sustainable trophy hunting pro- gramme. Working in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan regions, the project helped communities to step up control of illegal hunt- ing, conduct surveys to monitor markhor popu- lations, and implement a quota system whereby only a handful of permits to hunt individual animals were sold or auctioned each year for a huge premium. Each permit fetched up to a huge US$ 56,000 per individual animal. By auctioning a limited number of permits on the lucrative tourist market, the scheme made the markhor worth much more to the commu- nities as a species conserved for this purpose than they could make through hunting, even many, animals for food. In return, the com- munities agreed to cease hunting of animals themselves and instead became \u201ccustodians\u201d of the species, reducing overall pressure on the population. The income and community benefits derived from sale of the permits provided a direct incentive for communities to protect local markhor populations and their natural habitats. The project developed stringent trophy hunting procedures and established a transparent and equitable process for sharing quota allocations of trophy permits and revenue generated by their sale among valley communities. Only older male markhor were selected for trophy hunting to protect the breeding population of younger animals and females, allowing population growth. 80 percent of the profits from the sale of the permits were allocated to communities and 20 percent to local govern- ment. Community profits were ploughed into community development, such as building water channels, building and repairing schools and community centres, and community support services. A proportion of the community share was invested into the Valley Conservation Funds established by the project, to be used for habitat conservation. To coordinate conservation work, the project mobilized communities to form Valley Conser- vation Committees (VCCs), with representation from the clans living in a given valley. With project support, they developed Valley and Conservancy Management Plans, pasture and forest management, species recovery and grazing regulations. Collectively these activi- ties improved relations between communities and government agencies, and raised aware- ness of the value of natural resources and the benefits of managing them sustainably. As a result, communities decided to rest high country pastures, reduce livestock numbers and conserve the habitat of wild species. Due to its success, the VCC and conservancy approach was also adopted in other valleys outside the project\u2019s target sites. The projects strengthened community capacity for conserva- tion and successfully demonstrated that local livelihoods and incomes could be improved through the sustainable use and conservation of wild species. Pakistan will now build on the achievements of this work, with the \u201cMountain and Market Biodiversity Business\u201d project. As markhor were not evenly distributed among all conservancies, this project specifically focuses on develop- ing community-based biodiversity businesses based on sustainable use of wild species that are widely available across all conservancies to ensure that all communities are able to benefit from sustainable use and conservation. The pro- ject will support local communities to develop and sell natural products from wild non-timber products found in the forest, such as cumin seed, honey, medicinal herbs and mushrooms. Currently, there is little incentive to conserve these heritage species. The project will support local communities to obtain voluntary certification of their products based on their adoption of sustainable harvest- ing regimes and contribution to conservation. The premium they earn from selling these certified \u2018biodiversity-friendly\u2019 natural products is expected to create new incentives for con- servation. The project will especially benefit poorer and more marginal groups, including nomadic pastoralists, women and children, who are the main collectors of these wild non-timber forest species. The project aims to stimulate market demand for certified natural products, so that other communities across the conservancies can benefit from community biodiversity enterprise development through the sustainable harvesting of these wild non-timber forest products. 103 Biodiversity for Sustainable Development Markhor (Capra falconeri) Photo: Nataly Karol/Shutterstock.com 104 WORK & MONEY Here among the soaring Himalayan peaks and plunging valleys of northern India\u2019s Kullu district the figures speak for themselves: 65 newly established women\u2019s groups, 1,200 members, a communal bank balance of US$ 15,600.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2f4d1ebe-9a21-4afa-9fd0-17ffd5c7fecd": {"__data__": {"id_": "2f4d1ebe-9a21-4afa-9fd0-17ffd5c7fecd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Biodiversity for Sustainable Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "105275e4996113eba1b1ff030cae6a565093541355dacf300444e277727971b4"}, "2": {"node_id": "82cae8ff-81da-492a-a6fb-858e72bf1815", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "13768a277effd530f673a4bdf59a5bcde772ce302047ac30ba2c8d1c7602aa2e"}}, "hash": "a0a313fcca890d8d3bf3ddd138d1152b63143773c15ac31f87ad1581b4797e54", "text": "All of this has been fuelled by a grant from the UNDP implemented GEF-Small Grants Programme (SGP), a community-based organisation named Jagriti, and wild apricots.

One tree significantly threatened by clearance was the wild apricot. This species, whose fruits yield valuable oils, became a keystone of Jag- riti\u2019s conservation and financial empowerment strategy. With financial and logistical support from UNDP and GEF SGP, Jagriti trained women, mostly from marginalised \u2018Scheduled Castes\u2019, in techniques designed to maximise profits from wild apricots. They learned about collecting and grading seeds, drying them, using oil expellers, and packaging and selling their products \u2013 par- ticularly aromatic oils, which are increasingly popular in overseas markets. They also planted wild apricots and walnuts, and were introduced to accounting practices, record keeping, group management skills, and issues regarding deforestation, biodiversity conservation and sustainable forest management. Equipment was procured including a machine to de-shell apricot kernels, which raised the efficiency to 50 kilogrammes per person per day from just three kilogrammes prior to the ma- chine\u2019s installation. It also reduced the drudgery involved in the shelling process. By 2008, nearly 20,000 kilogrammes of kernels yielding 400 litres of oil were being collected in a season yielding an income of US$ 8,600. By 2010 yield was up, to 1,200 litres and US$ 17,500. The price of one litre of oil, originally US$ 2 has now risen to US$ 12. Besides the oils, women started marketing four species of aramanth, apple chips, beeswax, rosehip tea and other nature-based products. Local products are now sold under the umbrella name of \u2018Mountain Bounties\u2019 and with the co- operation of an organic herbal supply company, Herbal Partners, are being certified organic and ethical thereby increasing their value.

The Hamouns comprise three large wetland areas covering 5,660 square kilometres. Two thirds of these wetlands are located in Iran, linked and fed by water from Afghanistan\u2019s Helmand River. Twenty years ago, most of this area was green. Flora and fauna were abundant. The lake teemed with fish. The total annual catch used to exceed 12,000 tons and fisherfolk would regularly haul in large catches weighing 20 kilogrammes. The wetlands also supported agriculture and herds of grazing water buffalo, providing a livelihood for thousands of families. But water levels in the lakes have plummeted with the development of dams and canals in Afghanistan, which are drawing off water to feed agriculture, and the construction of reservoirs in Iran. What is striking is the pace of the man-made catastrophe that has resulted. In just 20 years, livelihoods have been devastated. Homes are now buried under sands blowing from the dried out lagoon beds of the Hamouns. The environmental crisis has forced thousands to leave the region. The government indicates that in 2012 alone, as many as 5,000 families left the area. In total, 600,000 people have moved out. Most have trekked 2,000 kilometres northwards to Golestan province to start new lives, others are scattered across Iran. The ones who remain simply get poorer, year after year. The slow death of the Hamouns signals a warning for the future. In this century \u2013 a century that will make or break our environment \u2013 we are beset by challenges to human security. As the exhaustion of the Hamouns demonstrates, water security, ecosystem security and human security are inextricably linked. First popularized by UNDP in 1994, the concept of \u201chuman security\u201d shifts the traditional notion of \u201cnational security\u201d away from its exclusive focus on the state. It seeks to ensure the security of people; not just borders. It speaks to the hugely destabilizing impact of the relentless challenges facing the poorest and most vulnerable, from hunger, food and water insecurity, disease, pollution, natural disasters and the impact of climate change to water shortages and expanding desertification. These threats can prompt massive movements of populations, potentially millions of en- vironmental refugees, fleeing these afflictions. Such movements can, in turn, prompt desperation, lawlessness, crime and conflict. So when people ask me about the real human security challenges we face, I lose no time in focusing my gaze on the future. True \u201csecurity\u201d \u2013 human security \u2013 must focus on people. In addition to political and economic considerations, it must focus on food, health, community, on the person and on the environment. Nature generates the services that are the foundation of life on earth. Ecosystems and biodiversity \u2013 the variety of life on earth \u2013 provide the goods and services that we all rely on. They secure livelihoods, food, water and health for billions worldwide and provide a safety net for the poorest and most vulnerable. They also mitigate climate change and provide a source of resilience \u2013 a range of ecosystems from forests to wetlands act as buffers against natural hazards and shocks, absorb and store carbon and guard against land degradation. Water is our biggest resource constraint in Iran. As water resources come under increasing threat, so does agriculture. Water over-use, over-grazing, deforestation and desertification coupled with climate change, are driving rapid land degradation, compounding this threat and making land less productive. In summary, we are at risk from a \u201cperfect storm\u201d \u2013 the combined impacts of water scarcity, land degradation, and climate change. These pressures are being felt all across Iran.The country has 1,000 wetlands, many of which are at risk. To combat this, current water and natural resource management approaches need to be enhanced and climate change resilience strengthened at the community and national levels. There are several examples of what can be done \u2013 and replicated. Since 2005, the \u201cIranian Wetlands Project\u201d \u2013 a GEF-financed joint initiative of the Iranian Government and UNDP \u2013 has been working in satellite wetlands surrounding Lake Uromiyeh and others to bring them back to life.

Once one of the world\u2019s largest saline lakes, water extraction and persistent drought have shrunk it by two thirds since 1997. Part of the problem has been diverging interests around the lake have pulled in different directions. The UNDP Iranian Wetlands project has helped to provide a platform for negotiations concerning the lake\u2019s future. It has developed management plans and improved the institutional arrangements for cooperation to ad- dress the problem. Crucially, public awareness of the threat has also increased as a result. Hope can be drawn from initiatives such as the UNDP wetlands project and others \u2013 where communities are working to revive their wetlands and implement sustainable management regimes. Most of the solu- tions we seek lie within Iran. But the problem does not only affect Iran. As we collectively respond to current global challenges, it is clear that we must seek to conserve, manage and restore ecosystems and biodiversity as the key to human security. If we fail, we face the same plight as the Hamouns. 109 Biodiversity for Sustainable Development Boats on the sand of the empty Hamouns Photos: Gary Lewis This was the fisherman.

UNDP supports countries in Asia Pacific to implement EbA approaches that can help vulnerable com- munities increase their capacity to adapt to the impacts of climate change, and build the resilience of the ecosystems on which their livelihoods and welfare depend. \u2022 IN MONGOLIA, a UNDP supported project financed by the Adaptation Fund, the Government of Mongolia and UNDP, is sup- porting EbA approaches to maintain water security in the Altai Mountains and Eastern Steppe landscapes. Working with multiple partners, the project uses traditional knowledge and technological innovation to maintain water provisioning services supplied by mountain and steppe ecosystems. Over its lifetime the project Conservation and rehabilitation of natural ecosystems that function as ef- fective carbon sinks contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. UNDP supports countries in developing capacity and accessing new sources of finance to maintain and restore these ecosystems, which include forests, peat- lands, wetlands, tidal marshes, mangroves and seagrass beds. Communities are directly sup- ported in securing land tenure and accessing new sources of finance to manage ecosystems effectively and sustainably, using both tradi- tional knowledge and innovative techniques. UNDP supports projects in a range of coun- tries in the Asia Pacific region to promote sustainable forest management measures. Destruction and degradation of peatlands can lead to the release of greenhouse gases, with a global warming potential that is equivalent to 13-30 percent of the global emissions from fossil fuel combustion. UNDP supported GEF financed projects support countries to reduce carbon emissions from peatlands and increase the resilience of economies and communities. aims to achieve quantifiable improvements in water quality, water use efficiency and land use practices through improved management and restoration of key ecosystems to improve resilience. \u2022 IN NEPAL, a project supported collabora- tively by IUCN, UNEP and UNDP and financed by the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Na- ture Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) of Germany, is supporting EbA in mountain ecosystems. The project will demonstrate EbA measures that sustain key ecosystem services and enhance the capacity of local communi- ties and national government to build and better integrate EbA options as part of overall adaptation strategies in Nepal. The project will include an assessment of the cost-efficiency of EbA by considering economic, social and environmental aspects, in order to make the business case for EbA. UNDP works with countries to strengthen their resilience to respond to climate and other en- vironmental impacts through effective conser- vation and management of natural resources. Ecosystem rehabilitation and expanding and connecting protected areas to conserve intact forests, wetlands, mangroves and coral reefs provides a natural buffer for vulnerable com- munities against natural disasters intensified by climate change.

The project will work to expand the area of peatswamp forest under protection, develop and establish integrated management plans for this forest, restore areas degraded by storms and fires and implement systems for prevent- ing encroachment and monitoring carbon flux. In addition, the project will seek to strengthen national policies and frameworks for managing peatswamp forests. Climate change represents a serious risk to efforts to reduce poverty and threatens decades of development gains. Receding forests, changing rainfall patterns, more intense floods and droughts, and rising sea levels exacerbate existing economic, political and humanitarian stresses and affect human develop- ment in all parts of the world. Asia-Pacific not only has many of the world\u2019s most climate-exposed territories, it is also home to millions of the most vulnerable people. The negative impacts of climate change pose a particular challenge to poor people, who are often dependent on natural resources and are less equipped to cope with climate variability and extremes. In response to these growing and increasingly evident threats, governments across the region are paying more attention to climate change. Significantly, there is a growing appreciation of the importance of natural ecosystems and protected areas in managing climate change. Restoring and maintaining key eco- systems can help communities in their mitigation and adaptation efforts and support livelihoods that depend on ecosystem ser- vices. UNDP supports countries and communities to incorporate nature-based solutions into their strategies for adapting to and mitigating the negative impacts of climate change. Projects in the region are working to support national efforts to address climate change, in this rapidly developing work area, building knowledge and experience on different approaches.

By working to improve water use efficiency, water quality, land use practices and integrated river basin management, the project aims to achieve specific quantified targets for improvements to ecosystem health. It supports evidence-based decision-making through improved knowledge and understanding of ecosystem dynamics, resilience and the impacts of different land uses. The project also assists community actions to implement EbA principles and practices for the long-term sustenance of their livelihoods. At the national level, the project supports mainstreaming of the EbA approach in the country\u2019s adaptation framework and related sector policies. To date the project has supported the development or revi- sion of three new water regulations and three new forest regulations to incorporate EbA principles. The new or reformulated regulations aim to promote sustainable use of water and conservation of forests, which help to store water, by providing incentives for efficient water use and protection, restoration and sustainable use of forests. It is also strengthening the capacity of key climate change policy and planning agencies to incorporate EbA approaches. The project makes great steps forward for safeguarding the world\u2019s largest Steppe ecosystem and its keepers. Although 60 percent of Mongolia\u2019s population now lives in towns, nearly 40 percent of people are reliant on subsist- ence livestock herding. The livelihoods of these nomadic communities are completely dependent on the ability of the ecosystem to provide surface water and pasture. In recent years, herders have noticed a marked change in rainfall patterns and an increase in temperatures. The hydrological system has also changed, altering the volume and timing of river flows and floods. Streams and lakes have dried up.

This map is one of a set developed by the UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP WCMC) for the UN-REDD Programme, as a decision-support tool for REDD+ planning that delivers multiple benefits. The maps were developed by UNEP WCMC in collaboration with the Ministry of Forestry of Indonesia, DG Forest Planning, the Regional Forest Service Central Sulawesi and Tadulako University. INTEGRATING BIODIVERSITY INTO REDD+ Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degra- dation (known as REDD+) is a dedicated effort to value the carbon stored in standing forests as a way to incentivize developing countries to protect, manage and restore forests to mitigate climate change. The United Nations REDD (UN-REDD) Programme is a collaborative initiative between FAO, UNDP and UNEP that supports countries to prepare to implement REDD+ activities, including reducing deforesta- tion and degradation, restoring, conserving and sustainably managing forests under the UNFCCC climate change convention. To date, a total of 15 countries have sought support from the UN-REDD Programme in the Asia Pacific region. The UN-REDD Programme works with national governments to pre- pare for participation in a future REDD+ mechanism with the active involvement of all stakeholders, including indigenous peoples and other forest-dependent communities. The Programme supports countries to develop national REDD+ strategies that will guide the implementation of nationally appropriate REDD+ activities in the country. Financial flows resulting from REDD+ will not only reduce carbon emis- sions, but can also benefit developing countries by generating additional social and environmental benefits, such as conserving biodiversity and vital ecosystem services and promoting local livelihoods. The UN-REDD Programme has developed a set of Social and Environmental Principles and Criteria and a range of decision support tools that are intended to assist countries in developing a national safeguards approach that emphasizes delivery of multiple benefits from REDD+. This safeguards approach includes applying the principles of Free, Prior and Informed Consent in the context of REDD+ to protect local communities\u2019 rights and forest-dependent livelihoods and to reduce risks through ensuring mutual understanding and agreement between all parties concerned. Under the UN-REDD Programme, UNDP has led work in Viet Nam to develop national guidelines on Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) in the context of REDD+, as part of sup- port to prepare the country to implement REDD+ activities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "983d8785-eaf4-4ac0-bffe-5839b210d017": {"__data__": {"id_": "983d8785-eaf4-4ac0-bffe-5839b210d017", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Biodiversity for Sustainable Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1be391a7e66fc507c4558c7093ed3fe626af58aa8948c2e18a4ab32f9759d821"}, "2": {"node_id": "1ba518ab-d536-4071-80a3-6d874b5b8045", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "045cc66b2a0ad4f46a197c1d7ccd7fe56f5f9089f3602724eb5dd652b7649424"}}, "hash": "36b888542f5537563bfdaa7a872854df82630123b2b26476b043c11dd92e44e6", "text": "National Guidelines on applying the principles of FPIC for REDD+ have been developed through an extensive process of consultation and testing, including pilot exercises in Lam Dong province and evaluations of this work.

Papua New Guinea\u2019s working guidelines will be tested in REDD+ pilot sites and the lessons learned from these tests incorporated before they are presented to the government. In the UN-REDD National Programme\u2019s pilot province of Central Sulawesi in Indonesia, a set of maps has been developed to support decisions on where and how REDD+ could be put into practice. The maps were developed by UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) on behalf of the UN-REDD Programme, in collabora- tion with the Ministry of Forestry of Indonesia and a number of other partners. They have been designed to support the development of plans for REDD+ actions that provide multiple benefits for livelihoods and biodiversity in line with the needs of different stakeholder groups, in addition to storing carbon. The potential benefits of implementing REDD+ actions in a certain location are influenced by a range of factors, including the biophysical, geographic, socio-economic and cultural characteristics of an area, as well as future development plans. The set of maps includes different data layers that show current land uses, carbon stocks, potential areas for REDD+ activities, current state forest area, population density and the location of areas important for biodiversity. Additional variables, such as planned infrastructure development, can easily be added, if requested by decision makers. By overlaying this spatial information, the maps demonstrate how different data layers can inform planning and prioritization of areas suitable for REDD+ activities based on selected criteria. For exam- ple, data layers showing the location of endangered forest types, of Important Bird Areas, and the nesting grounds of the endemic maleo bird, a flagship species in the province, can be used to assess the importance of different areas for biodiversity conservation. Data layers on slope and watershed boundaries can help to assess the importance of various areas of forest for delivering ecosystem services, such as erosion control. Combining this information with stakeholder analysis and consultation can help planners to identify, for example, areas of forest to maintain that will not only store carbon but which are also of significant value for biodiversity and ecosystem services. 118 HEALTH & SECURITY COMMUNITY COOPERATION HELPS HERDERS TO COMBAT ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE \u201cWe now have more options and different income sources. And we are better prepared for harsh winters. The dzud impact in this community was minimal last year, which I believe is owing to our organisation.\u201d NARANBEK RISTAN, AKHBASTAU HERDER The Altai Mountains of Mongolia\u2019s extreme west are harsh, daunting, and offer spectacular views of snow-capped peaks beyond sweeping grasslands, milky rivers that derive their startling colour from glacial melt flow, and immense lakes. This is home to the Kazakh nomads of the Akhbastau (literally: \u2018White Springs\u2019) community. People here are herders and horsemen who hunt with golden eagles and who live in \u2018gers\u2019 (yurts) decorated with colour- ful wall and floor carpets. These mountains are also an important area for global conservation, harbouring a number of threatened species, including the snow leopard. Older generations of the Akhbastau community have witnessed clear environmental changes over the last 70 years. Wildlife numbers have declined as a result of overhunting and overfishing, and pastures have deteriorated. Overgrazing is one of the main causes of environmental degradation in the range, worsened further by the harsh effects of climate change on precious water and land resources. Many herd- ers have stopped traditional rotational grazing methods that involved moving seasonally in search of good pasture, leaving time for other pasturelands to recover. To remedy increasingly adverse living conditions, in 2006, the families in the Altai Mountain region started forming herder groups, working with the UNDP supported GEF financed \u2018Community-based Conservation of Biological Diversity in the Mountain Landscapes of Mongolia\u2019s Altai Sayan Eco-region\u2019 project, locally known as the \u2018Altai Sayan\u2019 project.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "93b241e5-7f91-4bd8-a50f-ed65d7415a7c": {"__data__": {"id_": "93b241e5-7f91-4bd8-a50f-ed65d7415a7c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Biodiversity for Sustainable Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ee6523199c41e7fc12ab0edd25863379b9ddab42591f99a0185a3e8a78163c6a"}, "2": {"node_id": "d367447d-95e1-471f-baed-ef5732cd9990", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9276f9b7face206a4aa47b42cc967cd7f47cf9012f053b54e0fad3c32e54d34d"}}, "hash": "5548efdce872d17169f90bdf9c2cf56e4a718208dc075c0a3617cafbe9ffc727", "text": "The project, executed by the Government of Mongolia from 2005 to 2011, provided small loans and grants to community groups in the region to help develop tourism, grow vegetables for the first time, repair winter shelters and improve the quality of their milk and wool products.

As well as the devastation it caused to human life, the 8.0-Richter scale-earthquake also caused an ecologi- cal catastrophe. Sichuan province is one of the most important areas for biodiversity in China, harbouring more than 100 threatened species, including the Endangered giant panda. The earthquake damaged 35 Nature Reserves covering 400,000 hectares, and an estimated 60 percent of the panda\u2019s natural habitat. To support recovery and rehabilitation efforts following the earthquake, the Government of China, with UNDP support and GEF finance, began emergency biodiversity conservation measures in affected regions of Sichuan province. Working through the Foreign Economic Coopera- tion Office under Sichuan Province Environmental Protection Bureau and China\u2019s Ministry of Environmental Protection, the project aimed to mainstream biodiversity in the recovery and reconstruction process and to strengthen the affected protected areas. To inform sound decision making in the recovery process, the project quickly undertook a number of assessments to evaluate the damage caused to biodiversity and livelihoods. Within its first year, the project investigated impacts on 19 local communities and villages surrounding eight national nature reserves. Their findings were used to recommend a series of practical measures to improve local farmers\u2019 livelihoods. The project also assessed damage to the eight national nature reserves and surveyed the extent of damage to habitats of 10 key endangered species, to inform conservation and rehabilitation strategies. The Sichuan Province Environmental Protection Bureau used these findings and the recommendations of the \u201cEcological Function Re- gionalization Plan\u201d developed by the project to update its \u201cEcological Rehabilitation Plan in Sichuan Earthquake Areas\u201d.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "64c710df-8a47-4131-871f-45e6898e75a9": {"__data__": {"id_": "64c710df-8a47-4131-871f-45e6898e75a9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Biodiversity for Sustainable Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fe0f31b06faceebb112ee759be3eddca84175336abde30a023aa65eb20575da0"}, "2": {"node_id": "4e78166d-b875-4805-be1a-64705e7d17c2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "45cf6ab3791aa5a00715f97cc8026e9cfc59f91c7169ffc4a8c0f827d579f04d"}}, "hash": "49933469d4fdb9c92ad5ca5ab9fc7739158a952fd268cd612df45e809afbbf5f", "text": "This rehabilitation plan has played a guiding role in reconstruction efforts made by all sectors under the Sichuan Government, coordinating stakeholders\u2019 actions and defining their responsibilities in biodiversity conservation in the reconstruction.

Rehabilitation actions in 32 nature reserves affected by the earthquake have been guided by the \u201cReconstruction Framework for Protected Areas\u201d developed by the project. The project also developed a plan for strengthening protected area management capacity at two national nature reserves, which was used to inform revitalisation efforts in other earthquake-damaged reserves. The project has also updated field and office equipment in earthquake- hit nature reserves. Twenty-one nature reserves were provided with a range of equipment, including wildlife-monitoring cameras. \u201cForty infra- red cameras provided by the project to monitor endangered species such as golden monkeys, takins, black bears and wild pigs\u2026 provided information on their population size and behaviour, which have served as important evidence for conservation measures,\u201d says Mr. Shen Lim- ing deputy-director of Tangjiahe Nature Reserve. Community-based Reconstruction Centres for Ecological Civilization in five villages established through the project have played an important role in helping to support and comfort local farmers who experienced the earthquake, raising their awareness around biodiversity conserva- tion, improving their production techniques and increasing their family incomes. For example, farmers from Guanba Village tripled their honey production following practical training provided at the centre. Sichuan Province Environmental Protection Bureau has made budget- ary provisions to continue to support the affected nature reserves, in- cluding key giant panda habitat, ensuring the sustainability of this work. Most of the Endangered giant panda's (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) habitat is located in Sichuan province.

India, where the UNDP, along with the Government of India, with GEF support is operating the \u201cMainstreaming Conservation and Sustain- able Use of Medicinal Plant Diversity in Three Indian States\u201d Project, is a case in point. The value and role of medicinal plants was detailed in the Atharva Veda scripts over 3,000 years ago and today, with an 11 percent annual global increase in the botanical and plant-derived drugs market, the estimated yearly turnover of the herbal industry in India is estimated to be Rs 8,800 crore (US$ 17.6 billion). And growing. Over 90 percent of medicinal plants (MPs) traded in India are gathered in the wild, frequently by women and marginalized tribal or caste com- munities with low incomes and insufficient capacity to sustainably meet or cope with the demands of an increasingly demanding mass market.

But the resulting, moderate if sustainable supply, could not meet increased demand. Harvesting methods changed. Whole branches were ripped off making the plants vulnerable to fungal infection or simply killing them outright. A boom in \u2018production\u2019 translated into loss, not just of natural resources, but of the harvest. With insufficient capital to invest in correct processing, much of the excess tejpat, which is prone to contamination if not correctly treated and packaged, spoiled. The Project seeks to reverse this self-defeating trend by employing several strategies. Two are aimed directly at Bodmalla and the thou- sands of other villages like it: 1. Demonstrate replicable models of in-situ and ex-situ MP conservation 2. Promote MP-related cultivation and livelihood generation. \u201cUnless we learn to identify and document the resources, we cannot conserve and manage them,\u201d says Mr. Girish Chandra Gutholiya, Forest Guard, Uttarakhand, known as \u201cthe Herbal State\u201d. In Bodmalla, this involved gathering a Task Team comprised of State Forest Department staff, MP collectors, traditional healers, women\u2019s groups (30 percent involved in the project are women) and other parties who were then exposed to communities where sustainable MP collection was already being practiced. The visits inspired partici- pants. Project-supplied uniforms helped provide a sense of identity and purpose. Wasteland was converted into tejpat plantations, Task Team members compiled accounts of regional floral biodiversity that were subsequently integrated into People\u2019s Biodiversity Registers, a bio-resource database that promotes the equitable sharing of re- source benefits and acts as proof of previous community knowledge to prevent bio-piracy. It is not only the plants that require protection. Ancestral knowledge is equally vulnerable both to exploitation and degeneration as socio- cultural environments change. Traditional healers and ancient medicinal practices are dependent on a ready supply of ingredients and, to this end, the project has proactively engaged in direct cooperation such as assisting with medicinal plantations, sapling donations and even the construction of medicinal plant clinics to enable practitioners to keep traditional techniques alive and sustainable. But for permanent change, the involvement of government is essential. Legal rights to intellectual property (traditional knowledge) are to be strengthened through new Project-supported legal initiatives. A report on a legal mechanism to protect traditional knowledge related to MP cultivation, harvest and sustainable use was submitted this year, in addition to a proposed policy framework for a national strategy for the conservation and use of medicinal plants. Modern science and newly direct market linkages forged by the project to ensure equitable profit sharing, wedded to traditional knowledge and practice make for a formidable alliance. At the request of collec- tors, the project, in cooperation with the Utterakhand State Medicinal Plant Board and the Foundation for the Revitalisation of Local Health Traditions, is compiling easy to read materials offering guidance on sustainable collection, meshing traditional practice with scientific information on tejpat regeneration. Publication is eagerly anticipated by locals keen to apply it themselves and the Task Team, eager to roll it out to other suffering MP-dependent communities. Tejpat is currently classified by IUCN as Vulnerable meaning that it is likely to become Endangered unless the circumstances threatening its survival and reproduction improve. Here in India\u2019s Himalayan \u2018Herbal State\u2019 improvement is in the air. The seeds of tejpat sustainability are not just being sown but are already growing, ensuring that there will be forever green gold in these hills. \u201cUnless we learn to identify and document the resources, we cannot conserve and manage them,\u201d Mr. Girish Chandra Gutholiya, Forest Guard, Uttarakhand, known as \u201cThe Herbal State\u201d. 123 Biodiversity for Sustainable Development Bartundi/Noni or Indian Mulberry (Morinda citrifolia).

While advances in biotechnology have great potential use, they must be developed and used with adequate safety measures to guard bio- diversity, the environment and human health. The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety aims to ensure that countries safely transport, handle and use living modified organisms (LMOs), commonly termed genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The pro- tocol sets out international standards of regulation to derive maximum benefits from biotechnology while also safeguarding biodiversity and human health from possible negative effects of LMOs. As an interna- tional treaty under the Convention on Biological Diversity, countries are obliged to implement national legislation in accordance with the Protocol. UNDP, with GEF finance, has supported Malaysia to implement the Protocol. Through this \u2018Capacity Building for Implementation of Malay- sia\u2019s National Biosafety Framework\u2019 project, Malaysia has successfully created its own fully operational national system to assess, manage and monitor the long-term risks posed by LMOs to biodiversity and human health. Invasive alien species (IAS) are now recognized as one of the five main drivers of biodiversity loss. Glo- balisation of trade, travel and transport is accelerating the rate at which species can move from the location in which they evolved to others, where they are not native and can cause significant convulsions. UNDP VS. THE ALIENS: TWO CASE STUDIES In Nepal, local communities have worked with the \u2018Conservation and Sustainable Use of Wetlands Communities\u2019 project to remove invasive plants to restore critical wetland areas in the Ghodaghodi Lake Area. Importantly, the project also piloted ways for lo- cal communities to turn the invasive plants collected to good use; the pests if properly processed yield fuel, rich compost and fibre for making mats and other local handicrafts to sell. In this instance, the project supported skills training of women\u2019s groups, and facilitated their access to market, in collaboration with private companies, Organic Village and Knot Craft. Several trained women\u2019s groups have formed a cooperative of their own and established a small workshop and factory. Female members of the cooperative harvest water hyacinth, processing them for fibres and dyes, and produce various items in their workshop. As a result, the income of women and men at the project site has significantly increased. The project has also piloted the use of water hyacinth to prepare compost and mulch and as raw feed material for a biogas plant. In addition, the project has developed guidelines for management of invasive alien species at wetland sites. In Sri Lanka, the \u2018Strengthening capacity to control the introduction and spread of alien invasive species\u2019 project seeks to strengthen policies and legislation for effective IAS control. The project is supporting the finalisation of Sri Lanka\u2019s National IAS Policy and National IAS Strategy and Action Plan through stakeholder consultations. Following the prin- ciple that \u2018prevention is better than cure\u2019, the project aims to enhance integrated management planning and action, and institute financial and technical support for the prevention, detection, and management of invasive alien species. Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) an aquatic plant native to the Amazon basin, has done extensive damage to wetlands in Nepal, where it is not native and grows rapidly, invading habitats and choking water bodies by causing eutrophication that starves native species of oxygen and light. Malaysia passed a Biosafety Act in 2007 to ensure its rapidly growing biotechnology industry is developed safely and in accordance with the Cartagena Protocol. The Department of Biosafety in the Ministry of Natural Resource and Environment (NRE) began implementing the project with UNDP support soon after. The project has seen much success. Biosafety regulatory bodies nec- essary for administration, risk assessment and management, decision making and compliance were established, and their staff trained to equip them with the skills needed to carry out their biosafety functions with efficiency and confidence. In total, the project built the capacity of 351 staff in areas such as regulation, detection and enforcement. Top international experts were hired to train staff in state of the art practices for GMO detection and mobile detection laboratories were provided for use at ports. The regulatory bodies established comprise Malaysia\u2019s national bi- osafety framework. As a result of the project\u2019s support, these bodies are now fully operational and are working together to receive, administer and provide assessments and decisions on notifications and approvals for LMOs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2aee4f6b-e95b-4289-9900-a5c2b775f034": {"__data__": {"id_": "2aee4f6b-e95b-4289-9900-a5c2b775f034", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Biodiversity for Sustainable Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7278b530cff5d417bde3ec50b1e12b2d63648aa84ac0a7cad6e5effb6094e321"}, "2": {"node_id": "aefe5951-a5c5-4cd6-8d20-6f425ab0d330", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "19bedb465d290709e7bc3bd0e5b882773fea953d6ddbeb79e968cd764caac2b6"}}, "hash": "32865a3be1b2936d702ef457108d6c1e77520659f8aea219da22f2e5c1d10e69", "text": "A range of outreach activities, including workshops, seminars and communication materials developed by the project have built public awareness of biosafety and encouraged stakeholder participation throughout the project. 125 Biodiversity for Sustainable Development Photo: aodaodaodaod/Shutterstock.com Photo: Prashanth Vishwanathan/UNDP India 126 HEALTH & SECURITY As human populations expand and natural habitats shrink, people and animals are increasingly coming into", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "022609cc-26bd-448a-ac99-23327c181b10": {"__data__": {"id_": "022609cc-26bd-448a-ac99-23327c181b10", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Biodiversity for Sustainable Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "60624beb91a3473488772a6edd206be78c993d0fbccd99f61b403aaf5e249c48"}, "3": {"node_id": "95b914f3-bffb-463f-90ff-2b7795287263", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "041fb1793062a05e4d3811317ebedeeb6e0328261827006a20007c9dc918517b"}}, "hash": "3dba157616cdc819416f5f1c16cd25abff09a62946aad7849f53deb981d0d677", "text": "conflict over living space and food. From elephants destroying crops in Nepal to snow leopards killing livestock in Mongolia, human wildlife conflict can result in damage to crops, livestock, property and sometimes deaths of both people and the animals involved. If conservation efforts are to succeed, human wildlife conflicts must be reduced. Recognising this, UNDP supported projects have implemented activities to help address this problem. In Nepal\u2019s Western Terai, deforestation and a rising population have increasingly brought people into conflict with large mammals, par- ticularly elephants and one-horned rhinos, in and around the buffer zones of Bardia National Park and Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve. The UNDP supported GEF financed \u2018Western Terai Landscape Project\u2019 (WTLP) has worked collaboratively with local people to minimise this threat through a number of initiatives. Solar electric fences were constructed at critical locations of the buffer zones to protect settlements and farms. These fences have reduced the vulnerability of 5,000 households to crop damage and human injury. Where it was not possible to build fences, watch-towers were constructed to help warn villagers of approaching rhinos and elephants. To provide immediate support for damage already caused by wildlife, the project contributed Rs 3.6 million (about US$ 36,500) to establish a relief fund to help affected communities in the protected area buffer zones. In addition, natural solutions promoted by the project have helped to both mitigate wildlife incursions and improve livelihoods. The project supported farmers living in areas close to the protected forested areas to cultivate wild mint and camomile. These high value aromatic and medicinal plants grow well in the region and act as a natural deterrent \u2013 rhinos dislike the smell of the plants, which prevents them from eating them and deters them from entering settlements and farmlands beyond. The project provided high quality seeds, technical knowledge, and herb processing and marketing support to 995 farmers to cultivate wild mint and camomile in over 100 hectares of land in 2011. From these crops, the farmers yielded 2,800 kilogrammes of essential oil, which they were able to sell for Rs. 1,200 (US$ 12) per kilogramme of wild mint oil and Rs 23,000 (US$ 233) per kilogramme of camomile oil. Human casualty data from Bardia National Park and Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserve Data show that the number of injuries caused by wildlife declined between 2008 and 2012. As damage caused by wildlife has declined and local people have seen improvements through project support, the project reports that local support for protected areas has increased. In Mongolia, training and supporting local communities to become responsible for wildlife monitoring and management has also helped to reduce conflict among wildlife and people. Training in wildlife identifica- tion and monitoring provided by the UNDP supported GEF financed Altai Sayan project to herders in Mongolia\u2019s Altai Mountains has helped this community to avoid human wildlife conflict. This training enabled the community to better predict attacks on livestock by wildlife, such as snow leopards, and take precautionary measures. Human wildlife conflict is a major challenge in Bhutan, where large animals live in close proximity to rural communities. To address Bhu- tanese farmers\u2019 concerns over this, Bhutan\u2019s Nature Conservation Division of the Department of Forests developed a National Human- Wildlife Conflict Management Strategy. The strategy was developed through the support of UNDP Bhutan, WWF Bhutan and the Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation, and provides a concrete basis to understand and mitigate human-wildlife conflicts in Bhutan focused on human welfare and poverty alleviation. The National Strategy addresses both crosscutting and species- specific issues, proposing actions to address conflict between humans and carnivores (large cats, bears, dholes), wild pigs, deer, elephants and primates. It gathered inputs from a range of stakeholders and 80 national and international experts to analyse the root causes of human- wildlife conflicts and potential solutions to address them. Based on these analyses, it proposes concrete action plans, such as improving herd management to reduce the vulnerability of livestock to kills by predators, community compensation and insurance programmes and implementing monitoring programmes to understand and mitigate conflict hotspots. The National Strategy provides a critical guide for action by managers, researchers, and communities to work towards alleviating poverty and improving livelihoods for rural Bhutanese while protecting the mega-fauna that characterize this Kingdom.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "95b914f3-bffb-463f-90ff-2b7795287263": {"__data__": {"id_": "95b914f3-bffb-463f-90ff-2b7795287263", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Biodiversity for Sustainable Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "60624beb91a3473488772a6edd206be78c993d0fbccd99f61b403aaf5e249c48"}, "2": {"node_id": "022609cc-26bd-448a-ac99-23327c181b10", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3dba157616cdc819416f5f1c16cd25abff09a62946aad7849f53deb981d0d677"}}, "hash": "041fb1793062a05e4d3811317ebedeeb6e0328261827006a20007c9dc918517b", "text": "REDUCING CONFLICT BETWEEN WILDLIFE AND COMMUNITIES 127 Biodiversity for Sustainable Development Photo: M.

Our natural wonders and heritage provide many intangible but valuable benefits to humanity, including recreation, tourism, ed- ucation, enjoyment and mental wellbeing. Our relationship with these wonders is particularly relevant in a rapidly changing world, where communities, including indigenous peoples, face profound, rapid and apparently continu- ous changes to their societies and circumstanc- es. This is leading in many places to the erosion of the values and institutions that provide social cohesion, adaptability and resilience. Driven by the priorities of countries and communities, UNDP\u2019s work aims to strengthen the capacity of people to recognize and respond to this change while conserving and sustainably using the biodiversity and ecosystems that we all de- pend on. Photo: Jesse Montes By J Marc Foggin, Senior Research Scientist Mountain Societies Research Institute University of Central Asia Kyrgyzstan Tibetan nomadic pastoralists have lived in the extensive rangelands and mountain areas north of the Himalayas for millen- nia, depending largely on their domestic yak and sheep for their livelihoods. With average elevations over 4000 metres above sea level, the Tibetan plateau is known for its harsh and unpredictable environ- ment. The vegetative growing season is short and snow-storms can devastate herds of animals, both domestic and wild; in fact, snow can cover the grasslands during any month of the year. Yet this place is still known and valued as \u2018home\u2019 by many Tibetan herding communities. The Tibetan plateau also is home to a wide array of native ungulates and other wildlife, including the wild yak, white-lipped deer, kiang (or wild ass), Tibetan antelope, Tibetan gazelle, blue sheep and argali, as well as the Endangered snow leopard, Pallas\u2019 cat, musk deer, black- necked crane, saker falcon and many other species of local, national and global interest. The biodiversity of the Tibetan plateau is both a wonder to cherish and a global asset to preserve. For the yak and shepherds living on the plateau, this extraordinary biodiversity has also long been a part of their cultural heritage. Their lives and livelihoods \u2013 and their identity \u2013 are intimately tied to the environment on which they depend. As such, the maintenance of proper ecological functioning in their grasslands and wetlands is not optional; it is vital. The yak is essential for the survival of communities in the Tibetan plateau environment. Yaks provide milk, which can be drunk or transformed into butter or cheese. Yaks also are source of wool for making tents, fuel (yak dung), transportation, and ultimately meat. Without the yak, nomads would never be able to adapt to the condi- tions of the high plateau. The wildlife is equally central in herders\u2019 culture, as they feel that animals are like the \u201cjewels of the land\u201d and without them there would be a sense of sorrow and loss. If sustainable development is meant to achieve wellbeing for people, then \u2018culture\u2019 \u2013 which develops from the long-term sharing of experiences and represents the soul of a community \u2013 must also be considered integrally with other pillars of sustainability, including economy and environment. In the case of Tibetan nomadic pastoralists, people\u2019s livelihoods and their relationships with the natural environment have formed much of their sense of identity. By starting with \u2018community and culture\u2019 when designing and planning initiatives for sustainable development \u2013 rather than simply applying development models or conservation models that generally assume only market-driven motivations by lo- cal people \u2013 new synergies and pathways could emerge to support effective natural resource management. Studies show that many factors bring us happiness and wellbeing \u2013 a sustainable livelihood combined with good health and educa- tion, adequate living standards, involvement in decision-making and community, care of the environment, and cultural continuity are key. According to Bhutan\u2019s innovative Gross National Happiness (GNH) Index, maintaining ecological diversity and resilience is central to happiness and wellbeing. People-centred approaches to wildlife and nature conservation and management are already taking place in the Sanjiangyuan area of Qinghai Province, China, through the introduction of collabora- tive forms of natural resource management and more generally by strengthening local governance.

The philosophy of GNH was formulated in 1972 by the \u201cFourth Dragon King \u2013 Jigme Singye Wangchuck\u201d, and it rests on four pillars: promo- tion of sustainable development; preservation and promotion of cultural values; conservation of the natural environment; and the establish- ment of good governance. In keeping with these lofty goals and principles, the conservation of its globally significant genetic resources is a key priority of the Government of Bhutan today. Dr. Tashi Yangzome, Programme Director of the National Biodiversity Centre (NBC), speaks of this approach with a characteristically friendly Bhutanese smile on her face. A vet by background, Yangzome joined the NBC \u2013 a Centre mandated to coordinate biodiversity conservation and sustainable utilisation activities in the country \u2013 in 2007. Yangzome describes her years in practice as \u201cmost fulfilling\u201d and her current work at NBC as \u201cboth challenging and rewarding.\u201d Her principle motivating factors, she explains are \u201cthe compassionate leadership of our beloved Kings and the strong conservation ideals that Bhutan upholds.\u201d The thing that excites her most is working hard towards an inclusive, \u201cpeople- centric\u201d conservation approach. With her dedicated team at NBC, Yangzome is currently working on a bio-exploration pro- gramme to generate revenue from conservation for conservation; implementation of the Na- goya Protocol on Access and Benefit-Sharing; integrated ex situ and in situ conservation programmes to benefit farmers as well as researchers; and establishing a science-based information and knowledge base that can be translated into policy decisions. One intriguing project in progress is the Bhutan Biodiversity Portal \u2013 a consortium of differ- ent biodiversity stakeholders in the country \u2013 that aims to create a common platform for biodiversity-related information. Yangzome was also instrumental in the im- plementation of the UNDP supported GEF financed \u2018Integrated Livestock and Crop Conservation\u2019 project, which supported con- servation of traditional crops and livestock breeds through an holistic approach, as well as mainstreaming agro-biodiversity conserva- tion into national policies and programmes. It broadened the outreach of the centre in terms of advocacy and education on agro-biodiversity conservation by enabling the participation of farmers from all parts of the country. Yangzome says with confidence that there is certainly strong support for maintaining the rich agro-biodiversity of Bhutan since it features in draft policies on livestock and agriculture as well as in food and nutrition security policy. With the support of UNDP, Bhutan has also been able to access US$ 1 million through GEF for an Access and Benefit Sharing project. Among other objectives, the project will seek to spearhead a bio-exploration programme in Bhutan and generate better understanding of the valuation of the country\u2019s biological resources. Most importantly, Yangzome hopes that this project will result in tangible benefits through the strong involvement of local communities and create a vibrant conservation model where benefits are ploughed back into communities. Yangzome says that she is committed to devel- oping an ABS landscape that will benefit not only Bhutan but also other countries that are seeking to do the same. When asked about the highlight of her career, she says: \u201cThe most satisfying moments are working with the excellent and committed team at NBC on strengthening biodiversity conserva- tion and sustainable utilisation in the country.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "352993eb-d802-4bf0-a021-cfa676646003": {"__data__": {"id_": "352993eb-d802-4bf0-a021-cfa676646003", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Biodiversity for Sustainable Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "67ed8372406484eb8d43e733c396a81935b76798005da354f0970d34d9e42e15"}, "2": {"node_id": "4e7d69b4-c658-4a6d-b625-ee9f9cfd4362", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "70ccfc14aa0db36052b3132b09b46c27bfec7fcf5296322bfa2e15d27849b221"}}, "hash": "e5ffb77edaa1d6fcae98288b7be98b2331d12cb238166c572dbf80c12e390a1a", "text": "It has also been immensely gratifying to meet people from the global family who have helped us with their expertise, knowledge and who have shown such good-will towards my country.\u201d \u201cThe challenge that we would like to overcome is how to sustain our agro-biodiversity in the wake of emerging pressures, such as lack of farm labour, rural-urban migration, human- wildlife conflict, and rapid urbanisation.\u201d The greatest challenge, however, is", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6d38fae5-56ae-48d3-abb4-8293050f43bc": {"__data__": {"id_": "6d38fae5-56ae-48d3-abb4-8293050f43bc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Biodiversity for Sustainable Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1a27a2b9665d7fcfee74297094a1bdb38bf6f9c2cdc700f50aea623ec7b6e234"}, "3": {"node_id": "9021199f-c206-4def-bd46-45a2a34a08d0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/biodiversity-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e34ccc8465819d0e826f4c9c54b189f4bc6e261ee9ddc229e79e4b66a859ed74"}}, "hash": "cb4662db597a674c81634d23bbafe311ab4232c9dfdf56c12bf35e6bf12f97ac", "text": "to build a strong scientific community that will generate data that can be used in conservation strategies and policy decisions. One key advantage of her work on biodiversity conservation is that the country still has large swathes of intact biodiversity. Bhutan publicly aspires to become the world\u2019s first totally or- ganic nation and the constitution upholds the maintenance of \u201cat least 60 percent of the total land under forest cover at all time\u201d. The figure currently stands at just over 70 percent and this, combined with spectacular topography ranging from sub-tropical jungle in the lowland hills to permanent \u201cpolar-type\u201d environments in the snow bound peaks over 7,000 metres above sea level, ensures that Bhutan, despite its modest size, is a treasure trove of biodiversity in the region. Close to 200 species of mammals are known to occur in the country, including 27 globally threatened species. Bhutan is also known to be rich in wild cats, harbouring 11 of the 36 species globally recorded. The remarkable sighting of a Royal Bengal tiger at an altitude of 4,200 metres above sea level, in Jigme Dorji National Park, was the highest altitude tiger sighting recorded among the tiger range countries. Bhutan is home to about 700 species of bird, including 18 globally threatened species. She attributes this natural wealth to the \u201ccon- servation leadership of the Kings combined with political will, and a strong policy and legislative framework which provides an enabling envi- ronment and engenders strong commitment to ensure that it remains so.\u201d Yangzome says that the greatest inspiration on biodiversity conservation comes from the words of the 4th Dragon King who said: \u201cThroughout the centuries, the Bhutanese have treasured their natural environment and have looked upon it as the source of all life. This traditional reverence for nature has delivered us into the new millen- nium with our environment still richly intact. We wish to continue living in harmony with nature and to pass on this rich heritage to our future generations\u201d. This is the \u2018conservation anthem\u2019 for every Bhutanese citizen. Yangzome sings it with pride, determination and, yes, happiness!

Over 300-400 head of livestock were lost per year in Perak and Pahang states. Siva, with the consent of the Director General of DWNP and farm managers, deployed field rangers, developed monitoring mechanisms, advised improvements to fencing, moved cattle away from the forest edge and captured \u201cproblem tigers\u201d for relocation away from settlements. Siva is now known as the \u201cTiger Man\u201d in Malaysia.

As a result, 40 designated protected areas covering an area of more than 750,000 hectares were rediscovered as already gazetted. His pas- sion for protected area conservation led to the DWNP recommending Siva to pursue a PhD in the United States supported by a Malaysian Government scholarship. He sees his appointment by the Government to head the \u2018Protected Areas Financing\u2019 project, which started in 2012, as an unparalleled op- portunity to assist the DWNP and other stakeholders to train younger officers to work to further improve the management effectiveness of the protected areas system in Peninsular Malaysia. \u201cThis project will soon be complemented by another \u2013 the \u2018Improving the Connectivity in the Central Forest Spine\u2019 project \u2013 that starts in 2014 under the Forestry Department to create connectivity between forest blocks,\u201d he says. \u201cThis will link critical habitat for large migratory mammals, such as the Malayan tiger and Asian elephant, and will help to preserve critical water catchments.\u201d Tigers feature prominently in Malaysia and in local Malay folklore.

Protected Areas sustain our lives and our country.\u201d Fiji\u2019s Korolevuwai district is home to Biausevu village with approximately 200 hundred residents. Since the mid-1980s, the village has been offering tourists a short walking tour to a nearby waterfall. Over time, this initiative began showing signs of becoming a classic case of natural capital being \u201cloved to death\u201d. The area is an important forest and water ecosystem envi- ronment for the island, but the track that crosses the creek nine times has caused vegetation loss and major erosion around flood-prone areas. The riverbanks were being trod- den under well-meaning ecotourist feet, furthering erosion already begun by the loss of tree species along the path and more trees being cleared in the vicinity, ironically for eco-tourism development. The landscape was becoming increasingly stressed, barren and tired. The Global Environment Facility\u2019s Small Grants Programme (known as GEF SGP), implemented by UNDP, awards small grants to prevent small problems from growing bigger. In this case, a small grant helped the Biausevu Tourism Committee improve the environmental management of the Biausevu Waterfall Tour and develop a more sustainable approach to managing tourism in sensitive areas. Key activities included helping the community to identify the effects of logging on waterfall and creek water qual- ity, raising their awareness of the biodiversity in the area, and developing a strategy to manage and minimize future damage on the ecosystem. In particular, the Biasevu Tourism Committee received training at the University of the South Pacific (USP) and the Department of Forestry (DoF) on sustainable environmental management practices and participated in knowledge exchanges on sustainable forestry manage- ment and rehabilitation, forest-based ecotourism, and best practice on governance for resource owners.

Since its creation, GEF SGP has provided over 18,500 grants to communities in over 128 developing countries. Funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) as a corporate programme, GEF SGP is implemented by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) on behalf of the GEF partnership, and is executed by the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS). GEF SGP has been supporting communities as \u2018champions\u2019 of biodiversity conservation since its launch. Nearly 8,000 GEF SGP grants for biodiversity conservation awarded globally since 1992 have contributed significantly to protected area management, reduction of threats to threatened species, improved environmental governance, sustainable natural resource management, and the conservation and sustainable use of agro-biodiversity. GEF SGP\u2019s cumulative experience and results have demonstrated that supporting communities in their efforts to achieve more sustainable livelihoods is not only possible, but necessary to achieve global environmental benefits. also developed an Environmental Management Plan and organized community workshops to ensure implementation of these practices. To tackle soil erosion and divert water away from the track and back into the stream, the project constructed a more sophisticated drain- age system led by the DoF, and planted over 700 native tree and plant species beside the creek and waterfall to minimize water pollution. The results are encouraging, not just in terms of securing a valuable natural asset, but also by yielding other benefits. Following knowledge transfer between experts and the community, the project has helped recover and revive traditional knowledge on medicinal plants and sustainable use of native plant species. It has promoted intergen- erational communication by encouraging youths to work side by side with village elders. In addition, the USP Herbarium Department has documented wild plants living along the track. Visitors can not only learn about the im- portance of the wildlife and vegetation of the area, but also participate in tree planting activities along the path. The project also started a series of activities to promote sustainable alternative livelihoods to alleviate pressure the area from tourism, including the production of handicrafts and food for sale by local women and training of community members as tour guides. To date, the project has generated over 100 jobs including forest tour guides, waterfall attendants, nursery attendants, storytellers, caterers, tour coordinators and handicraft sellers. Most importantly, the GEF SGP project has worked with the local au- thorities to impose a capacity limit on the number of people accessing the track per week to mitigate adverse environmental impacts caused by the excessive trampling of overcrowded tours. 137 Biodiversity for Sustainable Development Photo: Terence Hay-Edie Photos: GEF SGP 138 ECOSYSTEMS QUIZ We would like to thank and recognise the many project teams and partners who have contributed to the projects profiled in this publication and to the publication itself, and to thank the Global Environment Facility (www.thegef.org).

UNDP provides expertise and implementation mechanisms in three priority areas: improving livelihoods, strengthening inclusive and effective governance, and building resilience. In 2014, UNDP is strategically strengthening its presence in the region to provide better services on these priorities to clients. To maximize results, UNDP is also building partnerships to bring together communities, experts, development partners, and South-South partners, to advance progress on MDG indicators and define a relevant post-2015 agenda. 2013 saw a strong new emphasis by UNDP on both innovation and scaling up as key components for ensuring transformative change with the implementation of the Innovation and Scaling- Up Funds of $9.5 million. In 2013, UNDP delivered US$1.15 billion in programmes to implement these priorities, with 88% of UNDP expenditures in the region taking place in low-income countries.

Haoliang Xu, Assistant Administrator and Director, Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific, UNDP \u201c EXAMPLES OF OUR WORK SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT In Nepal, more than 60,000 low- income groups, women and youth have become micro-entrepreneurs through the Micro-Enterprise Development Programme. Initially implemented in 10 of the country\u2019s 75 districts, the Government has replicated the model to 50 districts, with plans to reach all districts. In Bangladesh, UNDP supported improvements in the livelihoods of more than 3 million urban poor women and men; in so doing, it assisted the mobilization of the urban poor into community structures and the formation of community-based savings and credit groups for 400,000 poor households. In six Pacific Island countries, the Pacific Financial Inclusion Programme introduced financial services to 500,000 people who were excluded from the new cash- led and market-based economic system. UNDP assisted seven governments with development of social protection schemes. Supported by UNDP, the Government of China passed new social assistance regulation, which came into effect in May 2014, benefiting about 250 million people. UNDP promoted the integration of climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable policies and budgets into development plans in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia and eight Pacific Island states. It assisted 80 communities in the Pacific \u2013 affecting nearly 40,000 people \u2013 to adapt to climate shifts. EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE UNDP support to elections in Asia and the Pacific registered 16.7 million new voters in seven countries in 2013. Currently, UNDP advisors in Afghanistan are actively supporting the audit of the ballot boxes as part of UNDP\u2019s long- standing electoral support. In Papua New Guinea, UNDP helped prepare women to run for elections, contributing to the tenfold increase in the proportion of women elected to local government since 2011. With the final push for MDG achievement, nine countries developed MDG Acceleration Framework Action Plans in 2013 with the intention of speeding up progress on lagging goals. In Indonesia, a UNDP-supported pilot effort in Central Java province to reduce maternal mortality under the MAF resulted in the issuance of a national strategy and the Government scaling up of the framework to 64 additional districts, covering 30% of the population. UNDP also engaged in a number of initiatives in 19 countries to further rule of law and access to justice, particularly for the poor, women and vulnerable groups benefiting more than 182,000 people. DISASTER RISK REDUCTION AND EARLY RECOVERY Support to development of a comprehensive risk reduction system in Bangladesh facilitated the taking of refuge by 1 million people in nearly 4,000 shelters within 24 hours before tropical storm Mahasen hit in 2013, so that only 17 lives were lost, a figure significantly below the toll in similar disasters.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "03d2dc4e-9215-476d-ac74-3c11730afa90": {"__data__": {"id_": "03d2dc4e-9215-476d-ac74-3c11730afa90", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-results-report-2013-2014-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia Pacific Results Report 2013 - 2014: A Summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-results-report-2013-2014-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "09eaf485825b7c0f1afffca72f054ba2c4f021c1d4e394d77afe1f5ee21e14c2"}, "2": {"node_id": "98d11832-c0c3-40b3-905f-1a3f4f24d087", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-results-report-2013-2014-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "39159283601fdc1f8007460b7d0bdb2b37fac72c08fa6f467fb3adf2b6f51d17"}}, "hash": "5acb487d13356b03937df1e6c0f87bfec2f21b848f47eacb60e9c93d64e17056", "text": "The Government of India achieved a major success when a super- cyclone which struck Odisha and Andhra Pradesh states of India, and caused less than 50 deaths due to evacuation of more than a million people.

During 2013 the Centre\u2019s work focused on four key thematic issues, which are highly relevant to the region\u2019s development needs and priorities: crisis prevention and recovery, democratic governance, MDGs achievement and poverty reduction, including work on HIV/AIDS, environment, energy and climate change; and financial inclusion. Highlights of our work during 2013 included: > the pacific Risk Resilience programme (pRRp) which is a four year regional programme in partnership with Australia and the international nGo live and learn environmental education, went through its inception phase in 2013. the programme is being initially implemented in four countries \u2013 Fiji, Solomon Islands, tonga and Vanuatu \u2013 and is focused on strengthening governance mechanisms for disaster risk management and climate change adaptation. > A new project on \u2018Strengthening Citizen engagement in Fiji\u2019 (funded by the european union) was launched by the Centre\u2019s Strengthening Capacities for peace and Development (CpAD) programme. the project is designed to provide communities and local governments with the information, skills, tools and platforms to advance human rights, foster equitable service delivery, strengthen decision-making, enable voice, promote non-discrimination and enhance transformative leadership to support Fiji\u2019s democratic transition. > the Centre organized a pacific Symposium on Managing extractive Industries in pacific Island States in Fiji in March 2013 in collaboration with other partners. As a result of the symposium the Government of papua new Guinea (pnG) offered to host a follow up meeting in 2014. the Centre is also providing support to the pnG Country office for a national Human Development Report on the theme of extractive Industries which will be published in 2014. In Fiji, unDp was asked to provide technical assistance to the Government for reviewing its draft Mining Act and supporting a national consultation process. > the Centre\u2019s Regional parliamentary project initiated a new project with the Fiji parliament in 2013 with financial support from the european union. the project will focus on institutional and human resource capacity building. the regional project has continued to provide technical support to ongoing parliamentary projects, and specific capacity building activities with Mps, in tonga, Samoa, Kiribati, RMI and palau. In partnership with un Women and the pIFS, the Centre has also focused on increasing the participation of women in politics, to address the very low numbers of women Mps in the pacific. > the Centre\u2019s regional Anti-Corruption project (in a partnership with unoDC) made a significant contribution to the ratification and implementation of the united nations Convention against Corruption MeSSAGe FRoM tHe MAnAGeR u n D p pA C I F I C C e n t R e | A n n u A l R e p o R t 2 0 1 3 2 (unCAC) in the pacific during 2013.

We also welcomed a number of new staff and three new unDp Resident Representatives/un Resident Coordinators in Fiji, Samoa and papua new Guinea, who are members of the Centre\u2019s Management Board. 2013 was the last year of the current unDp Strategic plan (2008-2013) and regional programme cycle (2008-2013). In September 2013, unDp\u2019s executive Board approved a new Strategic plan for the period 2014-2017 and a new regional programme for the same period was approved by the executive Board in January 2014. Both of these frameworks will help guide the work programme of the Centre in the coming years. During 2013, the unDp Regional programme for Asia pacific 2008-2013 was evaluated by unDp\u2019s evaluation office. the evaluation can be found at http://web.undp.org/evaluation/rcf-gcf/rbap/rpe-rbap-2013.html the evaluation concluded that unDp\u2019s regional programme was highly relevant and addressed critical development challenges in the region. It also highlighted the fact that the pacific Centre\u2019s strong engagement with regional institutions had created lasting relationships through which unDp could address regional agendas and effectively channel its support through regional mechanisms. the pacific plan was reviewed in 2013, and pacific leaders will meet in 2014 to discuss the recommendations of the review, which will shape the future of pacific regionalism, and as a consequence, the future work of the Centre. In 2014, Samoa will host the 3rd International Conference on Small Island Developing States (SIDS). this conference will be especially significant for Samoa, one of the Centre\u2019s programme countries and for the region. It will allow pacific countries, most of whom are small island developing states, to highlight many of the development challenges they face, especially those related to climate change and achieving sustainable development. It will also provide an opportunity for pacific countries to articulate a \u2018pacific perspective\u2019 into the post-2015 global development agenda, and the design of sustainable development goals. the Centre was involved in the pacific SIDS regional preparatory meeting that was held in Fiji in July 2013, and will be actively engaged in supporting the SIDS conference and its outcomes. u n D p pA C I F I C C e n t R e | A n n u A l R e p o R t 2 0 1 3 3 Despite these changes to our internal and external operating environment, the Centre has continued to provide high quality support to unDp\u2019s programme activities in the pacific. We have strengthened our collaboration with the unDp Fiji Multi-Country office through a number of joint programmes, a Joint operations Centre and an Integrated Communications and Knowledge Management team. the pacific Solution exchange and Development Community, which has reached a milestone of more than 1300 members from across the pacific and globally, hosted 16 online discussions during 2013. the Centre\u2019s ability to provide high quality technical assistance has depended on a range of partners, both inside and outside the region. their support and willingness to jointly design and implement many of our activities has contributed significantly to their relevance, impact and sustainability. We have also benefitted from very generous financial support from our funding partners, particularly Australia, the european union, Japan, and new Zealand. Finally I would like to pay special tribute to the staff of the Centre who welcomed me so warmly to the pacific and to the Centre, and who have worked with much dedication, professionalism and enthusiasm throughout 2013. It has been a great pleasure to work with you all. I hope that you will find this report useful and informative, and thank you to all those individuals and partners who have worked with us to implement our work programme during 2013.

The Centre has established a strong reputation in the Pacific with a \u201ccan do\u201d approach to the development demands of the region. It was established with the twofold objectives of: supporting the country- level work that was led by the three UNDP country offices in the Pacific; while also delivering creative initiatives to support implementation of the 2005 Pacific Plan that was created to promote regional cooperation and integration. I am proud to say that through a number of independent reviews and evaluations it was highlighted that the Centre\u2019s work was systematically endorsed as being of a high quality and making a significant contribution to addressing the development challenges of the region. The success of the Centre was entirely dependent on its partnerships with Government agencies, regional organizations, non-government organizations and the private sector; its strong relations with Pacific UNDP and UN colleagues and with colleagues in the Bangkok Centre and our Headquarters in New York; and through the respect the Centre earned and support given by a number of development partners \u2014 but most notably the Australian and New Zealand aid programmes and the EU. 2013 was the final year of the 2008-2013 regional programme that was designed by UNDP with Governments and other partners in 2007. A new programme will be launched in 2014 and this will provide UNDP and its partners with an opportunity to maintain the thrust of a number of initiatives already underway, while developing a number of new ideas. In doing so I am confident that UNDP, through the Centre, will remain responsive to the development needs of the Pacific and continue to work alongside Governments and their wide range of partners in a cooperative and consultative manner. Message froM garry wiseMaN, outgoing Manager of the unDp pacific Centre Human Development trends and MDgs Achievement In pacific Island countries (pICs), where poverty is characterized by a lack of access to basic services and adequate resources, the provision of essential services such as energy, safe drinking water, sanitation, health and primary education matters significantly. poverty trends across the region are divergent, with no consistency between patterns of rural or urban poverty. At the sub-national level there appears to be strong, but divergent, geographic characteristics to the incidence of poverty, such as in Fiji, pnG, Vanuatu. there are a number of social and economic determinants for such a situation including inequality, isolation, non-inclusive economic growth and a lack of access to essential services, particularly energy. Multidimensional human poverty is, therefore, significantly high, particularly in rural areas, mainly due to weak local governance and the lack of capacity to deliver basic services. extreme poverty and hunger remain rather low, with the exception of pnG and nauru, but is an issue of concern. As the prevalence of imported food grows, inequality increases and with significant domestic migration towards urban areas, it becomes more difficult for pacific Islanders to supplement their diets with subsistence agriculture. the recent global food and fuel crisis raised prices even further, with food costing between 33 and 50 percent more in 2010 than in 2007 (pIFS, 2010:14). the food poverty line in nauru (25 percent) and pnG (26.5 percent) illustrate very significant deprivation. Despite improvements in the prevalence of underweight children in the region; pnG, FSM, Kiribati, RMI and Vanuatu still report a high incidence of underweight children and ensuring that all children under the age of five receive enough nutrients remains a problem. thus, most pICs are on track to achieve target 1C (Indicator 1.8) by 2015, with the exception of pnG, FSM, Kiribati, RMI and Vanuatu (SpC 2013: 10). progress towards the achievement of poverty reduction targets in MDG 1 are mixed in the pacific. poverty, in terms of the proportion of the population below the basic needs poverty line, has risen or remained the same in recent years, mainly due to the economic crisis. only Fiji and Vanuatu experienced a decline in the incidence of basic needs poverty. In FSM, the proportion of the population living below the national basic needs poverty line increased during the period from 1998 to 2005 (FSM HIeS 2005) and in Samoa, the proportion increased from 22.9 percent in 2002 to 26.9 percent in 2008 (Samoa HIeS 2008).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a409341a-e1e1-4969-8c92-60e179492c7f": {"__data__": {"id_": "a409341a-e1e1-4969-8c92-60e179492c7f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-pacific-centre-2013-annual-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Pacific Centre 2013 Annual Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-pacific-centre-2013-annual-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "35ccc1672ac3e6362ff9a03073dca342d783f090f235914fb617bccc74de7c67"}, "2": {"node_id": "6721d968-4c92-4497-8968-1e40a46bbbcc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-pacific-centre-2013-annual-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3d3ac3cb2eb9d42717f1dd349904fb10b10e6e449db8aa4ae7691ebc66bfa29a"}}, "hash": "f0027990554ad88411a2825668e6c9ba37a6af78daa629a9163b96507af2b00f", "text": "In pnG, the incidence of Basic needs poverty was estimated at 30 percent in 1996 and 39.9 percent in 2009-2011; as the two estimates cannot be compared for methodological reasons, no statement can be made on whether basic needs poverty has increased in pnG or not (HIeS 2009-2011, WB analysis: 7).

Inequality is rising in the pacific and reaching alarming levels in some countries. Human poverty is significantly higher than income poverty, particularly in rural areas. economic and poverty reduction policies have focused on market liberalization and job creation, with less attention paid to protecting the vulnerable or reducing inequalities. Most pacific countries are on track to reduce child mortality. Malaria is endemic to only pnG, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. While Solomon Islands and Vanuatu have made significant progress in reducing the burden of malaria, underpinned by widespread use of bed-nets and strong support by development partners, malaria in pnG remains a cause for concern. Six countries (Kiribati, RMI, pnG, tuvalu, FSM and Solomon Islands) are identified as having a high burden of tB. However, Kiribati, tuvalu and Solomon Islands are on track to reverse the incidence of tB. Drug-resistant tB in the Marshall Islands and FSM is making it more difficult for these countries to combat tB. For pnG, as with malaria, tB remains a major public health problem, especially given the HIV/AIDS epidemic the country is facing. the maternal mortality ratio is low in pnG and Solomon Islands. pacific Islands are facing a non-communicable diseases (nCDs) crisis of considerable magnitude with over 40 percent of the population being diagnosed with nCDs and the region holding the world record for diabetes and obesity prevalence. pacific countries have low life expectancy with nCDs being the major cause of death. the evidence that tobacco, alcohol and ultra-processed foods and drinks are major drivers of epidemics of nCDs is well established. the rapid lifestyle (dietary) changes and consequently exploding rates of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancers have enormous social and economic costs. literacy rates in the pacific are among the highest in developing countries (in most pICS above 90 percent). Most pICs are on track to achieve MDG 2 targets, with the exception of pnG and nauru. the quality of education, however, is a major concern. enrolment ratios are off-track in several pacific countries such as pnG, Solomon Islands, RMI and tonga. net enrolment ratios drop significantly for secondary and higher education in nearly all pICs. In addition to capacity issues and geographical remoteness, progress on MDGs 4, 5 and 6 are closely related to the multidimensional determinants of health such as poverty, food insecurity and the low status of women in most pICs. While gender parity in terms of education is impressive, women\u2019s economic and political empowerment remains a major challenge.

Correspondingly, the likelihood of achieving the full employment target in the region by 2015 is low, with particularly low full employment outcomes in pnG and FSM. Although labour Market Information and Analysis (lMIA) systems are often underdeveloped or non-existent, information that is available highlights employment creation for youth in the pacific is a critical development issue. Growth is a necessary, yet not a sufficient condition for development, in general, and poverty alleviation, in particular. It is not uncommon for natural-resource induced growth to fail to trickle down to the poorer segments of society, as is evident in pnG and Solomon Islands. these trends, including monetization and commercialization of economic activities, non-inclusive economic growth and rapid urbanization have widened the existing, as well as created new, income gaps. pICs\u2019 capacities to attract foreign investment also varies considerably, within and across countries. this, in turn, influences the rate of, and the beneficiaries from, employment creation. Moreover, the bulk of foreign investment received by pICs is extractive in nature and has few linkages with the rest of the economy and stimulates minimal job creation. thus with little development emphasis on livelihoods/informal economies, the increasing trend of rural to urban migration of young people further exacerbates the issue of youth unemployment and poverty in the pacific. economic trends in the Pacific the pacific region has experienced low, and volatile, economic growth in the last few decades. the size, remoteness and geographic isolation of the majority of pICs has also made it difficult to develop economically. other key constraints, such as vulnerability to natural disasters, susceptibility to adverse global economic conditions, a narrow production base, and limited export options exacerbate the economic challenges pICs face. pacific countries are heavily exposed to commodity price fluctuations and are, therefore, very vulnerable to food insecurity and the impacts of a volatile international food and energy market. Many of the challenges facing pICs are influenced by the structure, rate, stability and sustainability of economic growth (e.g. high cost of doing business, low levels of productivity, reliance on foreign aid and remittances and narrow economic base).

Weak domestic demand contributed to lowering inflationary pressures in 2011 and 2012 as well as projected inflation rates for 2013. While the current growth trends coupled with generally strict and over-cautious monetary policy should maintain inflation rates around its long-term trend, 2012 increases in international food and energy prices may generate inflationary pressures. one feature of the pacific region is that while most countries have relatively small open economies, the majority have high debt to GDp ratios (see table 2). of the two types of debt, external debt dominates total public debt.

Despite these developments, pacific Island countries continue to experience significant barriers that restrict the number of low-income (both rural and urban) households that are actively participating in the formal financial sector. the high costs of serving low-income customers relative to the revenues generated by small transactions and balances, the high costs of building a distribution system to acquire and serve customers living in small and remote villages, and a lack of products and services tailored to the needs of low-income customers deprive individuals, families and communities of the socio-economic benefits associated with financial inclusion. 1 fiji, solomon islands, Papua New guinea, vanuatu, samoa tABle 2: Debt levels of selected pICs Country total public Debt (% GDp) Year FSM 28.1* 2011 Fiji 54.2 2011 Kiribati 30 2009 palau 35* 2006 pnG 25 2011 RMI 67.4* 2011 Samoa 49.3 2011 Solomon Is. 22 2011 tonga 42.5 2012 tuvalu 14.5 2011 Vanuatu 20 2011 *external Debt Source: IMF Article IV Country Reports, IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis Reports, 2013. u n D p pA C I F I C C e n t R e | A n n u A l R e p o R t 2 0 1 3 9 Data on financial inclusion compiled by the central banks of Fiji, pnG, Samoa, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, working on the Alliance for Financial Inclusion pacific Islands Working Group Data project (AFI pIWG), shows that Fiji has the largest number of formal savings accounts (per 10,000 adults), followed by Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and pnG (there was no data for Samoa). Challenging geography and dispersal of population in small rural villages resulted in much lower numbers of financial access points recorded in pnG and Solomon Islands. However, due to advancement in telecommunications in the region, mobile and electronic financial services are now present in Fiji, pnG, Samoa, Solomon Islands, tonga and Vanuatu. electronic Funds transfer point of Sale (eFtpoS) devices are now more prevalent than any other forms of access points in all five countries in the AFI pIWG project. overall access to formal financial services is still low. Bank of pnG, in its 2014-2015 national Financial Inclusion and Financial literacy Strategy, estimates that nationally 85.6 percent of adults are unbanked with up to 92 percent without formal access in the most populated Highlands region. Measurement of adult financial competencies conducted by pFIp in Fiji, Samoa, Solomon Islands and pnG showed low to low-moderate levels of financial competencies. Competencies which were particularly weak were in planning of future expenditures, long term financial planning, budgeting and understanding the cost of money. Women, although they contribute to household income, were generally less financially competent and had a less significant role in managing household finances. Women\u2019s financial inclusion and empowerment will have a significant impact on household well-being. the low understanding of the \u2018cost\u2019 of money coupled with a weak regulatory framework on consumer protection needs to be addressed urgently to prevent predatory lending and over indebtedness. Inadequacy of savings for old age has significant implications on poverty incidence with aging. A strong policy commitment at regional and country levels to creating more inclusive financial sectors, coupled with advancement in digital financial services, payments systems modernization and investments in financial education by governments and the private sector will provide a strong foundation for targeted interventions to deepen financial access and empowerment for the estimated six million people in the pacific who still remain underserved in terms of access to financial services.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "db88eee0-589a-46d4-9d04-6340cbb2e68a": {"__data__": {"id_": "db88eee0-589a-46d4-9d04-6340cbb2e68a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-pacific-centre-2013-annual-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Pacific Centre 2013 Annual Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-pacific-centre-2013-annual-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d32e9e7141bde1988924935bf8d9dc814c6d96953f28571bb8df05c889e60abd"}, "2": {"node_id": "57284061-a3ee-4326-9aef-f3d65e0f79ec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-pacific-centre-2013-annual-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "65b18653db176193684e1b6b386de35bf5cd87a2b78667e56d22953e1f9bfdb8"}}, "hash": "9410a9d74fa91b318c696099ca441eda2010d9dbf37da5e580ff7a87f457184a", "text": "pIWG Financial Inclusion Indicators, 2013 InDICAtoR SAMoA FIJI pnG VAnuAtu Sol IS.

In response to these and other challenges, there has been a substantive increase in aid flows to the region, mainly through climate change adaptation (CCA) programming, and an increasing recognition that CCA and disaster risk management (DRM) need to be aligned along with climate change mitigation (CCM). In July 2013, the first Joint meeting of the pacific platform for Disaster Risk Management and the pacific Climate Change Roundtable occurred. As part of this, a process toward a Strategy for Disaster and Climate Resilient Development in the pacific (SRDp) led by pICs and guided by the principles of inclusion, leadership, and ownership, was established. the SRDp will allow the pacific to combine and harness the expertise of specialists working both in the DRM and climate change fields. this initiative follows the leadership of many pICs, who have already developed Joint national Action plans and other mechanisms for embedding disaster and climate resilience into their national development processes. the 44th pacific Island Forum leaders meeting held in Majuro, RMI in August 2013 highlighted numerous issues related to disaster risk management, energy, environment and climate change in the pacific. one outcome of the meeting was the Majuro Declaration for Climate leadership. the commitment to be climate leaders includes demonstrating climate leadership through action that contributes to the urgent reduction and phase down of greenhouse gas pollution and accelerate and also helps intensify efforts to prepare for and adapt to the impacts of climate change. u n D p pA C I F I C C e n t R e | A n n u A l R e p o R t 2 0 1 3 13 regional Programme until the end of 2013, all unDp activities were implemented within the framework of the unDp Strategic plan 2008-2013. this plan was approved in 2007 by the unDp executive Board, a steering and oversight body consisting of 36 un member countries who serve on a rotating basis. Initially covering the period 2008 to 2011, the plan was subsequently extended until 2013. the Asia-pacific Regional programme 2008-2011 was derived from the unDp Strategic plan and was also extended until 2013 to maintain this alignment. the Regional programme guides the work of the pacific Centre and the Asia pacific Regional Centre in Bangkok. For the pacific, the programme has also been guided by the initial priorities of the pacific plan and subsequent decisions of pacific Island leaders as well as the lessons learned from previous unDp regional programmes. In support of the Regional programme, the Centre implemented four major pacific regional projects \u2013 governance in the pacific, crisis prevention and recovery, MDGs achievement and poverty reduction and financial inclusion. the projects which ran from 2008-13, all went through a consultative process with a number of stakeholders within the pacific region \u2013 governments, nGos, donors and other un agencies \u2013 before being approved by governments in the region and the unDp Directorate for the Asia pacific region in December 2007. governance Arrangements the pacific Centre is part of the regional architecture of unDp\u2019s Regional Bureau for Asia and the pacific, with the Manager of the Centre reporting directly to the Deputy Regional Director, who is based at the Regional Bureau in new York. the Centre\u2019s work is reviewed annually by a Management Committee that is chaired by the Deputy Regional Director and includes the three pacific unDp Resident Representatives and a senior representative from the Bureau for Development policy.

One of the key aims of the CPAD project is to ensure that government and civil society are given the opportunity to engage constructively on peace and development issues. CPAD supports government peacebuilding efforts upon request and awards small grants to civil society organizations to implement innovative peacebuilding initiatives. The small grant mechanism enables CPAD to multiply the impacts of its work on the ground and achieve what the UN could not achieve by direct implementation. CPAD recognizes the capacities and resilience of local partners and enables people to build their own peace in a cost effective and sustainable manner. Finally, the programme codifies Pacific peacebuilding experiences and lessons learnt to strengthen peacebuilding interventions regionally and globally. Since its launch in 2009, the CPAD project has become recognized as: \u2022 A supporter of catalytic peace processes \u2022 An effective model of capacity development \u2022 A key provider of tailored and contextualized training \u2022 A reliable partner. In 2013, a number of activities were supported by CPAD that helped forge stronger partnership agreements between government and peacebuilding stakeholders in civil society in Fiji, Bougainville, Tonga and the Solomon Islands to work together in a collaborative and coordinated manner to advance peace consolidation. In Tonga, with financial support from CPAD, the Tonga National Peace and Unity Committees decided to mark International Peace Day 2013 in an unprecedented manner. To advance this aim, the Committee organized a week of activities aimed at bringing national attention to the issues of violence in Tongan society. In the Solomon Islands, efforts have produced a draft National Peacebuilding Policy that will be presented to the cabinet in 2014. The policy is unique in that it fosters a collaborative approach to peacebuilding. In Bougainville, the Northern Bougainville Women\u2019s Federation and the Hako Women\u2019s Collective, and its Hako Youth in the Media Unit, held a joint Evaluation Workshop to assess the impact of the 2012 CPAD small grant. The CPAD small grant enabled Bougainville youth and women in six districts (Atolls, Buka, Kunua, Nissan, Selau and Tinputz) to develop and deliver awareness building messages on health, women\u2019s participation in decision-making and peace-related issues for communities. The evaluation exercise revealed that the \u2018Bougainville Blitz\u2019 methodology was an effective approach for building government-civil society collaboration on community awareness raising. The approach helped the Government implement planned awareness programmes and helped establish a network of youth advocates equipped with the tools needed to conduct effect community and peer education activities. Recognizing the need for partnership, networking and sharing of information, resources and activities between the Autonomous Bougainville Government, the local level Council of Elders Governments, district offices, CSOs (women and youth) and faith-based organizations was a clear recommendation emerging from the evaluation exercise. The recommendation called for the establishment of an Information Centre in each District Office with facilities to share between the Government, CSOs, faith-based organizations, Bougainville Women\u2019s Federation and youth. As a result of the evaluation, the Division of Law and Justice has approved funding for the construction of Sub Region Information Kiosks to be built over the next three years. sUccess story: Strengthening Capacities for peace and Development u n D p pA C I F I C C e n t R e | A n n u A l R e p o R t 2 0 1 3 19 In Fiji, the CPAD project transferred its conflict resolution skills training methodologies to two key providers of conflict resolution training in the Pacific: the Pacific Centre for Peacebuilding and the Pacific Theological College (PTC). This will allow greater dissemination and appropriate contextualization of mediation, negotiation and dialogue skills throughout the region in a more sustainable manner. In 2013, CPAD also helped create a training of trainers programme that ran concurrently with PTC\u2019s three-week Pacific Peacebuilding Training Intensive.

SunGo uses the Citizen Report Card and Community Score Card methodologies to gather user feedback on public service delivery in the country, with a focus on health and education services. the initiative is expected to be completed by 2014 and will include a report card on the delivery of health and education services based on feedback received from the target communities. In addition to its work in Samoa, the Centre supported the unDp Solomon Islands Sub-office in designing a social accountability component for phase two of the provincial Governance Strengthening programme (pGSp). the Centre also continued its technical assistance to civil society organizations engaged in documenting human rights issues and advocating for change vis-\u00e0-vis governments and other stakeholders. transparency Vanuatu published a report in 2013 detailing its research findings on how school fee grants for primary education in the country are administered and to what extent they achieve their stated objective of abolishing primary education fees. they used the report to implement a targeted and evidence-based advocacy strategy at national and international levels, and have used the findings to inform the review of Vanuatu\u2019s human rights record under the universal periodic Review in 2013. the Centre provided technical and financial assistance to Ilukim Sustainability Solomon Islands during 2013. this support was used to undertake research on labour rights in Honiara\u2019s small and medium enterprises and assess to what extent current practices in the formal sector complied with the national labour law and international standards. the findings of the research are expected to be made public in 2014. understanding the linkages between Human rights and trade in the Pacific the Centre continued its work on enhancing understanding among policy-makers, civil society, and the wider public on the inter-linkages between trade and human rights in the pacific. this work has been undertaken in partnership with the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (oHCHR), the World Health organization (WHo) as well as other partners. A regional workshop on trade and non-communicable diseases in early 2013 highlighted the important linkages between trade, intellectual property rights and the right to health. the Centre is currently developing a regional knowledge product, using illustrative case studies, to highlight the key inter-linkages between human rights and trade in the pacific, with the aim of raising awareness among policy-makers and the wider public on possible impacts of trade and to help inform policy decisions that ensure respect for human rights when negotiating and/or implementing trade agreements or policies. this knowledge product will be released in 2014. Promoting Media Freedom In recognition of the vital role of media in democratic societies, the Centre stepped up its efforts in strengthening media freedom in the pacific in 2013. In partnership with oHCHR, uSp, un-Habitat and with the support of the pacific Media Assistance Scheme, the Centre has supported a sub-regional initiative to promote the right to adequate housing in Melanesia through human rights-based journalism, by strengthening the media as a conduit for increased coverage of informal settlements. Informal settlements are a growing development challenge across the pacific, in particular in Melanesia, and are a result of unprecedented levels of urbanization and internal migration. the initiative included a capacity-building component as well as an advocacy event in Fiji KeY HIGHlIGHtS: Democratic Governance u n D p pA C I F I C C e n t R e | A n n u A l R e p o R t 2 0 1 3 21 that allowed for the participation of people in informal settlements by giving them a voice in the public sphere. the initiative has led to increased media coverage on informal settlements throughout the region; while", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b89943af-25db-4550-b56c-29171c92e5c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "b89943af-25db-4550-b56c-29171c92e5c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-pacific-centre-2013-annual-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Pacific Centre 2013 Annual Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-pacific-centre-2013-annual-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "068a896eca8afadc0626d4b79de1d4bc66395fd49d7d29dd44019cffad829e89"}}, "hash": "068a896eca8afadc0626d4b79de1d4bc66395fd49d7d29dd44019cffad829e89", "text": "reducing negative stereotyping and promoting principles of participation and non-discrimination. In partnership with uneSCo and the pacific Freedom Forum, the Centre contributed to the strengthening of media freedom in the region through the development of a feasibility study for a regional media self-regulation mechanism. the feasibility study, to be launched in 2014, aims to inform the discussion on appropriate models for media self-regulation in the pacific and includes a representative survey on media self-regulation from media stakeholders across the region. Advancing gender equality in the Pacific Discrimination against women remains a major challenge in the pacific region. Recognizing that effectively addressing gender-based discrimination requires legislative reform and implementation, the Centre provided expertise to undertake a technical review of draft domestic violence bills for tonga and the Solomon Islands. As part of a joint un programme in Kiribati, aimed at supporting implementation of the national action plan on ending sexual and gender-based violence, the Centre developed a programmatic component on access to justice for victims of gender-based violence. In addition, the Centre continued its innovative work on legislative implementation. Following the provision of implementation roadmaps and costing for laws that address domestic violence in the Cook Islands in 2011 and the Marshall Islands in 2012, the Centre costed the implementation of the Family protection Act in palau in 2013. the costing exercise included an overview of projected costs across relevant Ministries over a three-year period. the Centre, in cooperation with other development partners, showcased its work on legislative costing at a side-event organized during the 12th triennial Conference of pacific Women in the Cook Islands in october 2013. the side- event allowed countries from across the region to learn about the benefits of costing domestic violence laws and provided a platform for women to share their experiences. Both the Marshall Islands and the palau Governments have used the costing exercises to successfully secure funding for the implementation of their laws from within national budgets. palau has also developed a Memoranda of understanding for Government stakeholders to implement the Family protection Act, following the implementation of the roadmap put forth by the costing. strengthening Pacific Parliaments In Fiji, the unDp Regional parliamentary Support project mobilized funding for the next three years to re-engage with the Fiji national parliament secretariat as it prepares for the national elections scheduled for September 2014. noting the fact that there currently exists no parliament secretariat and that the elections could return a number of new Mps with little experience of parliamentary practice, the Fiji parliament project will focus on a number of areas including providing technical assistance to provide for an effective legal framework for the new parliament, staff capacity development, limited infrastructure development and induction sessions for newly elected. the project, with funding secured from the european union, will begin in the first quarter of 2014. In response to requests from national parliaments in the region, workshops were conducted for Mps on financial oversight and the role of the public Accounts Committee (pAC) in Kiribati and Samoa. In the pacific context, pACs are amongst the most important parliamentary Committee, but often face capacity challenges. the workshops addressed the oversight/accountability role of parliament, including lessons from other parliaments; the relationship between the pAC and Auditor-General; as well as the role and powers of the pAC. u n D p pA C I F I C C e n t R e | A n n u A l R e p o R t 2 0 1 3 22 In Kiribati, the workshop also focused on the current legislative framework for the pAC, including, at the request of the Speaker, the conducting of consultations in order to develop a new draft Committees Bill. Subsequently, the Committees Bill has now been developed and is with parliament for consideration in 2014. In Samoa, Mps were also provided with an overview of unCAC as it relates to the working of pACs in general, substantive chapters of unCAC, the review mechanism, and the various unCAC processes. the pacific Centre supported Mps in Kiribati, RMI and tonga to gain a better understanding of and engage on issues of climate change as they relate to their constituencies. this was achieved through the set up and strengthening of parliamentary committees, provision of staffing support to these committees, an increased focus on outreach and consultations as well as increased research capacity on climate change. the second palau Mock Congress for women was also facilitated in September in partnership with the palau Ministry of Community and Cultural Affairs, the olbiil era Kelulau (national parliament, oeK), together with unDp, pIFS, and un Women.

Formal partnerships were forged between unDp and the Inter-parliamentary union (Ipu) during 2013. unDp and Ipu teamed up with the pacific parliamentary partnerships programme of the Australian parliament, to host the pacific parliamentary conference in tonga in october. the conference focused on the professional development needs of Mps, the role of parliaments when engaging with regional issues, as well as on the issue of gender sensitive parliaments and encouraging women\u2019s political participation. through the formal partnership between Ipu and the pacific Centre, Ipu is undertaking formal evaluations of unDp parliamentary projects in Samoa and palau with a view to providing unDp with recommendations on further engagement with the two national parliaments. u n D p pA C I F I C C e n t R e | A n n u A l R e p o R t 2 0 1 3 23 In 2009, only three Pacific Island countries had ratified/acceded to the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), making the Pacific region the least ratified region in the world by country percentage. Since 2010, the Pacific Centre in partnership with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), has led efforts in the Pacific to advance UNCAC ratification/accession and implementation. As of November 2013, a total of 10 Pacific Island countries have ratified/acceded to the Convention (Papua New Guinea 2007, Fiji 2008, Palau 2009, Cook Islands 2011, Marshall Islands 2011, Vanuatu 2011, Federated States of Micronesia 2012, Nauru 2012, Solomon Islands 2012 and Kiribati 2013). 2013 has been a significant year for advancing UNCAC in the Pacific. Kiribati acceded to the Convention in September. Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu completed their UNCAC implementation reviews, with a further seven countries (Cook Islands, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Palau and Solomon Islands), now undergoing review. Six of the seven countries under review have been trained on the UNCAC review process. UNDP/UNODC have also supported awareness raising efforts in Tonga and Samoa to promote UNCAC accession. Training was conducted for parliamentarians and senior Government officials in Kiribati on UNCAC. Awareness raising on UNCAC was also conducted with the Samoan Parliament as well as the Pacific Association of Supreme Audit Institutions (PASAI). More broadly, UNDP/UNODC provided training to the Parliaments of Kiribati and Samoa on public financial oversight as well as supported training for prosecutors in Solomon Islands on corruption prosecution. The joint UNDP/UNODC project is providing a range of support to Pacific Island countries on implementing UNCAC. This includes: support to Papua New Guinea on developing legislation to establish the proposed Independent Commission against Corruption; support to Kiribati, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu to develop/implement Freedom of Information regimes; and awareness raising in Kiribati and Vanuatu on options for developing anti-corruption policies. The Centre and UNODC have also championed South-South cooperation and experience sharing among Pacific Island countries on UNCAC. This includes: facilitating a study tour for the Government of Kiribati to learn from Tonga\u2019s experience on establishing a Freedom of Information regime; enabling representatives from the Governments of Nauru and Kiribati to undertake a placement with the Fiji Financial Intelligence Unit to learn from Fiji\u2019s experience on anti-money laundering; and developing in partnership with PASAI, a pilot staff exchange programme for the Kiribati and Fiji Supreme Audit Institutions.

During 2013 the Centre continued to support regional and country level efforts to respond to the issue of HIV/ AIDS and sexually transmitted infections (StIs). the Centre supported CSos in Vanuatu to use mobile technology to address HIV and StIs; it provided policy advice to SpC\u2019s regional \u2018Sexual Health and Wellbeing Shared Agenda\u2019 and the Global Fund\u2019s new Funding Model Interim grant for the pacific as well as several other initiatives led by unDp country offices such as for example the MDGs Acceleration Framework in tonga (with a focus on nCDs) and the national consultation on trade Related Aspects of Intellectual property Rights and access to medicines in pnG to ensure the country is able to safeguard its access to affordable medicines. Climate Change, energy and environment In 2013, the pacific Centre provided strategic guidance for the formulation of the globally first ever integrated regional Strategy for Disaster and Climate Resilient Development in the pacific (SRDp). this strategy, led by pICs, and guided by the principles of \u2018inclusion\u2019, \u2018leadership\u2019, and \u2018ownership\u2019, was established to allow the pacific to combine and harness the expertise of specialists working in both the disaster risk management and climate change fields. this initiative follows the leadership of pICs, who have already developed Joint national Action plans and other mechanisms for embedding disaster and climate resilience into national development processes. the pacific Centre supported the review of Fiji\u2019s 2006 national energy policy and plan during 2013. From this, a new policy and plan was prepared and a Fiji Sustainable energy for All rapid assessment was undertaken and a gap analysis report prepared. the Centre also provided technical support to tokelau\u2019s sustainable energy programme, household energy surveys in tuvalu and nauru and a climate change capacity development project in Solomon Islands.

Despite its potential, agriculture is not being seen as a viable career option by Pacific youth. In developed countries, the aging farmer demographic is changing with the entry of younger farmers pursuing organic farming. This trend, perhaps encouraged by the potential for organic agriculture is being seen as a viable career option for young people as well as a solution to many current environmental and economic issues. Seeing a potential entry point to address multifaceted issues such as youth unemployment, migration, food security, environmental protection, health and non- communicable diseases by importing sub-standard foods, the UNDP Pacific Centre in collaboration with the regional Secretariat of the Pacific Community and the Pacific Organic and Ethical Trade Community designed a programme to attract young adults in the organic agriculture sector which has both monetary benefits as well as socio-economic implications. On a regional level, UNDP with SPC organized two sub- regional workshops training youth in organic farming which covered 10 Pacific countries. The overall objective of these workshops and practical field trainings was to enhance livelihood opportunities for youth in organic agriculture through training-of-trainers and extension providers from organic associations in sustainable organic production methods. These agricultural extension providers provide ongoing mentoring and support to young farmers and link youth agricultural enterprises to existing organic certification and market chains. Andrew, a farmer from Navuso village in Fiji attended one of the workshops. \u201cI am not an organic farmer but the knowledge I gained at the workshop will immensely help me to move into organic farming in phases. What I liked most about this workshop was that only 30 percent was theory and 70 percent was practical hands-on experience in farms which are our open field labs,\u201d he said. Andrew is a member of Agronet Fiji, a loosely formed small scale farmers association of more than 100 members, and he has confirmed that he will engage in helping young farmers to adopt organic practices particularly in compost making and to grow organic vegetables and fruits. Samoa will be hosting the Small Islands Developing States (SIDS) Conference in September 2014.

Considerable progress has been made across all areas of the programme\u2019s work with a strong focus on technical support and collaborative partnerships with central banks, governments, development partners and the private sector. Policy, Advocacy and Coordination through the partnership with the Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI) pacific Island Working Group (pIWG), pFIp has continued to work closely with pacific Central Bank Governors. In 2013, the activity of pIWG covered the areas of (i) financial inclusion data, (ii) e-money trust arrangements, (iii) implementation of national microinsurance action plans, (iv) supervision of other Deposit taking Institutions and (iv) consumer protection and market conduct. the strength of the working group and its members has played an integral role in shaping the financial inclusion landscape in the pacific. At the fifth AFI Global policy Forum held in September, the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) was awarded the Maya Declaration Award in recognition of its efforts to provide access to financial services for 150,000 unbanked people in Fiji by 2014. At the same Forum, the Bank of papua new Guinea (BpnG) and Central Bank of Samoa (CBS) became the fourth and fifth pIC to sign up to the Maya Declaration Commitments. A significant area of activity in 2013 stemmed from the pIWG endorsed action plans focusing on Microinsurance and what is increasingly becoming termed inclusive insurance, recognizing the need for a range of insurance provisions and products. A second workshop was held for pICs in August 2013 in nadi, Fiji and was supported by AFI, Asian Development Bank and pFIp. It brought together insurance supervisors from five pICs and timor-leste to draft action plans for their respective jurisdiction and identify the key challenges, gaps, and technical assistance requirements across a wide range of topics including inclusive insurance, microinsurance, risk management and on-site supervision. pICs have made significant progress towards the achievement of the money pacific goals. Fiji has met 85 percent of the target of 150,000 people to have access to formal financial services by 2015 and anticipates that it will reach its goal by the end of 2013. Samoa reported that 45,000 people have access to both formal and informal financial services, accounting for 64 percent of the 70,000 to be reached by the end of 2014. Vanuatu in its 2012-2015 national Financial Inclusion Strategy has set a target of 76,000 (50 percent of which will be women) previously un-banked and underserved people. In papua new Guinea, Bank of pnG with technical assistance from pFIp and the Centre for excellence in Financial Inclusion convened stakeholders to build on the priorities for financial inclusion in the Informal economic policy 2011, and establish targets for 2014 and 2015 in the country\u2019s first ever national strategy on financial inclusion and financial literacy. pnG\u2019s goal is to reach one million unbanked people by 2015 with 50 percent to be women. In total, five pICs now have national Financial Inclusion and/or Financial literacy Strategies with active coordinating bodies (Fiji, Samoa, Solomon Islands, pnG and Vanuatu). pFIp hosted the pacific Donors Access to Finance (A2F) working group meeting in nadi in october 2013, a regional forum where all donors engaged in A2F share their activities, achievements and plans for financial inclusion to enable both learning and coordination of activities and resources.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8d62c3fe-446f-4b18-92f1-c9afddfc3637": {"__data__": {"id_": "8d62c3fe-446f-4b18-92f1-c9afddfc3637", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-pacific-centre-2013-annual-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Pacific Centre 2013 Annual Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-pacific-centre-2013-annual-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a68f6fc714a341fe37d2049eea549f9523e5da561c809b79eb38ebb0a697712c"}, "2": {"node_id": "a7f76522-d81b-48e9-8254-0595b13127b2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-pacific-centre-2013-annual-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6c0886453efbda093fe22b0ae9abfdcb4b356f570c46129e7a5bc22ccc63b716"}}, "hash": "3a2ccc8e2b7682e53ec9d04af178e8e61380a23a2324eca6c5c9dd37412f70c5", "text": "KeY HIGHlIGHtS: pacific Financial Inclusion programme u n D p pA C I F I C C e n t R e | A n n u A l R e p o R t 2 0 1 3 28 scalable and replicable Projects the support for pilots and the development of new products and distribution channels continued in 2013, improving access to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "96c58b96-7172-409b-a508-426cd0da8962": {"__data__": {"id_": "96c58b96-7172-409b-a508-426cd0da8962", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-pacific-centre-2013-annual-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Pacific Centre 2013 Annual Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-pacific-centre-2013-annual-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4a3f51c08cc65a5a9edf8000b210d27b406ddd7d14fdf3a3d26404cb5300e338"}, "3": {"node_id": "8bbbb59a-c1a5-4996-a031-c2abe6474ac8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-pacific-centre-2013-annual-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f5bb77e5987461158e84c90b289d7df933e7ec3f718b6fb3fb8b21c27aeefa17"}}, "hash": "32b9122b7f83de42de46eea8dacddc1797618cc8b79ae5821aaee84bb549576b", "text": "financial services in the region. In the first quarter of the year, pFIp reached its programme goal to increase the number of pacific Islanders who have on-going access to quality and affordable financial services by 500,000 by the end 2013. As of 30 September 2013, pFIp partners reportedly have opened 229,667 mobile money accounts and 372,848 new bank accounts for previously unbanked pacific Islanders. pFIp has provided performance-based grants and technical assistance in the areas of product design and partnership formation which has added two microinsurance pilots in the region. In Fiji, this support resulted in the piloting of term life products being offered in a partnership between life Insurance Corporation of India and tISI Sangam (a faith-based organization). In pnG, a low-cost term life product is being coupled with mobile phone accessed bank accounts in a partnership between nationwide Microbank and pacific MMI Insurance. In Solomon Islands, pFIp entered into an agreement with Bank of South pacific (BSp) to implement its rural banking operations. BSp has demonstrated impressive growth in expanding the number of account holders in pnG, growing from 550,000 accounts in 2011 to approximately 1.2 million in 2013. In addition to allowing greater access and usage of services through mobile agents equipped with tablet computers and portable eFtpoS machines, the project provides a \u2018no-maintenance fee\u2019 savings account and mobile phone linked services. pFIp worked closely with IFC, who supported and invested in BSp Rural in pnG, in developing the support. IFC is a co-investor and advisor in the Solomon Islands project. partner Westpac Bank demonstrated dramatic growth with its popular \u2018in-store\u2019 agent banking model throughout the pacific, more than doubling its number of access points from 2012 and adding over 100,000 newly banked clients in the region. Westpac also piloted its mobile phone-based banking services in Solomon Islands, with pacific-wide rollouts planned for 2014. Financial Competency Solomon Islands and pnG prepared their national financial literacy strategies based on the findings of their respective financial competency surveys. the Fiji financial literacy strategy was also approved by Cabinet. the national strategies will provide strengthened coordination of national and donor efforts as well as setting time- bound targets. this brings to four countries in the region which have now prepared national financial literacy strategies. the phased rollout of the Fiji financial education (Fined) curriculum across all schools in Fiji started in April. A monitoring exercise of 204 schools in november has identified well-informed actions to further strengthen the breadth and quality of implementation, which will benefit up to 200,000 students annually. It continues to be a global best practice, which has attracted much international attention. Senior education and central bank officials from Vanuatu made an in-depth study visit to Fiji during the year and have begun to review their national curriculum with the aim of introducing financial education in schools. Multi-stakeholder Financial literacy Working Groups were formed in Solomon Islands and Vanuatu and are overseeing the implementation of the financial literacy action plans. the importance of financial literacy in achieving greater financial inclusion was given prominence at the annual South pacific Central Bank Governors Meeting this year. the four main regional commercial banks operating in the pacific have developed their own financial literacy training programmes. one bank, in partnership with pFIp, has made financial literacy an integral part of its sustainability strategy. u n D p pA C I F I C C e n t R e | A n n u A l R e p o R t 2 0 1 3 29 Knowledge gathering and Knowledge sharing Generating and providing opportunities for learning and sharing knowledge has been central to the growing momentum achieved in the area of financial inclusion in the pacific. pFIp was the lead sponsor of the 2013 pacific Microfinance Week (pMW) held in nadi, Fiji in october 2013. the event, a bi-annual gathering, brought together more than 160 financial sector stakeholders from the pacific and further afield to share knowledge, examples of best practice and provided an opportunity to build and strengthen relationships. pFIp was involved in presenting and hosting panel sessions and also held workshops on the implementation of the financial education curriculum in Fiji. pFIp also provided learning opportunities for members of microfinance organizations and those working in the area of financial inclusion during 2013.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8bbbb59a-c1a5-4996-a031-c2abe6474ac8": {"__data__": {"id_": "8bbbb59a-c1a5-4996-a031-c2abe6474ac8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-pacific-centre-2013-annual-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Pacific Centre 2013 Annual Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-pacific-centre-2013-annual-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4a3f51c08cc65a5a9edf8000b210d27b406ddd7d14fdf3a3d26404cb5300e338"}, "2": {"node_id": "96c58b96-7172-409b-a508-426cd0da8962", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-pacific-centre-2013-annual-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "32b9122b7f83de42de46eea8dacddc1797618cc8b79ae5821aaee84bb549576b"}}, "hash": "f5bb77e5987461158e84c90b289d7df933e7ec3f718b6fb3fb8b21c27aeefa17", "text": "Members from microfinance organizations were supported to attend pMW and seven representatives from pacific countries attended training at the Boulder Institute for Microfinance in turin, Italy.

To witness the passion that drives some of the advocates who are taking on such an initiative is impressive. It is even more inspirational to learn about how this passion translates into learning around personal money management and investment in the classroom. Sabeto Central School can be found after a 10 minute drive down Sabeto Road, between Nadi and Lautoka in Fiji\u2019s Western Division. Established in 1918, the school was recently renamed, Sabeto Central School and has one stream of classes from Kindergarten to Class 8, with a roll of 240 students. Led by Head Teacher Abhinash Raj, the teaching body of the school has taken a proactive approach to introducing FinEd in the classroom across a number of class levels after attending the Ministry of Education-led training on FinEd for schools across the country. Sabeto Central School developed a plan to introduce financial education in its classrooms in 2013. Mr Raj explained the school\u2019s approach to financial education, \u201cFinancial education is transforming the lives of students and their families. The Sabeto Central School family has learnt a lot through FinEd this year. Education around managing the money in one\u2019s pocket presents a valuable opportunity for learning for our students and a means of equipping them to interact positively with the world around them in an everyday context.\u201d Sanjana Ram is a Class 8 Teacher of the school and school-appointed FinEd Coordinator for the school. She is also a proud parent with twins in Class 4 and a son in Class 1. Mrs Ram was the school\u2019s representative to the FinEd teacher training held by the Ministry\u2019s Curriculum Advisory Services in late 2012. After attending the Ministry-led FinEd training, Mrs Ram returned to Sabeto Central excited about FinEd and its potential in the classroom. With guidance from Class 1 teacher Paulini Tudreu, formerly of Nadi Airport School, a FinEd Champion School, Mrs Ram held teacher training for her colleagues within the school. This year, in recognizing that financial education is not a separate subject, Sabeto Central School introduced FinEd in the classroom in English, Mathematics and Social Studies/Science. Mrs Ram is excited about FinEd especially after observing her students\u2019 and her own children\u2019s enthusiasm for the learning around personal money management and investment. While acknowledging that there is room for improvement in implementation, she noted however, that \u201cAs teachers we need to start somewhere. This programme is important to our students. Everyday our students and our own children handle money and make money decisions. We must teach them how to manage their money on a daily basis and for the future, how to save, how to spend wisely and how to share - the three \u2018S\u2019 of financial education. There is a lot more that we can do to cover the learning outcomes, but we must start somewhere.\u201d This year, Mrs Ram introduced learning around personal money management in English and Social Science. She indicated that when teaching financial education she observed her children learning best with the hands- on activities that were provided. They especially enjoyed \u2018Aaja\u2019s Letter\u2019 a lesson structured around budgeting, cash-flow, saving and financial goals, spending wisely, foreign exchange rates and how to use these for a young boy who is planning to visit his cousin and grandmother who reside overseas. The lesson was delivered as part of Mrs Ram\u2019s Social Science class, where she also took the opportunity to teach her students about the world around us and a neighbouring country. She shared the practical experiences by her students and her observations of their use and management of money after learning. After learning about money and its management, students were noted to be more cautious with how they used their money and where they kept it. This cautiousness has been particularly observed at the school canteen.

Mrs. Ram noted that in addition several of her students diligently saved small amounts regularly over Term 3, to assist their families with the cost of the class end-of-year excursion to Sigatoka. She added that these students and their experiences with small amounts of money were an inspiration to the teachers. Mrs. Rama credits the dedication of the Head Teacher and the teaching body for their FinEd achievements this year. FinEd Fiji was rolled out nationally in April 2013 after national teacher training held by the Ministry of Education over the period 2012 to 2013. The nationwide implementation means that 197,000 students around the country are now learning about personal money management and investment from Class 1 to Form 6. FinED Fiji has generated strong interest from the Pacific and worldwide. This ground-breaking initiative is funded by the Australian Government and is jointly managed by the Ministry of Education and PFIP. A Nadi Airport School student shows what she\u2019s learnt during her financial education classes to UNDP\u2019s Deputy Assistant Administrator Nicholas Rosellini.

Since then, the countries of Asia and the Pacific have been working hard to achieve these goals. Some have been very successful; others have made less progress. Bringing all countries within reach of the goals will require increased commitment and determination at the national, regional and global levels. Many countries have prepared their own reports on progress towards the MDGs \u2013 and there have also been assessments at the global level. To supplement these, ESCAP, UNDP and ADB have formed a partnership, capitalizing on our particular areas of expertise, to present a regional picture \u2013 analysing the trends in MDG achievement across Asia and the Pacific and exploring the policy implications at both the national and regional levels. This tripartite initiative by a United Nations regional commission (ESCAP), a United Nations agency (UNDP) and a regional development bank (ADB) is the first of its kind in the world \u2013 and we are proud that it is referred to globally as a \u201cbest practice\u201d. It ensures a common voice on the MDGs in the region, helps build a consolidated regional platform and presents a clear plan of action for their achievement. The report is the second in a series. The first, published in 2003, was subtitled Meeting the Challenges of Poverty Reduction. It gave an initial picture of progress towards the goals, focusing particularly on national policies for poverty reduction and on the potential for partnerships at the global level. This Report updates and extends that analysis. Using the latest data, the Report tracks each country or territory\u2019s progress in each of the MDG targets and assesses whether it will achieve that target by 2015. The results reveal a mixed picture. Some countries are evidently making good progress on the poverty target, but many seem destined to miss other important targets related to health and the environment. The Report argues for change, not just for making substantial investments in key areas, but also for carrying out major institutional changes at the local, national and regional levels to make the development process fairer and more inclusive. In particular, it advocates for changes that could lead to better provision of public services, and highlights emerging and new patterns of regional cooperation that could have high pay-offs for the MDGs. We hope that this report will be a critical input to the United Nations General Assembly Millennium Summit +5 in September 2005. It provides a comprehensive regional picture for the Summit and helps to ensure that the interests of the region\u2019s 3.9 billion people are represented. We hope that for all stakeholders in the region this Report will also become a key resource in our efforts to inform and mobilize support for MDG achievement.

In the first chapter, it takes advantage of far more data than were available previously to present a much fuller picture on the state of progress. In the second chapter it adds to the earlier analysis of na- tional options by considering this time not just changes in policies but changes in national institutions that can accelerate progress towards the MDGs, particularly for the delivery of services. Finally, in the third chapter, it looks more closely at one of the most potent forms of international cooperation \u2013 between the countries in the region. Tracking progress Asia and the Pacific is one of the world\u2019s most dynamic regions, so it should come as no surprise that the report finds this region has made rapid progress to- wards many of the MDGs. But not all the developing countries in Asia and the Pacific are making sufficient progress; indeed none are currently on track to meet all the goals by 2015.

For each target, the report places each country in one of four categories. \ufffd \u2013 Early achiever \u2013 Has already met the target \u2013 On track \u2013 Expected to hit the target by 2015 Overview This is the second in a series of regional reports on the MDGs. The first was published in 2003 as Promoting the Millennium Devel- opment Goals in Asia and Pacific: Meeting the Challenges of Pov- erty Reduction. As well as assessing the progress across the region it looked at the kind of pro-poor policies that would be needed to achieve the goals and also at the prospects for creating global partnerships. \ufffd \u2013 Off track \u2013 Slow \u2013 Expected to hit the tar- get, but after 2015 \u2013 Off track \u2013 Regressing \u2013 Slipping backwards, or stagnating Goal 1 \u2013 Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger On the poverty target, the Asian and Pacific region has made dramatic progress. Between 1990 and 2001 in the 23 countries offering sufficient data (out of a total of 55) the proportion of people living on less than $1 per day fell from 31 to 20 per cent. Despite population growth, the absolute number of poor people also fell \u2013 from 931 to 679 million. A slightly different picture emerges, however, when considering the results of national poverty data: for the 13 countries for which data are available the poverty rate also fell, though less dramatically \u2013 from 21.3 to 19.4 per cent. On either basis, Asia and the Pacific\u2019s overall poverty reduction will inevitably be swayed by the achievements of China and India \u2013 and both are well on track, as are 17 other countries. The countries having the most difficulty appear to be Armenia, Bangladesh, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Mongolia. The second target under this goal is to halve the pro- portion of people who suffer from hunger. For 27 countries, the proportion of people consuming less \ufffd \ufffd OVERVIEW 1 A FUTURE WITHIN REACH than the minimum dietary energy requirement fell be- tween the early 1990s and 2001, but only slightly \u2013 from 18.7 to 15.1 per cent. The worst situation is in Tajikistan with 61 per cent of the population hungry, followed by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Ko- rea with 36 per cent. Another important indicator is child malnutrition which is disturbingly high in a num- ber of countries: 48 per cent of children are under- nourished in Nepal, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, for example, and 47 per cent in India. Goal 2 \u2013 Achieve universal primary education Here progress has been good. Most countries in the region have primary enrolment ratios above 80 per cent, and many above 90 per cent. Of the 33 countries with sufficient data available to estimate a trend, 8 have already achieved the target, and 11 others are on track to do so. However, dropout rates can also be high. In Papua New Guinea, for example, around half of chil- dren drop out before grade five and in India, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Myanmar more than one third do so. Another measure of success is the primary completion rate, which for the region as a whole between 1998 and 2001 rose from 89 to 93 per cent \u2013 though this gives an over-optimistic picture since the number of graduates is swollen by over-age children. Goal 3 \u2013 Promote gender equality and empower women Progress on eliminating gender disparity in education has been good, but progress in participation and em- powerment needs to be accelerated. The target under this goal focuses on eliminating gender disparity at all levels of education. At the primary level, of the 38 countries or territories with data available, 26 have already achieved the target and 5 are on track to do so. Bangladesh and China have made particularly rapid progress. Of the 5 countries that are regressing, the most serious situations are in Afghanistan, where be- tween 1990 and 1999 the ratio between girls\u2019 and boys\u2019 primary enrolment fell dramatically, from 0.55 to 0.08, though the situation has probably since improved, and in Pakistan, where the proportion has stalled at 0.74. At the secondary level the situation also seems positive. Across the region, between 1990 and 2001 the ratio of girls to boys at the secondary level increased from 0.73 to 0.87. Of the 36 countries with relevant data, 25 have already achieved the target, and even countries such as Pakistan and Nepal with very low ratios have been making progress so fast that they are on track.

Of the 27 countries with the necessary data, 15 have already achieved the target, while 5 others are on track; indeed in tertiary education a number of countries have more females than males. Goal 4 \u2013 Reduce child mortality Here the picture is mixed. The first target is to reduce the under-5 mortality rate by two thirds. For this indica- tor the 47 countries with data available divide into two halves. Half have already achieved their targets \u2013 and all have child mortality rates below 45 per 1,000 live births. The other half, however, are in a very different position: only 4 are on track to meet the target, 14 are off track, making progress too slowly, while 3 are regressing. In 2003, the largest number of child deaths was in India, 2.3 million, followed by China, 650,000, and Pakistan, 481,000. Of these countries only China has been making sufficient progress; both India and Paki- stan are moving too slowly. The most shocking rate, however, is in Afghanistan with 257 deaths per 1,000 live births: one child in four dies before reaching the age of 5. As child mortality rates come down, the majority of deaths take place in the earliest years, months, and even days, of life. Overall therefore, the pattern for infant mortality is similar to that of the under-5 mortality Goal 5 \u2013 Improve maternal health Here too progress has been far too slow. The target is to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by three quarters between 1990 and 2015, but the ratio in the average Asian developing country has only declined from 395 to 342. Even more alarming, of the 42 countries for which data are available, maternal mortality has gone up in 22. Around two thirds of Asian maternal deaths, 164,000, take place in India and Pakistan, both among the regressing countries. The highest maternal mortal- ity rates per 100,000 live births are, however, in Af- ghanistan (1,900), Nepal (740) and Timor-Leste (660). Each year, across the region around one quarter of a million women die as a result of a normal life cycle event: pregnancy and childbirth. Almost all these deaths could be avoided if mothers had routine obstet- ric care and access to emergency obstetric care. Goal 6 \u2013 Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases HIV/AIDS is also an area of great concern. The target is to have halted and begun to reverse the spread of the epidemic by 2015. Overall, however, the region is off track: between 2001 and 2003 the prevalence among those aged 15-49 in the average Asian country rose from 0.39 to 0.45 per cent. As of 2004, the Asia-Pacific region has over 9 million people living with HIV/ AIDS and each year half a million people die. 2 The highest prevalences among adults aged 15-49 are all in South-East Asia: Cambodia, 2.6 per cent; Thailand, 1.5 per cent; and Myanmar, 1.2 per cent \u2013 though the first two of these have already achieved their MDG targets, since they have reduced the prevalence. The highest numbers of infected people, however, are to be found in India and the Russian Federation, where the prevalence is rising. China has kept the prevalence fairly stable, so can be considered \u201con track\u201d. There are also worries about malaria. Although there are insufficient data to calculate trends, in some coun- tries the disease seems to be making a comeback. The highest prevalences are in the Pacific, notably Solomon Islands, where the disease affects 15 per cent of the population. The largest number of people sick are in Indonesia, with 1.9 million people infected. The largest number of deaths are in India \u2013 more than 30,000 each year. The highest death rate, however, is in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. Tuberculosis too remains a major concern, though in this case the region is making progress: between 1990 and 2003 the number of people infected declined from 12.8 to 10.3 million and the number of people dying each year fell from 1.1 to 1.0 million. The largest number of people infected in 2003 were in the most populous countries: China, 3.2 million; India, 3.1 mil- lion; and Indonesia, 1.5 million. All three are, however, making progress. Goal 7 \u2013 Ensure environmental sustainability The first target is to integrate the principles of sustain- able development into country policies and pro- grammes. Based on their progress in preparing national sustainable development strategies, of the 55 Asia-Pacific developing countries only 5 are early achievers and 10 are on track. This goal also aims to reverse the loss of environmental resources.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "703a1fe6-9de2-411b-8177-919326d387fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "703a1fe6-9de2-411b-8177-919326d387fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Future within Reach", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d68b5e3da5fa6470afa9839f506d0dff1e5d06642aa202abeef768f07d9cc5f3"}}, "hash": "d68b5e3da5fa6470afa9839f506d0dff1e5d06642aa202abeef768f07d9cc5f3", "text": "Here the picture is also mixed: over the period 1990-2000, in the 48 countries reporting data the proportion of land forested increased in 13, remained unchanged in 17 and decreased in 18. The most rapid rates of defores- tation have been in Micronesia, Myanmar, Indonesia and Malaysia. Another environmental indicator is carbon dioxide emissions. Between 1990 and 2002, average per capita emissions increased across the region from 2.2 to 2.5 tons. Of the 50 countries for which data are available, 30 are regressing, while 20 have become early achievers as a result of deliberate policy, or like many of the Central Asian countries, because of a reduction in industrial output. A further important target is to halve the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation. For urban water supplies, of the 40 countries offering data, 31 are early achievers or on track and even those that are regressing, nevertheless, had achieved quite high values. The situation in the rural areas is quite different, with coverage typically 10 to 20 percentage points lower. Nevertheless, here too there has been progress: of the 34 countries with data available, 11 are early achievers and 5 are on track, though 18 are off track, of which 11 are regressing. Access to improved sanitation is also far better in urban than rural areas \u2013 73 against 31 per cent. Indicators and countries of major concern This report groups each indicator into one of four clusters, according to the proportion of countries that are having some success with that indicator and also the severity of underachievement. On this basis the indicators of greatest concern would be those related to the national poverty line, rural water supplies, infant and under-5 mortality, malnutrition and primary enrol- ment. Maternal mortality too should be a priority, since even in the on-track countries the average rate is still unacceptably high. For these indicators, the report also identifies 19 countries that should be of greatest con- cern. Subregions and levels of development Countries even in the same subregion may have similar characteristics but perform differently on the MDGs. This is evident from looking at the proportion of indicators for which each country is off track. Within these subregions it is also important to consider differ- ent categories of countries: least developed countries (LDCs), landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) and small island developing States (SIDS). \u2022 South and South-West Asia \u2013 This is the poorest performing subregion: the only one in which a majority of its countries, 6 out of 10, are off track for more than one third of the indicators. The slow progress here is largely because this region includes 4 of the LDCs \u2013 3 of which are also landlocked and 1 of which is a small island devel- oping State. \u2022 North and Central Asia \u2013 This region has a high proportion of LLDCs. Here the countries of greatest concern are Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Armenia. The first two have high and increasing rates of malnutrition. Education standards have also slipped and the virtual collapse of the social sector in some countries has resulted in a general deterioration of health indicators. OVERVIEW 3 A FUTURE WITHIN REACH \u2022 Pacific \u2013 The majority of these countries are SIDS. Fewer than half have data for the majority of indicators: none offer any information on poverty or hunger and few on education or gender. Papua New Guinea has more information, which indi- cates that on most indicators it is off track. Many Pacific countries have problems with water sup- plies and sanitation. \u2022 South-East Asia \u2013 This includes some of the more prosperous countries in the region \u2013 along with some of the LDCs so it is no surprise that success in the MDGs largely reflects this division \u2013 with Timor-Leste as the least successful and Singapore the most. Like Myanmar, Timor-Leste also has high infant mortality rates, and along with the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Indonesia, the Phil- ippines and Viet Nam unacceptably high rates of maternal mortality. This subregion also has severe environmental problems: forest coverage is disap- pearing and carbon dioxide emissions per head are rising rapidly. \u2022 East and North-East Asia \u2013 China is on track for \u2013 or has already achieved \u2013 three quarters of the indicators. Mongolia, however, has struggled with most of the MDGs. For the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea it is difficult to assess progress since data are missing on almost half the indica- tors. Gender disparities in MDG achievement National data often mask wide disparities between males and females. The MDGs do address education disparities under", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "70622229-aee2-4381-a875-60a09783944d": {"__data__": {"id_": "70622229-aee2-4381-a875-60a09783944d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Future within Reach", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "57e0f7675a4ddcbf4994e8f1c1105e853ccb3a143b2cabdfb12fc765cfc85fc0"}}, "hash": "57e0f7675a4ddcbf4994e8f1c1105e853ccb3a143b2cabdfb12fc765cfc85fc0", "text": "Goal 3. But there are many other dimensions of gender disparity. For health, for ex- ample, one of the clearest indicators is life expectancy. Women have a biological advantage that should on average enable them to live four or five years longer than men. Of the 46 countries in the region with the necessary data, 18 had a life expectancy gap of less than four years. Of these same countries, 10 also show infant mortality rates that are abnormally high for girls. For both indicators some of the most severe problems are in South Asia. An important measure of women\u2019s empowerment is the extent of their participation in the labour force. Women\u2019s share of employment is lower than men\u2019s in every country. Moreover, women are clearly far less likely than men to be working as managers, or running their own businesses. They are also less likely to be legislators or senior officials and managers. Women also make up only a small proportion of members of national parliaments. Subnational disparities Most countries, particularly the large ones, also display significant subnational disparities. In the Philippines, for example, where the national poverty rate is 16 per cent the regional rates vary from 8 to 63 per cent. Similarly, in Indonesia, while the national child malnu- trition rate is 26 per cent the regional rates vary from 18 to 40 per cent. In India too there are often signifi- cant differences in MDG achievement between the better-off and poorer states. Poverty rates, for ex- ample, ranged from less than 10 per cent in the richest states to well above 40 per cent in the two poorest states, Orissa and Bihar. Country averages may there- fore disguise the fact that a number of areas within countries are significantly off track while others are on track. Attempting to help countries to attain their MDG targets in terms of national averages may there- fore leave vast numbers of the poor and needy behind. Rethinking service delivery If the countries in Asia and the Pacific are to achieve the MDGs they will undoubtedly need to invest suffi- cient resources. But just as important they will need to change how they do things. They will need to develop the necessary skills and capacity and ensure that their national and local institutions fit the needs and aspira- tions of the twenty-first century. Institutions in this sense refer not just to specific organizations, govern- mental or non-governmental, but also to \u201crules\u201d, for- mal and informal, that lead to patterns of behaviour \u2013 cultural, economic and social. Governments have a role in reforming their domestic institutions, so that they can better meet their responsibilities \u2013 and fulfil their promise in the Millennium Declaration to com- mit themselves to creating an environment \u201cconducive to development and to the elimination of poverty\u201d. One of the most direct ways in which Governments can address poverty \u2013 and meet the MDGs \u2013 is there- fore by ensuring adequate basic services, either provid- ing them directly or sustaining a framework for provi- sion through the private sector or civil society. Making services available The first task is to ensure that public services are physically in place. A rights-based approach demands that everyone be covered; in practice, however, there are trade-offs as Governments weigh up how much they are prepared to spend. And even when services are equally close to everyone their location affects some groups more than others \u2013 particularly women. Women tend to use health services, for example, on a more continuous basis than men and are also more affected by poor water supplies, because they are the 4 greatest users and typically have to fetch the family\u2019s water. Inadequate sanitation is a serious problem for all, but more so for women and girls, who need more privacy than men. Quality Even if facilities are in place the quality may be low \u2013 typically with deficiencies in terms of staff or supplies or in standards of supervision or quality control. A regular problem is the difficulty of recruiting staff to work in remote schools or clinics. Rural facilities also often run short of supplies. Another common issue is that services are inappropriate to local needs: children in minority ethnic groups, for example, often have to learn in what might be their second or even third language. Providing good-quality services that are cost-effective is therefore a challenge. Insisting rigidly on national standards that can only be provided for a limited num- ber of people will penalize those who are left out. It is better therefore to take a more flexible approach that can bring quality", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aca9e0e9-49b0-4412-8b96-3210da897427": {"__data__": {"id_": "aca9e0e9-49b0-4412-8b96-3210da897427", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Future within Reach", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a4d3ea2c8c20ca0c69ac18275f470647f8aba71848f150e44bc36b6947a38450"}}, "hash": "a4d3ea2c8c20ca0c69ac18275f470647f8aba71848f150e44bc36b6947a38450", "text": "basic services within reach of scat- tered populations, while planning for upgrades over time. Economic barriers Many people are unable to access services because they cannot afford them. This is most evident in private sector provision, but even government-provided ser- vices that are ostensibly free can turn out to be expen- sive. Thus, while in most countries primary education is free, parents will find themselves paying many supplementary charges. And patients in a \u201cfree\u201d health system may actually have to pay informal fees to nurses or doctors to receive treatment. In addition there are opportunity costs. If people have to travel a long dis- tance, for example, or queue for hours, to use a free service they will lose valuable income-earning oppor- tunities or work time. And poor families will also have to take into account the opportunity cost of sending their children to school. Legal barriers Many children in the poorest families do not have birth certificates and find it more difficult to get access to school or to free health services. In East Asia and the Pacific 19 per cent of births are unregistered, while for South Asia the proportion rises to 63 per cent. House- holds, particularly those of migrants, may also lack other important documents: thus unregistered squatter families who lack building permits or a legal address will find that they cannot be connected to an urban water supply. Sociocultural barriers Services in principle are available to all, but certain groups typically get inferior treatment, or are excluded altogether. Women form the largest category. Females even from birth can have less access to health services in countries that show a strong preference for sons. Girls too have historically been less likely to be sent to school. Ethnic minorities also often have less access to services than the rest of the population. And people who have contracted HIV/AIDS can face discrimina- tion when it comes to the use of health or education services. Also likely to be excluded are many of the 200 million people in the region living with disabilities. Other groups whose behaviour is either considered socially unacceptable or is illegal \u2013 which could include men who have sex with men, injecting drug users or sex workers \u2013 may also face barriers in getting access to services. Political barriers Deciding levels of service provision is essentially a process of political negotiation. Governments will de- cide what they can afford and who will get priority \u2013 while citizens will try to claim their rights to services to which they are being denied access. Generally, how- ever, this process of negotiation tends to exclude the poorest citizens living in remote areas; they may not even know what their rights are, still less be in a posi- tion to assert them. How can the rights of the poor be fulfilled? One of the most general requirements is a high standard of governance \u2013 to ensure that public services are deliv- ered in an efficient, transparent and honest fashion. But a number of institutional changes will be needed to extend services to the whole of the population. Broadening the range of providers One change would be to increase the delivery options. In most countries the main provider \u2013 particularly of health, education and water supplies \u2013 is the Govern- ment and where it does indeed provide good service it should continue to do so. Where it cannot do so, however, it should consider involving others, including the private sector and community groups Private provision is often extensive in health care, but less so in education and in water supplies. But in both cases it is rising. In recent years there have been a series of partial privatizations of water supplies \u2013 in addition to the provision by informal water sellers in largely urban settlements. Large-scale public-private partner- ships for water supplies have had mixed results for the poor, but it is also possible to create less formal part- OVERVIEW 5 A FUTURE WITHIN REACH nerships, where the public sector can help to create a demand for services that the private sector can meet. This has been demonstrated in sanitation, for example, which has a soft component in raising awareness for behaviour change and a hard component in the provi- sion of systems. Many civil society organizations have stepped in, either to fill the gaps or to provide alternative models. A number of Governments have worked in partnerships with NGOs to extend public services. In Bangladesh, for example, the NGO BRAC works with the National TB Programme and in Cambodia, too, there have been successful experiments of contracting", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "47755d6e-db86-43b6-aed6-fbf18df563f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "47755d6e-db86-43b6-aed6-fbf18df563f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Future within Reach", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "128794bb7d68e6375f913e3193edcb6c5ddcebcf3fd0c1bb4482734325c32e47"}}, "hash": "128794bb7d68e6375f913e3193edcb6c5ddcebcf3fd0c1bb4482734325c32e47", "text": "health delivery in remote areas to NGOs. In addition, Governments have been able to enter into partnerships with commu- nity organizations. Overcoming economic access barriers Most Governments agree that everyone should have access to primary education, basic health care and ad- equate water and sanitation and that costs to house- holds should not be a barrier. The simplest option is to supply all such services free: for example, most coun- tries do not charge formal fees for primary education. Alternatively, since general subsidies are expensive, Governments can provide subsidies, some of which can be targeted at the poor. As well as reducing the direct costs, Governments can also try to reduce opportunity costs \u2013 particularly the time taken to reach them. The most direct way of doing this is by extending the network of services to bring them closer to communities. But it is also pos- sible to consider mobile services, such as satellite clin- ics, that might reach distant villages once a month. Removing legal barriers For birth certificates a number of countries have also engaged in registration drives. For other documents, such as those related to property one option is to integrate existing extra-legal agreements into a single formal system. Governments can also review the regu- lations on service provision to identify those elements \u2013 whether laws, regulations, standards or procedures \u2013 that tend to exclude the poor. Making services more appropriate Services should also be adapted to local needs. In schools, for example, teachers should carry out most lessons in the local language and also consult with parents on, for example, the most appropriate school timetables and vacation periods. In addition, children and young adults who have missed out on primary education should have the option of attending non- formal schools. Health systems too can be better adapted to local needs if local people, and particularly women, are closely involved in planning and implementation. Empowering users The best way to ensure that local services are appropri- ate and effective is to empower the users. This will necessitate new institutions as well as new ways of working within existing organizations. NGOs have of- ten served as catalysts in this process \u2013 adopting a rights-based approach as \u201cclaim-making\u201d organizations for the poor. Community involvement should also ex- tend to implementation. When there are public works to be carried out, such as the building of new schools, communities should be able to adopt their own ap- proach and choose the contractors. In order to hold the Government accountable they also need more informa- tion generally about government performance \u2013 disag- gregated by sex, region, income and ethnic group. All this will only be possible, however, if communities have the capacity for this degree of supervision and monitor- ing. They should therefore be able to benefit from education and other capacity-building programmes. Decentralization and local governance Services work best if they are under democratic local control. Many Governments have been carrying out programmes of decentralization that can improve de- livery of services to the poor. However, there are also risks that decentralization may actually exacerbate in- equality and that services will deteriorate because local people do not have the capacity to manage them. De- centralization therefore needs to be accompanied by a realistic assessment of community dynamics and an effective process of capacity-building as well as re- source allocation to subnational levels to match the increased responsibility. An adaptive approach To deliver services to all, Governments should con- sider an adaptive approach that can extend coverage to all. This will require a series of institutional changes: 1. Broaden the range of providers \u2013 Governments should identify all the options, public, private and non- governmental, and plan for a combination of ser- vice deliverers. In addition to providing, Govern- ments should also concentrate more on facilitating. 2. Establish standards \u2013 Governments should establish key national standards with adaptations for local conditions. 3. Plan linkages and upgrades \u2013 Different levels of services should always be interlinked so that users can move from non-formal to formal education, for example. 6 And there should be a long-term strategy of upgrad- ing \u2013 replacing paramedics with fully trained health workers, for example, or replacing rural tap-stands with regular piped water supplies. 4. Devise relevant regulations \u2013 The regulatory framework should be relevant, realistic and responsive to local conditions, while being sufficiently dynamic to adapt to ever-changing realities. 5. Keep learning \u2013 Governments should constantly gather the necessary data and experience, and dis- seminate and use them at all levels \u2013 local, national and international. 6.

Service provision thus needs to be much more open and transparent, with appropriate channels for public consultation and involvement. Working together \u2013 opportunities for regional cooperation Most institutional changes to promote the MDGs will need to take place at the national level. Nevertheless there are also opportunities, particularly in the Asia- Pacific context, for concerted international action not just at the global level but also at the regional level \u2013 through South-South cooperation in the pursuit of what might be termed \u201cinternational public goods\u201d, such as open trading systems and clean air. By analogy countries can also work together to eliminate \u201cinterna- tional public bads\u201d such as pollution, communicable diseases or trafficking in persons. 1. Institutional change to gain more resources Countries that are off track on many MDG indicators often lack the necessary finance for augmenting growth and providing the poor with greater opportuni- ties to escape poverty. Greater global and regional co- operation can increase the resources at their disposal in a number of ways: by expanding trade, increasing for- eign direct investment and giving official development assistance. Increasingly, the developing countries of Asia and the Pacific have been intensifying trade between them- selves. But they could expand this still further if they dismantled trade barriers. Surprisingly, a number of countries in the region apply higher tariffs to goods coming from the developing countries in Asia and the Pacific than they do to imports from the rest of the world. Also, rather than making bilateral agreements they should put more effort into implementing the existing subregional ones. The least developed coun- tries could boost trade by collectively agreeing to lower their import duties on capital and intermediate goods. Better transport infrastructure would also help, so countries should work more closely together on projects such as the Asian Highway. Much international trade within the region is linked with FDI. While FDI is generally welcome, the recipi- ents can maximize the benefits by ensuring better terms. For mining and other natural resource invest- ments, for example, the least developed countries should agree on measures of site restoration, as well as negotiating complementary investments such as rural electrification that will benefit local communities. Some of the middle-income and even lower-income countries in the region also transfer funds to the least developed countries in the form of ODA. India, China and Thailand are the leading donors to a number of LDCs in the region, and since they give most of their aid for infrastructure, hydroelectricity, health, educa- tion and agriculture \u2013 they can make a positive contri- bution to the MDGs. Clearly, intraregional ODA has considerable potential for boosting the MDGs still further. Corresponding to the declarations of the OECD donors, all countries in the region should now aim to increase their ODA for the landlocked and low-income countries of the region to 0.7 per cent of GDP \u2013 and regularly publish infor- mation on such assistance. 2. Encouraging Asian monetary cooperation The Asian financial crisis of 1997-1999 was a serious setback for the MDGs. Millions were thrown into the ranks of the poor overnight and Governments found themselves unable to provide basic services for the poor. Countries should therefore consider how they can cooperate to prevent a future crisis of this scale. For this purpose they could create alternatives to as- sistance from the International Monetary Fund through regional monetary cooperation. The region has built up reserves of around $3 trillion \u2013 offering the opportunity to create such facilities. And given the growing scale of intraregional trade, the time is now ripe for such cooperation; China in particular would have a great interest in preventing another monetary meltdown. A number of initiatives have already prepared the groundfor regional monetary coopera- tion. As well as using the accumulated reserves to ensure monetary stability, it should also be possible to use some of these funds for productive investment, par- ticularly in the region\u2019s infrastructure. OVERVIEW 7 A FUTURE WITHIN REACH 3. Regularizing labour migration Nowadays many more of the region\u2019s migrant workers are going not to the Middle East but to the faster- growing countries in Asia and the Pacific \u2013 where they help to meet rising demand for unskilled and semi- skilled labour. Labour migration has many potential benefits for the MDGs \u2013 helping to increase growth and thus reduce poverty in both source and destination countries. The migrants\u2019 families benefit directly through substantial remittances that they can use not just for day-to-day survival, but for investing in the health and education of their children. Given the scale of migration and the flows", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2c72f158-7f79-48c7-b7f2-fb71260de727": {"__data__": {"id_": "2c72f158-7f79-48c7-b7f2-fb71260de727", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Future within Reach", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "88ef6baff1c1ff9b8eb77bcf642cb1b7e2190fffd7a28a590d4a3b15d3552231"}}, "hash": "88ef6baff1c1ff9b8eb77bcf642cb1b7e2190fffd7a28a590d4a3b15d3552231", "text": "of remit- tances, and the likelihood that they will persist for some years to come, the challenge for Governments is to make best use of them \u2013 maximizing the benefits for both source and destination countries while minimiz- ing the risks for migrants and their families, through better regional cooperation on laws and institutions that improve social protection for migrants. One of the most important steps would be to make realistic assess- ments of the needs for migrant labour and ensure that this demand is met through legal channels. 4. Creating an Asia-Pacific grain security system National Governments have the primary responsibility for the food security that is essential for keeping hun- ger at bay. Nevertheless, countries in the region can also cooperate for this purpose. They can, for example, make investments in and share information on tech- nology and marketing \u2013 with joint ventures to boost productivity to usher in a \u201csecond green revolution\u201d in the Asian and Pacific region. They should also be able to cooperate on quality control, including protocols for GM foods. In addition, they can remove various forms of protection and segmentation so as to permit farmers both to sell on their local markets and to export. And they can also improve roads and other transport infrastructure to allow for the more efficient distribution of grains around the region. One major new initiative would be to establish an Asia- Pacific International Grain Bank (APIGB). Initial fi- nancing for the Bank could come from the accumu- lated foreign currency reserves. Countries could then either purchase grains from the Bank, or borrow for later repayment in comparable grains or in hard cur- rency. APIGB could also incorporate some of the elements of a grain market, with a credit system and spot and futures transactions. In addition the countries of the region could establish early warning systems to notify each other of risks to food security from natural and man-made disasters, for example, or of likely volatility in international grain markets. 5. Tackling the HIV/AIDS pandemic and other diseases Many countries have been surprisingly slow to address the HIV/AIDS pandemic. In addition to stepping up action at the national level they can also supplement these efforts through cooperation via regional institu- tions \u2013 declaring HIV/AIDS a regional emergency and mandating an emergency response, and developing re- gional compacts to ensure the provision of drugs and other materials for both prevention and treatment. Another option would be to create an intergovernmen- tal collaboration mechanism to fight HIV/AIDS to mobilize funds for the lower-income and least devel- oped countries. At the same time countries should be able to collaborate on the control of other diseases, both infectious and non-communicable \u2013 by establish- ing standards, setting up early warning systems, and building more effective regional systems for surveil- lance and communications. 6. Aiming for green growth In order to reduce poverty and meet the needs of current and future populations, the countries of the region will need to pursue even greater economic growth. The challenge now is to achieve this growth, while limiting the use of natural resources and cutting pollution, and generally keeping within the region\u2019s ecological carrying capacity. This will mean moving on from the conven- tional paradigm of \u201cgrow first and clean up later\u201d to a new paradigm of \u201cgreen growth\u201d that harmonizes eco- nomic growth with environmental sustainability. At the regional level the possibilities include creating a policy consultation forum and a knowledge hub. Countries can also implement the existing initiative for a network on green growth, while making full use of existing subregional bodies to develop and implement regional and subregional strategies to create synergies between the environment and the economy. 7. Improving governance One of the reasons why service delivery and MDG attainment are poor is that resources are dissipated through corruption. Governments need to root out corruption primarily at the national level but they can do so more effectively if they cooperate across bor- ders. One possibility would be an Asia-Pacific conven- tion on the elimination of corruption. This could cover agreements on law enforcement and the sharing of information \u2013 as well as on extraditing and pros- ecuting offenders and seizing their assets. The countries of Asia and the Pacific will also be able to move more rapidly towards the MDGs if they can make better use of information and communication technol- 8 ogy (ICT) to promote e-governance. At present they differ greatly in their capacity: some are world leaders in ICT and have already advanced towards e-governance; others have yet to start. This suggests many areas of opportunity.

Strengthening cooperation between regional institutions While Governments working closely together can in- crease their possibilities of attaining the MDGs, there is also an important catalytic role for the regional-level institutions. The United Nations agencies, regional de- velopment agencies such as ADB and regional trade, economic and subregional cooperation groups and in- stitutions such as ASEAN, SAARC and GMS need to increase their cooperation on MDG-related issues. The regional partnership between ESCAP, UNDP and ADB for attaining the MDGs is an example \u2013 and this report is one output. A future within reach The MDGs have helped many countries to galvanize their development efforts \u2013 offering a space in which all sections of society can come together to debate national and regional priorities. But they will only fi- nally serve their purpose if they focus attention on the remaining gaps, and on the changes needed to meet the rights of everyone \u2013 especially the poorest and most vulnerable. 2015 is only 10 years away. Advocacy for greater resources is already under way, through the Millennium Project, for example. But these resources need to be complemented with appro- priate institutional changes to ensure that all these goals are within reach. OVERVIEW 9 I. Tracking the Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific The countries of Asia and the Pacific have made substantial progress towards the MDGs, particularly those related to poverty. Nevertheless on present trends many countries remain \u201coff track\u201d for some vital targets, including those for child and maternal mor- tality. Comparing the performance of countries across the region can reveal how and why some countries are performing better on certain goals, while others have stalled or are even slipping back- wards \u2013 and also indicate the kind of institutional changes needed to get back on track. Five years ago, in September 2000, at the Millennium Summit in New York, leaders of the world\u2019s Govern- ments signed the Millennium Declaration and commit- ted themselves to a series of targets that came to be known as the Millennium Development Goals, most of which are to be achieved by 2015. One third of the way through the target period, it is now time to take stock. How have the countries of Asia and the Pacific performed? Are they likely to achieve the targets \u2013 and if not what do they need to do to get back on track? Each country has to assess its own prospects and possibilities, and many have explored these through their own national MDG progress reports \u2013 looking at where they stand, goal by goal. In addition, ESCAP and UNDP in 2005 produced a report that looked specifically at some of the poorest countries in the region: Voices of the Least Developed Countries of Asia and the Pacific: Achieving the Millennium Development Goals through a Global Partnership. The purpose of this chapter is to build on this data and analysis to offer a broader regional perspective. This is partly to get a sense of what all these efforts add up to; Asia and the Pacific is, after all, home to around 60 per cent of the world\u2019s population so what happens here will have a strong bearing on the global picture. More- over, while the region shows dynamism and promise, the tasks ahead are immense. The United Nations Mil- lennium Project, for example, has estimated that in 2005, Asia is home to 71 per cent of the total number of people in the world without access to improved sanita- tion; 58 per cent of those without access to safe water; 56 per cent of the world\u2019s undernourished; 54 per cent of those living in slums; and accounts for 43 per cent of the world\u2019s child mortality. It could also be pointed out that some of the subregions are in a worse position than other parts of the world. South Asia, for instance, had more undernourished people than Sub-Saharan Africa, more people without access to improved sanitation and more people living in slum conditions. This chapter will also highlight these problems through various aggregations and comparisons across the region that can reveal patterns of success and failure and indicate lessons and priorities for the years ahead \u2013 and particularly the kinds of institutional changes that will be needed if countries are to hit their targets by 2015. This is a daunting task. Asia and the Pacific is a vast and diverse region.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee854374-d8be-42ee-985b-59018ff553da": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee854374-d8be-42ee-985b-59018ff553da", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Future within Reach", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "96a034311b3a59acfb49b8eb095292dda69ac7b7229e5912245c09462bb8aebb"}}, "hash": "96a034311b3a59acfb49b8eb095292dda69ac7b7229e5912245c09462bb8aebb", "text": "At one end of the scale it includes TRACKING THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC 11 A FUTURE WITHIN REACH China, India and Indonesia, 3 of the world\u2019s 4 most populous countries; at the other it also includes Kiribati and Nauru, 2 of the smallest member States of the United Nations. And as well as having some highly developed countries, such as Australia and Japan, it also includes Central Asian countries in transition such as Kazakhstan and Tajikistan, 14 of the world\u2019s least de- veloped countries, such as Cambodia and Timor-Leste, a number of which are landlocked and small island developing States. In these circumstances any regional review must be highly selective. This one focuses on the developing and transition countries of the region, and in particular the poorest sections of their populations. This is the second such regional synthesis. The first, published in 2003 as Promoting the Millennium Develop- ment Goals in Asia and the Pacific, sketched the picture for the early years, and looked particularly at the achieve- ments in poverty reduction. This second report builds on that analysis and takes advantage of the greater volume and range of data that have become available to paint a more detailed picture for a greater number of indicators. Even so, the data still fall far short of the ideal; either they are missing completely, or are avail- able for only one or two years, making it difficult to discern a trend. So in many parts of the picture the paint can still only be thinly applied, leaving some issues sketchy and unresolved. Tracking progress To encapsulate the diversity of country experience and achievement, for each indicator this report places each country in one of four categories. \ufffd Early achiever \u2013 Has already met the target On track \u2013 Expected to hit the target by 2015 \ufffd Off track \u2013 Slow \u2013 Expected to hit the target, but after 2015 Off track \u2013 Regressing \u2013 Slipping backwards, or stagnating Note that a country can be an early achiever for one indicator but off track on another; Turkey, for ex- ample, is an early achiever for poverty but is regressing on primary school enrolment; Azerbaijan is on track for primary completion but slow on infant mortality. All countries for which sufficient data were available on at least one indicator are listed in table I.1. This table also serves to highlight the extent of data gaps. Table I.1 also gives an early indication of the most difficult areas. On this basis, some of the most serious problem indicators are clearly under goal 5 for mater- nal mortality, where more than two thirds of countries are off track, and under goal 7 for carbon dioxide emissions, where more than half of the countries are off track. On a more positive note, some of the best performance has been under goal 3 for gender equality in education, for which more than three quarters of the countries are on track. The following sections will first assess the region goal by goal then stand back to draw more general conclusions on the goals and on the performance of different subregions. Goal 1 \u2013 Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger The first goal is the most fundamental: to ensure that everyone has the basic resources they need, with suffi- cient income to lead healthy, productive and fulfilling lives. If this goal is reached, then countries will not only fulfil the rights of their people to a decent income but also be in a much better position to achieve the other goals. Within this goal, there are two targets: Target 1: Halve, between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of people whose income is less than one dollar per day On this basis the Asian and Pacific region has made dramatic progress. Between 1990 and 2001 in the 23 countries for which data are available the proportion of people living in income poverty fell from 31 per cent to 20 per cent. Despite population growth, the absolute number of poor people also fell \u2013 from 931 million to 679 million. Poverty can, however, also be assessed using national poverty lines; each country determines the level of income required to purchase essential food and non- food items and then estimates how many people fall below this. This has the advantage over the interna- tional $1-per day line that it is more attuned to local realities and most countries do indeed use this measure in their national MDG reports. However, these results may not be internationally comparable and only 13 countries offer sufficient data to indicate a trend;", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3540c7a-5cb7-4c2b-a9f6-5fb48b5c5d8b": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3540c7a-5cb7-4c2b-a9f6-5fb48b5c5d8b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Future within Reach", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8aa3f45e905bf79a978a6379088891796cfc2acda7d061ffe94f3f00076b124e"}}, "hash": "8aa3f45e905bf79a978a6379088891796cfc2acda7d061ffe94f3f00076b124e", "text": "even then the dates of observation vary widely from one country to another. This makes it more difficult to produce an aggregate picture; nevertheless, by this measure, and for these countries, the proportion of people living in poverty also fell, though less dramati- cally \u2013 from 21.3 to 19.4 per cent. Asia and the Pacific\u2019s overall poverty reduction on either basis will inevitably be swayed by the achievements of China and India. In China between 1990 and 2001 the proportion of people living in poverty fell from 33 to 16 per cent \u2013 and the total number of poor people fell from 381 million to 213 million. India, also based on the $1- per day line, had a significant reduction: between 1993 and 1999 the proportion of people in poverty fell from 42 to 35 per cent \u2013 with the total number of poor falling from 381 million to 354 million. \ufffd \ufffd 12 East and North-East Asia China \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd DPR of Korea \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd Hong Kong, China \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd Macau, China \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd Mongolia \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd Republic of Korea \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd South-East Asia Brunei Darussalam \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd Cambodia \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd Indonesia \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd Lao People\u2019s Dem.

In addition, 17 other countries are either also on track or, like Indonesia, have already hit their targets. Table I.2, however, summarizes the position for both international and national poverty lines. Thus China and India registered significant falls on both the $1-per day measure and in their national poverty rates \u2013 though for some other countries, such as the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Pakistan, the two measures show opposite trends. This table also highlights the countries that are having the greatest problems \u2013 Armenia, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Mongolia and Uzbekistan. Apart from Uzbekistan, all have actu- ally been regressing \u2013 moving away from the target. Of these, probably the most worrying case is that of Bangladesh, which during the early 1990s seemed to be making good progress, but since 1996 has suffered a setback: by 2001 poverty had risen to 36 per cent. The most surprising case appears to be that of Sri Lanka, which has done well on some of the other indicators, such as infant mortality, but is drifting backwards on poverty. It should be emphasized, however, that Sri Lanka starts from a much better position and is at- tempting to halve a poverty rate \u2013 7.6 per cent \u2013 that is already far lower than those of the other larger South Asian countries: India has a rate of 35 per cent but is classified as \u201con track\u201d and Pakistan has a rate of 13.4 per cent and is classified as an \u201cearly achiever\u201d.

A fuller explanation of these charts is given in box I.1. Although one of the main determinants of poverty reduction in the Asia-Pacific region is economic growth, the degree of inequality also plays a significant role. Countries that grow rapidly will see their poverty rate fall, provided that inequality does not increase too much. An important measure of inequality is the Gini coefficient, which takes a value between 0, representing absolute equality, and 1 which corresponds to one person owning everything.

If the number is negative the country still has a gap to bridge before reaching the target, and falls within the white zone. The right-hand chart offers further information on the countries in the white zone, though in this case it looks at how fast the situation is changing. The vertical axis displays the country\u2019s current annual rate of change; if it is positive the indicator is improving; if negative, deteriorating \u2013 though in some cases, of course, like primary school enrolment, improvement will mean an increase, while for others, such as poverty, improvement will mean a decrease. The horizontal axis indicates how the current rate of change compares with the rate necessary to reach the target by 2015. Termed the \u201cprogress index\u201d, this is simply the current rate divided by the desired rate. If the progress index is negative this means that the value is moving in the wrong direction; if as well as being negative it is also a large number this means that it is moving in the wrong direction very fast. On this basis, for each indicator, countries fall into one of three colour-coded zones: \ufffd Light green zone \u2013 The progress index is greater than or equal to 1 (i.e., annual rate of change greater than or equal to the required rate of change); the countries in this area are therefore \u201con track\u201d, as they are projected to meet the target on or before time; \ufffd Pink zone \u2013 The progress index is positive but less than 1; these countries are \u201coff track, slow progress\u201d; they are expected to achieve the target, but only after 2015; \ufffd Red zone \u2013 The progress index is negative or zero; these countries are classified as \u201coff track, regressing\u201d because they are stagnating or moving in the wrong direction. TRACKING THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC 15 A FUTURE WITHIN REACH rapidly in economic terms during the 1990s with an 8.8 per cent increase in GDP per year. It also suffered an increase in inequality: between 1992 and 2001 China\u2019s Gini coefficient increased from 0.38 to 0.45. Even so, this did not completely offset growth. The growth and inequality experience of all 23 countries is summarized in table I.3. The significance of economic growth, or the lack of it, for poverty is evident in the case of Mongolia. Here, poverty increased dramatically during 1990-1994, the early years of transition, as national income plum- meted and unemployment increased. So even though inequality fell, poverty rose. The significance of in- equality is also illustrated by the cases of Georgia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Sri Lanka: al- though their per capita GDP and household consump- tion grew substantially, all three suffered a dramatic increase in poverty as a result of rising inequality. The issue of increases in inequality as part of the growth process is becoming a concern in the Asia-Pacific region, as this would tend to lower the impact of future growth on poverty reduction. This highlights the im- portance of focusing on growth strategies that are more inclusive and broad-based. Target 2: Halve, between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of people who suffer from hunger A reduction in poverty can also be expected to lead to a reduction in malnutrition \u2013 one measure of which is the proportion of the population consuming less than the minimum daily dietary requirement. In this case 27 countries offer sufficient data to indicate a trend and taken together they show an overall reduction between the early 1990s and 2001 \u2013 from 18.7 to 15.1 per cent. This overall trend is strongly influenced by the weak performance of India. Here the proportion below the minimum daily energy requirement fell between 1991 and 2001, from 25.0 to 21.4 per cent, but as a result of population increase the absolute number of hungry people rose: from 217 to 222 million. Even so, India is not the country most seriously affected. Far and away the worst situation is in Tajikistan, where 61 per cent of the population go hungry, followed by the Demo- cratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea with 36 per cent. Both have also been regressing: falling into the red zone of figure I.2b. Box I.2.

Those in the left zones have yet to reach their target, those in the right have already achieved it. Tajikistan is in the worst position: its latest value of 61 per cent is so high that it falls outside the range of this figure, but Uzbekistan (UZB) with 26 per cent of its people hungry is also more than 20 percentage points away from its tar- get. Figure I.2b looks only at those countries that have yet to reach their targets. Thus the same two countries are also in the red zone since they are regressing. The progress index shows that Tajikistan\u2019s (TJK) rate, which has been rising by 0.2 percentage points per year, would instead need to fall \u2013 and by twice as fast as it has been rising. Viet Nam (VNM), however, is well on track and is actually progressing four to five times faster than it needs to meet its target. Notes: 1.

TRACKING THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC 17 A FUTURE WITHIN REACH The proportion of people malnourished is affected by many factors, primarily the availability of food in a country and the economic and social access of the poor to that food. Tajikistan has serious problems of food availability. Only 6 per cent of the territory is arable land and in the Soviet era much of irrigated arable land was used for cotton, with wheat production often on ineffi- cient State farms relegated to the non-irrigated land. Poverty is also a major factor: although Tajikistan has achieved its poverty target, one fifth", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0f2bbb99-ab02-4733-8941-4ee9a456aed6": {"__data__": {"id_": "0f2bbb99-ab02-4733-8941-4ee9a456aed6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Future within Reach", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e4e284794ea508f845109ecb06b65404a9ba6640164266e41c501c69113d0e74"}, "3": {"node_id": "9b0442a8-b7f2-463b-8d57-507b6d533480", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "87771b9fe8a4fac45597b789fa85e2fc2ce0a47cc11f6d1f79d9801aa1cf44dc"}}, "hash": "c32a7d853057a58b39dd50803563bb050cac66019a151b1aca996852a77769c8", "text": "of the population is poor. This situation can be contrasted with that in Viet Nam, which is on track: not only does it have more fertile land it has also boosted output through liberaliza- tion and has increased economic access to food by reducing poverty. Perhaps an even more important indicator of hunger is the proportion of children under five who are mal- nourished. In this case there are insufficient data to indicate general trends across the region, but the most recent are collected in table I.4, which indicates pro- portions significantly different from the proportion of malnourished people. This is partly because this indi- cator refers only to children but also because the data are gathered in very different ways: child malnutrition is measured in household surveys that weigh individual children, while the proportion of people eating less than the dietary minimum is calculated indirectly through measures of food availability and income dis- tribution. For many countries, child malnutrition is disturbingly high; and surprisingly so since most households are not seriously short of food and should have enough for the small amounts that young children consume. The problems often start before and during pregnancy since malnourished mothers are more likely to produce low birth-weight babies. Then, during the first two years of life many children lose ground because they are not given sufficient high-quality food \u2013 particularly if mothers have low standards of education. Low stan- dards of health and hygiene also play an important part since sick children are less able to absorb essential nutrients. It is also important to ensure that children receive adequate quantities of micronutrients such as iron, iodine and vitamin A. Micronutrient deficiencies represent a \u201chidden hunger\u201d not evident from calorific measures. Box I.3. Cut-offs used for deciding whether MDGs have been achieved Many of the MDGs require reducing an indicator value by a certain proportion.

In the case of primary school enrolment, for example, this is 95 per cent, and for the poverty rate 5 per cent. The \u201ccut-offs\u201d for each indicator are indicated below.

After sig- nificant investment of resources, a number of coun- tries have already achieved the goal of universal pri- mary education, and many others are on track to do so. Target 3: Ensure that, by 2015, children everywhere, boys and girls alike, will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling Within this target there are three indicators: the net enrolment ratio, the proportion of children starting in grade one who reach grade five, and the proportion of all children who complete a course of primary educa- tion. For net enrolment the target is conventionally considered to be 95 per cent. Most countries in the region have ratios above 80 per cent, and many above 90 per cent. Of the 33 countries with sufficient data available for estimating a trend, 8 have already achieved the target and 11 others are on track to do so. Even Pakistan, with a net enrolment ratio in 2000 of only 59 per cent, should still hit the target if it maintains its current rate of progress. Worryingly, however, 13 countries are regressing, as indicated by their position in the red zone of figure I.3b. It should be noted that net enrolment refers only to children of primary school age and may present an over-pessimistic picture. Many schools also educate over-age children. A child of 13, for example, who is enrolled in grade 5 of primary school class would be considered over-age and not be counted even though the child could be on his or her way to successfully completing primary school. Although many countries have succeeded in enrolling children in the different primary classes they may then struggle to prevent them from dropping out. The cu- mulative effect of dropout can be measured by a \u201cco- hort analysis\u201d that follows a group of children through primary school. Only 17 countries in the region have cohort analyses suitable for the calculation of a trend. Among these, those with the highest dropouts are Papua New Guinea, where only about half of school entrants make it to grade 5, along with India, Myanmar and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, where the proportion is less than two thirds (figure I.4a).

Those in the left zone have yet to reach their target, those in the right have achieved 95 per cent or more. This chart, compared with many of the others, locates the countries along a straight line because in this case they all have the same target. Thus Azerbaijan (AZE) has both the lowest figure and is necessarily the furthest from the common target. Figure I.3b looks only at those countries that have yet to reach the target. This shows the position of Azerbaijan (AZE) as even more alarming, being in the red zone it is actually regressing. The Philippines (PHL), however, in the green zone, is well on track: although its rate of change is quite small it is already quite close to 95 per cent and its rate of progress is more than twice that required to meet to the target by 2015.

This, however, is really only an indica- tion of what happens in the final year: the primary completion rate is the total number of students success- fully graduating from the final year of primary school in a given year, expressed as a proportion of the total number of children in the population who are of the correct age to do so. For the region as a whole this figure can be quite high: increasing between 1998 and 2001 from 89 to 93 per cent. It may seem strange that this is often higher than the enrolment ratio, but the number of graduates is usually swollen by over-age children so this figure probably gives an overoptimistic picture. Why do some countries do better than others in educa- tion? Based on these data the following factors are associated with higher enrolment: \u2022 Higher per capita income \u2013 This reflects, among other things, the difficulty that poorfamilies have in pay- ing the expenses of education or in managing without their children\u2019s work. \u2022 Higher government expenditure on education \u2013 A 1 per cent increase in expenditure on education is associ- ated with a 1.5 per cent increase in enrolment. \u2022 Higher literacy rate of adult women \u2013 Mothers who themselves have been educated recognize the value of education for their children. \u2022 Lower rural proportion of the population \u2013 Rural chil- dren are less likely to go to school. This may be because the school can be some distance away, or because the quality of rural education is lower, or because more rural children are needed for work. \u2022 Higher share of women in wage employment \u2013 This can be taken as an indication of women\u2019s status within the home, and suggests that when they have the power to do so they will send their children to school. Countries such as Thailand that have remained on track have done so by reducing poverty while also finding ways of encouraging children to go to school by, for example, providing the children of poor families with scholarships, lunch and transport. Children in Papua New Guinea, however, are in a more difficult situation, with much higher levels of poverty. They also face measurable cultural obstacles \u2013 having to cope, for example, with an imported education system that does not fully meet their needs, and also often having to learn in a language different from the one they speak at home. Goal 3 \u2013 Promote gender equality and empower women At the Millennium Summit, the world\u2019s Governments placed great importance on women\u2019s rights \u2013 aiming not just to ensure parity in service delivery but also to empower women in their families and their communi- ties. The actual targets for this goal are, however, re- stricted to educational enrolment. Target 4: Eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education preferably by 2005 and in all levels of education by no later than 2015 This is one of the most successful areas for the coun- tries of Asia and the Pacific. At all three levels the target for the ratio between girls and boys\u2019 enrolment is taken to be 95 per cent.

Among the countries that have made particularly rapid progress since 1990 are Bangladesh and China, fol- lowed by the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, India and Nepal. Because most countries are so close to the target and some countries of concern lie outside a usable scale, the distance and progress charts for these are not included here. Of the 5 that are regressing, the most serious situa- tions are in Afghanistan, where between 1990 and 1999 the ratio fell dramatically from 0.55 to 0.08, and in Pakistan, where the proportion has stalled at 0.74. In Afghanistan the situation will have improved consider- ably since 1999 following the restoration of democ- racy; the 2004 Afghanistan human development re- port, for example, indicates that the ratio for combined primary, secondary and tertiary enrolment is now around 0.5. In Pakistan, however, the outlook does not appear good and the Government will need to make enormous efforts to get even close to the target. The other countries that should strictly be classified as re- gressing are doing so very close to the target. At the secondary level the situation also seems quite positive. Of the 36 countries with relevant data 25 have already achieved the target. And even some of those where the ratio is still quite low, such as Pakistan at 0.66 and Nepal at 0.75, have been making up ground so quickly that they are likely meet the target of 0.95 by 2015 \u2013 thus they fall into the \u201con track\u201d zone in figure I.5b. Across the region, weighted for population, be- tween 1990 and 2001 the ratio of boys to girls at the secondary level increased from 0.73 to 0.87. Of those countries in South-East Asia that are off track, 2, Myanmar and Viet Nam, are still nevertheless quite close to the target; Cambodia and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, however, are some way away and progressing too slowly. Tajikistan too needs to do much better since it is now slipping badly; in 1990 almost all children went to secondary school, but by 2002 the proportion had fallen to 90 per cent for boys and 74 per cent for girls.
