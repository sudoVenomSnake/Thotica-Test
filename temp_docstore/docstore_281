le that all reports of alleged corruption must be investigated. Second, the ICAC has enforced a rule of silence on all reports of corruption. It is an offence for the ICAC staff to disclose the names of persons being investigated until a search warrant is given or the persons are charged or arrested. Third, for highly sensitive cases, a comprehensive witness protection programme is in place that,in extreme cases,enables witnesses to change their identities and relocate. Gradually this has led to fewer and fewer anonymous reports of corruption \u2013 from 65 percent in 1974 down to only 30 percent in 2000. The ICAC also realized at an early stage that partnering with the media was necessary. The media is a powerful and indispensable partner in disseminating anti-corruption messages. The use of media does not, however, diminish the need for face-to-face contact. Face-to-face contact with the people is seen as crucial by the ICAC as it serves to explain the Commission\u2019s goals and mission and obtain feedback on its work. For this purpose, the ICAC uses a strategic network of regional district offices to maintain direct contact with members of various segments of the community. These offices have two primary functions: serving as focal points of contact with local community leaders and organizations with whom the ICAC regional officers organize various activities to disseminate anti-corruption messages; and being manned by staff trained to deliver the ICAC messages to different sectors of the community. The offices also serve as report centres where members of the public can walk in and lodge a complaint about corruption. Experience shows that people feel more at ease providing such information in these less-formal settings. The experience with fighting corruption in Hong Kong has showed that prevention is an essential component of anti-corruption strategies. Prevention is also considered to be more cost-effective then enforcement. In relation to this, the ICAC has also been providing assistance to public sector and private sector bodies for the development of codes of conduct. It has also proven essential to make corruption a high-risk crime, emphasizing the importance of securing convictions for corruption cases. Such convictions must also be widely publicized and brought to the attention of the general public. Trials for minor offences,however,are costly, and the experience of the ICAC has shown that cautions for minor cases for which the offender makes a full admission have been found to be highly cost-effective in that the offender knows that they will be watched closely after being cautioned and few offend again. In view of the extensive investigative powers of the ICAC, there is potential for abuse. It has thus been necessary to put in place an effective system of checks and balances.

Major parts of the enabling legislation have not been enacted, and the government has failed to undertake the necessary follow-up. In particular, the government has repeatedly failed to provide adequate budgets for the institutions set up to implement and enact these laws. Recent years have also seen important steps in institutional development, with a range of state auxiliary bodies established with mandates that contribute to the fight against corruption. These bodies include the Commission for the Audit of the Wealth of State Officials (KPKPN)4; the National Ombudsman Commission; the National Law Commission; and the Commission for the Eradication of Money Laundering (ADB,2004:1).However,the efforts of these institutions have been weakened by their conflicting mandates (Transparency International,2003:145).An important development in this regard is the establishment of the Commission for Eradication of Corruption (KPK) in December 2003 which, among other things, is charged with coordinating with and supervising all institutions authorized to eradicate corruption. It is hoped that the KPK will thus form a critical part of and become a focal point for a comprehensive institutional framework for tackling corruption in Indonesia. Corruption remains a major challenge, with Indonesia placing 137th out of 159 countries on Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perceptions Index 2005, having a disproportionate impact on the lives of the poor as described in The Poor Speak Up \u2014 17 Stories of Corruption and negatively impacting on the development of the country as a whole.

Institutional Arrangments to Combat Corruption: A Comparative Study 50 Mandate and institutional links of the key anti-corruption institution The Commission for Eradication of Corruption was established in December 2003, by virtue of Article 43 of Law 31/1999. The organizational structure of the KPK and its mandate and legal jurisdiction is set out in Law 30/2002. Article 3 of Law 30/2002 provides that the \u201cKPK is to be a State agency that will perform its duties and authority independently, free from any and all influence\u201d. The KPK decides on policies and procedures on how to conduct its duties and authority. The KPK is also responsible for the management of its own personnel,including appointments and termination of contracts (Article 25[1],Law 30/2002).Under Article 15(c) of Law 30/2002,the KPK is obligated to report on its activities,on an annual basis,to the President, the Parliament and the State Auditor. The KPK is made up of and headed by five Commissioners,one of which acts as the Chairperson of the KPK and the remaining four as Vice-chairpersons. The Commissioners are designated as government officials (Article 21, Law 30/2002). The Commissioners are selected by the Parliament from a list of candidates provided by the President.The list of candidates is prepared by a selection committee appointed by the Government (Article 30,Law 30/2002).The Commissioners hold office for a term of four years and may be reappointed for one term (Article 34, Law 30/2002). The KPK is assisted in its work by a Secretary General. S/he is appointed by the President but is accountable to the KPK Commissioners (Article 27, Law 30/2002). A Commissioner must relinquish office if s/he violates the provisions of Law 30/2002.Should a Commissioner be suspected of having committed a criminal act, s/he is to be temporarily relinquished from office.Any decision relating to the above is to be made by the President (Article 32, Law 30/2002). There is also an Advisory Team, made up of four members elected by the KPK from among the candidates proposed by a selection panel (Articles 21[1(b)] and 22, Law 30/2002).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4dd83c06-20c6-495e-abff-5d245f7e7674": {"__data__": {"id_": "4dd83c06-20c6-495e-abff-5d245f7e7674", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "40a4226102dab8dc89b21ab0b09e97e260e7e85b5fe9247a20bce665a3bff5eb"}, "2": {"node_id": "bc7e9b93-fb79-4da6-b114-56b538799f8a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4064a5b40480987d7fc8a60be60dacf04c57c8ea23df46de16bdf812e412e1b8"}}, "hash": "46dd706abbd8fd51b695490f84727e219405893d351eab288eca3145d1b0fe18", "text": "The purpose of the Advisory Team is to provide suggestions and considerations to the KPK within the context of the execution of the KPK\u2019s tasks and authority (Article 23, Law 30/2002).

The KPK appoints \u2013 as well as dismisses \u2013 investigators, indictors, and prosecutors in order to fulfil this mandate (Articles 43, 45 and 51). Article 12 of Law 30/2002 gives the KPK wide ranging powers in performing its mandate of investigation, indictment and prosecution, including: ordering the relevant institution to prohibit a suspect from travelling abroad; requesting financial details from banks and other financial institutions and freezing the assets of a suspect or connected parties; ordering that a suspect be suspended from his/her office; requesting information on the wealth and tax details of the suspect; requesting assistance from Interpol Indonesia or the law enforcement institutions of other nations to conduct searches, arrests, and confiscations in foreign countries; and requesting assistance from the Police or other relevant institutions to conduct arrests, confinements, raids, and confiscations in corruption cases currently under investigation. In carrying out its preventive mandate,the KPK is mandated to audit the wealth of state officials as well as carry out education and public awareness programmes, including: running anti-corruption education programmes in every level of education; designing and implementing socialization programmes against criminal acts of corruption; conducting anti-corruption campaigns; and conducting bilateral and multilateral cooperation on anti-corruption (Article 13, Law 30/2002). 5 The equivalent of US$100,000. 51 Country Briefs: Indonesia In performing its mandate to monitor the governance of the State,the KPK may conduct reviews of the management systems of all State institutions and give advice to said institutions should such a review reveal that their systems are prone to corruption. If the advice of the KPK is not adhered to, the KPK is to report this to the President, the Parliament and the State Auditor (Article 14, Law 30/2002). Article 15 of Law 30/2002 provides that the KPK must provide protection to witnesses or whistle-blowers reporting or providing information on alleged corruption. In performing its duties of coordination, the KPK is mandated to: \ufffd Coordinate investigations, indictments, and prosecutions against criminal acts of corruption; \ufffd Implement a reporting system for the purposes of eradicating corruption; \ufffd Request information on acts with the purpose of eradicating corruption from relevant institutions; \ufffd Arrange opinion hearings and meetings with institutions with a mandate to eradicate corruption; and \ufffd Request reports from relevant institutions pertaining to the prevention of criminal acts of corruption (Article 7, Law 30/2002). It is stressed in Law 30/2002 that the KPK shall be transparent and open to the public, including the appointment of commissioners and other staff as well as conducting campaigns to inform and raise awareness among the public on the work of the KPK.The KPK also aims to actively pursue and promote the involvement of the public in its activities. Operational arrangements In the course of carrying out its mandate to supervise other state institutions active in anti-corruption efforts, Article 8 of Law 30/2002 provides that the KPK is empowered to take over an indictment or prosecution in a corruption case being carried out by the Police or the Prosecutor\u2019s Office \u2013 who would then be required to hand over the suspect as well as all relevant documentation to the KPK \u2013 if any of the conditions outlined in Article 9 of Law 30/2002 prevail.6 Although the KPK is mandated to investigate, indict and prosecute cases of corruption, the KPK may request that the Police or the Prosecutor\u2019s Office investigate a case of suspected corruption should the KPK itself not be able to find enough evidence for an indictment (Article 44, Law 30/2002). The Police and Prosecutor\u2019s Office may also carry out indictments in relation to corruption cases but must then inform the KPK of this within 14 days; the KPK is then mandated to coordinate the indictment process.

The Court consists of five Judges \u2013 two District Court Judges7 appointed on the decision of the Head of the Supreme Court and three ad hoc judges appointed by the President in consultation with the Head of the Supreme Court (Article 56, Law 30/2002). In accordance with Article 58(1) of Law 30/2002, the Court must appraise and decide on corruption cases brought before it within 90 days.

Institutional Arrangments to Combat Corruption: A Comparative Study 52 The Audit Board is the supreme audit institution in Indonesia and is responsible for the auditing of the accountability of the state finance, including the budget implementations of the central government, the regional governments, the state-owned enterprises, and those of the enterprises owned by the regional governments.The KPK is required to report on its activities to the State Auditor. The State Auditor is one of the institutions which fall within the supervisory mandate of the KPK as it is mandated to contribute towards the fight against corruption. The Commission of the National Ombudsman is an independent public institution that aims to foster the integrity, accountability and the efficient running of the State. In its work, the Commission receives and strives to find and to rectify complaints lodged by the public against government maladministration as well as strives to create conditions conducive to fostering a state that provides services to the people in a manner that is free from corruption. Lessons learned Earlier experiences in Indonesia have been that high hopes placed on the new institutions established to combat corruption have come to be dampened by the government\u2019s lack of support and inadequate funding. Reforms of the judiciary, a key element in the fight against corruption, have also been disappointing. Previously, there has not appeared to be any overall government strategy for tackling corruption that brings together the creditable initiatives already initiated.Indonesia needs a clear road map for reform and a credible government commitment to push through, coordinate, and follow up reforms. To date, the history of anti-corruption initiatives in the post-Suharto era has been a story of creative initiatives and promising legislation that has not been followed through. Some observers suggest that the legislation and the associated institutions were designed to fail \u2013 providing a superficial commitment to fighting corruption, but with built-in features to render them inoperable. This can be considered a particularly sophisticated form of \u201cstate capture\u201d \u2013 indicating the necessity of political commitment at the highest levels in order for any anti-corruption effort to have a chance of being successful.

One of the main themes of his campaign leading up to the Presidential elections was the importance of tackling corruption. It also remains to be seen what impact the establishment of the KPK will have. One issue that will require attention in order to allow the KPK to successfully fulfil its mandate is the need to harmonise other laws with Law 30/2002.The provisions in Law 30/2002 do not necessarily coincide with the regulations that govern other institutions. One example of this is that although the KPK is empowered to request information from state institutions, there are no corresponding provisions requiring these institutions to disclose the information requested (ADB, 2004:2). The case of setting up the KPK illustrates that it is not only necessary to look at the mandate of an anti-corruption body but also that the regulations of other organizations must reflect the mandate of the anti-corruption body \u2013 especially if the body is to have a coordinating function. In a situation where a country has a number of anti-corruption bodies and a decision is taken to establish a coordinating body, this will require a harmonization of the legal framework, and it must be ensured that no legislation remains which can be used as a source of protection by corrupt elements with the State.

With the establishment of the Corruption Prevention Council in 1997, the Government took the first steps in developing a substantial anti-corruption policy (OSI, 2002:300).Yet the institutional setup for the prevention and combating of corruption remained fragmented and lacked effective coordination. Corruption was generally perceived as a worrying phenomenon negatively affecting the activities of some public institutions (GRECO, 2002:6).The current Prime Minister founded the New Era Party in part because of his desire to minimize corruption in the country. Leading up to the 2002 elections in which the New Era Party received the highest number of votes, minimizing corruption was also one of the main campaign promises (FHI, 2004,:18). The Government of Latvia remains strongly committed to further combating corruption and has taken several important steps in order to increase the effectiveness of its anti-corruption policy.This has included the improvement of legislation \u2013 such as the adoption in 2002 of the PCIAPO Law \u2013 as well as clarification and consolidation of the institutional setup through the establishment of a central Corruption Prevention and Combating Bureau (KNAB), fully operational since February 2003 (EC, 2003:14). Other important steps have been the establishment of the Crime and Corruption Prevention Council (CCPC), established in 2002, and most recently, the adoption in 2004 of the National Strategy for Corruption Prevention and Combating 2004-2008.

In particular, further efforts are needed to complete the legislative basis and to consolidate the KNAB (2003:56). Mandate and institutional links of the key anti-corruption institution The Corruption Prevention and Combating Bureau \u2013 established in October 2002 \u2013 is an institution of the State Administration under the supervision of the Cabinet of Ministers (Article 2[1], CPCB Law).The CPCB Law provides for the legal status and objectives of the Bureau.The CPCB is managed by a Director \u2013 appointed (and dismissed) by the Saeima on the rec- ommendation of the Cabinet of Ministers (Article 4[1], CPCB, Law) \u2013 together with two Deputy Directors responsible, respec- tively, for corruption prevention matters and corruption combating matters. The CPCB consists of a total of 16 divisions, nine of which sort directly under the Director, performing primarily internal functions.1 Of the remaining divisions, the Division of Control of Actions of State Officials, the Division of Control of Political Parties Financing, the Division of Corruption Analyses and Countermeasures Methodology, and the Public Relations and International Cooperation Division sort under the Deputy Director responsible for corruption prevention matters.The Division of Criminal Intelligence Process, the Division of Inquiry and the Administrative Division of Surveillance sort under the Deputy Director responsible for corruption combating matters. The activities of the CPCB are based on the three pillars of corruption prevention,investigation of cases of corruption and building of public awareness. Also, in accordance with Article 7(1) of the CPCB Law, the Bureau was tasked with preparing the National Strategy for Corruption Prevention and Combating 2004-2008 which was subsequently approved by the Cabinet of Ministers in 2004.The CPCB has a clear mandate to coordinate the implementation of anti-corruption measures in State and local government institutions as the Bureau is also responsible for ensuring coordination of the efforts of and cooperation between all institutions active in the fight against corruption in line with the national strategy (Article 7[2], CPCB Law). In relation to this, the CPCB is also responsible for providing the Crime and Corruption Prevention Council (CCPC) with information and recommendations on corruption-related issues.The CCPC is discussed further under the heading Operational arrangements. In accordance with Article 7 of the CPCB Law, the main functions of the Bureau in the area of corruption prevention are: \ufffd Developing anti-corruption strategies; \ufffd Reviewing any complaints received falling within the Bureau\u2019s mandate; \ufffd Analyzing corruption prevention practices in the State and local government institutions and, in cases where corruption is found, submitting recommendations to the relevant Ministry or institution; \ufffd Developing methods for preventing and combating corruption in State and local government institutions as well as in the private sector; \ufffd Analyzing and drafting legal acts and proposing possible changes, as well as submitting recommendations for the drafting of legal acts; \ufffd Carrying out surveys of public opinion and analysing the results; \ufffd Educating the public regarding legal and ethical aspects of corruption; \ufffd Keeping the public informed on developments regarding corruption in the country, cases of corruption found, as well as efforts made in the prevention of and fight against corruption; \ufffd Developing and implementing a public relations strategy; and \ufffd In accordance with its competence, evaluating investigations performed by other institutions. In the area of combating corruption, the CPCB is tasked with, as provided by Article 8 of the CPCB Law, charging State officials with administrative liability and imposing punishment in cases of administrative violations in the area of corruption as provided by law; and carrying out investigations and operative actions in order to detect corruption in the Public Service. All other bodies with an investigative mandate are required to assist the Bureau in carrying out its investigations.The Bureau also performs the function of monitoring the observance by political organizations of the party financing regulations (Article 9, CPCB Law). Article 10 of the CPCB Law provides the official of the Bureau with a wide range of powers and authority, including: 1 These are the Legal Division, the Financial Division, the Personnel Division, the Administrative Division, the Internal Control Division, the Protection of Classified Information Division, the Information Technology Division, the Internal Audit Unit and the Report Centre. 55 Country Briefs: Latvia \ufffd Carrying out investigations as provided by the Code of Criminal Procedures; \ufffd Carrying out operative investigations as permitted by law in order to uncover and prevent criminal offences in the areas of corruption and party financing; \ufffd Drawing up administrative charges in cases of discovered violations, reviewing cases of administrative violations and imposing administrative punishment in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1aae9cf1-b2f6-4c74-bdaf-15f6be57f2e3": {"__data__": {"id_": "1aae9cf1-b2f6-4c74-bdaf-15f6be57f2e3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ff6bcfc809d7fe3fa6729c0076206a28dbfb8a24f5c669e6778e95de2b9fd81d"}, "3": {"node_id": "bc87876b-d8bf-49ac-8ca1-41efeb09ea7c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "85fdde93ef9529a34c923f0959758b3f1c5b786a625ccf95ced11104c20e6291"}}, "hash": "db51b12051b9ab9ba5280b6454f989db0b2d0b39f76550ff33a604387fe0f14b", "text": "cases of violations, the review of which, according to the Code of Administrative Violations, comes under the jurisdiction of the Bureau; \ufffd Receiving information,documents and information upon request from the State administration and municipal institutions, companies, organizations, officials and other persons, regardless of their secrecy regime; \ufffd Receiving information from financial institutions needed in criminal cases through the agencies of the Prosecutor General; \ufffd Summoning to the CPCB any person connected to the investigation of a case or material,and in the event a person fails to appear after receiving such summons, bringing him/her in by force; and \ufffd Using force should it be required.

In addition to the above, Article 7(3) of the CPCB Law provides that the Bureau is tasked with monitoring the observance of the Law on Prevention of Conflict of Interest in Activities of Public Officials. This also includes the responsibility to examine the declarations of public officials2 submitted to the CPCB in accordance with Subsection 23(4) of the PCIAPO Law (Article 7[16], CPCB Law).The purpose of the PCIAPO Law is to ensure that decisions and actions taken by public officials are in the interest of the public interest and to prevent any influence from outside or financial interests. Ultimately, this is also intended to promote public confidence regarding the actions of public officials (Section 2, PCIAPO Law). Operational arrangements The parliamentary Crime and Corruption Prevention Council, established in 2002 and headed by the Prime Minister, is charged with overseeing efforts to prevent corruption and combating organized crime. As such, the CPCC is tasked with coordinating and supervising all State authorities\u2019activities in the field of prevention of crime and corruption (GRECO,2004a:4). Within this mandate, the Council has taken leadership of oversight of the KNAB (EC, 2003:15). In addition, the CCPC is tasked with supporting civil society\u2019s involvement in anti-corruption policies; promoting prevention plans with regard to organized crime and corruption;and supporting criminological research.It is also entitled to make proposals for the development of draft legal acts and the implementation of justice and home affairs policies to ensure the coordination of activities within institutions fighting crime and corruption, as well as the cooperation of Latvian institutions with international institutions (GRECO, 2004a:4-5). The State Audit Office (SAO) is established as an independent institution under Article 87 of the Constitution subject only to the law (Subsection 1[2], SAO Law). The SAO is the supreme audit institution and is headed by the Auditor General, appointed by the Saeima for a term of seven years (Subsection 26[1], SAO Law), together with the SAO Council \u2013 the members of which are approved by the Saeima on the recommendation of the Auditor General, also for a term of seven years (Subsection 27[1],SAO Law).The organization and responsibilities of the SAO are provided by the SAO Law.In accordance with Section 2 of the SAO Law, the SAO is tasked with examining the revenue and expenditure of State and local government budget resources; utilization of the resources of the European Union and other international organizations or institutions that have been included in the State budget or local government budgets; and actions with State and local government property \u2013 in order to ensure that resources have been used in a lawful, correct, economical and efficient in their manner. Should the SAO find irregularities that give rise to the suspicion of corruption, the case is reported directly to the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office (PPO) should there be evidence of criminal activity.Otherwise,the case is reported to the State Revenue Service (SRS) (GRECO, 2002:17).The SAO reports on its activities to the Saeima and the Government (Section 3, SAO Law).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bc87876b-d8bf-49ac-8ca1-41efeb09ea7c": {"__data__": {"id_": "bc87876b-d8bf-49ac-8ca1-41efeb09ea7c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ff6bcfc809d7fe3fa6729c0076206a28dbfb8a24f5c669e6778e95de2b9fd81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "1aae9cf1-b2f6-4c74-bdaf-15f6be57f2e3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "db51b12051b9ab9ba5280b6454f989db0b2d0b39f76550ff33a604387fe0f14b"}}, "hash": "85fdde93ef9529a34c923f0959758b3f1c5b786a625ccf95ced11104c20e6291", "text": "The SRS is a state administration institution operating under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance (Article 1,SRS Law) and is headed by a Director General appointed by the Minister of Finance upon the approval of the Government (Article 4[1], SRS Law).The organization and responsibilities of the SRS are provided by the SRS Law.As provided by Article 2 of the SRS Law,the main tasks of the SRS include: \ufffd Ensuring the collection of state taxes, duties and other compulsory payments administered by the SRS within Latvia and at the borders, i.e. customs; 2 Section 4 of the PCIAPO Law defines the scope of public officials covered under the Law.

Within the SRS, the Finance Police has been given extensive powers, as provided by Article 16 of the SRS Law, in the sphere of state revenue. In accordance with Article 14, the tasks of the Finance Police include: \ufffd Carrying out investigations aimed at disclosing and preventing crimes in the sphere of state revenues; \ufffd Carrying out investigations in accordance with the Law aimed at disclosing and preventing crimes in the activities of the officials and employees of the SRS; and \ufffd Carrying out investigations in the event of smuggling and criminal cases related to crimes disclosed in the sphere of state revenues as well as in the activities of officials and employees of the SRS. In addition to the KNAB, the Finance Police is only one of several law enforcement agencies involved in anti-corruption investigations. In addition, the Security Police as well as the State Police \u2013 in particular, its Economic Police Department (EPD) and Organised Crime Enforcement Department (OCED) \u2013 are also involved in anti-corruption investigations. The EPD is primarily responsible for investigating cases of corruption within the private sector, whereas the OCED is tasked with preventing and detecting corruption offences related to organized and economic crime (GRECO, 2004a:5). In investigating cases related to corruption,they all work closely with the KNAB and,as mentioned above,they are all required to assist the KNAB in its investigation should they be requested to do so.Both the Security Police and the State Police are state administrative institutions subordinate to the Ministry of Interior. The PPO is a uniform and centralized system consisting of three levels \u2013 the Office of the Prosecutor General, prosecutors\u2019 offices of judicial regions and district prosecutors\u2019 offices as well as specialized prosecutors\u2019 offices (Article 22, PPO Law). The PPO is headed by the Prosecutor General \u2013 appointed by the Saeima upon the recommendation of the Chairman of the Supreme Court for a period of five years (Article 38[1], PPO Law). Public prosecutors are appointed as well as dismissed in accordance with the procedures stipulated by law by the Prosecutor General (Article 23[2], PPO Law).Article 5 of the PPO Law provides that public prosecutors,when considering any case,shall make their decisions independently and in accordance with the law. Furthermore, Article 6 of the PPO provides that public prosecutors shall be independent from any influence by any other institution or official. As established by Article 2 of the PPO Law, the functions of the PPO are to: \ufffd Supervise the activities of inquiry institutions and the operative activities of other institutions; \ufffd Organize, manage and conduct pre-trial investigation; \ufffd Initiate and carry out criminal prosecution on behalf of the state; \ufffd Supervise the proper execution of sentences; \ufffd Protect the rights and lawful interests of persons and the State in accordance with procedures prescribed by law; \ufffd Submit a complaint or submission to the courts in cases stipulated by law; and \ufffd Take part in court review when required to do so by law. Within the PPO, several departments have been assigned specialized tasks. None of these, however, have been given the primary function of dealing with corruption cases (GRECO, 2002:24). All cases, including cases related to corruption, are brought before the courts by the PPO. The independence of judges and courts is guaranteed by the Constitution, which establishes that judges shall be independent and subject only to the law (Article 83).Corruption cases are dealt with by the courts in the same manner as other cases brought before them. There is no Ombudsman institution in Latvia. Instead, some of the functions traditionally carried out by the Ombudsman are being carried out by other institutions such as the State Office for Protection of Human Rights and the PPO (GRECO, 2004b:9 and 13). Lessons learned In GRECO\u2019s 2002 Evaluation Report on Latvia, the lack of direction and coordination between the various policing institutions charged with combating corruption was seen as a major concern and an impediment in the efforts to combat corruption. In view of this, a central recommendation was the need to promote coordination, experience-sharing and circulation of information among the different institutions. This would also include the establishment a body for overseeing coordination (2002:21).

In the field of investigation of corruption cases, however, the situation remains fragmented with, as described above, a number of enforcement institutions (GRECO, 2004a:6). The EC monitoring report notes that there also remains a need for the establishment of an efficient cooperation mechanism between other institutions involved in the anti-corruption effort such as the SAO and SRS (EC, 2003:15). A further concern was the lack of an efficient corruption intelligence system with operational functions, including research of vulnerable sectors and development of early intervention strategies. These concerns have been addressed through the establishment of the Division of Special Investigative Activities and Analysis as well as the Corruption Analysis and Counteraction Methods Development Division within the KNAB (GRECO, 2004a:6). Of additional concern was the perception of the public that the judiciary and the public prosecution are ineffective in fighting corruption.This was related in part to the disparity between crimes registered and individuals sentenced in corruption cases. In addition to this, it was noted that there is no unit within the PPO specialized in the field of corruption.This was considered a problem as the investigation and prosecution of corruption cases requires special training, skills and experience. GRECO proposed that the PPO establish a single unit for dealing with corruption, with the additional responsibility of training, supporting and sharing of practice with other units involved in the fight against corruption. Training in general was also considered necessary for judges and police officers (GRECO, 2002:24). In addition, the importance of strengthening the cooperation and coordination role of the PPO was also emphasized (EC, 2003:15). Measures have been taken to improve training of prosecutors as well as judges and police officers, but the recommendation on establishing a single unit within the PPO specifically dealing with corruption cases was not followed (GRECO, 2004a:8). Although, as mentioned above, other institutions fill some of the functions traditionally carried out by the Ombudsman, this has been seen as inadequate.The importance of the Ombudsman lies in the fact that, as an independent institution, it can be considered an additional instrument for preventing and combating corruption.This is because the Ombudsman\u2019s role covers a different area of activities than that of already existing institutions as the Ombudsman focuses on protecting citizens from abuse by the public administration.It is reported that the institution of an Ombudsman is being considered (GRECO,2004b:13). A key lesson learned for anti-corruption institutions is the importance of gaining the trust of the public through demonstrating effectiveness by producing results. As GRECO notes, the previous lack of convictions in corruption cases resulted in the public losing confidence in the efforts being made and in the institutions tasked with preventing and combating corruption themselves (GRECO, 2002:26). Hopefully this will be redressed by the KNAB, which has also placed greater emphasis on public relations and awareness-raising. It is noted in the EC monitoring report, however, that while public awareness of corruption and the role and functions of the KNAB is generally rising, continued efforts are needed to increase awareness among the law enforcement bodies, the business sector and the community in general (EC, 2003:15).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c2be2bf-1139-4b90-b4bb-1164cd406391": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c2be2bf-1139-4b90-b4bb-1164cd406391", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption -

The EU has also been one of the driving forces in the fight against corruption in Lithuania (Transparency International, 2003:177-178). Since the 1990s, Lithuania has put in place most of the components of an anti-corruption legislation framework (OSI, 2002:356). In addition, Lithuania has put in place a wide range of agencies and bodies, in particular, in the area of law enforcement,in order to prevent,detect and counter corruption (GRECO,2002:5).The most important of these was the Special Investigation Service (SIS) established within the Ministry of Interior in 1997 (GRECO, 2002:8).In 2000, the adoption of the Law on the Special Investigation Service saw the SIS become what has been considered the only truly independent anti-corruption agency in the countries which entered into the European Union in 2004 as well as those seeking accession. Two further important developments were the approval by the Seimas of the National Anti-corruption Programme in January 2002 and the adoption of the Prevention of Corruption Law in May 2002. The comprehensive National Anti-corruption Programme sets out a three-pronged approach to combating corruption, namely: \ufffd Prevention \u2013 including prevention of political corruption and conflict of interest, administrative corruption in tax and customs authorities, healthcare, law enforcement and judicial bodies, and encouraging public procurement and privatization, international cooperation, and public involvement in corruption prevention. \ufffd Investigation \u2013 increasing the effectiveness of investigations, ranging from limiting immunity provisions to improving information flows between the various institutions involved in investigation and prosecution. \ufffd Education \u2013 including introducing anti-corruption components into secondary and higher education curricula. 58 Lithuania Lithuania placed 44th out of 159 countries on Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perceptions Index 2005. Although it has been acknowledged that Lithuania has made significant progress in addressing the issue of corruption, the European Commission, in its Comprehensive monitoring report on Lithuania\u2019s preparations for membership, emphasizes that the fight against corruption should continue to receive high priority (2003:54). In the mapping of corruption undertaken by the Lithuanian Chapter of Transparency International in 2004,it was found that a majority of citizens perceive corruption as threat to the state.The European Commission concludes that \u201ccorruption remains a source of concern, in particular in the customs, public procurement, traffic police and health sectors as well as in the judiciary (2003:13). Although high-level political corruption is a relatively minor problem, administrative corruption remains at relatively high levels (OSI, 2002:351). Mandate and institutional links of the key anti-corruption institution The Special Investigation Service (SIS) was initially established under the Ministry of Interior in 1997,with the main function of collecting and using intelligence about criminal associations and corrupt public officials, in addition to carrying out corruption prevention (GRECO, 2002:8). Following the adoption of the SIS Law in 2000, the SIS \u2013 then accountable to the Government \u2013 became a statutory body accountable to the President and the Seimas (Article 2[1],SIS Law) in order to increase its independence, strengthen its effectiveness and increase its ability to combat corruption in the executive branch. As such, the SIS is obligated to report in writing, at least twice a year, to the President and the Chairman of the Seimas on its activities (Article 8[7], SIS Law).The SIS Law also provides for the objectives and legal basis for the activities of the SIS as well as its tasks and functions (Article 1, SIS Law). The Director of the SIS is appointed for a term of five years by the President by and with the consent of the Seimas. The candidates for the post of Director of the SIS are nominated to the Seimas by the President. The President may dismiss the Director of the SIS by and with the consent of the Seimas in accordance with the provisions of Article 12 of the SIS Law (Article 11[1], SIS Law). The First Deputy Director and the Deputy Director of the SIS are appointed and dismissed by the President on the advice of the Director (Article 11[2], SIS Law). The SIS is divided into a number of divisions and departments, including the Department of Intelligence Activities, the Department of Corruption Prevention and four field offices, each of which has its own Investigation Division, as well as a number of departments and divisions primarily performing internal functions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f3500fde-0cc8-496f-85da-972ba86d303b": {"__data__": {"id_": "f3500fde-0cc8-496f-85da-972ba86d303b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "323c3ec04fea0e8df128aeb519ede3f7eff4549337754f62d4a4f346b158d29d"}, "2": {"node_id": "9b4b7610-f474-47cb-9da7-74434aa7d26f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0f8ee58853b572bf6d4d3ba88fa70f9599e7c45fcb70a2786c1dd144b1a61c14"}}, "hash": "a3703205f1a5d7c97b6016e6e051561e1f348576ff4765c556f188f8b2fc3497", "text": "1 The SIS has been designed as the main anti-corruption body, with responsibilities including coordinating the National Anti-Corruption Programme, detecting and preventing corruption offences as well as ensuring the coordination of anti-corruption measures within State institutions and between them and society (Open Society Institute, 2002:367 and GRECO, 2002:8).The main functions of the SIS, as provided by Article 8 of the SIS Law, are to: \ufffd Carry out operational activities", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "48e4c2ae-8281-4bd3-9f86-df2607cd45eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "48e4c2ae-8281-4bd3-9f86-df2607cd45eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "93eaea879b9f7be9e980c3654f9544dcc1c85bf2e4065c4a9fe5da67ad8e8d42"}, "3": {"node_id": "3c281ca1-4312-4105-b8f1-dfed9cc7d1b4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c98661437d4aab6f6fbc0cc399d1de2efaf4408c0af998f7cb096d74ad0a75ce"}}, "hash": "2e7198216304faea4d940ab69cb22e6ced788f1d1803e45e2d3ff8f40508f791", "text": "in detecting and preventing corruption-related criminal acts; \ufffd Conduct inquiry and preliminary investigations into corruption-related criminal acts; \ufffd Cooperate with other law enforcement institutions in the manner laid down by legal acts; \ufffd Collect, store and analyse information about corruption and other related social and economic phenomena; and \ufffd On the basis of available information, prepare and implement crime control and prevention programmes. In carrying out the functions assigned to the SIS, its officers have been given extensive powers, including monitoring of correspondence, electronic communications and premises; entering the premises of any type of enterprise; and carrying out inspections at border points (Article 13, SIS Law). Article 16(2) of the SIS Law explicitly states that \u201cstate institutions and agencies or their employees, political parties, public organizations and movements, the mass media, other natural or legal persons\u201d are prohibited from interfering with operations or other activities of SIS officers. Inquiries and preliminary investigations conducted by the SIS (by its Investigation Divisions) are controlled,organized and supervised by the Prosecution Office (Article 22[2], SIS Law). In order to ensure their independence, these Investigation Divisions report directly to the Prosecutor General and cannot even be influenced by the Director of the SIS (GRECO, 2002:9). In addition, Article 15 of the Prevention of Corruption Law provides that the SIS shall: \ufffd Participate in the development of and, together with other State and Municipal agencies, implement the National Anti-Corruption Programme; 59 Country Briefs: Lithuania 1 These are the Internal Audit Group; Accountancy; the Division of Legal Affairs, Personnel and Internal Investigations; the Information Technology Division; the Organizational Division; the Administrative Support Division; and the Administrative Procedures Division.There is also an Advisor to the Director as well as a Press Officer. \ufffd Put forward proposals to the President, the Seimas and the Government as to the introduction and improvement of new legislation necessary for the implementation of corruption prevention activities; \ufffd Take part in the Government\u2019s discharge of its functions of coordination and supervision of State and Municipal agencies\u2019 corruption prevention activities; and \ufffd Together with other State and Municipal agencies, implement corruption prevention measures. From previously having functioned as a law enforcement body primarily focusing on repressive anti-corruption methods, the SIS has, in line with the priorities set out in the NACP, increasingly come to adopt a three-pronged approach in the fight against corruption that focuses on prevention, investigation and public education (GRECO, 2002:23-24 and SIS, 2004:3). This development will be further discussed under the heading Lessons learned. Operational arrangements Article 12 of the Prevention of Corruption Law provides that the implementation of corruption prevention measures, as outlined in the law, shall be carried out by the Government, the Chief Officials Ethics Commission (COEC) and other state and municipal agencies2, in addition to the SIS. As prescribed by Article 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Law, the Government plays a important role in combating corruption in that it is tasked with: ensuring that corruption prevention measures are implemented by the ministries; developing the National Anti-Corruption Programme together with the SIS (submitted to and approved by the Seimas); and making recommendations to the Seimas for the introduction and amendment of laws and other legislation necessary for the prevention of corruption. The COEC \u2013 established in 1997 \u2013 is an independent body accountable to the Seimas. The commission consists of five members \u2013 one appointed by the President, one by the Chairman of the Seimas, one by the Prime Minister and two by the Minister of Justice. The Chairman is appointed by the Seimas. The Commission is supported in its work by a six-person Secretariat (GRECO, 2002:18). One of the main functions of the COEC is to monitor and control the adherence by public servants of the APPIPS Law,which is intended to ensure that \u201cholders of public office should make decisions solely in terms of the public interest, securing the impartiality of the decisions being taken and preventing the emergence and spread of corruption in the public service\u201d(Article 1, APPIPS Law). Article 4 of the APPIPS Law also provides that senior officials are required to provide declarations of private interest (i.e. property and income declarations) which are filed with the COEC (Article 5[6]). The Commission analyses these declarations and may also initiate investigations into the adherence of the APPIPS Law on the basis of any information received. Based on analyses and investigations carried out, the Commission may recommend actions including fines or termination of employment.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3c281ca1-4312-4105-b8f1-dfed9cc7d1b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "3c281ca1-4312-4105-b8f1-dfed9cc7d1b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "93eaea879b9f7be9e980c3654f9544dcc1c85bf2e4065c4a9fe5da67ad8e8d42"}, "2": {"node_id": "48e4c2ae-8281-4bd3-9f86-df2607cd45eb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2e7198216304faea4d940ab69cb22e6ced788f1d1803e45e2d3ff8f40508f791"}}, "hash": "c98661437d4aab6f6fbc0cc399d1de2efaf4408c0af998f7cb096d74ad0a75ce", "text": "Such actions must be brought before a court.The COEC may also pass on information to the law enforcement bodies for further investigation (GRECO, 2002:18 and OSI, 2002:364).

In October 2001, an Anti-corruption Commission of the Seimas was established as a successor to the previous Commission on Economic Crime Investigation. The main responsibility of the Commission is to monitor the situation of corruption in the Institutional Arrangments to Combat Corruption: A Comparative Study 60 2 The Prevention of Corruption Law also mentions \u2018Non-governmental Organizations\u2019in Article 12.

The activities of the SC are regulated by the Law on State Control (Article 1). The SC is the supreme government audit institution and is accountable to the Seimas (Article 5[1]). The SC is headed by the Auditor General (Article 6), who is appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Seimas. The main functions of the SC are to supervise the lawfulness and effectiveness of management and use of state property and carrying out of the State budget; and to ensure that government auditing conforms to international standards (Article 4).Should the SC find any irregularities during revision, it has an investigative function before such a case is submitted to the prosecutors (GRECO, 2002:20).The SC is independent in carrying out its functions (Article 5). The fight against corruption is considered an important task of the SC, in terms of detection as well as in cooperation with law enforcement bodies (GRECO, 2002:20). The basic legal principles and activities of the Seimas Ombudsmen and the organizational structure and powers of the SOO are provided by the Law on the Seimas Ombudsmen (Article 1).The SOO was established as an independent state institution (Article 10) consisting of five Ombudsmen,each responsible for monitoring a particular field of public functions,appointed for a term of four years from among candidates nominated by the Speaker of the Seimas (Article 6).The Ombudsmen may only be removed from office by a majority vote of the Seimas (Article 7).The Ombudsmen are required to submit an annual report to the Seimas (Article 25). The main function of the Ombudsmen is to investigate citizens\u2019complaints concerning the abuse of office and bureaucracy of state and local government and administration as well as military institutions, except as provided in the Law (Article 4). Following an investigation,the Ombudsmen may give recommendations to the authorities that have been investigated as well as submit cases to investigative authorities if evidence of crime has been found (Article 22).The Ombudsmen have also acted to educate the public on its rights and how to exert them (GRECO, 2002:26). The judiciary is independent both in law and in practice (OSI,2001:377).There are no special procedures for corruption-related cases in the courts and the courts lack special expertise on corruption. Corruption cases are investigated in accordance with ordinary procedures for pre-trial investigation (GRECO, 2002:15).

The prosecution system is highly hierarchical and the Prosecutor General has extensive powers to intervene at all levels (GRECO, 2002:12-13). There is a Department of Organised Crime and Corruption Investigation established within the Prosecution Service, consisting of staff units specialized in organized crime and corruption investigation within the different prosecutors\u2019 offices. Together, they make up a unified and centralized prosecution system with regard to these types of offences.The Department is entrusted with commencing and conducting prosecution against organized crime and corruption-related crimes; to supervise the activities of interrogation and pre-trial investigation bodies focusing on corruption; conduct pre-trial investigation in corruption cases; back the state accusation in court; investigate relevant corruption cases; and coordinate actions of interrogation and pre-trial investigation in respect to corruption-related offences. The Department may also take over cases from the general prosecutors (GRECO, 2002:14). The Police have a general obligation to investigate any crime brought to their attention, including that of corruption. Corruption cases, however, are typically submitted to the SIS or the Department of Organised Crime and Corruption Investigation (GRECO, 2002:10). The various law enforcement institutions have signed agreements in order to create more effective cooperation and exchange of information in detecting and investigating corruption-related offences (EC, 2003:14). It is the prosecutor, however, who is tasked with distributing criminal cases regarding the competence of the various law enforcement bodies. It is thus the SIS that is generally charged with the investigation of corruption cases (GRECO, 2004:7). The activities of the SIS in this regard are closely monitored by the Prosecution Service (GRECO, 2002:24). It is the Prosecutor who brings corruption cases to the court (GRECO, 2002:16). 61 Country Briefs: Lithuania Lessons learned As stated both in GRECO\u2019s Evaluation Report on Lithuania (2002:22) and the European Commission\u2019s Comprehensive monitoring report on Lithuania\u2019s preparations for membership (2003:13),Lithuania has taken extensive action against corruption and, overall, the anti-corruption policy, including legal framework and institutional setup, is well on track, and capacity within the anti-corruption field has been strengthened. There remain, however, a number of concerns and potential areas of improvement. The European Commission concludes that \u201cfurther efforts are needed to speed up the implementation of the national and sectoral programmes, with a focus on the municipal level, and to ensure sufficient resources\u201d(p. 13-14). One concern is that there is a general lack of information on corruption, including research as well as data and official statistics.It is argued that data and research facilitating an adequate assessment of the corruption situation would assist in the adoption and implementation of anti-corruption measures (GRECO, 2002:22). Increasing attention has come to be placed on research and the collection of data and statistics. One example of this is the cooperation between the SIS and Transparency International in conducting sociological surveys of corruption (GRECO, 2004:2-3). Although the SIS has generally been praised, one concern has been that the Service is primarily a law enforcement agency. This has been a concern particularly in relation to the SIS\u2019s role in coordinating the National Anti-Corruption Programme, with its emphasis on prevention and education in addition to that of investigation. The GRECO Evaluation Report even suggested that a specific agency could be created and given responsibility for the National Anti-Corruption Programme. It was considered that too much emphasis was being placed on enforcement and that greater emphasis should be placed on prevention and public education both within the SIS and other bodies involved in fighting corruption (EC,2003:14 and GRECO, 2002:23). Although the responsibility for the National Anti-Corruption Programme remains with the SIS, the creation of its Corruption Prevention Department has allowed the Service to place greater emphasis on both prevention and public education (GRECO,2004:3-4).The Ombudsmen have also been playing an important role in public education (GRECO,2004:26). A further concern has been the lack of coordination between investigative bodies in corruption cases and that there has not been a clear procedure for the distribution of corruption cases.When pre-trial investigations have dealt with corruption cases linked to other offences,coordination has been even more difficult.Furthermore,the quality of pre-trial investigation has been considered to be lacking, leading to courts needing to send cases back for expert examinations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "851c43f9-a229-451b-850a-5b895fa13f3a": {"__data__": {"id_": "851c43f9-a229-451b-850a-5b895fa13f3a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d650ef1637696478e0fd29483e382a0daaaf8128e56d69b12c6d8a1be867ea23"}, "2": {"node_id": "384a1668-d063-4864-8aa8-c7eba4a41f37", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "566b744039007a9b3705ac900d465fe1e1982b63205c02adfe75dd6f281e0cc0"}}, "hash": "f75d9ebc6551ecb9894833b77c8c8cc5cf139f8857384d0d0d98606a9640068a", "text": "This also contributed to lengthy court proceedings,leading to backlogs in corruption cases (GRECO,2002:24-25).Measures have been taken to address these concerns through the designation of the prosecutor as the authority that distributes criminal cases as well as providing specialized training to investigation staff (GRECO,2004:6-7).The European Commission,however,maintains that further efforts have to be made \u201cin order to establish a proper and efficient network for", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9cad3b1c-0671-48dc-80a1-e653a809e722": {"__data__": {"id_": "9cad3b1c-0671-48dc-80a1-e653a809e722", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d00c3b0f2f50d7c22edaf5c5041a71ee68bdb3a37705c6285d4bab1233512c39"}, "3": {"node_id": "d56793b3-ffdc-48b7-8971-f80d1208c94b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fc40a37ec48e29cb006ec070f344a78248ceab2ae5cc65280900697718c4c1e3"}}, "hash": "f006aa9cea71661b80d1651e26ddffb47b3b9e7e0f8be4d35b8cfd668458370c", "text": "effective exchange of information\u201d between law enforcement institutions (2003:14).

Upon independence in 1957, one of the first actions of the Government was to conduct a study of corruption in the country. Upon completion of the study, measures were taken to combat corruption, including the setting up of a special force to investigate corruption cases (Kassim Bin Mohamad, 2005:3). This was followed by the adoption in 1961 of the Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA) and the establishment of the Anti-Corruption Agency (ACA) in 1967.Following the passing of the National Bureau of Investigation Act in 1973, the ACA was renamed the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI). Although this entailed no real changes in the mandate,it was perceived by the public that the NBI had been given a wider mandate then the ACA previously had, also covering, among other things, gambling and smuggling.With the adoption of the 1982 Anti-corruption Agency Act, the institution again came to be named the ACA in order to reflect the actual function of the agency \u2013 the prevention of corruption. In addition to the ACA, several other institutions have been established in order to address the issue of corruption and the strengthening of integrity, such as the Public Complaints Bureau (PCB) established in 1971. In line with national and international developments,the Act was revised in 1971 and repealed and replaced by the Anti-corruption Act in 1997 (Kassim Bin Mohamed, 2003). The Anti-corruption Act introduced more severe punishments for acts of corruption. Under the Anti-corruption Act, both giving as well as taking a bribe is an offence, and any officer of a public body to whom a bribe is offered is required to report this to the ACA or a police officer (Sections 10 and 17).

In order to promote and coordinate the implementation of the NIP, the Integrity Institute of Malaysia (IIM) was established. 63 Malaysia Mandate and institutional links of the key anti-corruption institution The Anti Corruption Agency (ACA) began its operations on 1 October 1967.The ACA is the primary institution charged with combating corruption in the public and private sector, adopting a three-pronged approach of investigation, prevention and education. The Anti-corruption Act provides for the mandate and function of the ACA. Organizationally, the ACA is placed under the Prime Minister\u2019s Department. The ACA is headed by a Director-General appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (the King) on the advice of the Prime Minister from among members of the public service (Subsection 3[2],Anti-corruption Act).The Director-General does not have security of tenure as s/he holds office at the pleasure of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong,subject to the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "06b4dfce-ed4b-48f4-bb42-f852c245d8ca": {"__data__": {"id_": "06b4dfce-ed4b-48f4-bb42-f852c245d8ca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "94cb86ac76bba13eb0d7bbd7e17274d29388a8991c282da116d3711f87e3d312"}, "3": {"node_id": "2a6e96c5-3a8a-4e0c-ba29-7f08f1ebbc6b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5d8642ffa8968540d208c83bec7cac8eaeecfbbf641347abb06ce6081586291f"}}, "hash": "9a4751cdfbceb1ce8d1ef37b31d8b00eec598911bf899030a0c632bddfe097bc", "text": "advice of the Prime Minister (Subsection 3[4], Anti-corruption Act). For the purpose of discipline, the Director-General is deemed to be a member of the public service (Subsection 3[5], Anti-corruption Act). In accordance with the Anti-corruption Act, the Direct-General is responsible for the direction,control and supervision of all matters relating to the ACA (Subsection 38[6]).The Director General is supported by two Deputy Director-Generals.The ACA is made up of a head office comprising nine divisions as well as a state office in each of Malaysia\u2019s 14 states \u2013 each of which is headed by a State Director.In the states,many sub-branches have been formed in order to expand the presence of the ACA in more remote areas of the country. The establishment of additional sub-branches is currently being planned (Kassim Bin Mohamad, 2005:3). The main functions of the ACA are: \ufffd To receive and consider any report of corrupt practices and conduct open as well as covert investigations into reports as is considered practicable; \ufffd To detect and investigate any suspected offence, attempt at committing an offence or conspiracy to commit any offence under the Anti-corruption Act; \ufffd To gather evidence in order to prove the commission of corruption, abuse of powers and/or disciplinary misconduct; \ufffd To ensure that public interest and justice are safeguarded under the relevant national laws and regulations through legal counsel and fair trial in corruption and abuse of power cases; \ufffd To assist heads of public and private sectors in handling disciplinary action against officers who have violated work regulations and the code of ethics reported in the ACA Disciplinary Report; \ufffd To examine the practices, systems and procedures of public bodies in order to facilitate the discovery of offences under the Anti-corruption Act as well as to secure the revision of such practices, systems and procedures which, in the opinion of the Director-General, may be conducive to corruption; \ufffd To advise heads of public bodies of changes in practices, systems and procedures which, in the opinion of the Director-General, are necessary in order to reduce the likelihood of corruption; \ufffd To oversee the selection and approval of eligible officials to high-level posts within the public sector as well as certain in stitutions in order to ensure that only candidates who have not been involved in corruption and abuse of powers are confirmed; and \ufffd To educate the public, i.e. raise awareness of the harmful effects of corruption as well as enhance and foster public support in combating corruption. The officers of the ACA are given far-reaching powers in order to fulfil the functions of the Agency. In accordance with Subsection 7(2) of the Anti-corruption Act, \u201can officer of the Agency shall have, for the purpose of [the Anti-corruption Act], all the powers and immunities of a police officer appointed under the Police Act 1967\u201d. Senior officers of the ACA are given the same right as an officer in charge of a Police District to give orders and issue certificates (Subsection 7[4],Anti-corruption Act). When an officer of the ACA has reason to believe that an offence under the Anti-corruption Act has or will be committed,s/he may initiate an investigation and, in doing so, exercise all the powers of investigation as provided under the Anti-corruption Act and the Criminal Procedure Code (Subsection 21[3], Anti-corruption Act). Section 22 of the Anti-corruption Act provides that, in conducting an investigation, an officer of the Agency has the power to call witnesses \u2013 who are required to attend as well as disclose all the information in respect of the matter for which s/he is being questioned \u2013 as well as require any person to produce documents, etc. This right does not, however, extend to banker\u2019s books.

The ACA has put in place \u2018reception of information\u2019 channels in order to ensure that the public can easily lodge complaints. These include a post office box number for which no postage is required and to which complaints can be made anonymously as well as a 24-hour manned national toll-free number. In order to ensure that the public is aware of these complaint channels, these means of contact are featured in national newspapers as part of the ACA\u2019s public education and awareness raising, which also includes advertisements on both radio and television calling for the public\u2019s cooperation in the fight against corruption (Kassim Bin Mohamad, 2005:5). Operational arrangements Although the ACA has the overarching responsibility for combating corruption,in 1998,the Prime Minister directed all Federal Departments and Ministries, as well as State Governments, Departments and Agencies, to establish Integrity Management Committees (IMC) in support of the agency\u2019s work.The function of the IMCs is to work towards the prevention of corruption, abuse of power and mismanagement through addressing issues of good governance. Furthermore, the aim of the IMCs is to instil internal controls against corruption.The ACA,together with the Modernisation,Administrative,Manpower Planning Unit (MAMPU), have been appointed joint coordinators of the national level IMC.Through this mechanism, the ACA is also given a direct channel to the heads of departments and agencies, allowing for a closer cooperation in the fight against corruption (Kassim Bin Mohamad, 2005:4). Any prosecution of an offence under the Anti-corruption Act can only be instituted by or with the consent of the Public Prosecutor (Section 50,Anti-corruption Act).(3) In accordance with Article 145(3) of the Federal Constitution,it is the Attorney General who \u201cshall have power,exercisable at his discretion,to institute,conduct or discontinue any proceedings for an offence, other than proceedings before a Syariah court, a native court or a court-martial\u201d. The Attorney General is also head of the Attorney General\u2019s Chambers of Malaysia. The Attorney General is appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong on the advice of the Prime Minister. In order to become the Attorney General, s/he must be qualified to be a judge of the Federal Court. Within the Attorney General\u2019s Chambers, it is the Prosecution Division which is tasked with exercising the powers of the Attorney General as the Public Prosecutor in accordance with Section 376 of the Criminal Procedure Code.Additional functions of the Prosecution Division also include: \ufffd To conduct prosecutions in the Session Courts and Magistrate Courts; \ufffd To conduct criminal trials, appeals, applications and revisions in the High Court; \ufffd To conduct appeals and applications in the Court of Appeal and the Federal Court; \ufffd To give advice and instructions to all enforcement agencies in relation to investigations and criminal prosecutions; and \ufffd To peruse investigation papers and to decide whether or not to institute prosecutions. The Public Prosecutor is given additional powers under the Anti-corruption Act which are relevant in the fight against corruption.The Public Prosecutor may authorize officers of the ACA to inspect banker\u2019s books and receive other material and information from a bank (Section 31, Anti-corruption Act).The Public Prosecutor may also authorize officers to enter premises and conduct searches of the premises as well as persons on the premises. Should an officer of the ACA believe that it is impractical to seek the authorization of the Public Prosecutor, s/he may proceed with entering and searching without having received any authorization (Section 23, Anti-corruption Act). When the Public Prosecutor is satisfied with the information given by the ACA, s/he may also, in certain circumstances, order the freezing or seizure of assets (Sections 33 and 34, Anti-corruption Act). When a person is suspected of having committed an offence under the Anti-corruption Act,the Public Prosecutor may require him/her to provide a declaration of assets. If the Public Prosecutor has reason to believe that a relative, associate or any other person may be available to assist in the investigation, the Public Prosecutor may request that they also give a declaration of assets.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2beab4c6-e114-4c7b-8c09-87e6cc6270da": {"__data__": {"id_": "2beab4c6-e114-4c7b-8c09-87e6cc6270da", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "85b120acab3e094b00ef748bf44a402bbcdacc2fa19660d0eded8a3988d3a978"}, "2": {"node_id": "29c24e68-a464-413d-81db-a7680ee57365", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2146b7a65b2043e5e502caff0575952b9a61392212101a4fac3735fe56bd8a12"}}, "hash": "eb1060ee5cdd7a52dcd8849c2cbbdf0362d2bce5d48460ae5b49bcb86993e740", "text": "In these cases, the Public Prosecutor may also request banks to provide information on the above mentioned individuals\u2019assets.Should the Public Prosecutor have reasonable grounds to believe that any officer of a public body required 65 Country Briefs: Malaysia to declare his/her assets has assets which are excessive in relation to his/her income and considering other relevant circumstances, the Prosecutor may request that person to give an explanation for how these assets were acquired.Should the officer fail to give a satisfactory explanation, s/he is guilty of an offence and shall, if convicted, be given a sentence within the same range as", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "67ff0df7-c256-45be-b7d4-31b6b9e163ad": {"__data__": {"id_": "67ff0df7-c256-45be-b7d4-31b6b9e163ad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4ff1b91639b59b7f46555391769c4809b31ba799d94ddf6ede0145108f7de56e"}}, "hash": "4ff1b91639b59b7f46555391769c4809b31ba799d94ddf6ede0145108f7de56e", "text": "for those convicted of corruption.The same sentence may also be given to an individual who does not comply with the investigation of the Public Prosecutor (Section 32, Anti-corruption Act).

The National Audit Department (NAD) is headed by the Auditor General, who is appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (the King), on the advice of the Prime Minister (Article 105[1] of the Federal Constitution). Although the NAD is organizationally placed within the Prime Minister\u2019s Department,the NAD,through the Auditor-General,is independent in that s/he enjoys security of tenure and reports to the House or Representatives through the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (Articles 105 [3] and 107[1] of the Federal Constitution). Furthermore, the Auditor-General is not subjected to the jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission (Article 109 of the Federal Constitution).In accordance with Article 106(1),it is the Auditor General who is responsible for auditing and reporting on the accounts of the Federation and of the States.In accordance with Section 7 of the Audit Act,the Auditor,in performing his/her functions under the Federal Constitution,may,among other things,call upon any person for any explanations and information which the Auditor General may require in order to enable him/her to discharge his/her duties. The Auditor shall have access to all records required in order to carry out the audit. Furthermore, the Auditor General may authorize any public officer to conduct any inquiry,examination or audit on his/her behalf and to report on these to him/her as well as confer any of his/her powers under Section 7 in writing to a public officer.It is through this last provision that the staff of the NAD are delegated the powers of the Auditor-General.Through this, the NAD is entrusted with the task of ensuring the existence of accountability in the administration and management of public funds through the audit of accounts and activities of the Federal Governments, State Government, Statutory Bodies, Local Authorities as well as other bodies.The staff of the NAD are members of the Malaysian Civil Service. Outside of the role prescribed by the Audit Act, the Auditor-General is also involved with other public agencies in developing a suitable public sector governance framework. The Public Complaints Bureau (PCB) was established in 1971 and is a division within the Prime Minister\u2019s Department. The PCB serves as a mechanism through which members of the public can lodge complaints on malpractices and abuse of power in the public service.The PCB is headed by a Director-General together with a Deputy Director-General.There is also a Permanent Committee of Public Complaints (PCPC) which has the function and responsibility to formulate policies on system for managing public complaints; to consider and make decisions on reports on public complaints made by the PCB; to direct the heads of the authorities concerned to attend meetings of PCPC to explain specific complaints or cases; and to direct the authorities concerned to take remedial action based on the findings of the investigation into a complaint.The PCPC has the administrative powers to request and obtain information; check files and related documents; and seek explanations from the officers concerned. Lessons learned The adoption of the current legislation \u2013 the Anti-corruption Act \u2013 was a result of perceived weaknesses in the previous legislation which it came to replace.In particular,the previous legislation was considered ineffective because the sentences for corruption were too lenient.In addition,the officers of the ACA did not have sufficient power to fulfil their mandate to combat corruption in the public sector.This included the fact that there were few possibilities of seizing assets that had been gained through corrupt activities. This has been addressed in the current Act, as well as the introduction of a Section making the possession of unexplained wealth and property an offence for investigation. (Kassim Bin Mohamed, 2003). The success of the ACA has been attributed to the political will of the government, together with a continuous strengthening of anti-corruption legislation and the mandate of the ACA to effectively combat corruption (Kassim Bin Mohamad, 2005:5 and 10). As mentioned above, the Government has acknowledged that it is necessary to address the issue of integrity in society as a whole and not only within the public sector.In view of this,the Government has adopted the NIP, which will serve as an action plan for all sectors in order to enhance integrity and build an ethical society. An important aspect of the NIP is that it is grounded in the principles of the Federal Constitution as well as other guiding policies.This should ensure that it is in line with national priorities,principles and values.Furthermore,the NIP addresses corruption within the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c9360f48-0dd6-4fa9-b012-ffa373a1ef31": {"__data__": {"id_": "c9360f48-0dd6-4fa9-b012-ffa373a1ef31", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1fa347823c793d1092d0299e619a78f420b33b89142d6624c0e3a781fbadd953"}, "3": {"node_id": "9912de51-afae-4b93-9600-9b3d2bdd59ab", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1a862e4fa9ad1acd19364a8ef3319482cbf2f78ec559fcb88da80b23f4398d37"}}, "hash": "2cca214146cae6d2fd7127601ff3db3dbd71c1c9250f2ed3600b0565543994dd", "text": "public as well as private sectors, Institutional Arrangments to Combat Corruption: A Comparative Study 66 and importantly,it focuses on the family,which also brings the youth into focus.In contrast with what is often the case,the NIP does not lose sight of the rationale for improving integrity, accountability and integrity \u2013 to fight poverty and improve the quality of life of the people. As mentioned above, in order to effectively promote and coordinate the implementation of the NIP, the Integrity Institute of Malaysia (IIM) has been established.The IIM has also been established in light of the fact that the ACA faces a major challenge in strengthening its work in promoting awareness among members of the public of the dangers of corruption and abuse of power.The weakness of the ACA in the area of education may be explained by the fact that the Agency has primarily focused on investigation and prevention of corruption.Thus,the role of the IIM is also to enhance awareness about corruption and the need for transparency in the public service (ADB and OECD, 2004:55). However, the IIM as a newly-established institution will require increased capacity as well as additional resources in order for it to be able to effectively fulfil its mandate.The ACA itself is also increasingly focusing on prevention and education as it is recognizing that corruption cannot be curbed and controlled purely through a punitive approach (Kassim Bin Mohamad, 2005:9).

Nigeria has become a society in which corruption is institutionalized as well as systemic (Agbu, 2004:22).The critical importance of addressing this rampant corruption is evident in that corruption is seen as a major factor in the country\u2019s prevalent poverty and an important contributing factor to the difficulties of life experienced by its citizens (Osborne, 2005:3). A 2001 survey conducted by a consortium of institutions showed that households perceived corruption as being second only to unemployment as an impediment to development.The urgency of combating corruption was also acknowledged by President Olusegun Obasanjo, who, in his inaugural speech following the return of the country to democracy in 1999, identified corruption as a major obstacle to development and promised to take action. Subsequently, the President, on assuming office, initiated the passage of the Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences (CPRO) Act in June 2000 (Agbu, 2004:9). The CPRO Act established the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) as the apex body responsible for fighting corruption and other related offences.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9912de51-afae-4b93-9600-9b3d2bdd59ab": {"__data__": {"id_": "9912de51-afae-4b93-9600-9b3d2bdd59ab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1fa347823c793d1092d0299e619a78f420b33b89142d6624c0e3a781fbadd953"}, "2": {"node_id": "c9360f48-0dd6-4fa9-b012-ffa373a1ef31", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2cca214146cae6d2fd7127601ff3db3dbd71c1c9250f2ed3600b0565543994dd"}}, "hash": "1a862e4fa9ad1acd19364a8ef3319482cbf2f78ec559fcb88da80b23f4398d37", "text": "Controversy, however, came to surround the ICPC from the outset, with the constitutionality of the Commission being challenged.While this was before the courts, the ICPC could neither investigate nor prosecute alleged corrupt acts.Two years later,the courts ruled in favour of the ICPC (Osborne,2005:10).There were yet further delays when the Senate in 2003 voted to replace the CPRO Act with an Act which would have weakened the mandate of the ICPC1. However, this replacement act was declared null and void by a federal high court (TI,2004:225).It was thus not until the beginning of 2004 that the ICPC was free to operate as had been intended. In its first four years, the ICPC received only some 1,200 reports.This low number of reports has been attributed to cumbersome reporting procedures (Osborne, 2005:10). Of the reports received, the Commission has investigated only around half,mainly due to a lack of funds (Agbu,2004:10).There is a perception that the ICPC has performed below expectations (TI,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ccb55735-529b-4fc2-a1a8-e497fce70a5e": {"__data__": {"id_": "ccb55735-529b-4fc2-a1a8-e497fce70a5e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c420644340630ec63375585dc40ecb69784aa3f1a0e4197f38bb82ad83c98369"}, "3": {"node_id": "f38ab521-8ab9-423e-8590-4d7bc2f3e0fc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "02a4d09f362ba8d853597f5384dcc64c3c45de8d392ddfda2bc60c30574e6bc2"}}, "hash": "46a630c5992e051a285a5053735af43d55bc335d248895cbe7f9728011252b77", "text": "2004: 225) and is not acting diligently to investigate corruption allegations of high-profile suspects (Agbu, 2004:11).

This is reflected in the unwillingness to prosecute high-profile individuals. Additional obstacles also include a slow judicial process (Agbu,2004:22-23).According to Osborne,the fact remains that \u201cmany people acquiesce in corrupt patterns and behaviour and make little or no effort to help change them\u201d(2005:5). Mandate and institutional links of the key anti-corruption institution The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission is the apex body for combating corruption and other related offences.The Commission was established in September 2000 by virtue of Subsection 3(1) of the CPRO Act as a corporate body (Subsection 3[2]).The independence of the Commission is ensured by Subsection 3(14), which states that \u201cthe Commission shall, in [the] discharge of its functions under [the CPRO] Act, not be subjected to the direction or control of any other person or authority\u201d.The Act further defines corruption, prescribes the punishment for corruption-related offences as well as sets out the mandate and function of the ICPC. In accordance with Subsection 3(3),the ICPC consists of one Chairperson and twelve members.The Chairperson and the other members of the Commission are appointed by the President upon the confirmation of the Senate (Subsection 3[6]). In accordance with Subsection 3(8), the Chairman or any member of the ICPC can be removed by the President acting on the address of at least two-thirds of members of the Senate. The Commission may not begin to discharge its duties until all members have declared their assets and liabilities.The Chairperson is required to have held or be qualified to hold office as a judge of a superior court of record. The remaining twelve members of the Commission shall be: two retired police officers (not below the rank of Commissioner of Police); two legal practitioners (with at least ten years of post-call experience); two retired public servants (not below the rank of Director); two women; and two youths (not below 21 or above 30 years of age at the time of his/her appointment) (Subsection 3[3]). A Secretary, appointed by the President, is responsible, under the direction of the Chairperson,for the general administration and control of the staff of the ICPC (Subsection 4[6]).In accordance with Subsection 3(12), the Commission has the power to appoint, dismiss as well as exercise discipline over its own staff and shall, for this purpose, adopt its own rules. As the apex body for combating corruption, the ICPC is mandated to prosecute and prescribe punishment for corrupt practices and other related offences. The main responsibilities of the Commission, as provided by the Section 6 of the CPRO Act, can be divided into three areas, namely: \ufffd Investigation \ufffd To receive reports and, where reasonable grounds exist for suspecting that an individual has conspired to commit or has committed an offence under the CPRO Act or any other law covering corruption or related offences, to investigate and, in the appropriate cases, prosecute said individual.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f38ab521-8ab9-423e-8590-4d7bc2f3e0fc": {"__data__": {"id_": "f38ab521-8ab9-423e-8590-4d7bc2f3e0fc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c420644340630ec63375585dc40ecb69784aa3f1a0e4197f38bb82ad83c98369"}, "2": {"node_id": "ccb55735-529b-4fc2-a1a8-e497fce70a5e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "46a630c5992e051a285a5053735af43d55bc335d248895cbe7f9728011252b77"}}, "hash": "02a4d09f362ba8d853597f5384dcc64c3c45de8d392ddfda2bc60c30574e6bc2", "text": "\ufffd Prevention \ufffd To examine practices, systems and procedures of public bodies in order to discover and secure revision of practices, systems and procedures which, in the opinion of the Commission, are conducive to corrupt practice; \ufffd To advise, instruct and assist public bodies on the ways to minimize or eliminate fraud and corrupt practices ;and \ufffd To advise heads of public bodies on practices, systems or procedures, the introduction of which the ICPC believes would lead to a decreased likelihood of bribery, corruption and other related offences. \ufffd Public Education \ufffd", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bd4255ce-4a3c-4d3a-abd5-b6deb22ee7a4": {"__data__": {"id_": "bd4255ce-4a3c-4d3a-abd5-b6deb22ee7a4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e96dd6de73df435f16c886ec29b94eb8a61880d8b5c174c72387845bedf762c8"}, "3": {"node_id": "a011d3ff-0758-4b9d-a1f0-1687fedadc42", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "939e9f3b07d0a34e26066c61d4b259dedfc9798190960dc4f84a75e6a981b075"}}, "hash": "8be9d1fd8b2d30cc637a883aca1df22b43044593fa7395ea47125170f3ff1d87", "text": "To educate the public on (and against) bribery, corruption and related offences; and \ufffd To enlist and foster support in combating corruption. The operational structure of the ICPC consists of three committees: (1) Investigation and Prosecution; (2) Prevention and System Study;and (3) Public Enlightenment and Education.The Committees are in charge of the Departments that correspond to their respective areas. In addition to these, there is also the Chairman\u2019s Special Unit and the Fast Track Team (consisting of top investigators and prosecutors), all of which answer directly to the Chairman. In accordance with Subsection 7(2), the ICPC may establish branch offices in each state as well as in the federal capital territory; however,such branch offices have yet to be established. 69 Country Briefs: Nigeria Reports received by the ICPC are referred to the Investigation Department for preliminary investigation.The CPRO Act provides officers of the ICPC with far reaching powers of investigation, search and seizure as well as arrest. The Chairperson is mandated to instruct an officer of the ICPC to obtain a court order for forceful entry and search of premises (Section 36).The Chairperson, upon receiving a court order, may also authorize an officer of the ICPC to exercise all powers of investigation in relation to banks and financial institutions as set out in Subsection 43(2). Every person asked by an officer of the Commission to give any information on a matter relating to his/her mandate is required to do so. Failure to provide information is a punishable offence (Section 40).In accordance with Section 5 of the CPRO Act,officers of the ICPC have,when investigating or prosecuting corruption cases,the same powers and immunities as a police officer under the Police Act as well as any other law which confers powers on police or empowers and protects law enforcement agents. Furthermore, the Chairperson may require any person as well as his/her relatives or associates to provide information in writing on his/her assets and property. Should the Chairperson have reason to suspect that the assets or property of that person,if a public officer,is excessive in relation to present or past emoluments,an explanation for this may be requested.If no adequate explanation is given, the public officer is presumed to have used his/her office to corruptly enrich or gratify him/herself (Section 44).The Chairperson may also cause assets which have been acquired through an offence under the CPRO Act to be seized, as well as require, upon a court order, the surrender of the travel documents of individuals under investigation (Sections 45 and 50).It should also be noted that a Judge of the High Court may,on application made in relation to an investigation under the CPRO Act,instruct advocates and solicitors to disclose any information that they have which may be of relevance to an investigation of the ICPC (Section 39). Upon completion of the investigation,the investigating officers prepare a report which is sent to the Prosecution Department to determine whether or not a prima facie case can be established. If a case is established, a charge is drafted and filed before a designated court (see further under Operational arrangements).Should a report concern an offence which does not fall under the CPRO Act, it is forwarded to the appropriate body (Raji, 2004). The CPRO Act provides that public officers who have been given, promised or offered a bribe, or any person who has been solicited or from whom an attempt has been made to obtain a bribe,are required to report this to an officer of the Commission (or police officer). Failure to due so is a punishable offence which can lead to imprisonment for up to two years (Section 23). Operational arrangements Although the ICPC is mandated to prosecute corruption cases,every prosecution shall,in accordance with Subsection 61(1) of the CPRO Act,be deemed to be instituted with the consent of the Attorney General.Cases are brought before courts or judges which have been designated by the Chief Judge of State.Such a court or judge,after being designated,may not hear any other type of case (Subsection 61[3]).It should be noted that the Attorney General has the power,in accordance with Section 174 of the Constitution, to discontinue a case at any stage. An additional challenge to the effective and expeditious handling of corruption-related cases is that the courts themselves lack capacity and are also seen as prone to corruption. The ICPC is working together with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) to strengthen the integrity and capacity of the judiciary2.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a011d3ff-0758-4b9d-a1f0-1687fedadc42": {"__data__": {"id_": "a011d3ff-0758-4b9d-a1f0-1687fedadc42", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e96dd6de73df435f16c886ec29b94eb8a61880d8b5c174c72387845bedf762c8"}, "2": {"node_id": "bd4255ce-4a3c-4d3a-abd5-b6deb22ee7a4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8be9d1fd8b2d30cc637a883aca1df22b43044593fa7395ea47125170f3ff1d87"}}, "hash": "939e9f3b07d0a34e26066c61d4b259dedfc9798190960dc4f84a75e6a981b075", "text": "It is not, however, the responsibility of the ICPC alone to combat corruption in Nigeria.

Over 100 such units have been established to date (Agbu, 2004:10). As noted above, there are also a number of other institutions which play a significant role in combating corruption.The most significant among these are the Budget Monitoring and Price Intelligence Unit (BMPIUP), the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB) and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The EFCC, established in 2002 by virtue of Section 1 of the EFCC(A) Act, consists of a Chairperson and 18 members \u2013 ex-officio members representing various ministries, agencies and institutions as well as appointed members. There is also a Director-General, appointed by the President, who is head of the EFCC Secretariat (Subsection 7[1]).The Commission has the power to appoint,dismiss as well as discipline its own staff and may make staff regulations for this purpose (Sections 7 and 8). The EFCC consists of a large number of units, including investigation, operations, legal and prosecution, research, audit as well as media and publicity units.The EFCC also has a Training and Research Institute. Institutional Arrangments to Combat Corruption: A Comparative Study 70 2 For further information please see http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/corruption_projects_nigeria.html The functions of the EFCC,as outlined in Part II of the Act,include the investigation of all financial crimes;the coordination and enforcement of all economic and financial crimes laws and enforcement functions conferred on any other person or authority; adoption of measures to eradicate economic and financial crimes; examination and investigation of all reported cases of economic and financial crimes; and carrying out public enlightenment campaigns on economic and financial crimes. The Commission also has the power to cause investigations to be conducted into whether any person has committed an offence under the EFCC(A) Act. Furthermore, the EFCC is mandated to prosecute offenders as well as conduct such proceedings as may be necessary to expedite the recovery of property forfeited under the EFCC(A) Act (Subsection 12[2]). It should be noted, however, that in accordance with Section 39 of the EFCC(A) Act, the Attorney General may make rules and regulations with respect to the exercise of any of the duties,functions or powers of the EFCC under the Act.During the course of its existence, the EFCC has come to be perceived as the most effective body in combating corruption (Agbu, 2004:18) and the Commission has also, unlike the ICPC, prosecuted several high-profile cases. In 2003, the BMPIU3, also known as the Due Process Office, was established under the Office of the Principal Secretary of the President, functioning as an operationally independent body.The unit was established in order to counter the perception of Nigeria as a corrupt nation.The unit had been designed to act as a clearinghouse for all government contracts as well as the procurement of goods and services.The function of the Due Process Office is thus to ensure the full compliance in the public sector with the guidelines and procedures that have been established for procurement.It should be noted,however,that as of March 2005, the formal creation of the BMPIU was stalled in the National Assembly, although it was expected that a redrafted Act would be passed shortly (Osborne, 2005:7). The CCB, headed by a board consisting of a Chairperson (who is also the Chief Executive Officer of the Bureau) and nine other members (Paragraph 1,Third Schedule, Part 1 of the Constitution), was established in 1989 with the mandate to establish and maintain the conduct of government business and to ensure that the \u201cactions and behaviour of public officers conform with the highest standards of public morality and accountability\u201d.The CCB has its Headquarters in Abuja as well as offices in each of the states and the federal capital territory.The CCB has three operations departments: (1) Assets Declaration; (2) Investigation and Monitoring; and (3) Education and Advisory Services and a service department: Administration and Finance. Each department is headed by a Director.The Secretary of the Board serves as the Administrative Head of the CCB.The Bureau has a \u2018twin\u2019organization set up along with it, the Code of Conduct Tribunal which serves as the court of the CCB. The mandate of the CCB was strengthened when it became a Federal Executive Body under the 1999 Constitution.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9a703d11-947f-49aa-a3ce-316a57b56f1a": {"__data__": {"id_": "9a703d11-947f-49aa-a3ce-316a57b56f1a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fef98a9f7740c0c2bf9eb226513b85b99928d706d32ff74ce7fd4fa9b53c415a"}, "2": {"node_id": "57c220d4-36ad-4499-b55f-243c36bb87e2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ea39e3ade283ecd80306310ffe1975a8f16685e503a02f09bbab47ca414c36c7"}}, "hash": "932cdac6cab98d59afcdd5411aaee23b6f1b8c09c01aba1300676dcea1835eed", "text": "The Constitution confers on the Bureau the power to receive declarations of assets by public officers as required under the Code of Conduct for Public Officers (CoC)4; examine the declarations; ensure compliance with the CoC; and receive complaints on non-compliance with or breach of the CoC (including allegations of corruption) and, when appropriate, to refer such matters to the Code of Conduct Tribunal.

Lessons learned As noted above,the government has indeed taken several steps towards curbing the rampant corruption in Nigeria.However, there is little concrete evidence of these measures having had any significant impact on levels of corruption. Some have even gone as far as stating that the war on corruption has so far been a failure (Agbu, 2004:24). Whether or not this is the case, several factors have contributed to the lack of results, despite the resources \u2013 both human and material \u2013 which have been invested. One result of the government\u2019s efforts has been the creation of a wide range of bodies tasked with different aspects of anti-corruption work. With this comes the risk of blurred boundaries and lack of coordination. In order to avert this, close cooperation is necessary in order to achieve a holistic approach to combating corruption (Osborne, 2005:8). It has been suggested that a coalition between the various institutions should be established, with the ICPC Chairperson as Chair. According to Osborne, there is, however, some resistance to the concept of coordination within the various institutions, with less-formalized cooperation being the preferred method. Stakeholder meetings were also seen as valuable as they have enabled the institutions, through information sharing, to avoid duplication and wasting of resources (2005:15-16). 71 Country Briefs: Nigeria 3 The information on the BMPIU was gathered from http://www.nigeriafirst.org/article_841.shtml. 4 The Code of Conduct for Public Officers is set out in the Fifth Schedule, Part 1 of the Constitution. The ICPC, which was established with the intention of being the apex body for anti-corruption efforts, has, as was also mentioned above, been perceived to function below expectations. This has been attributed to various factors. A major contributing factor has of course been the obstructions of the Senate. The CPRO Act also prohibits the Commission from investigating any cases of corruption which occurred before its establishment. The small number of reports received by the Commission may in part be explained by complicated procedures, discouraging the public from making reports.The low rate of investigation of reports received has been attributed to lack of funds. In fact, the ICPC has itself stated, on numerous occasions,that it is being starved of funds (Agbu,2004:10 and TI,2004:225).Furthermore,the investigative mandate of the ICPC is reactive rather than proactive. Additionally, the investigations of the ICPC have not resulted in any high-profile convictions. The fact that the ICPC has limited capacity across the country is further complicated by the fact that virtually no independent efforts have been undertaken on the part of the states themselves to combat corruption (TI, 2004:226). The ICPC itself also suffers from a lack of transparency in that it has yet to publish a report and does not have publicly accessible audited accounts (Osborne, 2005:13). Furthermore, the Commission has been accused of lacking in independence and is seen as being used as an instrument for political vendettas (TI, 2004:225). The lack of political will, as evidenced by the actions of the Senate described above, has also been a major obstacle to efforts to combat corruption. This lack of will extends further to politicians also outside of the Senate as well as the police (Agbu, 2004:22), which is itself perceived by the public to be one of the most corrupt institutions in the country.There has also been a lack of \u2018leading by example\u2019among the country\u2019s elite.Complaints have been made that this lack of political will has allowed several prominent government officials who ought to have been investigated on charges of corruption to evade investigation (TI,2005:225).In fact,even though five years have passed since President Obasanjo pledged to take action against corruption, no high-profile person has yet to be jailed for corruption (Agbu, 2004:24). A major challenge also remains in getting the people of Nigeria to join in the war on corruption. The many unfulfilled promises made about coming to terms with the scourge of corruption followed by no high profile convictions and a government and political elite that does not lead by example makes increasing public participation difficult. Despite the attention that corruption receives in the media, it is believed that many people are actually still not aware of the issue (Osborne, 2005:4).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f39f858c-03b6-4d22-9168-7530bfe8bc0e": {"__data__": {"id_": "f39f858c-03b6-4d22-9168-7530bfe8bc0e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "03b11cadf925084a42d0edd38c5d4ca69fc7437baeb7a946fb69937e6cc8ed40"}, "2": {"node_id": "42d76350-3827-4477-a581-39dd1c646a46", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3a700ff4bd543057cbdac622c260c0db99c368367589ae4d3f8dfac16f603383"}}, "hash": "a1ff22030dad0fcbd1e04377a913d4e52a2555d273a34078697edda686d678cb", "text": "Enlisting civil society organizations and the media in the war on corruption may be one way to gain the support of the people as they are among the most trusted institutions in the country (Agbu,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "88a6ea2c-fc6d-4282-a83d-3b584a6e4c53": {"__data__": {"id_": "88a6ea2c-fc6d-4282-a83d-3b584a6e4c53", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "667b50412d990278979fcc032ca1c374d4a72b5f6cec393ac7ce6760bff37755"}, "3": {"node_id": "01d21973-940f-455a-8367-b79bc89f6e57", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9824d1e35a0e8a6ff7f05d392a954d26afbcc27fdb583847d7f8eaace95ea00e"}}, "hash": "e4d4bd3aa0504971e5f74ee83f82cc772f208983af5a13123ef1ea5b8597c6f1", "text": "2004:14). One example is the Ministry of Finance,which enlisted a civil society organization to provide it with a hotline for complaints.It is believed that this has been more effective in gaining public confidence than had this service been provided by the government or a government-funded body (Osborne, 2005:14). The institutions which are meant uphold or maintain the law \u2013 i.e.the police and the judiciary \u2013 are perceived as being two of the most corrupt. Any effort to come to terms with the corruption in the country needs to first address this issue. As mentioned above, efforts are being made in collaboration with donors to strengthen the integrity and capacity of the judiciary.The rules of the High Court, however, are highly unsuitable for the types of cases brought by institutions such as the EFCC and the ICPC.In many cases,these rules have been exploited in order to stall cases put before the courts (Agbu,2004:16). It is clear that in order for the war on corruption to succeed, the efforts to improve the integrity of the judiciary must be stepped up.

This included the introduction of a Public Officials\u2019 Property Disclosure System which made it mandatory for public officials to register and open their property holdings to the public as well as the Administrative Procedures Act and the Act on the Disclosure of Information by Public Agencies,both of which contributed to the increased transparency of the public service.However,the approach towards corruption remained unsystematic and lacked comprehensiveness. A major change in public perception and official policy on corruption occurred following the 1997 economic crisis. It was recognized that corruption had been one of the major factors contributing to the severity of the economic crisis, prompting the government to declare \u2018war on corruption\u2019 in 1998 (KICAC, 2003:37). This was also a result of increasing pressure on the government to take action against corruption from a public that had grown tired of the perceived high levels of corruption and recurring corruption scandals, (KICAC, 2004:81).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01d21973-940f-455a-8367-b79bc89f6e57": {"__data__": {"id_": "01d21973-940f-455a-8367-b79bc89f6e57", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "667b50412d990278979fcc032ca1c374d4a72b5f6cec393ac7ce6760bff37755"}, "2": {"node_id": "88a6ea2c-fc6d-4282-a83d-3b584a6e4c53", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e4d4bd3aa0504971e5f74ee83f82cc772f208983af5a13123ef1ea5b8597c6f1"}}, "hash": "9824d1e35a0e8a6ff7f05d392a954d26afbcc27fdb583847d7f8eaace95ea00e", "text": "1999 saw the establishment of the Presidential Commission on Anti-Corruption (PCAC).The PCAC, however, proved to be inadequately equipped to deal with the problem of corruption and its functions were unclear and limited \u2013 serving as an advisory board to the President (KICAC, 2003:38). In 2001, the Anti-corruption Act (ACA) was enacted, giving Korea its first comprehensive law on corruption.

The KICAC adopted an approach which goes beyond the scope of enforcement, also focusing on prevention, education as well as the promotion of public participation in the fight against corruption.As noted by the Chairman of the KICAC,the Commission made significant progress in establishing the infrastructure for combating corruption during its first two years, although not enough progress has been made in order to meet the high expectations of the public (KICAC, 2004). 73 Republic of Korea Korea placed 40th out of 159 countries on Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perceptions Index 2005, indicating that", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f6b9fd61-a990-45b1-aca3-5cbdb8bc2ad0": {"__data__": {"id_": "f6b9fd61-a990-45b1-aca3-5cbdb8bc2ad0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "92f9d22fb6766f9c398b95654bae8804a4db93c6de4fda7c6cd2332e6fed2bb8"}}, "hash": "92f9d22fb6766f9c398b95654bae8804a4db93c6de4fda7c6cd2332e6fed2bb8", "text": "the levels of corruption in Korea are considerably higher than in other countries of similar levels of economic development. Mandate and institutional links of the key anti-corruption institution The Korea Independent Commission Against Corruption (KICAC) was established under the President in January 2002 by virtue of Article 10 of the ACA. The ACA, together with the ED, provides for the mandate, operation and organization of the KICAC. The Commission is made up of nine members, including one Chairperson, who is in charge of the work of the KICAC (Article 7[1],ED),and two standing members.The Chairperson and the standing members are appointed by the President and the President appoints or designates three members on the recommendation of the National Assembly and three on the recommendation of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court (Article 12, ACA). The independence of the Commission is provided for by Article 15 of the ACA which states that \u201cthe Commission shall independently perform the work belonging to its authority\u201d. In addition to this, the Commissioners also enjoy security of tenure. The KICAC is supported by a Secretariat composed of one office, two bureaus and 15 divisions.The Secretariat is headed by a Secretary General, appointed by the Chairperson from among the standing members of the commission (Article 19, ACA). The mandate and main responsibilities of the KICAC fall under four areas.These are, as provided by the ACA and ED: \ufffd Policy formulation and assessment, including: \ufffd Formulation of anti-corruption policies and programmes; \ufffd Setting up enforcement plans and recommending public agencies to establish and implement these; \ufffd Conducting diagnostic surveys on the compliance levels in public institutions; \ufffd Conducting regular surveys on the level of corruption, the causes of corruption, and the mindset and behaviours of public servants; and \ufffd Producing and announcing the Evaluation of Anti-corruption Policy (EAP) and the Integrity Perception Index (IPI). \ufffd Giving recommendations on institutional improvements (these recommendations,however,are not binding),including: \ufffd Eliminating and reducing unreasonable practices and procedures that could lead to corruption; \ufffd Improving frameworks for the enhancement of transparency of administrative standards and procedures; and \ufffd Providing specific codes for the various public agencies in order to enhance ethics within the public sector. \ufffd Handling whistle blowing, including: \ufffd Setting up and operating institutional tools, such as procedures for handling corruption reports, protection of whistleblowers and compensation systems in order to encourage public participation in the fight against corruption;and \ufffd Exercising powers to charge corrupt high-ranking public officials,filing for adjudication,and requesting reinvestigation of inadequate results and discriminatory measures imposed on whistleblowers.1 \ufffd Education and promotion activities, including: \ufffd Enhancing public awareness of the harmful effects of corruption; \ufffd Strengthening anti-corruption curriculum in schools and public organizations; \ufffd Conducting campaigns in alliance with NGOs to change the public mindset; and \ufffd Increasing cooperation with international counterparts and organizations. In accordance with Article 25 of the ACA, \u201cany person who becomes aware of an act of corruption may report such act of corruption to the Commission\u201d. In order to meet this responsibility, the KICAC has established a Corruption Report Center fully dedicated to receiving reports on corruption (KICAC, 2004:21).The specific responsibilities of the Center are: \ufffd To provide general information and counselling for reporters of corruption; \ufffd To process and classify reports received in person, by post, fax or the internet; \ufffd To analyse and manage corruption complaints; \ufffd To run a 24-hour report room; and \ufffd To manage report/petition archives and viewings of documents. Institutional Arrangments to Combat Corruption: A Comparative Study 74 1 The powers of the KICAC in regard to charging high-ranking officials and filing for adjudication is further discussed under Operational arrangements below. Under the ACA, whistleblowers are given guarantee of position, i.e. they may not be disciplined or discriminated against for having reported a suspected act of corruption. Should an individual feel that they have suffered detrimental practice due to submitting a report, they may request that the KICAC take measures to guarantee their position. Based on the investigation into the request, the Commission may request the head of a public agency to take the appropriate action to guarantee the position of the agency\u2019s employee as long as there are not unjustifiable grounds to do so (Article 32). The identity of whistleblowers may not be made public and the KICAC may take measures to ensure physical protection of whistleblowers if requested to do so (Article 34, ACA). Operational arrangements Article 3 of the ACA provides that every public agency shall assume the responsibility for putting in place mechanisms to combat corruption, including striving to raise the awareness of its employees as well as the wider public", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1df53fe2-8c70-49da-a835-63dfcc217591": {"__data__": {"id_": "1df53fe2-8c70-49da-a835-63dfcc217591", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f0f8c4bac57a69c6a9b3868bc3d004e5d3e04a2d08d0b9b4eeedce03c8ce5973"}}, "hash": "f0f8c4bac57a69c6a9b3868bc3d004e5d3e04a2d08d0b9b4eeedce03c8ce5973", "text": "of the importance of combating corruption. Article 6 of the ACA further provides that \u201cevery citizen shall fully cooperate with public agencies\u2019 anti-corruption polices and programmes\u201d. Public officials are obligated to report any case of corruption that comes to their attention to the KICAC (Article 26, ACA). As the KICAC does not have a mandate to carry out investigations on its own, it is required, upon receiving a report for which it is considered necessary to conduct an investigation, to refer such case to the appropriate authorities (Article 29[3], ACA). In accordance with Article 22(1) of the ED, cases may be referred to the Board of Inspection and Audit (BAI) and if there is suspicion of crime, to investigative agencies. Should neither of the former two be deemed appropriate, the case may be referred to the supervisory body of the public agency concerned. Should a case require the involvement of multiple authorities, the KICAC designates the primary authority, who then handles the case in cooperation with the other authorities (Article 22[2],ED).In the case that the KICAC receives a report regarding suspected corruption involving a high-ranking public official, the Commission is to file an accusation directly with the prosecution (Article 29[4], ACA).2 Upon receipt of the accusation, the prosecutors shall report the results of its investigations to the KICAC (Article 29[5], ACA). Public prosecutors are vested with sole authority and responsibility for carrying out criminal investigation, i.e. to initiate as well as conclude investigations. Thus, the police, as well as other law enforcement agencies, are required to conduct investigations under the direction and supervision of the public prosecutors. In practice, the prosecutors only direct police investigations in cases considered to be of high importance. However, as only the public prosecutor can conclude an investigation, all cases investigated by the police must be brought to the prosecutors for final decision. In cases of major economic improprieties and corruption,the public prosecutors initiate and conduct the investigation.Upon the completion of an investigation, it is at the discretion of the prosecutor as to whether or not the case should be prosecuted. In the case that an investigation has resulted from an accusation under Article 29[4] of the ACA and the prosecutor decides not to initiate a prosecution, the KICAC \u201cmay file for an application for an adjudication on the right or wrong thereof\u201d with the Court corresponding to the public prosecutors\u2019 office to which the relevant prosecutor belongs (Article 31[1], ACA). It is also under the mandate of the prosecutors to supervise the execution of punishments. The Supreme Public Prosecutors\u2019 Office (SPO) is responsible for the establishment and enforcement of the fundamental policies on the functions and duties of the public prosecutors as well as for supervision and support to High Public Prosecutors\u2019Offices and the District Prosecutors\u2019Offices (DPO). The SPO is headed by the Prosecutor-General, who directs and is responsible for all matters related to prosecution affairs. It is typically the DPOs that carry out investigations of criminal cases, and each DPO has a Special Investigation Department that is dedicated to investigating cases of corruption and economic crime. Under Article 8 of the PPO Act, it is the Minister of Justice, as the chief supervisor of prosecution functions, who directs and supervises prosecutors. In specific cases, however, the Minister may only direct and supervise the Prosecutor-General, who decides whether or not to convey the instruction to the prosecutor responsible for the case. Each public prosecutor is subordinate to the immediate superior prosecutor and all prosecutors are subordinate to the Prosecutor-General. The independence of the prosecutors is further ensured in that they may not be dismissed or suspended unless impeached or convicted of a serious crime (Article 37, PPO Act). Prosecutors are appointed and assigned by the President on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice. In the case of the Prosecutor-General, the appointment shall go through a confirmation hearing with the National Assembly (Article 34, PPO Act). 75 Country Briefs: Republic of Korea 2 In accordance with Article 29(4) of the ACA, high-ranking public officials are: a public official with the rank of Vice Minister of higher; the Special Metropolitan Mayor, Metropolitan City Mayor or Do governor; a police officer with the rank of superintendent general or higher; a judge or a public prosecutor; a military officer with the rank of general; and/or a member of the National Assembly.

Article 103 of the Constitution provides for the independence of judges in that they are to \u201crule independently according to their conscience and in conformity with the Constitution and the law\u201d. The BAI is the supreme audit and inspection institution. The BAI is a constitutional body established under the President by virtue of Article 97 of the Constitution. Article 2 of the BAI Act, however, provides for the independence of the Board in the execution of its duties. The BAI is headed by a Council composed of seven Commissioners, including a Chairperson. The Chairperson is appointed by the President with the consent of the National Assembly, and the commissioners are appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Chairperson (Article 98 of the Constitution). Decisions relating to the function of the BAI are taken collectively by the Council of Commissioners. In 1993, the Commission for Prevention of Corruption was established as an advisory body to the Chairperson of the BAI,providing advice and recommendations on the fight against corruption. The BAI is mandated to verify final government accounts;carry out audits of the accounts of the State,provincial governments and other local autonomous bodies, and government-invested corporations; and inspect the performance of government operations and its employees.In order to improve government operations and the performance of public officials,the BAI may also undertake investigations into problems not pertaining to the use of public monies. Upon the completion of audits and inspections, the BAI may order liable individuals to make reparations should there have been damages or losses made to government assets.Should investigations uncover irregularities, the BAI may request the agency concerned to take corrective measures, and if an individual has been found to have committed a serious wrongdoing, the BAI may request the relevant supervisory body to take disciplinary action against him/her.The BAI may also request agencies to take measures to improve legislation,institutional arrangements and practices when deemed necessary.In addition,the BAI is also mandated to support the development of internal audit and inspection functions within government agencies. Each year, the BAI prepares a report on its audit and inspections of government operations during the previous year that is presented to the President and the National Assembly. A similar report on the performance of government-invested corporations is submitted to the Government. The Ombudsman of Korea (OK) was established in 1994 in order to provide a safeguard against maladministration and to protect the rights and interests of the citizens.The OK is an independent administrative institution.The Council of Ombudsmen consists of 10 members \u2013 a Chief Ombudsman, three standing Ombudsmen and six non-standing Ombudsmen, all of whom are appointed by the President. Decisions of the Council are taken by majority vote, with each member having one vote. The office of Secretary General, the administrative head of the Secretariat which provides support to the Council of Ombudsmen, is held by one of the standing Ombudsmen. The OK is mandated to conduct investigations into grievances submitted by the public. The Ombudsman does not have any statutory powers to open investigations on its own initiative. The OK may make recommendations for corrective action when its investigations reveal unlawful or unreasonable administrative procedures as well as give opinions and make recommendations for the improvement of administrative systems and their operations.The opinions and recommendations of the OK,however,are not binding.Instead,the OK has the power to request the head of the relevant administrative agency to notify the OK of actions taken in response to the opinions or recommendations made to the agency. The OK may then publicize these reports to the media or the general public and report directly to the President. There are limitations to the jurisdiction of the OK, including that it may not investigate grievances against the BAI or matters under the investigation of the BAI. Lessons learned The development of the current framework for combating corruption in Korea comes out of experiences with past failures. The government recognized that policies against corruption need to be both comprehensive and systematic.Previous policies have been typified by the absence of a deliberate and systematic approach (KICAC, 2003:42). Efforts had been designed primarily in order to inspect certain organizations or extend the tenure of the regime,i.e.the motives were political rather than based on a real desire to tackle the problem of corruption (KICAC, 2003:40). Institutional Arrangments to Combat Corruption: A Comparative Study 76 The adoption of the ACA and the establishment of the KICAC are seen as important steps to overcoming these earlier deficiencies.

Instead, the adopted approach focuses on policy formulation and assessment, institutional arrangements, receiving and handling reports, and education and promotion activities. Although, as noted above, achievements have been made by the KICAC in combating corruption, public perception remains that not enough has been done. A major obstacle to the KICAC in performing its tasks has been its lack of investigative mandate (KICAC, 2003:39). In the case of the OK, the lack of mandate to independently initiate investigations was seen as an impediment to its performance. The whistleblowing system has been seen as one of the most effective tools at the disposal of the KICAC, of which the reward and protection elements are of particular importance. The KICAC itself, however, has emphasized that there is a need to strengthen both these aspects of the whistleblowing system (KICAC, 2004:37). The wider definition of corruption given in the ACA has also provided the KICAC with a greater scope. From previously only having included a few institutions, the concept of corruption now includes not only public officials but also public interests (KICAC, 2003:40).The private sector, however, is not included under the definition of corruption as provided by the ACA. The KICAC has recognized that prevention of corruption is more effective than corruption control systems that rely on detection and punishment of public officials only after the misconduct occurs. However, in order to put in place effective prevention measures,it is necessary to have a thorough knowledge of the nature and extent of corruption.Thus,the KICAC has placed emphasis on assessing corruption within the public sector by conducting \u2018integrity assessments\u2019(KICAC, 2004:41). Related to this, the KICAC also emphasizes the importance of public education, not only to raise awareness of the importance of combating corruption, but also to encourage the public to report suspected corruption as well as to raise awareness of the protection of and rewards for informants under the whistleblowing system (KICAC, 2004:53 and KICAC, 2003:139). Public education also serves to raise public awareness of the activities of the KICAC as well as to gain the trust of the public. The importance of having the trust and support of the public was a lesson learned from previous efforts to combat corruption that had failed in part due to the lack public support and trust (Cho,2001:8).Lack of engagement and public knowledge about its activities was seen as a problem for the OK, prompting the Ombudsman to place greater emphasis on public relations and promotional activities. In Korea, the participation of civil society \u2013 in the form of non-governmental organizations and citizen groups \u2013 has proven to be an important element in the fight against corruption (Transparency International, 2003:137).They have been important in driving the agenda on corruption, and the fact that the ACA was enacted despite strong resistance within the establishment has in part been attributed to the efforts of these civic groups (KICAC, 2003:39).

When the People\u2019s Action Party came to power in 1959, the new government made it an immediate task to minimize corruption and make it a high-risk, low-reward activity.Thus, in 1960, a comprehensive anti-corruption strategy was initiated through the enactment of the Prevention of Corruption Act (POCA).The strategy was based on the principle that \u201ccorruption is caused by both the incentives and the opportunities to be corrupt\u201d thus requiring that both the incentives and the opportunities for corruption be removed (Quah, 1999:83). Leading by example and a policy of zero-tolerance for corruption were key elements of the strategy for changing people\u2019s attitudes.The POCA also expanded the powers of investigation of the CPIB, giving the Bureau the tools it needed to combat corruption, as well as increased the punishment for corruption. Firm action was consequently taken against corrupt officials,leading to increased support and cooperation from the public as well as a clear message being sent that the law was going to be stringently implemented and that corruption had become a high-risk, low-reward activity. Singapore placed 5th out of 159 countries on Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perception Index 2005. Thus, Singapore ranks as the least corrupt country in Asia on the index and is today one of the least corrupt countries in the world. As such, Singapore has gained worldwide recognition and respect for its culture of integrity that permeates the public administration as well as the private sector. 78 Singapore 1 All legislation can be found at http://statutes.agc.gov.sg. Mandate and institutional links of the key anti-corruption institution The Corruption Prevention and Investigation Bureau (CPIB) was established in 1952.The Bureau is an independent body located within the Prime Minister\u2019s Office (PMO).The CPIB is headed by a Director who is appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Cabinet or a Minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet.The President may refuse to appoint or revoke the appointment of the Director if s/he is not in agreement with the recommendation made (POCA, Subsection 3[1]).The Director is directly responsible to the Prime Minister.The President also appoints a Deputy Director and any number of assistant directors and special investigators \u201cas s/he may think fit\u201d (POCA, Subsection 3[2]). All the above are considered under Subsection 4(1) of the POCA to be public servants. The main responsibility of the CPIB is the enforcement of the POCA and is thus the main body responsible for investigating and preventing acts of corruption. As such, the three main functions of the CPIB are: \ufffd To receive and investigate complaints concerning corruption in the public as well as private sectors; \ufffd To investigate malpractices and misconduct by public officers; and \ufffd To examine the practices and procedures in the public service to minimize opportunities for corruption. The CPIB\u2019s organizational structure is divided into three branches, namely: \ufffd The Investigation Branch, which is the largest branch, consisting of four units \u2013 each of which is headed by a Senior Assistant Director responsible for directing and supervising investigations. \ufffd The Data Management and Support Branch, which manages a computer information system that enables the CPIB to formulate corruption prevention strategies and to screen candidates for public appointments, promotions, scholarships and training. The Research Unit within the branch reviews work procedures of corruption-prone departments. The Intelligence Unit provides required intelligence for meeting the Investigation Branch\u2019s operational needs. \ufffd The Administration Branch, which provides secretarial support to the other two branches and is responsible for the financial and personnel administration of the CPIB (Quah, 2003). The CPIB is relatively small, with just over 80 staff.The Independent Commission Against Corruption in Hong Kong S.A.R., for example, has a staff 15 times larger. The Bureau\u2019s location within the PMO and its legal powers to obtain the required cooperation from both public and private organizations, however, enable the CPIB to fulfil its task despite a heavy workload, without requiring additional staff (Quah, 1999:84).

The Director of the CPIB or a Magistrate may also, by warrant, direct any special investigator (or police) to enter premises, by force if necessary, to conduct searches.Should an investigator have reason to believe that seeking a warrant may lead to the search being frustrated. s/he may enter without such a warrant (POCA, Section 22). The Public Prosecutor may also, by order, authorize the Bureau to use special investigative powers (see further under heading Operational arrangements). The POCA further provides that every person is legally bound to provide information to the Director or any officer of the CPIB on any subject which it is the duty of the Director or officer to inquire into under the POCA (Section 27). The POCA also provides for the protection of informers who report suspected acts of corruption (Section 36). In addition to reviewing work methods and providing advice to both the public and the private sectors on how to minimize methods and procedures prone to corruption, additional prevention tools include the requirement that all public officers make a declaration of non-indebtedness as well as a declaration of assets and investments at the time of appointment and subsequently once per year. Although the CPIB does not have a Branch directly dedicated to public relations, the Bureau does see public education as an essential element of an effective strategy towards combating corruption. For this purpose, the Bureau regularly conducts lectures and seminars to educate public officers \u2013 particularly those who work in corruption-prone professions \u2013 on the ills of corruption. 79 Country Briefs: Singapore Operational arrangements The responsibility for combating corruption does not, however, lie with the CPIB alone. While the Bureau has the main responsibility for investigating cases of corruption, the primary responsibility for corruption prevention lies with the respective departments. The Permanent Secretary in each ministry is responsible for ensuring that each department has a committee tasked with reviewing anti-corruption measures as well as to ensure that adequate measures are taken to prevent corrupt practices. These measures include improvement of working methods and procedures, strengthening control and monitoring systems, including the conduct of routine and surprise checks, regular rotation of public officers and putting in place strict measures governing conflict of interest (Ali, 2000:8-9). The Attorney-General, appointed by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister (Article 35[1] of the Constitution), is also the Public Prosecutor and, as such, is vested with the power to institute, conduct or discontinue proceedings for any offence (Article 35[8] of the Constitution). The Attorney-General is independent in this role and not subject to the control of the government. The Attorney-General heads the Attorney-General\u2019s Chambers of Singapore, which is divided into five divisions. Of these, the Criminal Justice Division is the organizational extension of the Attorney-General\u2019s role as Public Prosecutor and, as such, advises on and prosecutes criminal cases as well as exercises the Attorney-General\u2019s control and direction of criminal prosecutions by directing law enforcement agencies in their investigations. In order for a prosecution to be instituted based on an investigation conducted by the CPIB, the consent of the Public Prosecutor must be sought (POCA, Section 33). In addition to this, the Public Prosecutor can grant the Director and special investigators of the CPIB or any police at or above the rank of assistant superintendent special powers of investigation, including investigating bank and other types of accounts (POCA, Subsection 18[1]) as well as, by order, authorize the CPIB to exercise the powers of a police investigation in the case of any type of offence (POCA, Section 19).The Public Prosecutor also has the power to order the inspection,by the CBIP,of bankers\u2019books (also of the spouse,children or others who may have acted as his/her agent) (POCA, Subsection 20[1]). Section 21 gives the Public Prosecutor further powers to request information on the resources and property of the accused and his/her family and associates,including ordering the Comptroller of Income Tax to provide any information on offenders that it has in its possession (POCA, Section 21).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "59889fc2-242e-467d-b7a3-43f7a542a296": {"__data__": {"id_": "59889fc2-242e-467d-b7a3-43f7a542a296", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e264d73fa1c63e73c39d93b74d9c570e44553ca56dbf04644e2e5574eca2de39"}, "2": {"node_id": "05bef5c2-1453-492b-8f8c-5dc5c1631596", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f5c57e63ce35525d1f6699cffa1db96f8109909c75aaf681a3859f0ed603f4ea"}}, "hash": "3b1d14ab33ae454948b562a10d0af33d0c5da759f5ad60b609a060755e674114", "text": "Offences under the POCA fall under the jurisdiction of the District Courts, which try the cases and determine punishment following a conviction (POCA,Section 34).The POCA further provides that,during any trial or inquiry by a court into an offence under the POCA, the failure of an accused person to account for acquisition of resources", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8aea7190-5cf2-49c7-b9ea-e23847a84ba3": {"__data__": {"id_": "8aea7190-5cf2-49c7-b9ea-e23847a84ba3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0935ec3c8ffaa16e3fec35cc82430da42d3cde02ce074ecaa416495cdc17274f"}}, "hash": "0935ec3c8ffaa16e3fec35cc82430da42d3cde02ce074ecaa416495cdc17274f", "text": "or property shall be seen as corroborating that the accused has made these acquisitions through corrupt practices (Subsection 24[1]).When a defendant is convicted of a serious offence, the court shall, on the application of the Public Prosecutor, issue a confiscation order of any means which are considered to have been acquired through criminal activity (CBA, Subsection 5[1]). Lessons learned One of the main reasons for Singapore\u2019s success in combating corruption has been the government\u2019s efforts to remove the opportunities for corruption through a sustained focus on streamlining cumbersome administrative procedures,cutting down red tape and repeated messages to government contractors that contracts will be terminated and severe fines and other measures (being barred from any public contract for a period of 5 years) imposed in case of bribery and corruption. In Singapore,both the giver and the receiver of a bribe are guilty of corruption and are liable to the same punishment. Besides fines and imprisonment, the person convicted of a corruption offence will be ordered by the courts to return the full amount of the bribe. The courts are also empowered to order confiscation of the property obtained by corrupt offenders. The possibility of losing employment, pension and other benefits also provide effective preventive measures. But probably \u201cthe strongest deterrent against corruption in the Singapore society is a public opinion that censures and condemns corrupt persons and that make corrupt behaviour so unacceptable that the stigma of corruption cannot be washed away by serving a prison sentence\u201d(Singapore\u2019s former Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew as quoted in Quah, 1999:76). Singapore\u2019s success in combating corruption is also due to the comprehensiveness of its anti-corruption legal framework, which has been periodically reviewed to introduce relevant amendments whenever required. The POCA has equipped the CPIB with the necessary powers to effectively investigate as well as prevent corruption, as well as providing punishment that effectively deters officials from engaging in corrupt activities. Institutional Arrangments to Combat Corruption: A Comparative Study 80 The high wages in the public service are usually also considered one of the main contributing factors to the low levels of corruption in Singapore. Yet, while today, Singapore\u2019s public sector wages are among the highest in the world and certainly contribute to the consolidation of the integrity system, it needs to be reminded that these high salary levels are a main outcome of the anti-corruption policies rather than an explanatory factor of their success. In 1959, when the anti-corruption strategy was launched, GNP per capita in Singapore was only US$443.Thirty-eight years later, that figure had grown by more than 11 percent annually, mainly due to gains in revenue and productivity that resulted from the anti-corruption policy and from rapid growth-oriented development policies, including high investments in human development. By 1994, public sector wages ranked among the highest in the world,nearing private sector wage levels.Therefore,while the reduction in corruption in Singapore has often been linked to the high levels of pay in the civil service, it was not until 1972 that the government was able to afford an increase in the salaries of civil servants. In the meantime, the main emphasis was on reducing incentives and opportunities for corruption through economic, educational, and legal reform, institutional strengthening and severe punishment and penalties.The main lessons learned from the Singapore experience is that first, reducing corruption is much more complex than increasing civil services wages alone, and second, even for developing countries under severe resource constraints, corruption can be combated if there is sufficient political will and public support. Singapore\u2019s experience is particularly interesting because it represents a case of an independent anti-corruption agency that is under the direct supervision of the Prime Minister. Essential to the success of the CPIB was to separate the Bureau from the police, especially since the latter itself was considered highly corrupt. Some would argue that, although its independence is rather limited, placed within the PMO in a small city-nation, it is exactly this connection to the top executive that allows the CPIB to mobilize all needed support for its actions from other state institutions. Others would argue that this connection represents, at the same time, the vulnerability of the system, as it relies essentially on the integrity and professionalism of Singapore\u2019s political leadership. Also, the strength of the government has been seen as contributing towards the effective control of corruption, although the strength of the government has come at the expense of limitations of political freedoms and access to information (Transparency International, 2003:140). Furthermore,it also be should be acknowledged that the success of the CPIB has resulted from the relatively good governance of the country, including the effective", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d9619e33-be52-4edb-8138-10d4f584b885": {"__data__": {"id_": "d9619e33-be52-4edb-8138-10d4f584b885", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "abf5e6940db3043578f515b7b53d8089d834743f8fd0dd7052feb4424e670238"}, "3": {"node_id": "4d60386d-4e6f-4406-8f68-f79bc5929c12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a6a3ca57a3e798e96b7ee944ffa3da5eb89b93a2a123ddb7ddc49a7af29c06dd"}}, "hash": "288b0f3120b8679fc9095122374a2ddcb28552cc632eb70ca9a188d39163686b", "text": "prosecution agencies and judiciary (Transparency International, 2003:145).

Rather, it heralded a process of profound transformation of the state (Van Vuuren, 2004:2).The first task was thus not to design a plan to combat corruption; rather, it was to build the institutions that were required to fulfil the obligations of the state as established by the Constitution.In addition,this had to be done with elements of the former regime maintaining key functions within the public service,security apparatus as well as the economy, following on the negotiated transition.

Establishing a framework for combating corruption became a first priority well into the presidency of Nelson Mandela (1994-1999). It was a necessary means towards safeguarding the achievements that had been made during the first years after the fall of the Apartheid system, and it gained further momentum during the first presidency of Thabo Mbeki (1999-2004). 82 South Africa What followed was the adoption by the democratically elected National Assembly of a number of laws relating to combating corruption as well as the establishment of a number of different agencies with a mandate to counter corruption \u2013 a devolved anti-corruption mandate as opposed to a single anti-corruption agency. In addition, civil society and the media have also played a role in keeping up the reform momentum. Although the legislation related to corruption is generally deemed to be adequate, the case has been made that implementation of these laws has not been adequate.This has been attributed partly to lack of resources (Transparency International, 2004:259-260). In addition, there has been an overlap in the mandate of and a lack of coordination between the different agencies with a mandate to combat corruption (UNODC, 2003). Despite discussions on whether or not to establish a single anti-corruption agency, the Government has decided to maintain the current devolved institutional structure for combating corruption, opting to instead implement incremental improvements to existing agencies as proposed by the 2002 Public Service Anti-corruption Strategy. In line with the recommendations put forward in the strategy, an Anti-corruption Coordinating Committee has also been established to coordinate the work of the different agencies (UNODC,2003).The adoption of the Public Service Anti-corruption Strategy is in itself a positive development providing a comprehensive framework aimed at preventing and combating corruption in the public service. A further encouraging development is the replacement of the Corruption Act of 1992 \u2013 widely seen as inadequate \u2013 with the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act adopted in 2004.

South Africa placed 46th out of 159 countries on Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perceptions Index 2005. However, although the level of corruption is relatively low compared to its neighbours, the Country Corruption Assessment Report carried out by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the Government of South Africa shows that the perception of corruption is high, although those reporting to have actually been exposed to corruption are much fewer. Mandate and institutional links of the key anti-corruption institutions No single anti-corruption agency exists in South Africa. Instead, the anti-corruption mandate has been devolved to a number of separate institutions.The investigation and prosecution of corruption primarily lies with the National Prosecuting Agency of South Africa (NPA), the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) and the South African Police Services (SAPS). Bodies such as the Office of the Auditor-General, the Office of the Public Protector, the South African Revenue Services (SARS), and the Public Service Commission (PSC) have, as their core function, to strengthen employee integrity, financial management and the quality of administration within the public service \u2013 all of which are central to the prevention and detection of corruption. The NPA \u2013 headed by the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) and appointed by the President \u2013 was established in terms of section 179 of the Constitution, which also states that the NPA must exercise its functions without fear, favour or prejudice.The NDPP reports to the Parliament and is accountable to the Minister of Justice.The functions and duties of the NPA as outlined in the NPA Act are: \ufffd To institute and conduct criminal proceedings on behalf of the State; \ufffd To carry out any necessary function incidental to instituting and conducting such criminal proceedings; and \ufffd To discontinue criminal proceedings. As such, the NPA is the institution most closely associated with state efforts to combat corruption and organized crime in South Africa. The two units of the NPA who play the most direct role in combating corruption are the Directorate of Special Operations (DSO) \u2013 also known as the Scorpions \u2013 and the Asset Forfeiture Unit (AFU). One of the key objectives of the NPA is to implement the asset forfeiture provisions in Chapter 5 and 6 of the POCA.The AFU was established to pursue this objective. Although the AFU does not have a direct mandate to combat corruption, its work is of fundamental importance to its prevention through the recovery of profits and assets gained as result of involvement in criminal activities, including corruption. The DSO was launched in 1999 as part of the establishment of state capacity to effectively investigate and prosecute national priority crime. As such, the DSO is a multidisciplinary agency specifically mandated to deal with crimes committed in an organized fashion.This mandate includes investigating and prosecuting organized crime and corruption.Primarily,the DSO 83 Country Briefs: South Africa has come to focus on high-level corruption cases.The DSO has adopted a unique law enforcement approach that combines crime analysis, investigation and prosecution in an integrated manner, making use of modern technology. The SIU was created under Act No. 74 and is accountable to the Minister of Justice and Parliament. The SIU is a semi- independent statutory body tasked with investigating fraud, corruption and maladministration of state assets and public money. As such, the SIU is the only agency that has an exclusive mandate to combat corruption. If, following an investigation, there is evidence of fraud, corruption and maladministration, the SIU is empowered to take civil action in the Special Tribunal to recover any state assets or public money that may have been misappropriated or misused. The SIU concentrates on civil protection and recovery and is not empowered to take any criminal action.The SIU works in close cooperation with the NPA, DSO, AFU and SAPS. When the SIU does come across alleged criminal activity or uncovers criminal acts, the information is passed on to the relevant criminal investigation body in order for corruption to be pursued on a civil as well as criminal basis. Within the SAPS, it is the Commercial Branch of the Detective Service Division that has the main responsibility in relation to corruption.This has followed on the merger of the SAPS Anti-Corruption Unit into the Detective Service Division. The Internal Complaints Directorate (ICD) \u2013 established by virtue of Chapter 10, Section 50(1) of the South African Police Service Act, No. 68 of 1995 (Act No. 68) \u2013 is mandated to investigate any alleged misconduct of a member of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "405a3ca5-a872-4bf0-b51e-91c1d14d93b8": {"__data__": {"id_": "405a3ca5-a872-4bf0-b51e-91c1d14d93b8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "88e73659e8bd232aa5c7b945802d32e5130c99f88b27d6d25b07e9a025dde9e3"}}, "hash": "88e73659e8bd232aa5c7b945802d32e5130c99f88b27d6d25b07e9a025dde9e3", "text": "the SAPS as well as the Municipal Police Service (Section 53.2,Act No.68) with the purpose of promoting proper police conduct.This also includes investigating allegations of members of the SAPS being involved in any form of corruption.The ICD is a government department, headed by an Executive Director nominated by the Minister and appointed by the Parliamentary Committee, which operates independently of the SAPS (Section 51, Act No. 68). By virtue of Chapter 9 of the Constitution \u2013 State institutions supporting constitutional democracy \u2013 a number of independent state institutions have been created. Of these, the Office of the Auditor-General and the Office of the Public Protector are of particular relevance to the National Integrity System. These institutions are protected against outside interference and are accountable to the National Assembly,to which they are also required to report on their activities and the performance of their functions on an annual basis (Section 181 of the Constitution). The Auditor-General \u2013 who heads the Office of the Auditor-General, as prescribed by Section 188 of the Constitution \u2013 must audit and report on the accounts, financial statements and financial management of: \ufffd All national and provincial state departments and administrations; \ufffd All municipalities; and \ufffd Any other institution or accounting entity as required. The Auditor-General thus has an important role to play in the control of economic crime in South Africa, including contributing towards the prevention of corruption. The functions of the Office of the Public Protector \u2013 headed by the Public Protector \u2013 are provided by Section 182 of the Constitution.The Public Protector has the power, as regulated by national legislation: \ufffd To investigate any conduct in state affairs or in the public administration in any sphere of government that is alleged or suspected to be improper or to result in any impropriety or prejudice; \ufffd To report on that conduct; and \ufffd To take appropriate remedial action. In addition to the main institutions listed above,there are also several additional agencies that play a role in the prevention of corruption, such as the Public Service Commission and the South African Revenue Service as well as the National Anti-Corruption Forum \u2013 a body consisting of government, private sector and civil society representatives. Operational arrangements As there is no single anti-corruption agency, an Anti-Corruption Coordination Committee has been established, following on the recommendations of the Public Service Anti-corruption Strategy. The Committee consists of national and provincial departments as well as those national agencies and institutions that have anti-corruption functions.The Committee is tasked with assisting in the coordination and integration of anti-corruption work. Institutional Arrangments to Combat Corruption: A Comparative Study 84 Within the Department of Public Service and Administration (DPSA), the Public Service Anti-corruption (PSAC) Unit also has a coordinating function and is responsible for: \ufffd The development and implementation of the Public Service Anti-corruption Strategy; \ufffd Coordination and integration of the government\u2019s anti-corruption work at policy and strategic levels; \ufffd Supporting the national anti-corruption programme; \ufffd Regional and international policy and cooperation on anti-corruption; \ufffd Collecting and analysing information on corruption and anti-corruption; and \ufffd Supporting the Minister for the Public Service and Administration in the responsibility of fighting corruption. The PSAC Unit also provides advisory and support services to the Public Sector on implementation of anti-corruption policies and legislation as well as convenes the Anti-corruption Coordinating Committee.The PSAC Unit,however,does not itself carry out any corruption investigations. The Public Service Anti-Corruption Strategy \u2013 a comprehensive framework for initiatives to combat and prevent corruption in the public service adopted in 2002 \u2013 provides guidance in the Government\u2019s efforts to combat corruption. The strategy proposes that a holistic and integrated approach to fighting corruption be established, requiring a strategic combination of preventative and combative activities and a consolidation of the institutional and legislative capabilities of the Government1. The strategy establishes nine considerations, namely: \ufffd Review and consolidation of the legislative framework; \ufffd Increased institutional capacity to address corruption; \ufffd Improved access to report wrongdoing and protection of whistle blowers and witnesses; \ufffd Prohibition of corrupt individuals and businesses; \ufffd Improved management policies and practices; \ufffd Management of professional ethics; \ufffd Partnerships with stakeholders; \ufffd Social analysis, research and policy advocacy; and \ufffd Awareness,training and education to support the above developments and launch of a public communication campaign. While Chapter 2 of the newly adopted PCCAA also provides for offences in respect to corrupt activities, an additional tool in combating corruption is provided by Chapter 3, which establishes that the NDDP may apply to a judge in chambers to investigate individuals whose property is disproportionate to their current or known sources of income or assets.

Any person who reports suspected acts of corruption are protected under Act No. 26, which provides for the protection of whistleblowers through the process of disclosure of acts of corruption or other abuse of office in the public and private sectors. In its efforts to prevent and combat corruption, the Government has also established that all departments and institutions of the Public Service must establish a minimum capacity to undertake the following functions: \ufffd Conduct risk assessments; \ufffd Implement fraud plans including as a minimum, in accordance with the provisions of the PFM Act, an anti-corruption policy and implementation plan; \ufffd Investigate allegations of corruption and detected risks at a preliminary level; \ufffd Enable the process of conducting further investigation,detection and prosecution in terms of prevailing legislation and procedures; \ufffd Receive and manage allegations of corruption through whistle blowing or other mechanisms; and \ufffd Promote professional ethics among employees. Lessons learned One of the strengths of the South African national integrity system has been the promulgation of a comprehensive anti-corruption related legislative framework. This includes the PAJA and the PAIA, which empower the general public to 85 Country Briefs: South Africa 1 See: Department of Public Service and Administration, Public Sector Anti-Corruption Strategy, DPSA, Pretoria, January 2002. require information from the public sector and to challenge administrative decisions. It is stated in the Country Corruption Assessment Report that \u201cthese laws greatly enhance transparency and contribute to clean government\u201d.The adoption of the PCCAA also should lead to a more effective facilitation of the fight against corruption. In addition, Act No. 26 provides protection for whistle blowers and witnesses in anti-corruption cases in support of the duty of individuals to report corruption as expressed in the PCCAA. However, concerns have been raised as to the state\u2019s lack of capacity to provide actual protection, with most departments and institutions not having put in place the policies and procedures necessary in order to comply with Act No. 26 (UNODC, 2003 and van Vuuren, 2004:6). This relates to a further challenge, namely, that there has been a lack of implementation of the existing legislation (Transparency International, 2004:259) and that there is an uneven capacity to enforce and comply with the legislation within the public sector (UNODC, 2003). One of the elements towards ensuring the success of an anti-corruption strategy will thus lie in the effective implementation of existing legislation as well as raising the awareness of both those tasked with implementation as well as the wider public of the rights and responsibilities afforded to them by the legislative framework (UNODC, 2003 and van Vuuren, 2004:4-5). Although South Africa has been successful in increasing its law enforcement capacity (i.e. investigation and prosecution), the country has not been equally successful in prevention of corruption and public education \u2013 the other two elements of the so-called \u2018three-pronged approach\u2019 to corruption. This constitutes one of the major weaknesses of South Africa\u2019s current approach to corruption (UNODC, 2003), possibly because there is no single anti-corruption agency with such a mandate. The strategy also covers the issue of the need for increased coordination between the institutions with an anti-corruption mandate. Coordination between institutions was only initiated recently. The creation of the Anti-corruption Coordination Agency has met with some success in bringing together the various agencies (van Vuuren, 2004:4). Yet the devolved corruption mandate is still seen as a weakness, with overlapping legislative mandates and lack of coordination between institutions. There is thus a need to clarify the mandate of the respective institutions as well as to better coordinate anti-corruption strategies, initiatives and investigations (UNODC, 2003). It has been proposed that South Africa consider establishing a single anti-corruption agency as a way of rectifying this perceived deficiency (Van Vuuren, 2004:3-4).

State officials found to be corrupt faced disciplinary reprimand by their respective government agencies. As was the case in several other countries, evolvement of anti-corruption institutions in Thailand resulted from a crisis in public confidence in the Government. After the public uprising of 14 October 1973 against the Government, the subsequent 1974 Constitution stated that \u201cthe State should organize efficient systems of government [\u2026] and should take all steps to prevent and suppress the quest for benefits by corrupt means\u201d. As a result, in 1975, the Counter Corruption Act was promulgated and a special agency, the Office of the Counter Corruption Commission (OCCC), was established.

The 1997 Constitution resulted from political reform efforts that stemmed from the People\u2019s Uprising in May 19912.To ensure transparency and accountability, the Constitution aims to establish oversight institutions that are independent, transparent and free from executive interference.Existing institutions were restructured to ensure greater independence,while many new institutions have been created (the Election Commission, the Anti-Money Laundering Office, the Ombudsman, the Administrative Court, and the Constitutional Court). In line with the Constitutional provisions, the Organic Law on Anti-corruption was promulgated in 1999.

The regulation lists the \u201cRule of Integrity\u201d and the \u201cRule of Value for Money\u201d among the key good governance principles. In 2003, the current Government issued a Royal Decree on Rules and Procedures for Good Public Administration, focusing on responsiveness, results-based management,effectiveness and value for money,transparency and cutting down red tape.The decree assigns a key role to the Public Sector Development Commission that was established in 2002 to steer the public sector reform process. Thailand placed 59th out of 159 countries on Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perception Index 2005. Corruption remains a serious concern, especially in the area of procurement, customs3 and business operations. Over the years, corruption has become diverse and complex both in size and forms,adapting succinctly to the rapidly changing political,economic and social environment, advancement in technology and fierce business competition. Political corruption (money politics), as well as corruption related to organized crime and prostitution has become widespread. The press is playing an increasingly important role in investigating and exposing examples of corruption. Parliament is also increasing its role in checking the abuse of powers by officials and politicians and the judiciary is showing increasing signs of independent assertiveness. Finally, there is also a vibrant civil society network against corruption, with Transparency Thailand, the Anti-Corruption Network and the Foundation for Clean and Transparent Thailand playing a dominant role. Mandate and institutional links of the key anti-corruption institution The National Counter Corruption Commission (NCCC) is an independent constitutional agency, accountable to the Senate. The NCCC is composed of nine commissioners (the President and eight other members) who sit for a term of nine years without renewal. The commissioners are selected by the Senate from a list of 18 candidates recommended by a selection committee of 15 people4. The persons nominated as NCCC commissioners must have been a Minister, Judge of the Constitutional Court,independent Commissioner,Ombudsman,member of the National Human Rights Commission,the State Audit Commission, serving or having served in positions not lower than Deputy Prosecutor General, Director General or its equivalent, or University Professor. The NCCC submits an annual performance report to the Senate, the House of Representatives and the Cabinet. In addition to the administrative units, the NCCC is composed of seven main Bureaus: (1) the Bureau of Corruption Prevention Measures, (2) the Bureau of Corruption Prevention \u2013 Public Relations and Ethics, (3) the Bureau of Policy and Planning, (4) the Bureau of Corruption Suppression \u2013 Local Government and Social Sector,(5) the Bureau of Corruption Suppression \u2013 other sectors, (6) the Bureau of Asset Inspection; and (7) the Bureau of Legal Affairs. 2 In 1992, the general who led the military coup in 1991 installed himself as prime minister.The 1997 Constitution now stipulates that the Prime Minister can only come from a political party leader who runs as Party-list Member of Parliament. 3 According to the Director General of the Customs Department (2002), at least 25 million baht (approximately US$610,000) in bribes passed under the table of customs officials monthly (http://www1.oecd.org/daf/asiacom/countries/thailand.htm). 4 The selection committee comprises the President of the Supreme Court, the President of the Constitutional Court, the President of the Supreme Administrative Court, 7 Rectors representing the State higher education institutions and 5 representatives from all political parties that have members in the House of Representatives. 89 The Office of the NCCC serves as the Commission\u2019s secretariat. It is headed by a Secretary General who is directly answerable to the President of the NCCC.

It proposes measures and recommendations (including legislative and managerial remedies) to the cabinet and concerned organizations, aiming to improve working procedures and reduce opportunities and incentives for corruption in the public sector. The NCCC also promotes transparency and accountability in society. It monitors the implementation of the provisions in the Organic Act on Counter Corruption that deal with conflict of interest issues. \ufffd Corruption suppression: the NCCC has the power to conduct inspections and investigations. The NCCC also investigates offences relating to the Bid in Public Agencies Act of 1999. The Act imposes severe penalties for politicians and state officials as well as private businesses6. Public officials who are aware of unfair or corrupt procurement practices but who fail to act against the process are also subject to strong penalties. The NCCC can summon relevant documents or evidence from any person or summon any person to provide a testimony in a corruption case.The NCCC cannot issue a search warrant or a warrant of arrest or custody; it needs to file an application with the competent court to do so. If the NCCC is of the opinion that the continued performance of the accused shall cause injury to the Government service or cause an impediment to the inquiry, the NCCC shall refer the matter to the superior of the accused for an order of suspension from the Government service,pending the decision of the NCCC.When investigating a case of unusual wealth, the NCCC has the power to order a temporary seizure of that property. Oversight of the operations of the NCCC is ensured through well-defined operational arrangements involving the courts and the prosecution services. Inquiries into corruption cases are also monitored by special committees composed jointly of external highly qualified resource persons and NCCC officials. The NCCC is not only tasked with ensuring witness protection, but also has the power to issue regulations and decide on rewards for information leading to the detection of corrupt activities. It also promotes research on corruption from social, economic, political and criminal perspectives. It has initiated a number of prevention programmes among youth, local governments and community people nationwide.The NCCC has commissioned several surveys on the issue of corruption in business and government, and has issued guidelines for public officials that regulate the acceptance of gifts. Furthermore, as part of its \u2018prevention\u2019mandate, the NCCC has taken several measures to promote ethical standards among students. Operational arrangements Where the NCCC finds irregularities in the declaration of assets of public officials,it shall,after investigation,refer the matter to the Constitutional Court for further decision. This is the case where the NCCC rules that an office-holder has withheld information or submitted false information when making an asset and liability declaration7. Country Briefs: Thailand 5 According to section 291 of the Constitution, persons holding the following political positions shall submit an account: (1) Prime Minister; (2) government ministers; (3) members of the House of Representatives; (4) senators; (5) other political officials; (6) local administrators and members of a local assembly as provided by law (the list has been specified in article 39 of the Organic Act on Counter Corruption).The account submitted by the Prime Minister and ministers shall be disclosed to the public. 6 As of 2000, it is believed that procurement corruption accounts for as high as five to ten percent of a procurement project\u2019s budget and as high as 10 to 20 percent of a bidding project budget (Seminar on \u201cAnti-corruption Strategic Planning Workshop\u201d, held by NCCC in 2000). 7 The Partnership and Shares Management of the Ministers Act stipulates that Cabinet members cannot hold shares of public companies of more than five percent unless he or she sets up a blind trust to manage the shares without his or her involvement. In 2000, a case involving the current Prime Minister was brought before the Constitutional Court.The Court decided in favour of the Prime Minister.

In that case, the President of the Senate shall refer the matter to the NCCC for investigation.

But the NCCC shall also submit the report to the Prosecutor General in order to institute prosecution in the Supreme Court Criminal Division for Holders of Political Office (for holders of political positions) or the competent court (for others).The removal from office by the Senate does not do prejudice to the trial of the Supreme Court (in accordance with the Organic Law on Criminal Proceedings against persons holding political positions) or another court (in the case of non-political positions). An individual can also lodge a complaint against a state official directly to the NCCC, in which case the NCCC will conduct a fact inquiry (the NCCC does not, however, consider anonymous complaints). If the matter concerns a person holding a political office, then the NCCC will report to the Senate and to the Prosecutor General. When the investigation involves a person who does not hold a political position, the case is submitted to the Prosecutor General (if there is a violation of the Criminal law). If there is a case for disciplinary action, the NCCC shall also submit the report to the relevant superior for further action. In principle, it is thus the Prosecutor General who is responsible for bringing corruption cases before the competent Court. However,there are some exceptions to this rule.First,where the case is to be judged by the Constitutional Court,the NCCC shall itself act as the prosecutor in the case. Second, the NCCC shall also have the power to act as prosecutor under the following two circumstances:(1) when the accused is a Prosecutor General; (2) when the Prosecutor General considers that the report of the NCCC is not complete and does not justify prosecution, and no agreement has been reached in the special working committee, consisting of representatives of both the NCCC and the Prosecutor General9. The NCCC operates within a web of relationships with other institutions that are directly or indirectly involved in anti- corruption efforts. The Election Commission comprises five members,selected by the Senate on the recommendation of a Selection Committee. It ensures the holding of free and fair elections.More specifically,the Election Commission has ruling power against candidates in vote-buying cases. It has the power to recall an election or bar a particular candidate from running for election should clear evidence for vote-buying be found. In addition, the body also oversees financing of and contribution to political parties. To ensure transparency in party financing, records of political parties\u2019 accounts \u2013 including income, expenses and contributions \u2013 are required to be reported to be the public on an annual basis. A key role in the fight against corruption lies with the Civil Service Commission (CSC) and its executive agency as well as with the Public Sector Development Commission (PSDC). The CSC sets policy and guidelines for the management and administration of the public service and oversees and monitors operations. It is comprised of 15 to 17 high-ranking government officials and individuals of high calibre from both the public and private sector10. The CSC sets ethical standards for government agencies to follow and advises and supports ministries, departments and provinces to develop efficient and effective management techniques. It is also tasked with strengthening people\u2019s awareness on public service values and confidence in the public service system. The Office of the Civil Service Commission (OCSC) is a government agency under the Office of the Prime Minister.The OCSC is headed by a secretary-general who is directly accountable to the Prime Minister as the Chairperson of the CSC. Its main duties involve making recommendations and advising the Cabinet on personnel administration policy, monitoring public sector personnel administration, serving as the central agency in protecting the merit system, as well as encouraging professionalism, efficiency, result-based performance, transparency and accountability in the public sector. The newly engineered Senior Executive Service aims towards more transparent and merit-based appointment of senior public officials. The Constitution also stipulates that members of Parliament cannot use their position to interfere with the appointment, recruitment, transfer or promotion of government officials. 8 A person holding a position of Prime Minister, Minister, member of the House of Representatives, senator, President of the Supreme Court of Justice, President of the Constitutional Court, President of the Supreme Administrative Court or Prosecutor General, who is under the circumstance of unusual wealth indicative", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e0669947-4958-4da2-ac9c-98ed0be33338": {"__data__": {"id_": "e0669947-4958-4da2-ac9c-98ed0be33338", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "56ad6743b65aa195e25a3cdaadcfa1c8361af0197f47e610f676e1553929e434"}}, "hash": "56ad6743b65aa195e25a3cdaadcfa1c8361af0197f47e610f676e1553929e434", "text": "of corruption, malfeasance in office, malfeasance in judicial office or an intentional exercise of power contrary to the provisions of the Constitution or law, may be removed from office by the Senate (Constitution section 303).The provisions also apply to the Election Commissioner, the Ombudsman, judges of the Constitutional Court, members of the State Audit Commission, civil court judges, public prosecutors and high ranking officials (section 303). 9 That special working committee is to collect further evidence to be submitted to the Prosecutor General for further prosecution.Where there is no agreement, the NCCC itself shall have the power to prosecute or appoint a lawyer to prosecute on its behalf. 10 There are five elected commissioners, five to seven academic specialists and five ex officio members (which include the Prime Minister or Deputy Prime Minister, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, the Director of the Budget, the Secretary General of the National Economic and Social Development Board and the Secretary General of the Civil Service Commission). 91 In 2001, the OCSC created the Transparent and Clean Thailand Foundation (http://www.fact.or.th/english/index.asp). The Foundation is a joint effort between the OCSC, relevant public and private organizations and the general public. The objective of the foundation is to raise awareness among all segments of Thai society \u2013 including politicians, state employees,businessmen,and the general public \u2013 to embrace ethical standards and to conduct themselves with honesty and integrity as well as to encourage mutual cooperation and networking among organizations and individuals to safeguard against corruption.The campaign called \u201cNeither give nor receive\u201daims to create a new value for the Thai society. In 2002, the Government created the PSDC. The PSDC plays a key role in monitoring the implementation of the Decree on Rules and Procedures for Good Public Administration (2003). In accordance with the decree, the permanent Secretary in each ministry shall establish One-Stop Service Centres (OSSC) that will act as intermediaries between the citizens and the government agencies, and enhance transparency, convenient public access to information and speedy delivery of services. Similar OSSCs are to be established at the provincial, district and sub-district levels. The Office of the Official Information Commission (OIC) is in charge of awareness creation and enforcement of the Official Information Act (1997). In essence, public agencies are entitled to provide information as requested by the public, with few exceptions. Citizens can file complaints to OIC in a case of non-compliance by a public agency, and OIC has power to direct the agency to disclose information. The Royal Decree on Rules and Procedures for Good Public Administration (2003) also imposes disclosure of official duty11. Official secrecy may be imposed to maintain national security, national economic stability, public order or to protect personal rights. The State Audit Commission audits the accuracy of statements on receipts and payments, custody and disbursement of money and use of other properties of public agencies and state enterprises. It also certifies whether transactions are in compliance with stated objectives and are cost-effective.The Auditor General is appointed by the King after prior approval by the National Assembly.The Auditor General holds office until retirement at the age of 60. The Organic Law on the Ombudsman of 1999 foresees a maximum of three Ombudsmen.The Ombudsman is empowered to seek facts on complaints against public officials who do not perform according to the laws, fail to perform their duties as required by law or exercise powers beyond their authority. The Ombudsman is thus another channel through which corruption cases can be acted upon.The Ombudsman does not have investigative power and needs to file alleged corruption cases with the NCCC. It can also submit cases to the Constitutional Court or the Administrative Court for decision. The Ombudsman also provides an annual report to the Parliament,which is another channel to reveal the corruption situation in the country. The National Human Rights Commission of Thailand (NHRC), established under the Constitution, is composed of 11 full-time commissioners, elected for a six-year term by the Senate from a shortlist of 22 people. Each Commissioner can serve for only one term. The Commission is to (1) promote the respect for human rights; (2) examine and report on acts which violate human rights or which do not comply with international obligations;(3) propose polices and amendments of laws,rules and regulations for the promotion and protection of human rights; (4) promote human rights education and research, including the dissemination of human rights information; (5) promote coordination and cooperation with governmental agencies, nongovernmental organizations and others; and (6) give opinions when the government considers being a party to human rights treaties.

The NHRC submits an annual report to both the Parliament and the Cabinet. Relations between the state and its citizens are also regulated by the rulings of the Administrative Court.

It also covers dispute over cases where state officials neglect to perform their duties or perform their duties at an inappropriately slow pace.Anyone who feels s/he has been wrongfully discriminated against by a state agency can take the case to the Administrative Court, making it an important avenue for the general public to police the actions of the state. The Anti-Money Laundering Office (AMLO) serves as the Financial Intelligence Unit for law enforcement agencies in Thailand. As such, a primary function is to collect and analyze the various reports submitted to AMLO by financial institutions and other sources of information in order to identify subjects for investigation.Corruption is one of the seven charges covered under the Anti-Money Laundering Law of 1999. AMLO has the power to cease banking transaction of suspected cases under the Anti-Money Laundering Law.The Office is accountable to a Board, chaired by the Prime Minister. AMLO is responsible for Country Briefs: Thailand 11 Government agencies are obliged to disclose their annual budget, annual procurement as well as any approved procurement contract.

A further responsibility of AMLO is to educate the public and private sectors concerning the Anti-Money Laundering Act. The Decree on Good Governance also assigns to the National Social and Economic Advisory Board (NSEAB) the task of creating and facilitating cooperation among government, business, and the general public for the establishment of sustainable good governance. The NSEAB is a constitutional body comprised of 99 members, selected from different professions. It is meant to be a formal channel of the people\u2019s voice to the Cabinet. The Board has set up an internal anti-corruption working group. The Cabinet is required to respond to the Board\u2019s inquiries or recommendations, but it does not need to follow the recommendations given. Lessons learned The independence of the NCCC from the Executive branch has improved its operations, especially where it is to verify the assets and liability declaration of persons holding political offices.The NCCC also has a wider jurisdiction than did the former OCCC, which could only intervene after a state official was accused of corruption. The transfer to the Constitutional Court of cases involving declarations of assets of high-level politicians have strengthened popular confidence in the NCCC. Clearly, while playing an important role, the NCCC is not the only institution involved in the fight against corruption. As is the case in other countries, the Thai experience has shown that one organization, even if independent and highly efficient, is unlikely to be successful if not complemented by a comprehensive legal and institutional framework.Thailand has designed institutional and legal mechanisms whereby corruption can be tackled from different points of view, including significant efforts in public sector reform, with a key role assigned to the Office of the Public Service Commission. But a comprehensive framework also calls for effective coordination mechanisms. However, there seems to be an increasing lack of coordination as more institutions have now been given a mandate to coordinate anti-corruption related activities directly or indirectly (the NCCC, the OCSC, the NSEAB). In addition to a comprehensive web of state institutions, the Thai experience also stresses the need for effective partnerships between relevant authorities, civil society and the media. People can file complaints and lawsuits against corrupt practices either to the NCCC, the Ombudsman or the Administrative Court, or to the Senate (by gathering at least 50,000 signatures to file a petition to the Senate Chairman against politicians and senior state officials12 whose behaviour and wealth imply corrupt practices and/or abuse of public power).The recent arrest in Bangkok on 30 October 2004 of a former Health Minister who had fled the court hearing in the Supreme Court (in 2003) is but one example of a successful collaboration between the NCCC and civil society (in this case, the Anti-Corruption Network). But while the independence of the NCCC has proven successful in the unprecedented indictment of high-level corruption cases in the country, the lack of oversight by a representation from civil society is a point of concern. Although civil society actively collaborates with the NCCC, oversight mechanisms are lacking. First, civil society representatives cannot apply to be NCCC Commissioners.

The NCCC has the power to initiate criminal prosecution against politicians, their advisors and senior officials but it lacks the manpower and resources to do so. Capacity remains a serious issue of concern, and one of the main reasons for the current backlog of corruption cases. When the OCCC was replaced by the NCCC, pending cases stood at approximately 3,000. At present,pending cases have increased to nearly 5,000.The NCCC\u2019s mandate covers persons holding political positions at all levels, including the local level, and all levels of state officials. With manpower of approximately 500 for a total population of 65 million, it is almost impossible for the NCCC to cover the entirety of its mandate13 . The NCCC is now working towards e stablishing a screening mechanism within respective ministries before a case is submitted to the Commission. The problem of capacity is aggravated by the fact that assets and liabilities declarations of officials other than Cabinet members are classified as secret by law.The NCCC is thus unable to hire outside personnel or institutions to assist in verifying the accuracy of assets and liability declarations. 12 The 17 positions for which such petition is possible are defined in the Organic Law on Counter Corruption. 13 Hong Kong\u2019s ICAC has a manpower of 1,300 staff for a total population of 6.8 million. 93 Because of this lack of capacity and insufficient human resources, the NCCC has not been able to reach out to people reporting corruption. The ineffectiveness of the NCCC\u2019s whistleblower programme has also reduced popular involvement. The NCCC is also supposed to promote capacity development related to combating economic crime. But while the NCCC has provided recommendations to state agencies, due to a lack of trained personnel, it has not been able to do so for private businesses, unlike Hong Kong\u2019s ICAC.

The task of combating corruption was performed by the Ministry of Home Affairs, with the Police Force Department mandated to investigate and prosecute corruption offences. But the side-effects of the command economy soon started to become evident as monopolies in the economic sectors provided ample opportunities for extortion. In order to combat the increasing levels of corruption, in 1971, the Prevention of Corruption Act was adopted.This was followed in 1975 by the creation of the Anti-Corruption Squad (ACS) by President Julius Nyerere, under the Prevention of Corruption Amendment Act (1974). The ACS was initially under the Ministry of Home Affairs. However, in an effort to make it more independent in the execution of its duties, supervision of the Squad was shifted to the Office of the Prime Minister and eventually to the Office of the President. In the 1980s, despite the creation of the ACS, corruption had become prevalent, particularly in the police, and banditry and smuggling was widespread.In 1984,the Government enacted the Economic and Organized Crime Control Act, making offences under the PCA economic crimes.

In the early 1990s,the government launched a series of remedies that focused largely on promoting popular involvement,e.g., reporting \u2018wrongdoers\u2019as well as on campaigns to improve relations between the police and the public service.This included United Republic of Tanzania 95 giving incentives for reporting smuggled or stolen goods,and policemen were encouraged to denounce those offering bribes. Although these campaigns were believed to have led to some reductions in corruption, implementation of the strategy met with several obstacles. Corruption in procurement remained high, funds from charities and non-governmental organizations continued to be funnelled to private accounts, and there were high levels of tax evasion. In addition, court action remained slow and there were repeated failures to bring convictions to a close. In 1991, the ACS was renamed the Prevention of Corruption Bureau (PCB), with the intention of creating an institution capable of applying a scientific approach to combating corruption. Corruption was one of the main issues during the 1995 elections \u2013 the first multi-party elections in Tanzania \u2013 and the winning candidate had led by example in declaring his and his families assets during the election campaign1. The new President decided to establish a Presidential Commission of Enquiry Against Corruption (commonly known as the Warioba Commission) as well as the Public Leaders\u2019 Ethics Secretariat. The Warioba Commission was appointed early in 1996 to extensively inquire into the problem of corruption in the country and come up with recommendations to move forward. The report of the Commission detailed that petty as well as grand corruption was rampant at all levels of society,stigmatizing ministries,departments and agencies involved in corrupt practices. The widespread corruption was partly explained by low salaries in the civil service, but the report concluded that the worst perpetrators were actually those at higher levels in the bureaucracy.The Commission identified a lack of ethical leadership and the failure to remove or persecute corrupt high-ranking officials as being the major cause of corruption.This, in combination with a failure of the relevant parties to act on citizen reports on incidence of corruption, explained the lack of confidence of the people in state organs, especially the judiciary and the police. Moreover, the Commission found that the PCB had focused on investigation rather than prevention of corruption; the report also found that the PCB suffered from inadequate resources to effectively fulfil its mandate (Government of Tanzania, 1996). Following the delivery of the Commission\u2019s Report, the government embarked on the formulation of a national anti-corruption strategy.The process involved government ministries, NGOs, the private sector, civic associations, donors, the media and religious organizations. Resulting from this participatory process was the National Anti-Corruption Strategy and Action Plan, adopted in 1999. It covers all sectors and sets out the four principles for the fight against corruption, namely (1) prevention; (2) enforcement; (3) public awareness and participation; and (4) institution building. The strategy also highlights the importance of political will for the success of anti-corruption measures. Tanzania placed 88th out of 159 countries on Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perception Index 2005. Although the country still suffers from high levels of corruption permeating all areas of society, Tanzania has showed improvement since the late 1990s. Mandate and institutional links of the key anti-corruption institution The Prevention of Corruption Bureau (essentially the renamed Anti-Corruption Squad) came into being in 1991 by Government Notice No. 27 of 1991. The Bureau is a semi-autonomous governmental institution tasked with combating corruption in mainland Tanzania, under the supervision of the President\u2019s Office.The Bureau is headed by a General Director, directly accountable to the President. The director is assisted by four Directors (PCA, Section 2A). On administrative and financial matters of the PCB, the Director General is accountable to the Chief Secretary of the President\u2019s Office.The Director General authorizes investigations of corrupt practices that involve high-ranking government officials, political parties, public institutions and the private sector, and advises the President on actions taken after completing investigations of alleged corruption. In accordance with Section 3A(3) of the PC[A]A No. 2, the functions of the PCB are: \ufffd To take necessary measures for the prevention of corruption in the public, parastatal and private sectors; \ufffd To investigate and, subject to the directions of the Director of Public Prosecutions, to prosecute for offences under the PCA and other offences involving corrupt transactions; and \ufffd To advise the Government, the public, civil society organizations, parastatal organizations and the private sector on ways and means to prevent", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b417c98c-9e42-4d8b-969e-514f744aae53": {"__data__": {"id_": "b417c98c-9e42-4d8b-969e-514f744aae53", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca93d9e1ac6e2ed9231bd072609d48c79ac8e277042130f1b6c8b79b719f3b5a"}}, "hash": "ca93d9e1ac6e2ed9231bd072609d48c79ac8e277042130f1b6c8b79b719f3b5a", "text": "corruption.

By law,the PCB is mandated to investigate all forms of corruption in the public,parastatal as well as private sectors.The Director General may assume the responsibility for any investigation or prosecution commenced by the police for an offence involving corruption (PCA, Section 2A[4]). The PCB invites and considers complaints, including those given anonymously. As part of its investigatory mandate, the Bureau also initiates surveillance. Pending the approval of the Director of Public Prosecution, the Bureau may also prosecute cases. Officers of the PCB have the same powers in performing their functions as police officers6. This includes the power to arrest, enter premises, detain suspects and seize property when there is reason to suspect that any offence involving corruption has been or is about to be committed (PCA,Section 2A[4]).In addition,the Director General may grant PCB officers special powers of investigation, e.g. to investigate bank accounts (PCA, Section 12[1]). The PCB also has regional offices that are headed by the Regional Bureau Chiefs, who report directly to the Director General. The regional offices have a mandate to prevent, investigate and educate on corruption. However, they may not institute or withdraw a corruption case without instructions from the Director General.There are also district offices.These are headed by senior investigators who are responsible to the Regional Bureau Chief. Operational arrangements The performance of the PCB is monitored by the Committee for Control and Evaluation and the Committee of Directors. The Committee of Control and Evaluation is responsible for the overall supervision of the performance of the PCB. The Committee is chaired by the Chief Secretary of the President\u2019s Office, with the PCB Director General, the Director General of the Tanzanian Intelligence and Security System and the Private Secretary of the President as additional members. The Director of Administration and Personnel of the PCB acts as Secretary. The Committee of Directors is chaired by the PCB Director General, with the Directors of the PCB as members. The operations of the PCB are also monitored by the Auditor General.The report of the Auditor General is made public and is subject to public evaluation. As mentioned above, the PCB may prosecute cases. However, in order to do so, it must seek the approval of the Director of Public Prosecution (PCA, Section 18).It is the Legal and Prosecution Section within the PCB that is responsible for prosecuting corruption offences. In doing so, the section is to work closely with the Police and the Director of Public Prosecution. No prosecution matters are submitted to the Director of Public Prosecution without having been approved first by the Committee of Directors.Offences under the PCA are to be tried by the High Court,the court of Resident Magistrate or a District Court (PCA, Section 19). The Good Governance Office, within the President\u2019s Office, is tasked with the: (1) implementation and coordination of the National Anti-Corruption Strategy and Action Plan (2) monitoring of the public leaders' ethics and abuse of power; (3) coordination of state organs involved in the fight against corruption; (4) strengthening of the legal regime (i.e., anti- corruption legislation and ethics frameworks); and (5) linking the efforts of the Government with civil society (through education, prevention of corruption programmes, media, etc). As such, it has the overall responsibility for coordination of the fight against corruption. However, the Good Governance Office has limited capacity to fulfil this wide mandate. The PLCE Act of 1995 established a code of ethics for public leaders (as defined in the Act) as well as required all public leaders to submit a declaration of property (also including that of family members). The Public Leaders\u2019 Ethics Secretariat has the duty to receive these declarations as well as notifications of breaches of the code of ethics from the public and to inquire into any alleged or suspected breach of the code of ethics by public leaders who are subject to the PCLE Act (Section 2 The Investigation Division consists of the Public Sector Investigation Section, the Private Sector Investigation Section, the Legal and Prosecution Section and the Technical and Communication Services", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1ee43396-35a4-4b6f-a73a-300d7167fa0d": {"__data__": {"id_": "1ee43396-35a4-4b6f-a73a-300d7167fa0d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f0c32769a92c5294544211bfcb3f628c9170ed7acb6cf35fb909cf1021417a18"}}, "hash": "f0c32769a92c5294544211bfcb3f628c9170ed7acb6cf35fb909cf1021417a18", "text": "Section. 3 The Research, Control and Statistics Division consists of the Research Section, the Control Section, and the Statistics Section. 4 The Public Education Section consists of the Liaison and Coordination Section, the Public Education Section, the Library Section, and the Planning and Logistics Section. 5 The Administration and Personnel Section consists of the Administration Section, the Personnel Section, and the Training Section. 6 The same powers as granted to a police officer of or above the rank of an Assistant Superintendent of Police. 97 19[2]). The Ethics Secretariat was established in accordance with Section 132 of the Constitution. Within the Secretariat, the office of the Ethics Commissioner, who also serves as the head of the Secretariat, was established in 1996 in accordance with Section 20 of the PLCE Act.The Commissioner is appointed by and reports to the President. As provided by Section 8 of the PCA, any public officer may, if authorized in writing by the President, the Attorney General or the Director General of the PCB, be requested to give an account of all property in his/her possession as well as in the possession of the immediate family or associate. If the public officer is found to be in possession of property that could be suspected of being corruptly acquired, s/he must give an explanation for this. Should the public officer not be able to give a satisfactory response, s/he will be found guilty of an offence under the PCA and a court may order the property acquired by corrupt means to be forfeited (PCA, Section 9). The Human Rights and Good Governance Commission, which was established in 2002,serves the function of Ombudsman (replacing the previous Permanent Commission of Enquiry). The Commission considers complaints of abuse of office, including human rights abuses. It recently asserted itself by finding against the Government in a case filed by members of a village in the Serengeti who were forcefully removed by the district authorities. The case had a high profile and the Commission gained the public\u2019s respect for its politically sensitive \u2013 though widely perceived to be fair \u2013 ruling. The National Audit Office is the supreme audit institution in the country. The Office, together with the National Board of Accountants and Auditors,has issued a Code of Ethics for its members,aimed at instituting a professional behaviour that leads to reduced malpractices, including corruption. The profession has also been at the forefront of promoting best practice in corporate governance in the country.The National Board of Accountants and Auditors is one of the founding members of the Tanzania Institute of Corporate Governance, a private sector institution recently launched to spearhead the corporate governance issues in the country. Lessons learned One of the main causes of corruption in Tanzania, as identified by the Warioba Commission, was the poor example that the leadership was showing in the fight against corruption. As mentioned earlier, corruption affects the country at all levels and little was being done to address corruption at the higher levels. In addition, when corrupt officials at the lower levels of the bureaucracy were reported by the public, frequently no action was taken as superior officers were either directly involved in the corruption or did not consider it a priority (Government of Tanzania, 1996). In order to address the perceived lack of ethics within the leadership, the PLCE Act provided for the adoption of a code of conduct for public leaders as well as the establishment of the Public Leaders\u2019 Ethics Commission and the Office of the Ethics Commissioner.The Commissioner is,however,limited to making enquiries to complaints received from \u201cidentified\u201dpersons and reports in the media.The Commissioner may not make enquiries on the basis of anonymous complaints. Also, the Secretariat is dependent on the police and the PCB for conducting investigations. In addition, as long as standards are not well-defined and penalties for breaches not explicitly provided, the role of the Commissioner will be limited. A further obstacle to the effective functioning of the Secretariat was the statement by the Attorney General that public declarations of wealth offended the constitutional right of privacy. Following this, declarations have only been made directly to the Ethics Commissioner.In order to gain access to these declarations,special permission is required \u2013 though rarely granted.Even when permission is granted, it is illegal to make public any information obtained. To date, no one has been convicted for making a false declaration or for having excessive wealth. Corruption at the lower levels has been attributed to low levels of remuneration, something which was also acknowledged as a problem by the Warioba Commission. The Commission went on to conclude that this should not,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3c80671c-afc8-4360-b6f7-492a01e3e7aa": {"__data__": {"id_": "3c80671c-afc8-4360-b6f7-492a01e3e7aa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Arrangements to Combat Corruption - A Comparative Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-arrangements-combat-corruption-comparative-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ce362aee1942ab5a1b635d4bbae3d7d61ea08526348ed586e55c6979cf6124f5"}}, "hash": "ce362aee1942ab5a1b635d4bbae3d7d61ea08526348ed586e55c6979cf6124f5", "text": "however, be seen as the major determinant of corruption as those most corrupt were also those at higher levels within the establishment and already receiving high salaries. Raising salaries would thus \u201conly help them raise the value of corruption\u201d. That corruption is prevalent also within the higher levels of the public service is also acknowledged in the National Anti-Corruption Strategy and Action Plan. The latter, however, states that raising salaries and increasing incentives for public servants is part of, but not in itself, a strategy towards addressing the high levels of corruption. The PCB itself has proven less than effective in combating corruption,with few cases of corruption being prosecuted and even fewer convictions. One problem is the institutional setup of the Bureau, i.e. the fact that the PCB is a functional section of the President\u2019s Office, thus lacking in independence because it is subject to the directives of the President\u2019s Office. The Director Country Briefs: United Republic of Tanzania Institutional Arrangments to Combat Corruption: A Comparative Study 98 General of the PCB is appointed by and responsible to the President. Having no fixed term, the Director General serves at the will of the President, who alone has the power to remove or sanction the Director General. Confidential reports need to be forwarded to the President. The PCB is thus not in a position to seriously tackle corruption involving actors close to the President. Moreover, the Committee of Control and Evaluation, which oversees the performance of the PCB, is chaired by the Chief Secretary of the President\u2019s Office. The findings of this Committee are not published. In addition, neither Parliament nor citizen\u2019s committees have formal oversight authority for the PCB.These are all factors that are likely to contribute to the lack of public confidence in the Bureau.Some observers have also argued that the PCB has not gained public support and credibility to act independently because of fear, apathy and lack of awareness of its mission. Nonetheless, despite all the changes made over the years in the institutional setting of the Anti-corruption Squad, the functions and responsibilities of the PCB have remained the same as those contained in the PCA of 1971. An essential element of any anti-corruption agency is having the capacity for researching levels and causes of corruption. The Research Section of the Research, Control and Statistics Division in the PCB carries out research on: various policies to ensure that there is no room for corrupt practices; on services provided by different institutions in order to detect loopholes that lead to corruption; on remuneration of public servants, employees of political parties, parastatals, and the private sector; on Public Service Acts and regulations so as to determine whether such legal instruments are appropriate and in conformity with the behaviour of employees; and on methods for combating corruption adopted in other countries. A further hindrance to the efficiency of the PCB is the weak linkages that the Bureau has with other government agencies, in particular, the judiciary.The judiciary is itself weak, requiring increased resources and capacity. In order for the fight against corruption to be effective and for the national Anti-Corruption Strategy and Action Plan to be implemented,stronger linkages with the government as well as with civil society and the private sector are required on the part of the Bureau. Strengthening the PCB and implementing the Strategy will not, however, in itself be sufficient. Other reforms are also needed; local government reform, public finance reform and public sector reform will all play a critical role in coming to terms with corruption. Furthermore, it will also require a change in culture and attitudes within the leadership and the existence of political will at the highest levels to come to terms with corruption.

The project was strategically well-positioned and highly relevant, being a response to the MoH request for support in its efforts to establish transparency and accountability in health sector. It has proven to be highly innovative and catalytic, resulting in its replication at the State Specialized Inspection Agency (SSIA) in 2008 and the Independent Anti- Corruption Authority in 2009. This new project, \u2018Strengthening Integrity and Transparency Efforts in Mongolia\u2019 (SITE), will seek to replicate the integrity approaches piloted in the health sector in other sectors and will continue to work with the MoH as one of the partner agencies. The accountability and transparency benchmarks developed for the health sector have attracted the interest of the central government. It has recently been reported that the central government has been collecting suggestions and comments from its ministries on issuance of a governmental resolution for using the health sector benchmarks across the entire public sector, thus ensuring even further sustainability of the project\u2019s efforts. The Code of Ethics of Medical Professionals has been accepted as a set of guiding principles for professional conduct throughout the health sector of the country. The project has also managed to create synergies between other donor-supported projects in the health sector that have brought tangible changes in policies and management. One example is the introduction of an over two-fold increase of salaries for health sector employees and consequently, according to medical staff, less interest in receiving under- the-table payments. High rotation and frequent changes in MoH and project management and staff have posed challenges that have successfully been overcome except for one final outcome: collecting and storing products produced by the project as manuals, CDs, brochures and materials in one place. As the present assessment is being conducted 15 months after project closure, this report will examine outcomes, sustainability and implementation across the entire period, rather than limiting itself to the implementation phase. Executive summary 8 The DGTTF-funded pilot project \u2018Strengthening Ethics and Integrity for Good Governance in the Health Sector of Mongolia\u2019 was implemented in two phases over two years from January 2006 through December 2007 on USD 260,000, out of which USD 230,000 were disbursed from the DGTTF and USD 30,000 from UNDP country office TRAC funds. This project aimed at supporting the ongoing initiatives of the MoH to improve: ethics and integrity in the health sector; assess the current situation: initiate dialogue; promote discussion; and propose ways to implement sustainable change within institutions. The project\u2019s expected outcomes were: a To increase transparency and accountability of the MoH and selected health organizations by identifying current constraints and bottleneck areas and developing mechanisms to address them a To promote ethics and integrity of staff through open discussions, training, a code of conduct and handling complaints The project aimed to: a Develop new benchmarks for transparency and accountability requirements; a Review and suggest amendments to government regulations and procedures used in the health sector to ensure that procurement, financial management processes and human resources practices are fair and just; and a Strengthen the mandate, rules and procedures of the Ethics Committee of Medical Professionals. The project included the following activities: a Development of transparency and accountability benchmarks in the civil service a Review of existing laws, regulations and procedures in the health sector to ensure efficient and transparent procurement, financial management processes and human resources practices with suggestions for amendments a Development of a General Code of Ethics of Medical Professionals a Development of a Code of Ethics of Medical Professionals by medical institutions based on the General Code of Ethics of Medical Professionals a Development, publication and dissemination of training manuals related to ethics of civil servants, managers and medical professionals a Organization of trainings on professional, civil service and public management ethics a Development and publication of a manual for trainers and organization of training of trainers on health sector ethics a Training on ethics in all 21 provinces of Mongolia a Organization of a study tour to Singapore to examine the health sector ethics system a Publication and dissemination of a compilation of all health sector-related laws for the general public, entitled \u2018Citizen and Health\u2019 a Organization of an inter-sectoral conference on experience sharing a Review and revision of Ethics Committee rules and regulations a Establishment of ethics sub-committees in every health organization Introduction 9 Mongolia Project Assessment a Launch of an E-licensing Centre responsible for conducting examinations and issuing licenses for medical professionals (www.med-license.mn) a Development and launch of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "74a4d0ae-f5f2-4131-bf42-10b1fe615cdb": {"__data__": {"id_": "74a4d0ae-f5f2-4131-bf42-10b1fe615cdb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrity-health-sector-mongolia-project-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integrity in the Health Sector: Mongolia Project Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrity-health-sector-mongolia-project-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ec6ac6dbb66946eb0bcfe5e85ce4e649733e6848200adca15d3c808662defea7"}, "3": {"node_id": "9db0c2bb-df97-444a-9d79-6433d9bd5be8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrity-health-sector-mongolia-project-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e2e640d398eb1146870e142b2a51b6d4d517be460daf111d2cc72190763e1907"}}, "hash": "8cc1c1b53f1d73a547ee081da6dbc1c5eb6fda9901a5cb1fe1433d261248c2ab", "text": "Drugs Registration, an online database accessible by pharmaceutical companies and the public (http://MoH.mn/MoH db/drug.nsf) a Upgrade of the MoH Ethics Committee website (http:// www.MoH.mn/newethics/) a Disbursement of small grants to 24 health organizations a The launch of an annual reward and sector\u2013wide acknowledgement of professional organization with best ethics a Corruption and transparency perception baseline study of the health sector a Study on salaries, remunerations and norms in the medical profession that led to a revision of salaries in the health and education sectors a Assessment of application of benchmarks on accountability and transparency in health sector (Nov 2007 \u2013 Jan 2008) a Development and dissemination of electronic versions of training manuals, laws, regulations, the Code of Ethics and all documentation collected and developed under this project a Development and publication of media products informing general public of ethics in health sector; popularization of the E- licensing centre 10 This pilot project was implemented in the health sector and aimed to strengthen democratic governance though greater openness, accountability, transparency and the introduction of a code of professional ethics. These objectives have largely been achieved over a two-year implementation period. Public sector corruption has long been identified by all stakeholders, including the public, government and donors, as the leading impediment to democratic governance and \u2018the main obstacle to achieving sustainable pro-poor development in support of the MDGs\u2019.2 The first effort to tackle corruption in Mongolia was made in 1993, when the Parliament established a Sub-Committee on Anti-Corruption, whose work led to adoption of the Anti-Corruption Law in 1996. This was the first legal document in the country aimed at regulating prevention and investigation of corrupt practices. In 1999 a Parliamentary Anti-Corruption Working Group was established to develop a National Programme for Combating Corruption, approved in 2002. Mongolia joined the Anti-Corruption Action Plan for Asia and the Pacific in 2001 and ratified the United Nations Convention against Corruption in October 2005. A new Anti-Corruption Law was passed in July 2006 and the Independent Authority Against Corruption (IAAC) was established in early 2007. Despite all those efforts, numerous studies have revealed that public perception of corruption in the public sector has been worsening and trust in government declining. Accountability within the public sector has been weak, raising public suspicions of corruption. A number of surveys have confirmed the perception of the health sector as corrupt. Regular surveys conducted by the Asia Foundation have found that health care providers are consistently ranked among the top three professions amenable to bribes (Mongolia Corruption Benchmarking Survey, September 2008). Although efforts have been made towards transparency and accountability in the civil service at large, the general practical impact seems to have been insignificant, according to numerous surveys, assessments and evaluations conducted by national and international organizations.3 The demonstration of political will on the part of MoH to strengthen integrity and ethics in the health sector and to partner with UNDP on developing a project on good governance has therefore been a pioneering initiative within the public sector. MoH began its initiative for greater transparency and ethics in 2004-2005, and received DGTTF support in 2006 that greatly catalyzed progress. MoH officials have acknowledged that despite modest funding, project outcomes have been significant.

As a quality manager of the Second General Hospital in the capital, Ulaanbaatar, put it: \u201cMedical ethics became a fashion throughout the sector thanks to the project.\u201d A Code of Ethics of Medical Professionals was developed.

Although the project achieved its stated objectives, outcomes were of uneven quality largely because of their innovative and challenging approach to issues of democratic accountability, financial and operational transparency, civil service integrity, participatory decision-making and implementation, open reporting, and human-rights based service delivery. The findings below highlight the objectives achieved and the level and quality of implementation. Establishment and incorporation of transparency and accountability benchmarks Health-sector regulations and procedures were reviewed to identify constraints and bottlenecks to transparency and accountability and develop mechanisms to address them. Benchmarks were set at sectoral, organizational and individual levels to ensure fair, open procurement and transparent, accountable financial management processes and human resources practices. Decree No. 177 of the Minister of Health (implementing provision 6 of the Anti-Corruption Law) adopted benchmarks on transparency, integrity and accountability in human resources, procurement and financial management and stipulated their implementation from 22 June 2007. The benchmarks for financial management transparency on the sectoral level called for defining finance policy, revising implementation mechanisms and publicly reporting budget expenditures. Those on the organizational level stipulated public access to information on payments and tariffs for paid services, transparency in the financial accounting of MoH, the Ministry of Finances and the State Social Insurance General Department in finance-related dealings with health care organizations, and conducting dealings with the private sector openly, transparently and strictly in accordance with adopted rules and regulations. At the individual level, benchmarks called for establishing a code of ethical conduct, collecting service fees according to established rules, and reporting these benchmarks was a significant step toward transparency and accountability throughout the health sector. However, the adoption of benchmarks on paper did not automatically lead to implementation. An independent project-supported assessment published in 2008 revealed persistent deficiencies in health sector accountability and transparency on financial management, budget-based procurement, and participatory decision-making on financial allocations at sectoral, ministerial and organizational levels. Moreover, the assessment revealed that top sector managers sincerely believed that there was no need for open procedures or reporting. A 2007 audit by the National Audit Office on heath sector expenditures and performance, published on December 2008, exposed serious problems of spending, illegality and mismanagement. Yet the response of senior MoH management to these findings was neither open to the public nor transparently reported within MoH. Effectiveness 12 Integrity in the Health Sector Although implementation of financial management and procurement benchmarks left much to be desired, the assessment showed increased awareness of all stakeholders about these issues and the need to improve accountability and transparency of human resources policies and practices. However, there remained room for improvement on workplace safety and eliminating nepotism in hiring. Transparency and accountability benchmarks to be introduced throughout the public sector The IAAC has modified the benchmarks to apply to all public sectors, with additional benchmarks for pubic reporting and accounting. A forthcoming governmental resolution will seek to enforce transparency and accountability benchmarks in every sector of public service. All ministries have been invited to submit suggestions and amendments on the initiative, and MoH has been recognized as breaking new ground in anti- corruption. The new IAAC-authored benchmarks on public reporting and accounting aim to increase public participation in the accountability, transparency and integrity initiative. Salary scheme change and introduction of work incentives MoH was able to create synergies among its HR strategic policies, this project, and a WHO-supported project on HR development. As a result, the project funded a comprehensive assessment of salary schemes in the health sector, which led to the separation of salary schemes for heath and education sector employees from those of all civil servant employees, an update of health professionals\u2019 workload standards from 1986, and an update of labour norms for health professionals. The assessment has shown that there is a great deal of unaccounted and unpaid work in the health sector, which compromises the quality and integrity of health services. Tellingly, all health sector employees interviewed for this assessment expressed satisfaction with the pay raises (100% to 150%) that followed the assessment, and asserted that fair remuneration for their work had directly improved the integrity of the health sector. The assessment findings and recommendations were discussed by the Prime Minister and sectoral ministers of Mongolia, representatives of international organizations and health professionals. The MoH organized a high-level meeting on human resources issues in health care system and signed an MOU establishing an Inter-Sectoral Coordinating Committee on Health Sector Human Resources consisting of governmental ministries, donors and partner agencies, including", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a43c88c3-354c-42ac-ad87-c3aa753f3575": {"__data__": {"id_": "a43c88c3-354c-42ac-ad87-c3aa753f3575", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrity-health-sector-mongolia-project-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integrity in the Health Sector: Mongolia Project Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrity-health-sector-mongolia-project-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c8e71c4a2b2789d47fb3c80d0f8f0feeb4a30c270dea79ecc0e67a005af7f1b0"}}, "hash": "c8e71c4a2b2789d47fb3c80d0f8f0feeb4a30c270dea79ecc0e67a005af7f1b0", "text": "UNDP. The Coordinating Committee supported the initiatives of the Mongolian government in HR. Its first activity in the health sector was the establishment of a remuneration system to motivate city-based, high-level medical doctors to work for six months in aimag centres that suffer from a lack of specialists. The system received financial support from ADB (in the amount of 70 million MNT). A remuneration of 1 million MNT (USD 645) is given on top of a doctor\u2019s salary, which is around 350,000 MNT. Under this scheme, doctors from the best capital-based hospitals and scientific centres not only treat people and conduct disease prevention work during their countryside residence, but also train their rural colleagues. Nine doctors joined the programme in November 2008, and were due back to the capital on May 2009. In addition to changes in salary schemes for health sector employees, the project has encouraged a system of incentives for ethical behaviour and service quality. MoH has introduced an annual award for the most ethical health care organizations in Mongolia. A few hospitals received such an award in 2008. The organizations themselves have also initiated bonuses on salaries (for example 10%) to promote ethical behaviour, as well as other incentives, which reward the most ethical employees. For example, in the Second General Hospital, one of the largest 16 hospitals in the capital, patients are encouraged to make use of a board of gratitude for employees set up at the hospital entrance. Patients can express their thanks by purchasing 500 MNT heart-shaped paper cards on which to write the name of the employee whom they wish to thank and post the card on the board. The \u2018hearts\u2019 are collected once a quarter and employees with the most gratitude postings are awarded a cash prize from the collected contributions, as well as publicly recognized on the board. Renewal of Ethics Committee and establishment of sub-committees However, gratitude postings are not the only incentive to improve service delivery. Health organizations participating in the project also placed complaints boxes next to hospital entrances or inpatient wards. In the Second General Hospital for example, the complaints box is placed below the gratitude board. Complaints are regularly collected by organizations\u2019 quality managers. Those related to ethics are transferred to organization\u2019s sub-committee on ethics, established in all project\u2013selected hospitals in 2006. In that same year the structure, rules and procedures of the MoH Ethics Committee were revised. Reportedly, most of the complaints addressed to the Ethics Committee are initially 13 Mongolia Project Assessment sent to the SSIA for confirmation that an issue relates to ethics only. However, the SSIA Health Inspectorate has criticized this procedure, citing an already heavy burden of unplanned investigations. The number of ethics\u2013related complaints sent directly to the SSIA has notably increased in recent years. However, the number of complaints sent to the MoH Ethics Committee has remained stable (13% of all complaints per year). A similar situation is observed for sub-committees working at health care organizations. This may indicate that the public is unaware of the MoH Ethics Committees and Sub-Committees in health care centres and hospitals, but well aware of the SSIA. Although the project helped establishing the MoH Ethics Committee website (http://www.MoH.mn/newethics/), there seems to have been little advocacy or outreach. Only a limited number of Mongolians use online information services, and as of this writing the website remains inactive. Small grants and ethics training Overall under this project, sector-wide dialogue on ethics was launched and a number of manuals, brochures and CDs were published. Best-practice sharing meetings were organized for the 24 small grant recipient organizations that included city and countryside hospitals, health department and NGOs. Two information kits on best practices of small grant recipients were developed and published. With the small grants, recipient organizations created more patient-friendly environments, for example by establishing reception desks (with smiling employees), hanging signposts on the walls of the hospital, setting up information boards for patients displaying the tariffs for medical services, arranging seating facilities and waiting rooms. Cabinets also posted condensed information on doctors\u2019 qualifications and working hours. Several hospitals also set up information boards displaying the order of patients waiting to be taken in. Aside from developing the Code of Ethics of Medical Professionals and an accompanying manual, the project produced training manuals on ethics for civil servants and managers. Ethics trainings were conducted in 21 provinces, and 56 people were trained as trainers in a workshop funded by ADB. The project also produced an information kit for the Ethics Committee of Medical Professionals and Subcommittee members, a patient kit, and \u2018Citizen and Health\u2019, a user-friendly", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "322e9b20-2b6a-4fad-99d9-c0140149dd75": {"__data__": {"id_": "322e9b20-2b6a-4fad-99d9-c0140149dd75", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrity-health-sector-mongolia-project-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integrity in the Health Sector: Mongolia Project Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrity-health-sector-mongolia-project-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d16d1bd4d017fca3c7c98947cf487010caefc99d0f8dbc3f2e0ba99714f81bfd"}}, "hash": "d16d1bd4d017fca3c7c98947cf487010caefc99d0f8dbc3f2e0ba99714f81bfd", "text": "compilation of relevant health sector laws and regulations. The manual on civil servants\u2019 ethics was requested by the Secretariat of the President of Mongolia for possible replication in that office. Additionally, inter-sectoral experience-sharing meetings were organized for representatives of the Civil Service Committee, HR and Public Administration Departments of different ministries. Despite project efforts to balance its focus, ethics of health care professionals seems to have been prioritized over civil servants\u2019 ethics. Medical ethics curriculum Medical ethics were introduced into the medical university curriculum, increasing the number of lecturing hours to 20, and included in the undergraduate curriculum of medical universities in three provinces. Some 120 professors were trained to teach classes on ethics and integrity to medical students. \u2018Ethics in Medicine\u2019, a workbook for medical students, was developed. Establishment of e-licensing centre The project established an e-licensing centre for medical professionals and medical organizations to register with the National Centre for Health Development, which recently received the status of an agency. Testing and licensing of medical professionals and organizations used to be done half by code-reader and half manually, raising questions as to accuracy. Centre employees had to make costly trips to test medical professionals working in the countryside. The e-licensing centre offers a cost-effective, accessible alternative. The centre was established in 2006 with the donation of 11 computers in a furnished office, and a commercial company was hired to develop software. Despite a high-profile launch and its designation as a major project achievement, this much-praised centre has never been functional. Software malfunctions have never been addressed, requiring staff to continue the old procedures. This year, the centre secured funds from the Ministerial budget to develop new software, to be launched this spring. As of this writing the website, remains inactive. 14 Integrity in the Health Sector Drugs and medications online database Another electronic innovation was an online database for registering and licensing imported drugs. The database was housed in the Pharmaceuticals Department of MoH, at an initial cost of USD 5,000. A year after its installation, WHO provided an additional grant of USD 4,000 to upgrade its performance and relevance. This software is still working well although the programme requires regular upgrades and improvements. The database has significantly reduced the number of unregistered drugs on the market. It has also accelerated the permissions and registration process. The Pharmaceuticals Department estimates that about 10% to 13% of drugs on the market are counterfeit. Posting pictures of medications on the online database would help the public and health professionals to easily recognize permitted and authentic drugs. The website (http://MoH.mn/MoH db/drug.nsf) needs to be better publicized; so far there has been no media outreach. Although the site does not contain a list of counterfeit drugs, a link to the Ministerial website contains a page on counterfeit drugs and information on what drugs have been removed from the market. MoH is planning to include usage instructions on each registered drug. 15 The project was implemented under a degree of organisational instability. It witnessed the change of four ministers and three vice-ministers, three heads of ethical committees, three project officers, and HR changes in virtually all but the Public Administration Department of MoH, which helmed the project and ensured its implementation despite unstable conditions. UNDP had initially placed the project with the National Centre for Health Development, but procedural changes and delays meant that actual implementation started only in September 2006. This means that a year-long project plan was largely completed in three months. During this time, the National Programme Officers (NPOs) assigned to the project kept changing, and the number of project employees (initially one NPO, two consultants and an assistant) shrank until only the assistant was left. As a result of these shifts in leadership some project documentation and products were not archived and stored at MoH (for example, MoH no longer has a copy of the Civil Servant\u2019s Ethics Code manual). Despite these circumstances the project managed to achieve success, largely thanks to dedicated leadership and the commitment of the project team and its partners within and outside MoH, particularly health care providers. Internal and external difficulties 16 The project has led to the adoption of accountability and transparency benchmarks and Codes of Ethics in health organizations, securing a solid foundation for enforcing accountability and ensuring integrity in health sector. The year 2009 was recently declared the Year of Ethics in the health sector. MoH commitment has been reflected in ministerial decrees on accountability benchmarks and Code of Ethics. The transparency and accountability benchmarks established for the health sector have resonated throughout the entire public sector.

The Code of Ethics of Medical Professionals was adopted by the Health Minister\u2019s Decree and is to be followed by every organization in the sector. Numerous manuals on ethics were produced and trainers trained. Ethics was introduced into the universities\u2019 curriculum as one of the main subjects. With the commitment of the National Centre for Health Development, funding has been secured to operationalize the e-licensing centre. MoH successes on the project also prompted the implementation of a similar project at the State Specialized Inspection Agency in 2008. MoH will be a recipient of partial UNDP funding channelled through the IAAC for replication of best practices accumulated by this project. This alliance will promote and sustain the good practices and procedures cultivated by the project. The project significantly enhanced democratic governance by prompting the adoption of accountability benchmarks and codes of ethics in the health sector. Organizational and individual capacities in project implementation have been strengthened. However greater capacity and public oversight is needed to build on these gains. Sustainability 17 The project responded to a ministerial need with clear objectives. MoH was the first governmental ministry in Mongolia to demonstrate commitment to strengthening integrity and ethics in the public sector, and requested support for its initiatives. DGTTF support has enabled the country office to position itself strategically in this democratic governance area. Along with MoH and the WHO, the project anchored successful synergies and partnerships developed with other UN agencies and ADB around democratic governance. One strong example is the establishment of the Inter-Sectoral Coordinating Committee on Health Sector Human Resources. Relevance and strategic positioning 18 Despite a delay of at least six months and several staffing setbacks, the project managed to implement all of its goals and objectives. The steady leadership of the Public Administration Department of MoH, together with regular UNDP monitoring, stabilized operations. In addition, a set of high-quality manuals have been developed on ethics among health professionals, the civil service and management. The popularity of ethics trainings suggests a strong need within the health sector. Moreover, the Secretariat of the President of Mongolia has expressed interest in the manual on civil service ethics. Although a multi-stakeholder Coordination Committee was established to oversee the project, it lacked an active Coordination Committee and was ineffective. Regular UNDP monitoring of project activities was therefore useful for measuring achievements, defining further improvements and taking actions when needed. Staff turnover remained high, and only the Project Assistant stayed through project closure. Efficiency 19 The project started with its own study on perception of corruption in the health sector, and then focused on the ethics of health professionals. The benchmarks on accountability and transparency at the sectoral, organizational and individual levels, in conjunction with the sector\u2013wide code of ethics, adopted by Ministerial decrees, have inspired possible replications for civil servants elsewhere in the public sector. Small grant recipient organizations used various creative methods to train health care professionals on ethics and the code of conduct. For example, in the central hospital of Uvurkhangai aimag, trainers used skits to demonstrate unethical behaviour, featuring rude attitudes, service delays, sparse public information and administrative inefficiency. The performances prompted the hospital to improve service and aspire to higher standards of service. One of the specific lessons learned was the advantage of conducting trainings at the local level. The training in Uvurkhangai aimag hospital involved medical personnel from the aimag hospital and its soums\u2019 (smaller territorial and administrative divisions) hospitals. Participants felt comfortable among colleagues who work in similar conditions and face similar problems. This allowed them to be open and encouraged their active participation. Conducting trainings at the local level also reduces costs and enables broader local participation. Despite high staff turnover the project managed to produce good quality outcomes due to its innovative and catalytic nature, relevance and timeliness as well as the commitment of MoH and the project team. The public service reform of 2008 that prohibits civil servants from being political party members is hoped to bring long-lasting change and help develop a more stable civil service independent of political party appointments, avoiding volatility and frequent staff rotations in government ministries and agencies. Public participation and awareness-raising were a weak point of the project, despite the breadth of project ambitions in reaching health professionals and creating sector-wide discussions on ethics and implementation of transparency and accountability initiatives. Media outreach efforts were not strategic.

The ultimate objectives of leadership development include more inclusive participatory governance, improved aid effectiveness, and increased efficiency and value-added for organizations, programmes and projects at all levels. This vision of leadership focuses attention on the relationship of individuals to the group, emphasizing the development of the collectivity. In this context, leadership\u2019s relationship to capacity development is examined on three different levels: individual, organizational and societal. Of these, the societal level offers the most potential for widespread sustainable change, but it is the most difficult to reach, monitor and evaluate. Most of the initiatives analyzed in this document are tied more closely to the individual and organizational levels and results achieved within the local context. This document provides specific evidence of existing leadership programmes, primarily within international multilateral, bilateral and non-governmental, and examines the array of methodologies and materials currently in use. It also focuses predominately on local leadership development since this is the level for which more evidence exists and which coincides best with UNDP strategic opportunity. General lessons learned from programming experience include the importance of defining clear target populations, the inclusion of appropriate educational designs and pedagogical methods, the extension of training and instruction beyond a single event, and the necessity for working within the context and culture of the target population for achieving sustainable results.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e980a68-b75d-4b25-bfca-31d9115739b1": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e980a68-b75d-4b25-bfca-31d9115739b1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/leadership-development-leading-transformation-local-level", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Leadership development - Leading transformation at the Local Level", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/leadership-development-leading-transformation-local-level", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a6069d6108e87613921afdf0ecc625b490c94ecaeb7c99ceda89e8d2665b77e7"}, "2": {"node_id": "4f4a642f-55b4-4764-b6dd-2a010816fa85", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/leadership-development-leading-transformation-local-level", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bab21b25adbaa9e37aba394edd192efeadd4e192b4553bf542908ba0b6b8fda9"}}, "hash": "d241f7192c38946cbbec5f98332a7352a5b47b148abbbaead9a3fef60bc952b1", "text": "Additionally, the inclusion of a knowledge management platform insures the creation of a database system that facilitates the warehousing, replicability, and dissemination of good practice.

Specifically, the following areas offer most immediate potential: \u2022 A focus on local elected officials capabilities in the areas of enforcing transparency, managing institutional reform and facilitating a more inclusive decision making process in local governance (through local councils and local government). \u2022 A focus on civil society organizations leaders\u2019 ability to manage development projects and administration, to expand and diversify networks, to guide and effect change both within organisations and in their environments. \u2022 A focus on emerging groups with a view to strengthening community leaders\u2019 capacity for representing their particular groups\u2019 interests in the local and national development dialogue and resource allocation agenda (this is particularly true for indigenous, rural and HIV-affected populations), with particular emphasis on gender equality and non discrimination. Within these areas of focus, some of the key lessons learnt from a capacity development perspective in this field are clear, and need to influence programming development and 5 implementation to better ensure success over the longer term: a) interventions and support must be designed within a 10-15 year long term vision; b) programming design needs to link to the greater societal sphere, which defines the political economy context and space for local leaders; c) regional and sub-regional Trainer to Trainer (TtT) strategies must be implemented as a means to driving and sustaining the overall process of enhancing specific skills, knowledge and overall leadership capabilities; d) monitoring and evaluation tools, that are independent and validated by stakeholders is key, to keep leadership work in objective perspective and validated. I. A Conceptual Framework Why leadership? The current interest in leadership as a capacity development strategy is intrinsically linked to the desire to promote the capacity of a human collectivity, not simply that of isolated individuals, to bring about the necessary decisions, actions and changes that further the pursuit of common human development goals. It seeks to strengthen group capacity to stimulate initiatives and effect influence over leaders at all levels of society. Leadership capacity strives to achieve better and more inclusive participatory governance, improved aid effectiveness, and increased efficiency and value-added for organizations, programmes and projects. This expanded concept attempts to bring more of the \u201cwisdom of the whole\u201d1 to the process of sustainable human development. The leadership concept This vision focuses attention on the relationship of individuals to the group, concentrating on the development of the collective rather than on a single individual\u2019s role within the whole. Its participatory emphasis is critical for promoting participatory democracy and more inclusive processes for decision-making and implementation. It calls for a \u201cparticipatory\u201d leadership to reorient current systems, methods and actors\u2014both authorities and followers\u2014in the processes of planning, budgeting and resource distribution. This concept of leadership development confronts a variety of challenges depending upon the local environment, the culture and the stage of development found within the group and the society. Consequently, leadership programmes must be customized in accordance with histories, cultures and levels of organizational development to meet the particular capacity development requirements of a given situation since different leadership qualities will be necessary for different circumstances. Power vs. Authority Leadership depends on both power--the ability to influence people--and authority--the ability to influence decision-making and resource allocation.2 Ideally, leadership programmes encompass both, and they build on an individual leader\u2019s innate power as well as the leader\u2019s capacity to properly serve his or her constituency\u2014a process that should ultimately serve to further legitimate both the leader\u2019s authority and the influence of the collectivity as a whole. Leadership initiatives must be owned by the group. Creative, participative planning initiatives must also be linked to budgetary authority to be functional\u2014or else not depend upon it for financing. To be effective, leadership development should be set within and effect influence over the decision-making context. 1 Surowiecki, James. (2005). The Wisdom of the Crowds. New York: Anchor. 2 UNDP, BDP-CDG. 2005. Leadership for Human Development: A UNDP capacity development resource. New York: UNDP. 6 Leadership and Capacity Development Leadership\u2019s relationship to capacity development can be examined on three different levels: individual, organizational and societal. At the individual level, initiatives usually focus on developing a range of abilities (interpersonal, communication, negotiation and analytical skills, for example) and core values. At the organizational level, the focus is on coaching for institutional reform and change through improved approaches to doing business. At the societal level, the emphasis is on bringing together the governing body and the community in an effort to change norms", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6921688e-0e69-4630-86ef-a8a923dc2a54": {"__data__": {"id_": "6921688e-0e69-4630-86ef-a8a923dc2a54", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/leadership-development-leading-transformation-local-level", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Leadership development - Leading transformation at the Local Level", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/leadership-development-leading-transformation-local-level", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5dc09aefb47150528611c9ca74f974a2746ae874dfea7935a0e98a78e85df109"}}, "hash": "5dc09aefb47150528611c9ca74f974a2746ae874dfea7935a0e98a78e85df109", "text": "and processes in a way that furthers the common good. While this last level offers perhaps the most potential for sustainable, broad-based change, it is often the most difficult to reach and measure. It is also important to mention that while this concept of leadership development stresses the importance of the collectivity as a whole, individuals in certain circumstances can act in ways that strongly influence others to follow suit and in ways that actually alter official or organizational norms. These individuals can be powerful agents of change, serving as catalysts for organizational and societal change as well. The reverse is also true: organizational and societal change can bring about transformations toward more participatory individual leadership styles and decision-making. Thus, it is important to note the fluid, dynamic and often synergistic relationship between these three levels of leadership development. Leadership Typology The Netherlands Development Organization (SNV) presents a useful typology for visualizing the different types of leaders that emerge from different circumstantial contexts. Isolating two issues crucial for distinguishing between target groups for leadership development, the typology presents 1) the dimension of having an established status (or not) for the body to be led, and 2) the dimension of specificity of responsibility within the leadership post. Combining the two dimensions, four types of leaders emerge as indicated in the diagram below: SNV Contextual Leadership Typology Established General influence Specific responsibility Emerging Source: Eggnik, Jan Willem. Some Notions on Leadership Development and Capacity Development. SNV: 2005. Public figures and advisors Leaders of organizations Students Entrepreneurs and young executives 7 These different types of leaders require distinct types of support. Younger, emerging leaders tend to require more training, mentoring and information, while established and experienced leaders require more peer-related feedback, coaching and consulting. Leaders with more specific responsibilities require assistance that addresses the specific problems they encounter within their organizations, while more generally influential people with less specific responsibilities tend to benefit more from coaching for personal growth. These trends are reflected in the range of concentrations and methods offered by leadership development programmes worldwide at varying levels. Local leadership While all leadership development initiatives aim to develop leaders worldwide in different areas at different levels--and equip them with the necessary skills to explore their own potential and transform their organizations, institutions and societies--more work is done and more impact achieved at the local level. The local level of society is where most of the world\u2019s people live and die. It is the \u201cpolitical sphere\u201d where many of the maladies of development (poverty, malnutrition, environmental degradation, inequality, gender discrimination, etc) manifest most severely. Thus, the local level warrants concentrated attention and the same level of programming commitment as the national and meso levels. In most developing countries, there is a disconnect between the national and the local levels. For this reason, micro/macro links connecting the upstream with the downstream deserve special attention for development initiatives. When this is not achieved, the local level is often left forgotten and unattended, fostering less effective overall development progress. Within this scenario, a more mature type of development tends to be promoted at the national levels, while a weaker type of development is evident at the local levels. In spite of this, the local level may actually experience a deeper, more focused and impacting development evolution, but due to limitations in the micro/macro national/local links, this development will not be coordinated with, or be able to influence, national development initiatives. For more effective, complete and synchronized development at every level--given that attention is already focused on the national\u2014more systematic consideration needs to be directed at the local level. Aid effectiveness needs to be increased, development investments need to be augmented; and existing projects need to be interlinked, and innovative strategies need to be conceived and implemented. Local leadership for human development is a catalyst for good governance and human development. It is a driver that has the potential to directly advance on-going processes; create links between existing levels; negotiate on behalf of local interests and connect them with the national; advocate for increased investments; and plan constructively for the medium and long term. Effective local leadership is a key strategic component for democratic governance, inclusion and human development. Given this conceptual framework with its emphasis on local governance, the rest of this document provides specific evidence of existing leadership programmes that operate primarily at the local level and utilize a wide array of methodologies and materials.

While measurement of the longer-term impact of these programmes and the indicators affecting impact are just beginning to be developed, there are nevertheless strong signals that leadership development is a powerful vehicle for developing capacities at all levels and stages of the developmental process, particularly when applied at the local level. 8 II. Local Leadership Development Strategy in Application 2.1. Capacity context Leadership development as a capacity development strategy strives to achieve better and more inclusive participatory governance, better utilization of resources, more effective management, and increased efficiency and value-added for programmes and projects at all levels of society: individual, organizational and societal. Evidence of leadership development exists in various forms and generally comes from programmes aimed at training individuals or groups of individuals to generate change at the individual and organizational levels, most often within the local context. While the final objective of leadership development is often one of effecting societal change, it is much more difficult to secure concrete evidence for this type of transformation. This does not mean, however, that change is not occurring at the societal level. The most tangible evidence of local leadership development comes from non-governmental, multilateral and bilateral organizations that have developed specific methodologies, materials, services and programmes for training leaders and organizations. While the target groups of these initiatives vary, many of the methods and materials are similar, as are the lessons learned in the capacity development process. Though some private sector examples of leadership development have been incorporated into this analysis, the bulk of the input for the conclusions reached in this document comes from the experience of a collection of development organizations\u2019 application of leadership development as a capacity development tool. The initiatives reviewed include 1) UN programmes, such as UN Habitat\u2019s local governance capacity development, UNDP\u2019s HIV/AIDS leadership programme, and Capacity 2015\u2019s LEAD-UPEACE local indigenous programmes; 2) NGO leadership/organizational development programmes such as those established by AVINA, Ashoka and Synergos; and 3) bilateral agency interventions, such as those of the Netherlands Cooperation Organization (SNV). Even at the local level, leadership development is such a broad category of capacity development that it is difficult to think of a context in which it is not applicable. Better questions to formulate for considering--and then tailoring--the application of a leadership development strategy are the following: o For what type of sector are we developing leaders? (business, civil society, government) o For what level of interaction are we developing leaders? (community, municipal, sub-regional, meso) o What are the key capacities that need to be developed in local leaders(resoource mobilization, financial management, communication, negotiation, strategic planning, education, empowerment, etc.) The extent to which the various groups working with local leadership development as a capacity development strategy have answered the questions presented above is reflected in the specificity of the group\u2019s vision on leadership development, the methodologies it employs, and the materials it uses in its programming. A range of alternatives is available in each of these areas. The following sections provide summaries of leadership development application in the areas of local government, civil society and excluded groups. Leadership development is currently applied in many more areas; however, these three embody the applications for which most evidence is currently available and which appear to offer the greatest potential for future UNDP involvement. 2.2 Leadership and Local government Relevance of local governments Local governments are strategic actors in the development process for a number of reasons. First, the process of decentralization is a global phenomenon and regardless of whatever initial 9 resistance to change they may have experienced, central governments are now immersed in the distribution of power, responsibilities, decision-making and budgets that must accompany such a process. Secondly, moving away from the hegemony of central economies, local economies have come to be recognized as fully legitimate nodes of production that function as the core providers of wealth development. Thirdly, local governance is where citizenship expresses itself. Recently promoted concepts of increasing \u201cinclusion\u201d, \u201cparticipation\u201d and \u201cgrowing citizenship\u201d will be tested first and most importantly at the local level. And finally, local governments are the closest \u201cstate agency\u201d to the people. Given their responsibility to provide basic public health and education services, they are under increasing pressure to deliver these necessities effectively and efficiently. Although the pace of decentralization is accelerating and increasing responsibility is accruing to local governments, these governments tend to be historically weak. Capacity development, therefore, becomes a key strategy for local governments--one that can be approached in many different ways. Most approaches, however, include a major component of leadership development.

UNDP Regional Project for Local Governance in Latin America promotes five key capacities: strategic long term vision; transformational leadership; harmonious inter-sectoral relationships; development of institutional capacities; and increased citizen participation.3 UNDP-CDG also claims five functional capacities from the project management perspective: long term strategic vision; capacity for policy formulation; inter-sectoral relationships; capacity for programme or project implementation; and effective monitoring and evaluation.4 UN Habitat works directly with skills development of publicly elected officials, concentrating heavily on the official\u2019s role as power broker and negotiator for institutional reform. And UNDP Costa Rica has been more involved with leadership development for institutional reform, procurement and transparency5 and has designed and validated a holistic approach to municipal capacity development. It has also developed a manual for transparent procurement and anti-corruption, validated it in four municipalities in Huetar Norte, and is currently in the process of generalizing the experience in an effort to facilitate achievement of the MDGs at the local level. Accumulated assets, lessons learned and experiences of the examples detailed above coincide in three key capacities that need to be furthered and developed: \u2022 Long term vision and participatory planning \u2022 Institutional change and reform \u2022 Procurement and transparency Leadership development for local governance focuses on advancing both the leadership training of individuals and the institutional reform of organizations. It is the synergy between these two parallel actions that most contributes to successful outcomes. As an approach, working exclusively on individual training can breed highly dynamic, effective individuals; however, if these individuals are constrained by the environment of their organizations, they will likely accomplish relatively little. Working on the organizations as well helps to create a more fertile environment for both individual and collective action. Consequently, leadership development directed at both individual leaders and organizations creates a combination of capacity that is more likely to be productive over the medium and long term. 3 PNUD-RBLAC, Agenda para el Fortalecimiento de la Gobernabilidad Local en Am\u00e9rica Latina. Diciembre 2004 4 UNDP-CDG, Capacity Assessment Practice Note, July 2006. 5 UNDP CO Costa Rica, Capacity 2015 Preparatory As\u00edstanse in Huetar Norte, 2004-2006 10 2.3 Leadership and Civil society Relevance of civil society There are certain elements that contribute to civil society\u2019s increasing relevance in the development scheme. In terms of moral and ethical status, civil society is anchored in the paradigm in favor of justice and equality, proclaiming inclusion and denouncing poverty and inequality, particularly for excluded populations (women, rural peasants, indigenous and HIV- affected populations, among others). It focuses on the lacks and needs of emerging and marginal populations, making it the ideal development actor for promoting capacity development. Civil society is also characterized as the \u201ccivil organization\u201d closest to the people, able to concentrate on implementation and balancing the \u201cwhat\u201d and the \u201chow\u201d of development. And civil society has benefited greatly from technology, which has facilitated the establishment of local, regional and national networks and platforms for political action and advocacy. Despite these strengths, however, civil society continues to face a number of serious capacity development challenges, among them those of a) going beyond the isolated local arena; b) solving the micro/macro riddles of development; c) developing strong organizations; d) achieving economic sustainability; and e) going beyond the private/public debate. Civil society is known for its effectiveness at the local level; the challenge now is to convert effective local solutions into more generalized, less isolated answers. Similarly with the micro/macro issue, while solutions are frequently achieved at the micro level there is limited know-how for connecting the micro to macro, the downstream to the upstream. A good example of this is found in the multiple dilemmas of connecting ongoing decentralization processes that attempt to link the national, regional and local arenas. From the standpoint of organizational strength, solid long term planning, human resource development, robust accounting systems, and securing sufficient funding all remain demanding priorities. Most civil society organizations are plagued by financial constraints and depend on 3-5 year project cycles. Finally, in reference to the private/public debate, civil society is an expression of private citizenship whose voice is beginning to be heard, yet it has not acquired the necessary tools and instruments for entering the public debate and converting its knowledge into public policy. This is perhaps the most significant of the capacity development challenges facing civil society and among the many reasons that leadership development is so critical.

Initiatives are generally conducted at the local level with the aim of strengthening civil society leaders\u2019 ability to manage administratively, network, effect change and promote institutional reform. The major promoters of local civil society leadership development tend to be global or regional NGOs that effect training, either directly or through other local NGOs, that is directed at developing 1) specific organizational and individual skills, and 2) collective dialogue and bargaining power. Development of skills Civil society initiatives that revolve around the development of specific organizational and individual skills generally seek to develop capacities in one or more of the following categories: Administrative \u2013 these focus on strengthening leaders\u2019 capacities in areas such as accounting, organizational strategy, fund raising, human resource development and knowledge management; Networking \u2013 these focus on strengthening leaders\u2019 abilities to tap into other CSO leaders\u2019 experience, funding sources and informational references; 11 Advocacy \u2013 these focus on strengthening leaders\u2019 abilities to negotiate, advocate and influence policy-making. Specific examples of these initiatives are found in the activities of international NGOs such as Synergos, INTRAC and Ashoka. Syergos\u2019 Strengthening Bridging Organizations Program provides leadership capacity building services to local organizations through a combination of peer-learning and technical support in the areas of program development, fundraising and asset building, communications, administration and advocacy. Many of the resources associated with these services are available online through Synergos\u2019 Foundation Building Library.6 INTRAC offers something similar through its series of Open Training Courses, Customized Consultancies and research publications. Much of this information is also available online.7 Ashoka initiatives are more targeted toward youth and social entrepreneur leadership development, but many offer the same mix of administrative, networking and advocacy oriented skill development. Ashoka programmes such as the Citizen Base Initiative, Social Financial Services and Changemakers serve, respectively, to educate leaders in ways to broaden a civil society organization\u2019s citizen base, diversify the financial structure to promote sustainability, and advocate for collective social gain. Development of collective dialogue/bargaining power Initiatives that strive to develop local leaders' capacity for collective dialogue, negotiation and policy influence have typically worked through scenarios that involve the coordination of multi- stakeholder discussions and problem solving around a specific issue. These exercises are usually lead by experienced professionals who bring together key local leaders and direct step- by-step problem solving exercises geared toward the particular issue in question with the goal of formulating policy recommendations and collective action plans. These dialogue initiatives serve to facilitate local leader networking and capacity building for collective bargaining and policy recommendation. Synergos has been successful with the application of this leadership development strategy through its Multistakeholder Partnerships programme, which aims to catalyze partnerships between government, business and civil society to solve more complex development challenges. This programme has been utilized for various community related initiatives in conflict situations in both South Africa and Colombia, and has also been applied to local child nutrition and sustainable food supply problems in India and elsewhere. In Latin America, Avina has also used a variation of this approach with its Interregional Dialogue programme, through which it has been effective mobilizing local leaders in Brazil to promote new coastal legislation and regulatory action. Avina has also utilized this programme to bring together leaders in the Amazon and Patogonia to advance measures for sustainable development related to water and forest resource management. Ashoka, too, has undertaken several initiatives of this nature, particularly through its Youth Venture programme. This programme educates, networks and invests in young leaders to enable them to start and lead their own social ventures and lobby for social change. Youth Venture is currently operating in Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, India, South Africa and Thailand. 2.4 Leadership and Emerging groups Relevance of emerging groups Dealing with the development issues of emerging groups and excluded populations is relevant to development in the modern world for many reasons. With regard to the indigenous, it is estimated that there are over 350 million worldwide, representing some 4,000 languages in more than 70 countries. In Latin America alone are an estimated 50 million indigenous people who 6 See the Synergos Global Philanthropy and Foundation Building website: http://www.synergos.org/globalphilanthropy/. 7 See the INTRAC Training website: http://www.intrac.org/training. 12 make up 11% of the region\u2019s population. In Guatemala and in Bolivia--where the indigenous movement just won the presidency of the republic with Evo Morales--indigenous people make up more than half the population.

Gender is widely acknowledged as a critical issue in international development and has begun to focus attention on the issue of gender-equality with a view to increasing both participation and economic security for women. Numerous studies and measures indicate that poverty and gender are closely correlated; in fact, UNDP has reported that a full 70 percent of those living in poverty are women.8 In recent years, more development programming has begun to recognize the need for mainstreaming a gender perspective, though far more remains to be done. HIV-affected populations are another emerging group deserving of attention with over 40 million people worldwide estimated to be living with the disease.9 Though significant strides have been made with research and treatment, considerably less has been accomplished with regard to the stigma and discrimination people living with HIV AIDS continue to struggle against. Technology has worked in favor of many emerging group movements that have been systemic in their integration of well-coordinated national and international networks and it promises to be a tool that will continue to enable and empower these populations. Women\u2019s groups, indigenous and rural populations, and those living with HIV/AIDS have begun to network extensively and connect nationally, regionally and globally. In Latin America, for example, even many indigenous groups are organized by political networks and supported by electronic platforms such as the Confederaci\u00f3n de los pueblos ind\u00edgenas de Bolivia (CIDOB); Movimiento ind\u00edgena de Nicaragua (MIN); and the Asociaci\u00f3n de Mujeres Ind\u00edgenas de la Costa Atl\u00e1ntica (AMICA). Capacity development is a key component toward furthering the autonomy and well being of emerging groups. Those perceived as \u201cemergingl\u201d social groups for whatever reason are often offered humanitarian assistance, but are less often offered an opportunity to further their own capacities. Integral individual, organizational and societal capacities need to be constructed with these populations for them to be in a position to increase their participation and advocacy. Evidence of emerging groups\u2019 leadership development With all emerging groups, from an individual perspective, skills need to be built in the areas of systemic long term planning; negotiation with governments; ethics and decision making; deeper understanding of sustainable development; and gender issues. The relationship between vision, objectives, organization and resources needs to be made clear. From a societal perspective, political skills need to be reinforced in the development of leadership for emerging groups, as do the capacities for building local/national links, negotiating with national and international institutions, and defining relevant policy. As part of the evidence for leadership development with emerging groups, UNDP-Capacity 2015, LEAD international (Leaders for Environment and Development) and UPeace have joined forces in a regional programme for local indigenous and peasant leadership in Latin America. The training programmes have started in Central America with the training of leaders from Guatemala, El Salvador and Costa Rica. The main thrust of the programme is the development of skills in long-term vision, negotiation, culture, and systems thinking; the establishment of sub-regional networks; and concentration on the individual/organizational change management scheme. UNDP has been progressive in its development of local leadership within the HIV/AIDS programme and has produced significant instructional material and programming documentation. 8 UNDP. 1999. Meeting on Women and Political Participation: 21st Century Challenges UNDP, 24-26 March 1999. New Delhi, India. 9 UNAIDS. 2006. Uniting the World Against AIDS. http://www.unaids.org. 13 The programme has also chosen to operate through various different publics (arts and media, local leaders, women, etc.), which has broadened both the range of activities involved and the kinds of results achieved. With gender, local leadership initiatives have at times been directly targeted, as with some of the UNDP/UNIFEM programmes to increase women\u2019s participation, though often they have been more indirect, targeting instead women\u2019s ability to become more economically secure. This has been the case with certain community NGO interventions, such as some of Ashoka\u2019s and AVINA\u2019s micro-business oriented programming. III. Operational Implications As with the strategies in application, for the operational aspects of programming, a number of generalizations can be made across programmes and organizations about general lessons learned, knowledge management, and the major challenges and opportunities now facing those involved in the utilization of leadership development as a capacity development strategy.

This does not mean, however, that they are necessarily less effective leadership developers. The NGO Synergos, for instance, has a clear vision of aiming to bridge divides that emerge from separated sectors, levels of society and cultures by bringing the various actors together to build common ground and joint action to reduce poverty and inequity.14 The vision is less specific about local leadership development, yet various Synergos\u2019 initiatives\u2014the Strengthening Bridging Organizations Program, for one, which provides for the continuous development of community civil society organizations\u2014are oriented directly toward local leadership development. 10 Eggnik, Jan Willem.

By encouraging young people to take active roles in addressing local social problems, learning and leadership skills are significantly fostered and developed. 3.2 Methods and materials If the vision statement sets the stage for the direction of an organization\u2019s activities, then the methods and materials it utilizes to further its objectives are what define its role as a development player. And generally, the degree of specificity of the vision will determine the degree of specificity of the particular methods, materials, tools and even partners the organization employs in pursuit of its goals. Those with clearly defined leadership visions have developed similarly precise materials and ways of working. The UNDP HIV/AIDS programme stands out noticeably in this regard. Along with its clearly defined vision, it has produced a well-defined set of tools for the implementation of the vision.

These LEAD-UPEACE manuals on leadership for local sustainable development currently exist in Spanish.21 Synergos, too, has developed a number of in-house training and knowledge management materials directed at NGOs operating at the local level, most of which it makes accessible through its website. In contrast to the UNDP HIV/AIDS group, however, none of these other programmes have incorporated the same degree of measurement and/or documentation/dissemination of best practice along with their implementation materials, and therefore do not offer quite as complete a spectrum of tools. At the opposite end of the spectrum are the organizations that are actively involved in local leadership development initiatives but that operate primarily through partner organizations and, therefore, do not have proprietary leadership development material production as one of their priorities. AVINA and SNV fall into this category. 3.3 Programming and lessons learned Definition of clear target-populations The definition of clear target populations makes for much more focused projects and programmes and generally makes it easier to judge results. LEAD-C2015-UPEACE works with local leaders, specifically peasant and indigenous leaders in Latin America. The programme has precise criteria for participation candidates, which must be 1) of rural peasant or indigenous origin; 2) aged 18- 30; 3) primary school education certified; and 4) involved in local political movements and active in an ongoing productive project for sustainable development. This clear definition of participants allows for focused and effective training in terms of language, politically and culturally relevant examples, and thus more communicative and effective training. The SNV typology referred to earlier also emphasizes the necessity of defining target populations\u2014in this case, students, public figures, leaders of organizations, and young entrepreneurs involved in business\u2014and tailoring the type of support to correspond with the type of leader targeted.22 UN-Habitat, to give another example, works with elected local public officials.

This, in turn, facilitates and nurtures learning. Pedagogical considerations for programming A number of pedagogical considerations also apply to successful programming: \u2022 The right educational design - This refers to understanding how central the scope of the leadership training programme is in terms of individual, organizational or societal breadth. It implies defining whether the programme will focus on developing individual skills, training the leader for organizational change, or procuring ample influence of societal trends. A clear scope defines clear educational objectives. \u2022 Pedagogical method - In an evolutionary continuum, there is evidence that stand-alone training does not have as much impact as integrated processes. This mix of training, coaching and networking seems to be an effective combination for more effective production of leadership schemes. \u2022 Inclusion of more than a single event - For learning purposes, time for application of new knowledge and time for assimilation appears as a critical element in most existing programmes. To give some examples of these considerations in application, SNV in Niger proposes a 9-month period with three four-day sessions of face-to-face trainings. SNV in Albania proposes five master sessions of two days each on the following topics: Lead yourself, lead others, lead society and stay in the lead. LEAD-C2015-LA-UPEACE proposes a 3-month period with two five-day face-to- face trainings and a strong, well planned inter-sessional period where knowledge is tested. The UNDP HIV-AIDS programme has designed and validated a six-to-nine month programme, with three sessions of three days each. Working within the context and culture of the target population Understanding the particular context and culture of a programme\u2019s chosen target population and working within it to create a realistic operating scenario seems to be another important lesson learned for leadership development programming, particularly at the local level. Different initiatives manifest this lesson in their respective programmes indifferent ways: The UNDP HIV/AIDS leadership programme appreciates culture as an inherent part of all its trainings. The HIV/AIDS pandemic, in its societal expression, is a cultural phenomenon. HIV/AIDS educational interventions work directly with behavioral change that focuses on death, sexuality, and gender issues, the most intimate elements of human nature. It is not possible to practice prevention, attention or leadership programming without considering the most intimate cultural aspects of people\u2019s beliefs. 17 The LEAD-C2015-UPEACE leadership programme specializes in local rural peasant and indigenous populations in Latin America. The local level has its own culture, just as the peasant and indigenous people each have their own diverse and rich cultures. These elements demand that cultural aspects be taken into account when working with leadership. As an inherent part of the method, LEAD-C2015-UPEACE proposes a \u201ccultural mediation and adaptation workshop\u201d as a required step. During this workshop, three fundamental issues--simplicity of concepts, language, and relevant best-case practices\u2014are defined and channeled into the training process. UN-Habitat is committed to the development of capacities of the local governments. As the \u201cexcluded\u201d actor of public development, this marginality generates cultural and political demands in terms of \u201cinclusion, participation, bottom-up approaches, and negotiation\u201d with the national level. The 11 manuals for local elected leaders deal with specific topics that build empowered action. The leader\u2019s environment and the environment/leader virtuous cycle Given the natural relationship between the leader, his group and the environment, it becomes imperative to work with the leader\u2019s environment in a way that augments his influence. Ashoka, for example, identifies innovative leaders within NGOs performing groundbreaking work. It supports leaders in the implementation of their dreams, thus developing their capacities to further influence their natural environment. UN-Habitat extracts local authorities from their local government environments, trains them, increases their skills, professionalizes them, and returns them to their natural local government environments. LEAD-C2015-LA-UPEACE, sets as a prerequisite for enrollment of local leaders direct involvement in local sustainable projects. During the inter-session periods they apply new knowledge and skills to their sustainable projects; during the second round of training, they consolidate their new skills through an action plan.

It is a global network of government agencies, local authorities and their associations, professional and academic institutions and grassroots organizations dedicated to the identification and exchange of successful solutions for sustainable development. The objective of the BLP is to raise awareness of decision-makers on critical social, economic and environmental issues and to better inform them of the practical means and policy options for improving the living environment. It does so by identifying, disseminating and applying lessons learned from Best Practices to ongoing training, leadership and policy development activities. Best Practices are actions that have made a lasting contribution to improving the quality of life and the sustainability of our cities and communities. BLP partners are specialized in such areas as housing and urban development, urban governance, environmental planning and management, architecture and urban design, economic development, social inclusion, crime prevention, poverty reduction, women, youth, cultural heritage, municipal finance and management, infrastructure and social services. Synergos has also dedicated a fair amount of resources to knowledge management. One example of this is the organization\u2019s Foundation Development Library, an online database for disseminating a variety of organizational capacity development tools and references. AVINA, too, 18 has recently moved in the direction of knowledge management with its Let\u2019s Share database and forum for exchange of information and experience among practitioners. With 500 registered users, AVINA reports over 7,000 exchanges during the past year. C2015-LA has developed the Information Learning Network for Latin America (ILN-LA).23 It maps regional capacities in strategic topics for local sustainable development in the fields of local governance, local leaderships, environment-poverty links, and indigenous capacities. It focuses on capturing existing formal courses, in all its formats, face-to-face, on-line, etc. making relevant information available, and thus increases the supply of available courses in the region. As an example for formal university courses on indigenous affairs, the ILN has identified 17 universities in the region that offer formal courses on law and human rights, culture and language issues, autonomous development. 3.5 Challenges and opportunities The time element As we have evidenced most of the local leadership programmes run for a 3-5 year period; their existence is determined by the duration of available financing; during this time line programmes can consolidate and measure behavioral changes at the individual level, but is it too soon to adequately measure sustainable results in organizations and societies. In this regard, the design and implementation of leadership programmes need to be conceived, planned and projected in a 10- to 15-year timeframe. This is the time period necessary for observing how individual behavioral change affects organizational reform, and how this in turn affects societal change. Behavioral change, institutional reform, and societal transformation taken together as a whole can take years to effect. The longer-term time element is necessary to monitor change in a reliable manner. It is unfair to monitor behavioral change without allowing enough time to witness the potential outcome or impact this has had at the societal level. Forging local leaders for management, institutional reform and transparent procurement practices Management, institutional reform and transparent procurement practices have been identified as three core areas requiring leadership development. Good training and coaching programmes that focus on developing the theory and practice of these key areas are a challenge that still needs to be addressed in terms of leadership development for both government officials and civil society leaders. Relevant, replicable programmes still need to be designed, validated and scaled up. Forging the capacities of local leaders\u2019 constituencies Most of the programmes that were reviewed for the preparation of this document focus on individual leadership skills and the increased influence they can exercise in a group, but they do not seek to develop the capacities of the group/constituency. Developing the capacities of the group/constituency implies a capacity development assessment/strategy exercise that will allow the leader to discover capacity assets, needs and gaps so that he and the group may develop individual, institutional and societal capacities. The development of a leadership training programme to achieve this and put it into practice has yet to be constructed. UN-Habitat has begun to move in this direction with some of its achievements. One of their local government training manuals focuses on the relationship between the leader and institutional development, though much remains to be developed and validated. 23 For additional information, please refer to the ILN-LA website: http://iln-la.nivel7.net/. 19 Instructional design During this review, we have seen that most leadership training programmes have strong components in individual training and its influence in their organizations, yet they are", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "22b6b1a1-a5dd-403d-8bd1-faad99adc1c1": {"__data__": {"id_": "22b6b1a1-a5dd-403d-8bd1-faad99adc1c1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/leadership-development-leading-transformation-local-level", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Leadership development - Leading transformation at the Local Level", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/leadership-development-leading-transformation-local-level", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "60137a2b6e03337e129e1cebbcbc8043576661b47d6f5c685ed1e56eff9257c1"}}, "hash": "60137a2b6e03337e129e1cebbcbc8043576661b47d6f5c685ed1e56eff9257c1", "text": "fragile when confronted with their design and practice towards influencing societal enabling environments. Nurturing the virtuous link between the leader and his environment is certainly a step forward; training leaders for societal capacity development represents another important step. Now, these elements need to be incorporated into a curricular design structure, systematized, and validated in diverse contexts. Monitoring and evaluation tools Capacity development has done limited rigorous work in the field of evaluation of capacities and leadership. From a methodological standpoint, Results Based Management contributes with setting the capacity development context and then defining the capacity development output and outcome indicators, but not much experience has been accumulated. Proposed general indicators for measuring behavioral and organizational changes in leadership programmes are yet to be designed and validated. From a local participatory perspective, IDRC has developed the Outcome Mapping methodology, which systematizes bottom-up, participatory approaches with the rigor of ad hoc progress indicators. Unfortunately, Outcome Mapping has not yet been linked to RBM and applied to leadership training programmes. Overall, few institutions set aside the necessary funds for monitoring and evaluation purposes. As a result, few formal evaluations are available for existing leadership programmes with which to derive lessons learned. IV. Final Comments From a development perspective, the ultimate objectives of leadership development include more inclusive participatory governance, improved aid effectiveness, and increased efficiency and value-added for organizations, programmes and projects at the individual, institutional and societal levels. The initiatives analyzed in this document have been associated more with development at the individual and organizational levels and results achieved within the local context, since this is the level for which more evidence exists and which coincides best with UNDP strategic opportunity. In terms of lessons learned for programming, the following stand out as indispensable: definition of a clear target population; utilization of a method that includes a good mix of training, coaching and networking; inclusion of more than one single training event; the appreciation of context and culture as crucial elements in the training programme; and the nurturing of the virtuous cycle between the leader and his environment. Institutional profiles highlight the existence of strong, clear visions; a wide array of methodological alternatives and materials; a strong focus on individual development of traits and skills, with relevant connections to organizational reform; and a strong need to overcome the rather weak evidence for societal influence. Given the abovementioned programming evidence and the importance of UNDP\u2019s mandate for fostering democratic governance, UNDP is strategically positioned to further local governance- directed leadership training. \u201cGovernance\u201d here is understood in the broader sense of the word and incorporates all development actors including government, civil society and excluded social groups. Much can be accomplished utilizing existing programming knowledge (such as that developed internally with the HIV/AIDS programme, as well as that developed in conjunction with partners--such as with the C2015-LEAD programme\u2014or in other UN agencies, such as with UN Habitat) and adapting it to new contexts. Based on the evidence examined, specific areas of 20 focus within the governance spectrum that particularly warrant exploration for applying existing programming knowledge are the following: \u2022 A focus on local elected officials capabilities in the areas of enforcing transparency, managing institutional reform and facilitating a more inclusive decision making process in local governance (through local councils and local government). \u2022 A focus on civil society organizations leaders\u2019 ability to manage development projects and administration, to expand and diversify networks, to guide and effect change both within organisations and in their environments. \u2022 A focus on emerging groups with a view to strengthening community leaders\u2019 capacity for representing their particular groups\u2019 interests in the local and national development dialogue and resource allocation agenda (this is particularly true for indigenous, rural and HIV-affected populations), with particular emphasis on gender equality and non discrimination. Within these areas of focus, specific conditions should be met in programming development and implementation to better insure success over the longer term: a) interventions and support must be designed within a 10-15 year long term vision; b) programmmes need to link to the greater societal sphere, which defines the political economy context and space for local leaders; c) regional and sub-regional Trainer to Trainer (TtT) strategies must be implemented as a means to driving and sustaining the overall process of enhancing specific skills, knowledge and overall leadership capabilities; d) monitoring and evaluation tools, that are independent and validated by stakeholders is key, to keep leadership work in objective perspective and validated. a) Vision and designs over a 10-15 year horizon. Leadership capabilities take time to nurture and grow.

As evidenced, one of the main drawbacks of current leadership development work is that the design, implementation and evaluation processes do not have enough breadth in terms of the timeframe to allow for initiatives to move from the individual to the organizational and social spheres; and to evaluate them adequately and learn from them. Facilitation and support in this field needs a process perspective, where long- and medium-term partnerships support the process, regardless of the more limited project timeframes. b) Programmes need to link to the societal sphere in which the space for leadership development is defined (or confined). Pedagogically speaking, most of the reviewed leadership initiatives do not link the individual with the other social spheres. Understanding and using the political economy as context, often determines the success or failure of a leadership support effort. Developing the capacities of the group, or the community, is therefore as essential a part of this process, as a focus on the leader as individual. Working with the social and cultural environment, clarifying the ways in which the environment can propel and support the leader\u2014all of these need to be fed into the design and implementation or leadership development processes. c) Implementation of regional and sub-regional Trainer to Trainer (TtT) strategies. Programming guidelines and lessons learned are relevant if they can be put into practice. Theory is important, but more relevant is its validation or adaptation in practice. We know the \u201cwhat\u00b4s\u201d. We need to invest more in the \u201chow\u201d. Becoming true experts in the \u201cimplementation\u201d realms is part of the development challenge and way forward. Horizontal coaching and learning among trainers and organisations working in this field are key. d) Independent Monitoring and Evaluation tools that cover leadership processes. As has been evidenced throughout this document, there have been a number of important but rather weak efforts to design, and validate sensitive tools for M&E of capacity development and leadership processes. This is a field that is as subjective as it is political. 21 The more transparent the monitoring and review processes, the more multi stakeholder the engagement on feedback, the more rigourous and systematic the interventions and support. If results (both good and bad) are substantiated with evidence; methodologically framed and clearly documented and communicated, the process could become less \u201csensitive\u201d and politicized. UNDP investment in the above areas could serve to accomplish a great deal for advancing the niche of Leadership Development as a capacity development strategy. This investment will contribute significantly to strengthening democratic participatory governance, particularly at the local level. 22 ANNEXES ANNEX 1. Case Studies. In accordance with the organizational methodology developed to measure the impact of the leadership development programming of each of the organizations studied, we selected the highest scorers for developing three case studies. These are the UNDP HIV/AIDS Leadership Development Programme, the UN-HABITAT Local Elected Leadership programme, and the Capacity 2015 Latin America LEAD-UPEACE local leadership programme. The full case studies are presented below. Case Study 1. UNDP HIV/AIDS Leadership Capacity Development Programme The UNDP HIV/AIDS Leadership Capacity Development Programme is one of UNDP\u2019s most thoroughly developed leadership development initiatives. Since 2002, it has been applied in over 30 countries around the world to scale-up and lead change in the national responses. The vision aims to bring together leaders from government, civil society and the private sector to generate individual and collective commitment and sustainable action in response to causes of the epidemic. The strategy is composed of mutually reinforcing programmes that progressively build leadership and institutional capacity over a three-year period: Methods and materials for the programme include Strategy Notes and Implementation Guides for each of the programmes mentioned above, along with a measurement framework, Responding to HIV/AIDS: Measuring Results, and a Compendium of Resources that offers a collection of specific documents, reports and strategic materials for practitioners. While the programme has been most active in Sub-Saharan Africa (Botswana, South Africa, Ghana and Ethiopia, for example) and Asia (Cambodia, China, India and Papua New Guinea, among others), it is also being implemented in Eastern Europe, the Arab States, nearly all of the Caribbean islands (Haiti, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic among them), and several countries in Latin America (El Salvador, Mexico and Bolivia). The transformation oriented Leadership Development Programme (LDP) brings together leaders from all levels of society to participate in action learning sessions held over the period of a year in which they discuss the factors influencing the spread of the epidemic and develop new strategies for implementation. Working in groups, they develop breakthrough initiatives designed", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "64b3859a-9dd8-4bec-881f-ceaa7fc4ab52": {"__data__": {"id_": "64b3859a-9dd8-4bec-881f-ceaa7fc4ab52", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/leadership-development-leading-transformation-local-level", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Leadership development - Leading transformation at the Local Level", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/leadership-development-leading-transformation-local-level", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4640c468dcec104a277f1ce29e5e7771a0c8d2c86595a19dc5234a427db95a5f"}}, "hash": "4640c468dcec104a277f1ce29e5e7771a0c8d2c86595a19dc5234a427db95a5f", "text": "with several key criteria: leverage, visibility, measurability, and the demonstration of short-term results, as well as 23 sustainability. These initiatives are put into action between session and it has been demonstrated that this individual empowerment leads to increasingly effective organization and institutional responses as participants bring their insights back to their working environments. Partnerships\u2014with other UN agencies such as UN-Habitat, CSOs, governments, businesses and arts and media\u2014form another integral part of the leadership programme and enable projects to catalyze actions that stimulate sustainable action beyond the life of the project. Nevertheless, while some degree of evidence exists for examples of societal change, documentation in this area is still weak, partly as a result of the fact that the programme has only been in operation for less than four years. Case Study 2. UN-Habitat Local Elected Leadership Programme Guided by the assumption that many of the problems facing local elected leaders are so complex that they require leadership strategies as opposed to mere administrative solutions, the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) has developed a Local Elected Leadership programme through which it aims to strengthen the capacity of local governments through the introduction of good local leadership practices. UN-Habitat has developed and tested a series of training handbooks to assist councillors to represent the citizens, provide civic leadership and effectively work with central government and with the management, technical, and professional staff in local authorities and other local institutions. These handbooks cover policy and decision making, communication, negotiation and leadership, attending, managing and conducting meetings, councillors' enabling and facilitating activities, financial management and other related needs. Additional assistance for trainers using these handbooks has been published in the companion Trainer's Guide for Training of Elected Officials. UN-Habitat has also incorporated a knowledge management aspect by establishing The Best Practices and Local Leadership Programme (BLP), a global network of government agencies, local authorities and their associations, professional and academic institutions and grassroots organizations. The objective of the BLP is to raise awareness of decision-makers on critical social, economic and environmental issues and to better inform them of the practical means and policy options by identifying, disseminating and applying lessons learned from Best Practices to ongoing training, leadership and policy development activities. Training focuses on challenging the processes for getting things done by constantly questioning the size of, and need for the varying bureaucratic mechanisms a given government has developed over the years. Attention is also given to the creation and inspiration among others of constructive visions. Enabling others to act is another strategy employed for achieving many of the programme\u2019s objectives and is probably the most valuable training for helping leaders to get things done in the local environment. The programme has carried out a couple of pilots in most regions--Costa Rica and El Salvador in Latin America, Kenya and Uganda in Africa, Lithuania and Romania in Eastern Europe and Vietnam in Asia\u2014and has translated the materials into 25 languages to enable replication of programming across the globe, which is now beginning to take shape. By influencing local elected officials to become more knowledgeable about an increasingly complex set of interrelated issues through developing competencies in decision making, communication, facilitating, overseeing and empowering, UN-Habitat produces these individuals with broader vision and capacity. By taking this back to their governing environment, local leaders better represent citizens, provide civic leadership and more effectively work with central government and with the technical and professional staff in local institutions. Evaluation and documentation of the impact of the programme at the societal level, however, is still sparse. 24 Case Study 3. LEAD-C2015-UPEACE project- Peasant and Indigenous Leadership in Latin America. Capacity 2015 in Latin America has partnered with the LEAD International (Leaders on Environment and Development) and UPEACE (University of Peace, based in Costa Rica) with the launch a local leadership training programme that supports the vision that it is possible to \u201ctransform local peasant or indigenous leaders into effective activists through training on leadership metadisciplines24, in order to strengthen their on going local sustainable projects and processes\u201d. The following disciplines are included in the modules taught25: o Systems thinking, the art of going from short term to long term vision. o Negotiation, the power to influence others. o Ethics and decision making, integrity as the core to transparent procurement. o Leadership and cultural affairs, or learning to respect and negotiate with diverse groups. o Networking, the promise of nurturing the group and creating sustainability of local sustainable development projects. The selected target population is that of peasant or indigenous leaders in Latin America, 18 to 30 years of age, who have completed primary school", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "478a4ac3-da34-4494-95e8-d0448992024b": {"__data__": {"id_": "478a4ac3-da34-4494-95e8-d0448992024b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/leadership-development-leading-transformation-local-level", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Leadership development - Leading transformation at the Local Level", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/leadership-development-leading-transformation-local-level", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c82a01ac99eca00209a042b3aaa88430d8aa11e19fc62b39ed75457cc54b3ada"}}, "hash": "c82a01ac99eca00209a042b3aaa88430d8aa11e19fc62b39ed75457cc54b3ada", "text": "education, are involved in on-going local sustainable projects, and participate in active local political movements. The methodology is composed of four main steps: 1) a cultural mediation and adaptation workshop, 2) a first training session of five days on skill building, 3) an inter-sessional period (going back to the governing environment), and 4) a second training on consolidation and networking. During the \u201ccultural mediation and adaptation workshop\u201d the LEAD materials mentioned above are reviewed. The method demands the reconsideration by 5 local leaders, 5 academics dedicated to local sustainable development and 2 LEAD facilitators. Each module is reviewed by all three groups from the perspective of its application to the target population, selection of core concepts, simplicity of language, cultural and politically relevant case studies. Once the materials have been adapted, the first training sessions takes place during 5 full days. Paulo Freire\u00b4s participatory teaching techniques26 are used to guarantee assimilation of knowledge. At the end of the programme, and action plan for the application of \u201cnew knowledge and skills\u201d in the context of their local sustainable projects is defined. Once this takes place, student/leaders come back for a three day training, where \u201cconsolidation\u201d of knowledge is emphasized, and the group as a whole, works on team building and networking. The over all process lasts 3-months. Five days (or 40 hrs) of presential training; one and a half months of application to local sustainable projects during the intersessional period (with 5 hrs a week average, times 6 weeks, equals, 30 hrs of applied work), plus three days (25 hrs of presential work) for review of work planes, consolidation of knowledge and setting up of the network. This generates a total of 100 hrs for the full process. During 2006, this process was validated with local leaders from the GEF-SGP from Costa Rica, El Salvador and Guatemala. The process was formally evaluated, base line information was set, and the process will be monitored over the next five years. Major lessons learned derived from the process include the following: 24 A metadiscipline is a core, essential, cross-practice that is necessary to leadership, regardless of the level and setting. 25 LEAD launched an in depth questionnaire to 300 of its LEAD fellows and interviewed them in order to define the \u201cMAIN\u201d disciplines, all leaders need to go through regardless of level and setting. These modules are a result of this future vision evaluation process. 26 Paulo Freire, Pedagog\u00eda del Oprimido, Siglo XXI. 25 o When working with local leaders in Latin America, whether peasant or indigenous, the cultural mediation workshops are fundamental. They allow for the adaptation of materials, language, and the selection and usage of culturally and politically relevant case studies for educational purposes. o Training materials need to be adapted in terms of selection of concepts, simplicity of language, and relevant case studies. o Freire\u2019s participatory teaching method is very useful to maintain the interest of the group, participation and effective learning. o A curricular design that allows for the application (inter-sessional period) and consolidation (second participatory workshop) seems necessary. o The formal evaluation will show whether the above combination of elements is sufficient to impact societal spheres. Current challenges for the programme include designing and validating Trainers-to-Trainer modules, taking the vision from the pilots to the regional level, designing and validating Monitoring and Evaluation mechanisms, and securing funds for the regional programme and formal evaluations. 26 Annex 2 - Measuring Impact Organizational Profiles on Leadership Development Programmes Given the relative dearth of monitoring and evaluation tools available for accessing existing leadership development programmes, this study began its investigation into the impact of the various organizations reviewed by developing the following methodology: 1) information gathering/inventorying of relevant leadership development documentation from multilateral, bilateral and non-governmental organizations; 2) development of a rough scale with which to profile each organization in terms of its vision, methods, materials, effect on individual behavior change, effect on organizational change, and influence over societal change; 3) revision by an internal panel for objective organizational comparison. The ranking of each organization represents the total score of the six categories of analysis mentioned above. Each category was ranked from 1 to 5 (5 reflecting the highest score), for a possible overall total of 30, in accordance with ranking criteria listed in the table below: Ranking criteria 1 - No evidence or only anecdotal evidence of capacity development 2 - Capacity development is being planned 3 - Capacity development plan is being implemented 4 - Capacity development plan is being implemented and includes a review 5 - Capacity is fully exhibited and reviewed on the basis of benchmarking", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0d36859f-449e-4ee9-9349-f15bcdfa6a80": {"__data__": {"id_": "0d36859f-449e-4ee9-9349-f15bcdfa6a80", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/leadership-development-leading-transformation-local-level", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Leadership development - Leading transformation at the Local Level", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/leadership-development-leading-transformation-local-level", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b0abc55a7207ef9d45d766fe90f232210aba13d33f88b7f183939cd6a3e413f6"}}, "hash": "b0abc55a7207ef9d45d766fe90f232210aba13d33f88b7f183939cd6a3e413f6", "text": "data This exercise represents what would be carried out, ideally, as an evaluation including input from the actors of all the relevant organizations.

A cumulative sequence is set up whereby vision plus methods plus materials plus individual change of behavior taken together contributes to organizational and, ultimately, societal change. Based on this, the UNDP HIV/AIDS leadership programme shows the highest individual ranking per category plus the highest total. UN-Habitat also scores high because of its strong contribution in materials for leadership development. SNV does not have a high cumulative score, largely because it does not produce its own leadership materials. AVINA and Ashoka also have relatively low ratings, explained by the fact that they do not demonstrate such explicit leadership visions, methods or materials. More detailed information on each organization is provided in the subsequent sections. The following graphic presents the cumulative results for each of the six categories of analysis across the organizations reviewed. Cumulative Categorical Scores The graphic highlights the following tendencies among organizations with programming in leadership development: strong, clear visions; an extended menu of methodological contributions; a need to move forward with broader alternatives in terms of materials; a strong focus on individual development of traits and skills; a relevant connection with organizational reform; and weak evidence of measurable societal influence. The information in the subsequent sections is based on the analysis of the six categories introduced previously, which were rated from 1 to 5 for each organization reviewed. 17 22 36 27 34 36 0 20 40 1 Vision Methods Materials Individual Change Organisational Change Societal Change 28 1. UNDP HIV/AIDS Leadership Capacity Development Programme Commentary o The UNDP HIV/AIDS Leadership Capacity Development programme has a clearly defined vision stating that the group \u201csupports the implementation of approaches and methodologies that embody governance in action: bringing together leaders from government, civil society\u2026and the business sector to generate individual and collective commitment and sustainable action in response to the underlying causes of the epidemic.\u201d o In terms of method and materials, it has produced a well-defined set of tools including Strategy Notes and Implementation Guides in addition to Measuring Results frameworks and such knowledge management devices as the Compendium of Resources. o All initiatives aim to develop a multitude of leaders worldwide, in different areas and at different levels, and equip them with the necessary skills to explore their own potential and to transform their organizations, institutions and societies.

Costing: Methodologies and Implications Average cost per type of service across sectors Compared to the information available on methodologies and materials, relatively little on costing data is accessible for leadership development programmes presently in operation. To compensate somewhat for this information gap, our costing research and analysis focused on the major categories of leadership development reflected in current supply side tendencies in both the private sector and civil society: 1) coaching services, 2) management training services, and c) development programme training services. 1) Coaching services refer to personalized training based on monitoring and analysis of client performance in his/her job. Two main coaching modalities have been observed from the available information: face-to-face, where the personal coach follows every one of the client\u2019s actions on a daily basis, and by telephone, where a personal coach is available every time the client needs a specific consultation. Six institutions were researched yielding the average costs presented in the table below. Average Costs for Coaching Services (2006) Modalities Average cost per hour per person (US$) Face to face $ 351.5 Telephone $ 240.5 Face-to-face training showed an overall average investment of $ 2,196.60 per person over an average timeframe of 6.25 hours, whereas telephone training showed an average investment of $1,346.60 over an average timeframe of 5.6 hours. The target population for these types of services are generally businessmen, entrepreneurs, and young corporate executives; the main topics to be addressed are usually related to financial management, human resources administration, and various commercial concerns. 2) Management training services include courses, workshops, and group oriented seminars that run from short one-day conferences to large university-style training processes. The main topics covered in these training modalities are generally project management, business management, and organizational leadership; target populations are predominately entrepreneurs. Six institutions were researched yielding the average costs presented in the table below. Average Costs for Management Training Services (2006) Modalities Range (days) Average cost per person (USD) Average cost per day per person Short term training 1 $ 550 $ 550 Medium term training 2 \u2013 5 $ 1,122.5 $ 374 Long term training* 6 \u2013 30 $ 15,133 $ 1,260 * University-style training process 3) Development programme training services tend to be more comprehensive than either of the other categories of training mentioned and generally include in the overall price the cost of 36 design, implementation, materials, processes and prototype validation. As a result, analysis of this category shows that training programmes for local leaders tend to be more expensive than general management leadership training courses. Primarily NGOs or international development organizations are the implementers of this kind of training service.

For example, the average hourly rate for leadership coaching varies within the range of US$250-350 USA per hour. For training sessions and courses, university-style training costs (per day) generally fell within the range of US$ 500-1200 per day, or roughly 50% less than personalized coaching services. Development leadership programmes that incorporate the design, materials, implementation, validation and evaluation stages are unquestionably the most expensive, ranging in cost between US$1,000 and US$3,000 per person per day. (For more detailed information on costing, see Annex 2). Key variables in costing From the analysis reviewed above, a number of factors surface as key variables affecting the costing decision-making. In the area of on-the-job coaching services, these variables are primarily 1) the modality (face-to-face versus telephone coaching, with face-to-face services being more expensive) and 2) the number of hours engaged in the coaching\u2014as interventions tend to be short-term and punctual, fees and costing are generally calculated on an hourly basis. For training services, the variables are typically 1) the modality (a general preference is noted for classroom or university-style context) and 2) the number of days or weeks engaged in the training, thus costing tends to be done on a per-person-per-day basis. As development programmes often include more extensive processes in their training, they often have more variables affecting their costing. These can include 1) programme length (days, weeks, months, years), 2) development of materials (and how numerous and/or complex the materials are), 3) validation of materials, 4) validation of process, 5) validation of prototype and 6) elaboration of formal evaluations. With regard to these last four variables involving validations and evaluations, much depends upon the length and complexity of the process involved for each. Since development programme training tends to involve a more complex process, costing tends to be done on an overall, per person basis for the entire programme. 37 Annex 4: Bibliography Ashoka.

These are only a few of the 131 Fellows of the Leadership Course undertaken by the Asian Young Leaders in Governance (AYLG) initiative of the UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok and Regional Centre in Colombo. Supported by four regional programmes \u2013 Capacity2015-Asia (programme of the UNDP Capacity Development Group), Asia Regional Governance Programme, the Asia Pacific Gender Mainstreaming Programme, and the Regional Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Programme \u2013 the AYLG aims to strengthen the leadership capacities of young leaders in the region towards making them even more potent advocates of change. In partnership with and using leadership modules pioneered by LEAD International, participants were trained on systems thinking for transformational change, cross cultural communications and leadership, conflict resolution and negotiation, and leadership styles tools, as well as on thematic modules on anti-corruption and leadership, gender and leadership, capacity assessment for leadership development, and indigenous peoples and development. The one-week training courses included presentations, interactive group discussions and exercises, regional and country leadership action planning, and simulations. The balance between theory and practice has allowed participants to absorb the modules, and its interactive nature likewise allowed UNDP 2 to learn from the various experiences and substantive knowledge of the participants towards further improving the course. Since the AYLG initiative started in 2005, it has conducted one regional leadership course, a leadership training of trainers, and two sub- regional leadership courses. Nine of the Fellows have also been trained as Leadership Trainers, and have been involved in the delivery of the sub-regional leadership courses. Fellows have started e-networking and sharing information and discussing issues. A sub-national rollout of the leadership course has been completed in Bangladesh using their own funding, with Fellows from the country coordinating and facilitating the course. A sub-national rollout is likewise planned in the Philippines in December 2006. In addition to regional initiatives, each country delegation to the course has likewise developed national and sub-national leadership action plans that are expected to take place in 2007. Receiving very positive evaluation from the participants, the success of the initiative so far can probably be summed up by one participant\u2019s remarks: \u201cSuccess! The course has made us reflect on our own leadership styles and abilities, and promoted inspiration and energy to aspire to cultivate these qualities in ourselves. Cultural diversity of the group was very enriching and contributed greatly to my learning. Good networking and positive energy all around.\u201d The initiative has also received support from the United Nations Democracy Fund (UNDEF), which approved a proposal from the UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok for broadening the initiative by building on the experiences and lessons learned from AYLG. A regional adaptation workshop is expected to take place in February 2007, to further adapt the leadership modules to the Asian context, bring in more Asian case studies, and catalyze leadership innovations in the region.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "577e63d1-bd55-4497-b5fd-7611667a3e87": {"__data__": {"id_": "577e63d1-bd55-4497-b5fd-7611667a3e87", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-first-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Linkages between International Trade and Human Poverty First Stakeholder Perception Workshop Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-first-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d2f68e9707b0cec50bfc79517b9c63316ea721ee81a862ea0e385302aa8a924c"}, "3": {"node_id": "a8990ef6-35f7-41dc-b877-41caaee10759", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-first-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "01a181ec79f133f0df1cf2817adcdd72a34fe2548687624421b31e64ee366fb8"}}, "hash": "f2e03b03e5c485a73fcf6ab5fbe7eec0424b6184e8c3aa92ef1902ca7891f776", "text": "Linkages between International Trade and Human Poverty First Stakeholder Perception Workshop Report New Delhi, India February 2005 APRI Asia Pacific Regional HDR Initiative ------------------------------------------------------------ Regional Centre in Colombo Serving Asia and the Pacific ---------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------- \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty \u201d -

First Stakeholder Consultation Report, February 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 3 Introduction International trade is about exchange of goods and services by people and companies. Rules and policies framed by governments (individually as well as collectively) play an important part in this cross-border exchange. However, from time immemorial it is the people and entities formed by people, which drive international trade and the political economy associated with it. There is no better example than the history of the East India Company, which has been engaged in cross-border trade for over six centuries. The literature on international trade has mixed opinion regarding the impact of cross- border exchange of goods and services on people\u2019s livelihood. While a large number of people have benefited from international trade, there is no shortage of literature documenting its adverse impact. How is the situation today? The present system of international trade is different from what it was a century ago. There is much more certainty, as rules, procedures and policies are framed and documented. This was possible because of the formation of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in mid-1990s. True that the WTO is an unequal treaty, but it is a fact that a rules-based system is much more preferable and desirable than having no system in place. Another important feature of today\u2019s international trade is that the issues are no longer confined at the border of a country. With changing nature of globalisation and economic liberalisation (international trade being one of the drivers of this change), sovereignty (of countries) is getting multilateralised. The bottom line is that more and more people are getting involved and/or exposed to international trade. As such there is no index to measure people\u2019s \u2018exposure\u2019 to international trade (and the implications of such exposure), but there are studies showing how, overtime, a country\u2019s \u2018openness\u2019 to international trade is increasing in terms of rising share of exports and imports as percentage of gross national product as well as rising share of foreign direct investment in gross national capital formation. The next question is, can \u2018openness\u2019 work for the benefit of the people, especially the poor? There is no ready answer to this question. Equally important is the fact that there is no \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 and/or \u2018one-type-fits-all\u2019 approach for \u2018making\u2019 openness work. We need to understand why openness is important. As Rodrik (1999) argued, \u201copenness is a mixed blessing, one that will need to be nurtured if it is to be a positive force for economic development\u201d outlined three propositions about openness while analysing \u201ceconomic policy in countries that are in the process of integrating into the world economy\u201d: First, openness by itself is not a realistic mechanism to generate sustained economic growth. The fundamental determinants of economic growth are the accumulation of physical and human capital and technological development.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a8990ef6-35f7-41dc-b877-41caaee10759": {"__data__": {"id_": "a8990ef6-35f7-41dc-b877-41caaee10759", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-first-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Linkages between International Trade and Human Poverty First Stakeholder Perception Workshop Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-first-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d2f68e9707b0cec50bfc79517b9c63316ea721ee81a862ea0e385302aa8a924c"}, "2": {"node_id": "577e63d1-bd55-4497-b5fd-7611667a3e87", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-first-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f2e03b03e5c485a73fcf6ab5fbe7eec0424b6184e8c3aa92ef1902ca7891f776"}}, "hash": "01a181ec79f133f0df1cf2817adcdd72a34fe2548687624421b31e64ee366fb8", "text": "The fundamental determinants of economic growth are the accumulation of physical and human capital and technological development.

Several attempts have been made to empirically estimate the impact of trade liberalisation on poverty in poor country. Cline (2004) projected that rich country trade liberalisation would lift 540 million people out of poverty. Weisbrot, Rosnik and Baker (2004) made some corrections to Cline\u2019s methodology and estimated the figure as approximately 440 million. The main argument of Weisbrot et al (2004) was that \u201csince most of the world\u2019s poor are currently clustered close to the international poverty level of $2 a day, a relatively modest increase in income is sufficient to lift many of these people out of poverty. They also argued that the amount of income projected to be gained by the poor in developing countries due to trade liberalisation is equal to between 0.1 to 0.4 percent of rich country GDP (gross domestic product). \u201cWhile trade liberalisation may be one way to bring about these gains to the poor, it is not necessarily the only way. In principle, effective foreign aid equal to 0.1-0.4 percent of rich country GDP could accomplish the same result.\u201d Country Pre-Liberalisation Post-Liberalisation Bangladesh 1.97 2.03 China 2.00 2.00 India 1.92 2.08 Indonesia 1.96 2.04 Malaysia 1.93 2.07 Pakistan 1.79 2.24 Philippines 1.94 2.06 Thailand 1.72 2.37 Source: Mark Weisbrot, D avid Rosnick and Dean Baker, \u201cPoor Numbers: The Impact of Trade Liberalisation on World Poverty,\u201d Center for Economic and Policy Research, Washington DC, 2004. Table 1: Incomes of Poor Lifted Out of Poverty (Dollars per Day) McCulloch et al (2001) identified \u201cpathways through which trade liberalisation can have a direct effect on poverty\u201d. According to them, the \u2018pathways\u2019 are as follows: Price transmission The impact of trade liberalisation depends on how changes in border prices get translated into changes in the prices actually faced by households. Price transmission depends on: \u2022 the competitive structure of the distribution sector; \u2022 the way in which government institutions such as marketing organisations operate; and \u2022 the extent of the domain of trade. ---------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------- \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty \u201d - First Stakeholder Consultation Report, February 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 5 Enterprises Trade liberalisation also affects households through its impact on profits, and thereby employment and wages. There are two opposite ways in which they may occur: If wages are flexible and labour is fully employed, then price changes caused by trade liberalisation will be reflected in wage changes, with employment staying the same. Alternatively, if there is a large pool of workers who move in or out of jobs when circumstances change, then trade liberalisation will cause changes in employment. Taxes and spending Trade liberalisation may affect poverty through changes in government revenue and expenditure. The key lessons here are that: \u2022 liberalisation often does not have to lead to revenue cuts if tariff peaks and exemptions are also tackled; \u2022 it is important to look at the poverty effects of alternative forms of taxation introduced to cover any shortfall, particularly consumption taxes; \u2022 it is generally possible to protect social and anti-poverty expenditures even if expenditures do decline; and \u2022 good macroeconomic management is far more important to maintaining social expenditure. Shocks, risks and vulnerability Households may become more vulnerable as a result of switching their activities in response to trade liberalisation. But if the new activities generate higher returns and the switch is voluntary, the change is not necessarily welfare-reducing. The essence of this review is that international trade is intrinsically linked with people and \u2018income\u2019 is only an aspect of poverty, not \u2018the\u2019 aspect. As we try to understand the impact and implications of international trade on people\u2019s livelihoods, it is necessary to explore the linkages between international trade and human poverty. It is necessary to know what we understand by \u2018human poverty\u2019. As Malhotra (2003) argued: \u201cIf income is not the sum total of human development, lack of it cannot be the sum total of human deprivation.

Beyond lack of income, people can be deprived if they lead short and unhealthy lives, are illiterate, feel personal insecurity or are not allowed to participate. Thus, human poverty is larger than income poverty. Human poverty is more than just a state: it is a process. People living in poverty deploy whatever assets they have to cope with it.

Defined in this way, human development is a simple notion with far-reaching implications. People\u2019s choices are enlarged if they acquire more capabilities and have more opportunities to use them. Choices are important for current as well as future generations. For human development to be sustainable, today\u2019s generations must enlarge their choices without reducing those of future generations. Though important, economic growth is a means of development \u2013 not the ultimate goal. Higher income makes an important contribution if it improves people\u2019s lives. But income growth is not an end. Development must be focused on people, and economic growth must be equitable if its benefits are to be felt in people\u2019s lives. Gender equality is at the core of human development. A development process that bypasses half of humanity \u2013 or discriminates against it \u2013 limits women\u2019s choices. By focusing on choices, the human development concept implies that people must participate in the processes that shape their lives. They must help make and implement decisions and monitor their outcomes. Human security is distinct but contributes to human development. Security means safety from chronic hunger, disease and repression. It also means protection from sudden, harmful disruptions in the patterns of daily life. In an economic context, it protects people from threats to their incomes, food security and livelihoods.\u201d Taking into account these concepts of human poverty and human development, Malhotra (2003) outlined linkages between international trade and human development as: \u201cBeyond its direct benefits for human development through economic growth, trade can enlarge people\u2019s choices by expanding markets for goods and services and by providing stable incomes for households. (\u2026) Better human development outcomes, in the form of improved capabilities as the result of a healthier, better-educated and more skilled work force, with a strong focus on knowledge creation, contribute to higher economic growth and better trade outcomes.\u201d If one looks at trade from its human development perspectives, where does the multilateral trading system under the aegis of the WTO fit in? Rodrik (2001) elucidated the so-called dilemma between trade as a \u2018market-exchange\u2019 perspective and trade as a \u2018development\u2019 perspective as: \u201cEconomists think of the WTO as an institution defined to expand free trade and thereby enhance consumer welfare, in the South no less than in the North. In reality, it is an institution that enables countries to bargain about market access. \u2018Free trade\u2019 is not the typical outcome of this process; nor is consumer welfare (much less development) what the negotiators have chiefly in mind. Traditionally, the agenda of multilateral trade negotiations has been shaped in response to a tug-of-war between exporters and multi-national corporations in the advanced industrial countries (which have had the upper hand), on the one hand, and import-competing interests (typically, but not solely, labour) on the other.\u201d Rodrik (2001) further argued, \u201cthere are at least three sources of slippage between what development requires and what the WTO does. First, even if free trade were optimal for development in its broad sense, the WTO does not fundamentally pursue ---------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------- \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty \u201d - First Stakeholder Consultation Report, February 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 7 free trade.

The three essential choices are, i) to lead a long and healthy life, ii) to acquire knowledge, and iii) to have access to resources needed for a decent standard of living. The four components seen as being essential to human development are: empowerment, productivity, equity, and sustainability\u2026. The challenge facing the Asia Trade Initiative is, thus, to relate these concepts to trade issues and policies.\u201d UNDP\u2019s Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific is implementing another initiative titled \u201cThe Asia Pacific Regional Human Development Report Initiative,\u201d whose objectives are: \u2022 To improve national and regional capacities in cross-country HD (human development) analysis and impact assessments. \u2022 To enhance networking for the exchange of information and expertise. \u2022 To bring the concept of human development into regional development strategies, inter-governmental agreements and policies related to human development. In support of the (above-stated) objectives, activities under the APRI include: \u2022 Providing support to preparation of regional/country-cluster HDRs (human development reports) on issues of common concern. \u2022 Providing support to producing background technical support documents, policy briefs and application notes, and impact assessments linked to and complementing sub-regional/regional and national HDRs. \u2022 Hosting regional learning seminars on human development. \u2022 Facilitating exchange of experiences, best practices and cross-fertilisation of ideas and methodologies through national and regional HD (human development) networks. \u2022 Assessing and improving advocacy and monitoring of impact of HDRs.

The report will cover the broad issues of: \u2022 agriculture, food security and rural development, \u2022 movement of natural persons, \u2022 trade in energy services, \u2022 trade in environmental services, \u2022 geographical indications, \u2022 trade and investment, \u2022 fisheries, and \u2022 WTO accession of least developed countries (LDCs). The Asia-Pacific Regional Human Development Report (RHDR) on International Trade and Human Poverty, which is essentially an advocacy document, will examine the ways in which international trade affects human poverty. This is the reason for hearing stakeholders themselves (or representatives of stakeholders) about the issues of concern. Therefore, the following activities are conducted: \u2022 Two stakeholder consultations (February and June 2005); and \u2022 Field research in select countries of the Asia-Pacific region. Stakeholders\u2019 feedbacks and perceptions cover the following themes and sub-sectors: Promoting Rural Livelihoods and Food Security \u2022 Agriculture \u2022 Fisheries \u2022 Geographical Indications Generating and Sustaining Employment \u2022 Textiles and Clothing \u2022 Tourism \u2022 Overseas Movement of Persons \u2022 Outsourcing Ensuring Access to Basic Services \u2022 Energy \u2022 Environmental Services \u2022 Health Keeping in mind the linkages between international trade and human poverty (defining human poverty from the human development angle), stakeholders\u2019 feedbacks and perceptions were gathered by looking at both income and non-income aspects of poverty.

The stakeholder consultations were conducted by taking into account the above-stated strands of micro-level analyses on linkages between international trade and human poverty. The purpose was not to enter into debates about vhe macroeconomic nexus between international trade and human poverty. Instead it was to ascertain how international trade in an increasingly open and evolving environment will affect different stakeholders, particularly their livelihood opportunities and food security, the availability of basic services such as health, energy, and water and sanitation with a specific focus on the poor and marginalised sections of the society. The outcome of these consultations was to provide feedbacks and inputs to the \u201cAsia-Pacific Regional Human Development Report on International Trade and Human Poverty\u201d.

The consultation was structured in a roundtable mode, divided into two sessions (one on livelihood and food security issues and the other on public health services).

Field research is to be conducted in 13 countries (i.e. all countries targeted for first stakeholder consultation, except Fiji Islands). This was due to cost and time factors involved in conducting the field research. Field research is to target primary as well as secondary (representative) stakeholders. Furthermore and as per need, experts and government officials are to be consulted. Field research is to cover all sectors. However, given the availability of time for the field research, in some countries it is not to cover those sectors, which are of minor importance to that country (for example, outsourcing in Nepal). If in case and due to want of time, field research was not conducted in a particular sector in a country, it is to be done subsequently, either visiting that country and/or by involving a person from that country. Participants at the first stakeholder consultation are to act as \u2018key\u2019 contacts in respective countries. Field researchers from CUTS-CITEE are to consult them for identifying stakeholders for doing the field research in respective countries. These key contacts are to help field researchers in logistical arrangements for conducting the field research. Field researchers, while taking to stakeholders during the field research, will also collect materials from secondary sources (in particular, initiatives having linkages with \u2018international trade and human poverty\u2019.

Background 1.1 UNDP is presently preparing on a Regional Human Development Report (R- HDR) for Asia-Pacific on international trade and human poverty. There is hardly any doubt that international trade affects the lives of people through a variety of channels. Indeed, many people have argued that international trade is beneficial to economic growth and hence poverty reduction and human development. But others have disagreed with this observation. Among other things, they have argued that, even if international leads to an expansion of income, it cannot be concluded that there is an automatic link between trade and poverty reduction. While the macro-economic effects of trade on poverty is ambiguous, research is gradually shifting to from the \u201clarge\u201d to the \u201csmall,\u201d from searching for macro- economic linkages to identifying the linkages/mechanisms at the micro-economic level: labor market issues, the effect of the removal of subsidies, employment opportunities for a particular commodity or a particular sector, the rise in prices following trade liberalization and, more generally, at the impact of trade at the level of sub-sectors and communities. 1.2 The purpose of this Stakeholder Consultation is not to enter into the debate about the macro-economic nexus between trade and poverty. Instead it is to ascertain how international trade in an increasingly open and evolving environment will affect different stakeholders \u2013 particularly their livelihood opportunities and food security and the availability of public health services, with a specific focus on the poor and marginalized sections of society. The feedback from this consultation will be incorporated into the R-HDR, which is primarily an advocacy document. II. Objective of the Consultation 2.1 There will be two consultations: one in February and the other in April. The present Consultation, which is being held in Delhi, will draw stakeholders from the 14 countries in the region.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "740c66c2-0251-4089-8455-38928e4b23b1": {"__data__": {"id_": "740c66c2-0251-4089-8455-38928e4b23b1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-first-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Linkages between International Trade and Human Poverty First Stakeholder Perception Workshop Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-first-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f7bc203620b56cbf362307eb2cd3f1f7865a9bca49747ed13e92654aca96404a"}, "2": {"node_id": "b350cb58-98dc-4be0-8794-c4e4b00c03d3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-first-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5bc9231ae16c2b976348253b5ca174ba9f97c72a5e2ee58242376475beaddda6"}}, "hash": "9075aa2b4777bc214a60391cabd847e3fb8fdbf6737ba69adf6f49d06a96cf82", "text": "It\u2019s main objective is to get feedback on the effects of international trade on ---------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------- \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty \u201d - First Stakeholder Consultation Report, February 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 16 employment (more broadly, livelihood) opportunities, inequality, food security, health services within the context of the Millennium Development Goals.

Of course, in thinking about supply and demand, the issue of price enters the picture as well. What is the effect on the price of inputs for farming/cottage industries or other productive entities? Because a more liberalized multilateral trading environment is expected to inject a healthy doze of competition, has there been a fall in the price of basic consumption goods (such as food items and clothing) and consumer durables (such as TV, stereos, tape recorded, refrigerators, etc). Has the quality of these items improved? \u00a7 Livelihood opportunities: On balance, do you think that the present era of enhanced liberalization creates more opportunities for employment than it destroys? Have working conditions improved or deteriorated?

Summary UNDP is preparing a Regional Human Development Report (RHDR) for the Asia -Pacific region on international trade and human poverty, to be published in the third quarter of 2005. Because the report, which is essentially an advocacy document, will examine the ways in which international trade affects human poverty, it will be interesting to he ar from stakeholders themselves (or representatives of stakeholders) about the issues of concern.

It is important to highlight the non-income aspects of poverty and how \u201cinternational trade\u201d are/can affect them, as international experience is mixed. For example, Bangladesh has done relatively better in \u2018non-income\u2019 aspects of poverty reduction, whereas India has done relatively well in \u2018income\u2019 aspects. Vietnam can be termed as a \u2018success\u2019, as its performance can be termed as good in both income and non-income aspects of poverty reduction. II. Outputs There will be three sets of outputs from this project \u2013 \u2022 A report on each of the two Stakeholder Consultation, and \u2022 A high-quality report for separate publication as well as to provide inputs for the preparation of the RHDR\u2013 the will be based on the two Stakeholder Consultations, the field survey/research and feedback from a review process.

In addition, there will be some generic questions, so that researchers can steer interviews as per the objective of the project and as the direction of the discussions warrants. As the final report will be analytical and qualitative in nature (not quantitative), the analysis will follow the \u2018endowment-entitlement\u2019 model of \u201cchoice and welfare\u201d theory. Thus, questions will be prepared in a manner so as to derive stakeholders\u2019 feedbacks and perceptions on international trade and its effect on endowment and entitlement sets (including choice) of people and transfer mechanism (terms of trade, commodity prices), so as to understand, in particular, factors leading to \u201ctrade entitlement failures\u201d and also to look at \u2018welfare\u2019 as \u201cfreedom and opportunities\u201d. In doing so, not only income aspects of poverty will be covered, but non-income aspects as well. III. Consultations The two Stakeholder Consultations will be executed by UNDP in partnership with CUTS. In particular, CUTS will be responsible for: \u2022 The identification of stakeholders who will participate in the Consultations; \u2022 Logistical support in organizing the events, with UNDP assuming the main role, with CUTS assuming a secondary role. \u2022 Rapporteruing the Consultations and preparing the report, together with UNDP, on the Consultations. This will be the responsibility of CUTS. ---------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------- \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty \u201d - First Stakeholder Consultation Report, February 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 23 IV. Methodology CUTS-CITEE will engage a Project Manager (for overseeing the project and writing the final report) and three researchers for doing the field research. One researcher will be engaged in South Asia and two in East and South East Asia. The following is the list of project manager and researchers and their brief CVs are enclosed: \u2022 Bipul Chatterjee (Project Manager) \u2022 Parashar Kulkarni (South Asia: Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) \u2022 Purnima Purohit (Mekong Region: Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand and Vietnam) \u2022 Pramod Dev (Rest of the countries: China, Indonesia, Malaysia and The Philippines) Before conducting the field aspect of the work, researchers will be trained on issues to be covered in the project, as well as on methodology of conducting field research (the survey). One aspect of this training is how to conduct field research in an unbiased manner. For example, researchers will be trained that they should not go to the field with preconceived notions but with an open and alert mind. Yet, as in the case of any stakeholder a nalysis, it needs to be emphasized that there will be an element of subjectiveness coming out of stakeholders\u2019 feedbacks and perceptions even though researchers approach the task in an objective manner. The Project Manager and the Project Researchers will participate in both the stakeholder consultations to be organized as part of this work. The field research will be intensive in nature, instead of an extensive questionnaire survey. As research will be based on specific themes/policy issues, purposive sampling technique will be used in selecting the stakeholders. Representative stakeholders will be contacted while selecting the stakeholders in each country. On each themes and sub-themes, there will be questions addressed to the different kinds of stakeholders. For example, in case of \u2018agriculture\u2019 there will be questions addressed to farmers and landless agricultural laborers. Cross-fertilization of views and concerns will be obtained from different stakeholders in order to get better perception on specific issues. For example, researcher will obtain feedbacks from big farmers on the perception expressed by marginal farmers. At another level, different questions will be used for obtaining feedbacks from different sectors. For example, \u201cRural Livelihood and Food Security\u201d issues of stakeholders in the agriculture sector will be different from similar issues of stakeholders in the textiles sector, thus separate questions will be used.

Relevant Experience & Track Record RIS has accumulated considerable experience at the policy level and works in close association with various governmental bodies, research institutions, academicians, policy-makers, business and industry circles in India and abroad. However, its experience at the level of stakeholders seems to be rather limited. Based on our research, RIS does not seem to have a solid networking relationship with CSO, NGOs and other grass root organization. SWATEE has considerable experience in advocacy and the international trade regime. However, its position is anti - WTO, which colors its perspective. Its preoccupation with this issue has to some extent detract from the work it should be doing with grass root organizations. As far as our research shows, SWATEE has never worked with any entity of the UN system. CUTS has worked under UNDP-administered Global Environment Facility and in partnership with the Centre for Environment Education, Ahmedabad, in a Watershed development project in C hitorgarh, Rajasthan.

Since we did not ask this company to submit a proposal, we do not know what its cost would have been. Based on our own work with several knowledge products over the past two years, we are of the opinion that the rates asked by CUTS are reasonable. For example, this proposal compares well with another of our survey \u2013 the BPO. While the latter covers three countries, the CUTS survey will cover 13 countries at a cost comparable to that of the BPO. It seems that the prevailing local rates for this kind of work hovers around this amount. Overall While RIS has some experience working with the UNs, it is not really a grass root organization and is thus unsuitable to our purpose. More importantly, RIS does not seem to be involved with the kid of work that this study contemplates. Since the RHDR is primar ily and advocacy report and is intended to presents the fact surrounding both sides of the fence \u2013 this consideration rules out SWATEE, which, in addition, is involved too heavily with the negotiation aspects of trade. Because is directly involved in the kind of work this study contemplates, it naturally interested us. When price, stability, track record and experience are added, the decision was clear: CUTS should undertake the study.

Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 3 Summary of the First Consultation The first consultation was held on February 23, 2005 at New Delhi. Its main objective was to get feedback on the effects of international trade on employment (more broadly, livelihood) opportunities, inequality, food security, health services within the context of the Millennium Development Goals. The focus of this consultation was on two thematic issues and nine sub-themes: \u2022 Livelihood and food security, with the sub-themes o Agriculture and Food Security, o Fisheries, o Textiles and Clothing, o Tourism, o Economic migration, and o Outsourcing \u2022 Basic services, such as o Health, o Energy, and o Environmental services In both cases, the idea was to understand how an increasingly open multilateral trading regime is affecting people, particularly the poor and marginalised sections of the society. Stakeholders were provided with the opportunity to present their (including the organisations and/or groups that they represent) views, ideas, beliefs, perceptions and experiences. The consultation was structured in a roundtable mode, divided into two sessions (one on livelihood and food security issues and the other on public health services). At the beginning of each of session, a facilitator introduced the relevant issues, which was followed by sharing of knowledge and experience by the stakeholders, including cross-fertilisation of ideas and issues for the field research. UNDP-APRI (UNDP\u2019s Asia-Pacific Regional Human Development Reports Initiative, housed in UNDP\u2019s Regional Centre in Colombo, Sri Lanka) and CUTS- CITEE (CUTS Centre for International Trade, Economics & Environment, Jaipur, India) jointly organised the stakeholder consultations, while CUTS-CITEE conducted the field research and report writing. For the first consultation, CUTS-CITEE identified stakeholders from the following 14 countries of the Asia-Pacific region: \u2022 Bangladesh \u2022 Fiji Islands \u2022 Lao PDR \u2022 Nepal \u2022 Philippines \u2022 Cambodia \u2022 India \u2022 Malaysia \u2022 Pakistan \u2022 Vietnam \u2022 China \u2022 Indonesia \u2022 Sri Lanka \u2022 Thailand Out of the above, representative stakeholders from 10 countries (except China, Fiji Islands, Lao PDR and Pakistan) participated at the first stakeholder consultation.

As the meeting was held with about three weeks\u2019 time for preparation and only one person was invited from each country (except India, which was represented by more than one person), the following factors influenced the selection of stakeholders: \u2022 Whether they can represent more than one sector? \u2022 Whether they can provide some general ideas on international trade and its relationship with human poverty, particularly at the ground level? Whether they have some knowledge on the multilateral trading system or not? Are they working on trade and development issues? \u2022 Whether they are aware of institutions and organisations working on different aspects of international trade and human poverty in sectors relevant to this project in their respective countries?

In order to assist the participants (representative stakeholders) to think about the issues, UNDP-APRI and CUTS-CITEE identified some broad areas for their feedback. This note was distributed prior to the meeting and covered the following issues: Agriculture and Food Security How a more open and liberalised international trading environment is affecting (or has affected) the food security situation in your community/country? How are the poor and marginalised sections of society in your community/country coping with the situation? Are food items readily available and of higher quality (as compared with the past)? Do people have a range of choice (with regard to access to food)? Have prices of food (in particular, staple food) become more affordable now as compared to about two years or so ago? Fisheries Is this an important source of livelihood in your country/community? Has more openness to trade allowed the people dependent on this sector to make a more comfortable living? Textiles and Clothing What will be the structural effects of the end of quota regime on textiles and clothing sector? How will these changes affect marginal workers? Women comprise the majority of the workforce in this sector \u2013 what will be the employment effects on them? Will they be able to find alternative sources of employment?

What coping strategies will the poor adopt or are they adopting? Tourism To what extent is this an important source of livelihood in your country/community? What is the gender balance of the employment created by tourism? Is tourism in your community putting undue stress on the environment? What steps are being taken to expand tourism and create additional employment? Economic Migration To what extent is your household dependent upon remittances from members who have migrated to other countries? In your view, do you think that a more liberalised trading environment has led to more people going abroad in search of work? What are some of the issues that returnees (migrants who have returned from abroad) face in their attempt to reintegrate into the society? Outsourcing Is outsourcing a significant source of livelihood in your country/community? Is the quality of employment (in terms of conditions of work and reward for work done) in this sector better than alternative sources of employment? What is the gender balance of employment in this sector? Health What are major constraints of public health services in your country/community? What would be the possible impact of intellectual property rights regime on the provision of public health services to the poor? What policy measures are to be adopted for better access and delivery of public health services by and to the poor? Is public-private partnership a possible measure for better delivery of public health services to the poor? Energy Do you think that international trade has had an impact on access to energy services (electricity, cooking gas, other kinds of fuel for cooking, etc)? Has it increased the burden of women? Environmental Services Do you think that there is connection between a more liberalised trade regime and further environmental degradation? Who are affected most by environmental degradation? What measures are being taken to cope with this problem in your country/community? While representative stakeholders were urged for their perceptions on the above- stated issues, they were also requested to provide feedback on the following general issues: Supply and Demand Side Effects What would be the possible supply (of inputs, labour, working capital) and demand side (marketing, prices of produce) effects of a more open international trading system?

It was difficult to fix prior appointments with primary stakeholders due to the nature of their spread. Hence the method employed was to follow the leads from key contacts, secondary stakeholders, and other informants. Due to the paucity of time, it was decided between UNDP and CUTS-CITEE that in each country 10-12 stakeholders will be interviewed and three-fourth among them were to be primary stakeholders. It was also decided that, wherever possible each primary stakeholder (especially the poorer ones) will be interviewed on at least two sub-themes viz. one relating to the stakeholder\u2019s livelihood and rest on her/his access to basic services. This was also thought to be a better way to understand the overall impact of changes in different sectors. The following factors were taken into account while selecting stakeholders for the research: \u2022 relationship with \u2018key\u2019 contacts; \u2022 relevance, willingness and gender of the stakeholder; \u2022 balance of stakeholders representing different sectors; \u2022 ability to interact in English except in countries where there was assistance from interpreters; \u2022 ability to provide feedback and perception on issues discussed; \u2022 availability for spending time with field researchers; and \u2022 location: in and around the capital city of a country. Before starting the field research, an informal training for field researchers was organised at CUTS-CITEE. Field research started in the third week of April 2005 and covered 13 countries identified in the First Stakeholder Consultation. On average, a field researcher spent five days in one country. A total of 160 stakeholders were interviewed achieving 75 per cent target. The ratio between primary and secondary stakeholders was 60:40. Despite best efforts, there was a gender skewedness towards males in the sample group. In South Asia, except in India, the number of women interviewed is much less than the men. Though in textile and clothing the percentage of total female stakeholders interviewed was almost double of the men. Methodological Issues \u2022 In general primary stakeholders could not draw out the linkages between international trade and poverty, as they were not aware about macro issues. There was a general lack of understanding among the primary stakeholders about the channels of trade they deal with. Hence, it was not strange correlation that almost all stakeholders were not unaware of possible gains under increasing openness. \u2022 There was difficulty to set a single questionnaire directed at primary stakeholders of all the countries, especially when there are complex micro level socio-political and economic inter-linkages responsible for poverty. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 9 \u2022 There were cultural issues involved while asking some important questions on poverty. \u2022 Stakeholders generally preferred the conversation mode rather than strict adherence to direct questioning. Sometimes field researchers had to set aside questionnaires and get onto conversation to get responses. \u2022 There is an inherent demerit of following a single structured questionnaire when both primary and secondary stakeholders were to be interviewed. The questionnaire was targeted at the primary stakeholders; but many issues and terms were unknown to them. Since the questionnaire was directed at the primary stakeholders many of the questions were not relevant to secondary stakeholders, and had to be reformulated. \u2022 It was difficult to effectively capture the range of non-economic aspects that influence human development through a structured questionnaire. The conversational mode of data collection was a better tool. The following were some practical issues faced by field researchers while conducting the field research: \u2022 Time: interaction with more number of stakeholders (in particular, primary stakeholders and in places other than in and around the capital city of the respective countries, i.e.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6d44783b-ed28-4147-b1e5-9142a68cc79b": {"__data__": {"id_": "6d44783b-ed28-4147-b1e5-9142a68cc79b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-second-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Linkages between International Trade and Human Poverty Second Stakeholder Perception Workshop Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-second-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "21eac8e67504aa92d53f853e99444533a2e7201cbcc4c123a2a0b85b34c741aa"}, "2": {"node_id": "0886639b-2dbd-44a1-8d2a-c8caa1c70f2e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-second-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7a13d40bfbbf7544b446d18f9e32ce6a6d61c212a8999f0163816c5574e8f7eb"}}, "hash": "55ee3f5fc9435a0858b3994366fa577f66cad69937f020b20a18d36c2061811e", "text": "in hinterlands, where, in some countries, poverty is much more concentrated) would have been possible if there was more time for field research.

Some of the interviews especially with stakeholders who have lost out were highly emotional. It was very difficult to control emotions and not to give hope or quell their hope. A general trend was that stakeholders who have lost out due to the impact of trade were generally forthcoming in their opinions. Whereas those who have benefited from trade were reluctant to divulge details. It affected the ability to better understand positive impact of trade. \u2022 Access: in some countries, access to stakeholders was not good. This was due to several reasons \u2013 language being a major one and interpreters were not available in all cases and all the time. In some other cases (particularly, in sectors like \u2018textiles and clothing,\u2019 with respect to \u2018migration\u2019), employers denied full access to primary stakeholders, besides adopting rent-seeking attitudes. \u2022 Availability: in some countries and in case of some sectors, primary stakeholders were not available at the time of the field research. Though field researchers did not adhere to \u201cworking hours\u201d while conducting the field research, in some cases the timing of interaction did clash with the \u2018engagement\u2019 of primary stakeholders with their day-to-day \u2018livelihood\u2019 concerns. In some countries, it appears that the \u2018civil society\u2019 is underdeveloped and thus, the \u2018environment\u2019 in which it was being conducted affected the field research. \u2022 Selective distortion: in some cases respondents were giving their views and opinions in a manner, which was biased towards his/her circumstances. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 10 Preparation of Data and Analysis After the field research was over, all questionnaires addressing a particular sector/issue from all 13 countries were \u2018pooled\u2019 together for analysing stakeholders\u2019 feedback and perceptions on \u2018linkages between international trade and human poverty\u2019 so that the analysis did not suffer from either a \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 or a \u2018one- type-fits-all\u2019 approach. The analysis followed a descriptive method for interpretation. Since the stakeholders were unable to demarcate the impact of trade in clear terms, the findings on human development impact were drawn by linking and corroborating different experiences of stakeholders with the responses to questions. Additional information provided by the stakeholders was helpful in revealing the complex linkages between international trade and human poverty. Since the data collected cannot form a credible representative sample, generalisation of findings was avoided. The findings are, therefore, presented as examples of stakeholders\u2019 experiences and perceptions. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 11 Deliberations The second stakeholder consultation was held during 1-3 June 2005. The methodology for selecting stakeholder-participants for this consultation was similar to the first consultation, except that at the second consultation, three stakeholder- participants were invited from each of the 13 countries where the field research was conducted. While one of them was the \u2018key\u2019 contact in respective countries, the following factors were taken into consideration for selecting the other \u2018two\u2019: \u2022 good mix of primary and secondary (representative) stakeholders and other experts; \u2022 stakeholders identified during the field survey. \u2022 balance between different sectors (including some cross-cutting participants, i.e. who can represent different sectors); \u2022 gender balance; and \u2022 ability to take forward the results of this consultation (including conducting some more field research, if required) and the study to respective countries. The specific objectives of the consultation were: \u2022 Present work-in-progress on the different chapters of RHDR and obtain stakeholder perspectives on the two-way linkages between international trade, wages and employment, poverty, inequality, sustainability and ultimately human development, focusing on key aspects/sectors of international trade that are of relevance and of emerging importance to the Asia-Pacific region.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee471536-0252-4f3a-9f3f-9ee32daa4cfb": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee471536-0252-4f3a-9f3f-9ee32daa4cfb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-second-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Linkages between International Trade and Human Poverty Second Stakeholder Perception Workshop Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-second-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "755831208616e0034405375a355f749c41cb499ad5b63e176ad6b938a84eefdd"}, "2": {"node_id": "ef3109b1-0ded-4db3-aa8d-8465ae15dd02", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-second-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d83d546a3059e5230f55b59c8970b8ce7ead5ddca6eb5a957477158ca83f1f86"}}, "hash": "23536613bd8b7b44b4b9dade389513da074fde22ec61d5214dc9f0b12c73759c", "text": "\u2022 Obtain feedback on the field research regarding \u2013 o the methodology employed o the principal findings \u2013 both general and theme/sub-theme specific o the differences and areas of agreements among different stakeholders as regards the findings of the field research to the extent that they have implications for poverty reduction and human development \u2022 Obtain ideas for identification of key messages for national and international policy and opinion makers.

There are many \u2018invisible\u2019 people who get affected by trade even though they are not active participants in the process of trade. \u2022 Positive effects are not automatic \u2013 they may have to be engineered through policy. \u2022 Trade is not about WTO agreements. The larger concept is how might its potential advantages affect human development The consultation was structured around the themes of the proposed RHDR. The emphasis was on receiving feedback on the preliminary findings of the various chapters of the RHDR and the field research. The outcomes of the two stakeholder consultations and the findings of the field research are presented in subsequent chapters. Summary discussion of the Field Research The following presents in detail the discussions and deliberations on the findings of the Field Research carried out after the First Consultation in February 2005. to a great extent it represents the summary and recommendations of the research and contributes towards the Regional Human Development Report on International Trade and Human Poverty. At the outset of the consultation the participants emphasised the following: \u2022 There is a need to ensure that the positive effects of trade be engineered through policy interventions. It is not only trade policies that are important but also domestic policies with respect to health, education, agriculture etc. The policies should be coherent at the domestic, regional and international levels. \u2022 The multidimensional aspect of poverty has to be borne in mind. Poverty is beyond lack of income. Social and cultural aspects are equally important. There is need to empower and mobilise people pulling themselves out of the poverty trap. The need for a clear grasp of the definition of \u201cempowerment\u201d. \u2022 Reversal of policy-making processes may be necessary for better representation and participation of less well-off sections of society. \u2022 The positive case studies within the Asia-Pacific region need to be mentioned in order to compare and contrast situations. Review of history vis-\u00e0-vis present cases to establish relationships. \u2022 Trade has various strong as well as subtle linkages with the rest of the economy that need to be discussed. \u2022 It has to be seen how trade can serve as a means to achieve developmental goals, and not be an end in itself. \u2022 The timing of the meeting was also emphasised. It was felt that the issues have to be put across before the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference. It was felt that the messages should be put across clearly so that the interests of the developing countries vis-\u00e0-vis the developed countries can be safeguarded. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 13 The key messages that came into focus after the introductory discussions are: \u2022 Markets cannot take care of the inequalities as unequal partners in trade appropriate unequal gains from trade. \u2022 Human development has to become centre stage in all policy interventions. Improvements in quality of life are important. \u201cDemystification of trade\u201d has to become mainstream. \u2022 The interests of smaller countries need to be considered vis-\u00e0-vis the larger countries. \u2022 Need to look beyond quantitative data. It has to be taken as a starting point. Surveys, research and investigations need to capture the qualitative aspect of data. Both types of data are important to arrive at meaningful policy intervention policies. International Trade and Human Development: Two-way Relation This session highlighted the following main points: \u2022 Human development can be grouped into four facets: Empowerment, Productivity, Equity and Sustainability. \u2022 Countries can follow policies that are either human development lopsided or economic growth lopsided. \u2022 The following needs to be considered while evaluating trade policy and its outcomes on human development: o Livelihood and employment o Rural incomes and food security o Access to basic services o Social resources for investment o Technological upgrading and innovation o Gender relations \u2022", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "665b2d63-8f6f-4edd-8b16-4c6c324471da": {"__data__": {"id_": "665b2d63-8f6f-4edd-8b16-4c6c324471da", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-second-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Linkages between International Trade and Human Poverty Second Stakeholder Perception Workshop Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-second-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0d516977311b79b34aa39523542321427f72d91c07cca5c9ae0a182722d6d656"}, "3": {"node_id": "58cc92a2-74f1-4641-852a-2de925085994", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-second-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d4f6a2835d5c83bf6bff2ee8d1c09a0bbdd7f95483ecd742fe1a6e79bfaa74e1"}}, "hash": "036ac8e15a0adb9036bd48e6a1e4edf910cd40e7a7630efff4b29cc8855f55d4", "text": "The key challenges that are faced are: o Can trade continue to play a positive role in human development? o Can state play a strategic role in managing external trade? o Can a domestic private sector emerge? o Is the current system dependent on low cost labour? o Can trade extend beyond its direct benefits for human development through economic growth by expanding choices and enhancing capabilities for sustainable betterment of people\u2019s lives? According to the discussant of this session, a conceptual framework was to be evolved to study the link between trade and human development. It is necessary to put growth in the trade and human development perspective. Also, the importance of public action needs to be recognised for trade to affect human development. The conditions through which growth leads to higher human development need to be specified. Moreover, higher productivity in agriculture is a prerequisite to ensure integration through trade. The floor discussions pointed out to the following issues and concerns: \u2022 Conceptual framework has to be linked to the actual experiences of Asia- Pacific countries. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 14 \u2022 Trade policies should not be entirely based on commercial objectives but should also incorporate social and human development objectives. \u2022 Growth process and policies should also improve the quality of life. \u2022 Trade policy needs to be clearly defined. Need for expansion of definition of trade policy so as to study the disaggregated effects of policy on human development. \u2022 Need to go beyond pro-poor growth to pro-poor development in the conceptual framework. \u2022 Issues of financing of development and transfer of technology in relation to trade need to be stressed upon. \u2022 Countries should consider cooperative efforts to respond to trade agreements, which have negative human development consequences. What the Data Say? The next presentation was on data and its analysis in order to examine regional and sectoral trends of human development index (HDI) and trade. The analysis was based on data on 39 countries over the period 1970 to 2002. The main findings of data pointed towards the following facts: \u2022 Growth trends: Asia-Pacific Region has grown faster than other developing regions; South Asia has grown faster than East Asia and Pacific in terms of GDP growth but not in terms of Per Capita GDP; LDCs in Asia Pacific have grown faster than all LDCs. \u2022 Trade trends: Trade has grown faster in East Asia and Pacific as compared to South Asia; imports have grown faster than exports in South Asia; \u2022 Human development trends: East Asia and South Asia lag behind other developing countries with respect to many Human Development Indicators; poverty has fallen more rapidly in East Asia and Pacific though growth has been higher in South Asia; Latin America and Caribbean have done better in HDI, HPI (Human Poverty Index?) and GDI (Gender-Related Development Index?) than EAP and South Asia; the degrees of improvements in HDI have varied across countries. \u2022 Correlation between trade and HDI: Trade and HDI had high correlation in 1990 (0.66) but this declined steadily by 2002 (0.55); correlation between exports and HDI (0.65) is higher than that between imports and HDI (0.56), exports and HDI are more correlated in LDCs than in DCs, correlation between imports and HDI in LDCs has steadily fallen. However it is important to analyse individual country experiences of growth in trade and HDI to arrive at more meaningful policy implications. \u2022 Sectoral trends: Agriculture is a predominant sector in terms of employment generation in both DCs and LDCs though the growth rate has been falling since late 80s in most DCs and LDCs; agricultural exports and imports have declined in DCs; trade in manufacturing and services sectors has been increasing; important to conduct sectoral studies to analyse the impact on sectoral trade on HDI.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "58cc92a2-74f1-4641-852a-2de925085994": {"__data__": {"id_": "58cc92a2-74f1-4641-852a-2de925085994", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-second-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Linkages between International Trade and Human Poverty Second Stakeholder Perception Workshop Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-second-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0d516977311b79b34aa39523542321427f72d91c07cca5c9ae0a182722d6d656"}, "2": {"node_id": "665b2d63-8f6f-4edd-8b16-4c6c324471da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-second-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "036ac8e15a0adb9036bd48e6a1e4edf910cd40e7a7630efff4b29cc8855f55d4"}}, "hash": "d4f6a2835d5c83bf6bff2ee8d1c09a0bbdd7f95483ecd742fe1a6e79bfaa74e1", "text": "By looking at the data, the following conclusions and implications can be drawn: \u2022 trade does not necessarily lead to improvement in human development and a decline in poverty; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 15 \u2022 exports are more correlated to HDI than imports; \u2022 correlation is higher in LDCs than DCs; \u2022 there is a need to analyse data further, to arrive at policy interventions: o country level studies are required to analyse the role of policy in this relationship, o important to estimate sectoral employment elasticities of trade, and o conduct sector specific studies to analyse the impact", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "430c3186-5d6b-4103-a10e-da65c4588242": {"__data__": {"id_": "430c3186-5d6b-4103-a10e-da65c4588242", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-second-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Linkages between International Trade and Human Poverty Second Stakeholder Perception Workshop Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-second-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8db69f806f7971500fe8e856ccaffe00269f59b54ad2d8646230df5bb7befe03"}}, "hash": "8db69f806f7971500fe8e856ccaffe00269f59b54ad2d8646230df5bb7befe03", "text": "of trade on HDI. The floor discussions after the presentation pointed to concerns of data consistency and analysis. The following issues were raised: \u2022 The use of correlation to study the extent of relationship between indicators was questioned. Also, attention was pointed towards possibility of spurious correlation and problem of endogeneity. \u2022 Need to do a further analysis to examine the underlying reasons for correlations between exports, imports and HDI. \u2022 Trade volume is not the only important factor for trade policy. Other issues, which are not directly related give examples? are also important for policy formulation. \u2022 Comparison of HDI overtime was questionable. However, it was clarified that the HDI indicators used were comparable taking into account methodology over time. \u2022 The need to capture informal and across-border trade was stressed upon. It was pointed out that in many countries, this type of trade was a significant proportion of overall trade. \u2022 For the effect of trade on HDI, it is also important to find out the beneficiaries of international trade. \u2022 Use of consumer price index for a proxy of poverty was suggested as inflation plays a major role in determining the extent of poverty by affecting real incomes. \u2022 Exchange rate has to be taken into consideration if trade is defined within the context of exports and imports. \u2022 Use of common trade policies to analyse trends. Promoting Rural Livelihoods and Food Security In the Asia-Pacific region, there is a great diversity in the share of agriculture as a percentage of GDP between countries, with Laos at 52 per cent and Korea at 6 per cent. Generally, at lower levels of GDP the significance of agriculture in the economy is higher. This means that distortions in world agriculture trade have the largest impact on the poorest countries in Asia. It is in this context that the next presentation focused on the effect of trade on agriculture and fisheries. The importance of agriculture in developing countries is through two main channels: \u2022 Importance in deriving income growth and employment generation. \u2022 Importance for food security. The trends in international trade in developing countries points to the following: \u2022 Developed countries are natural exporters of agricultural commodities. \u2022 LDCs are involved in trade, but mainly in those areas where benefits are small or negligible. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 16 \u2022 Developing countries could lose out in their export areas and be adversely affected in their import dependent areas, especially food. The presentation pointed out the following concerns for the developing countries in the area of international trade in agriculture: \u2022 Unequal concessions to developing and developed countries: While concerns of the developed are consistently addressed, the only special concession being provided to developing countries in this area is a longer implementation period. \u2022 Concessions to developing countries for Special Products impinging on issues of rural development, livelihood security and food security is left undefined. \u2022 In sum, the concern in the agricultural area during the framework stage has been to take on board the sensitivities of the developed countries, particularly the European Union, while postponing any special specification relating to the developing countries. The discussions pointed towards the importance of agriculture in developing countries and need to strengthen this sector for maximising gains from liberalisation: \u2022 Food security issue needs greater attention. It can be discussed in terms of: availability, access and constraints. The issue of food security has not been given adequate attention. The issue of sustainability of food security under the current trade regime has to be borne to mind. \u2022 Nutritional value of food is an important determinant affecting poverty in developing countries. Healthy individuals can benefit from increased opportunities from trade. \u2022 Farmers need better infrastructure and cheaper credit facilities in most of the developing countries. \u2022 The increase of TNCs in agricultural trade has impacted small farmers adversely. There has been shift from food crops to cash crops, change in consumption patterns and introduction of genetically modified (GM) foods. These factors affect livelihood. \u2022 Many problems in the agricultural sector are due to domestic policies and not necessarily trade policy. Call for domestic policy reforms. \u2022 Need to negotiate that developed countries bring down agricultural subsidies. \u2022 Need to deal with trans-border activities such as illegal smuggling which distorts import prices. \u2022 The changing consumption trends from biotechnology Human Development Issues in Generating and Sustaining Employment This session touched upon human development issues in generating and sustaining employment.

The common issues relevant to all these sectors are: employment potential, powerful HD outcomes especially for women, capability to expand the base of tradable. The presentations emphasised the following issues and concerns of human development in these sectors: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 17 \u2022 HD challenges in T&C: exploitative work conditions, despite legislation; gender based wage disparities where women are usually lower-paid and employed in lower-skilled jobs; foregone employment and income opportunities in countries adversely impacted by quotas. \u2022 Short-term economic migration: the positive HD outcomes include opportunity to improve quality of life; female empowerment \u2013 effects on family; remittances are a major source of foreign exchange, revenue for capital and consumption and poverty alleviation; skills and knowledge transfer and externalities. There are negative outcomes, which include increases in income disparities; exploitative conditions for workers - especially women; loss of skills in sending countries and negative externalities. \u2022 Outsourcing: employment and income-creating potential; skills and knowledge transfer; resource generation; externalities and other social and cultural implications. \u2022 Tourism: focus on tourism that generates net benefits to the poor; approach to tourism development; not a specific product or niche sector; may benefit the poor as well as non-poor; strategies focus on increasing opportunities for poor and not only expanding the overall size of the sector The following policy recommendations were suggested for these sectors for better human development: \u2022 Need to mitigate negative impacts on HD: creation of decent work by enforcing realistic legislation, formulation of responsible closure policies of restructuring and retraining; special focus on women workers. \u2022 Foster International Competition: to enable infrastructure investments, especially? in physical and social a word missing?; fiscal incentives to be given \u2022 Need to deepen market access: trade agreements to protect policy space, pursue tariff reductions and enable more market access; regional integration to pursue south-south trade and special policy measures for LDCs \u2022 Policy options for migration: protection of workers\u2019 rights; support for family welfare and reintegration; easy transfer of resources and technology; promotion of desirable migration; international, bilateral and regional agreements; more cooperation between labour exporting and importing countries; \u2022 Policy options for tourism: government in tourism to operate on more professional basis, provision of more data on tourism for easy analysis; reduction in entry barriers and permissions required; need to implement accountability/transparency to tackle red tape and bureaucracy; develop indicators for each process to measure objectives e.g. key performance indicators; minimise negative effects of tourism; develop infrastructure facilities and train and impart skills for tourism purposes. The discussions reiterated the important and significant role that these emerging sectors can play in improving conditions of people. These sectors have an enormous potential to generate employment and create opportunities whereby a larger section of society can gain from increased opportunities. \u2022 It was felt that the concept of pro-poor tourism was not clear from the presentation. \u2022 Pro-poor tourism depends on comparative advantage of destination ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 18 \u2022 Though it was realised that these sectors have a positive impact, however, individual country cases pointed out the negative impacts of these new sectors. These negative impacts were mainly in the form of changing social norms and attitudes. Women in T&C sectors had varied reactions across countries. \u2022 It was felt that imposition of quantitative limits on exports based on performance of past exporters spawns problems, especially for those who were not initially members. \u2022 It was felt that due to large movements of labour, labour laws needed to be devised and enforced for migrant workers also. \u2022 The negative impacts of outsourcing jobs were discussed. Attention was drawn to cases of racial discrimination and abuse. \u2022 The issue of sustainable development and environment were raised, as there is a trade off involved while developing tourism. The discussion ended with a word of caution on the implications on labour \u2013 migrant, farmers, female labour \u2013 of the changing work profile and nature of work. It was strongly felt that these changes should be backed by stronger legislations to improve conditions of workers.

The argument in favour of GATS is that since the services sector is the largest and fastest-growing sector of the world economy, providing more than 60 per cent of global output and in many countries an even larger share of employment, the lack of a legal framework for international services trade was anomalous and dangerous: anomalous because the potential benefits of services liberalisation are at least as great as in the goods sector, and dangerous because there was no legal basis on which to resolve conflicting national interests. The presentation highlighted the issues in access of environment, energy and health through the HD lens. Furthermore, issues took on both rural as well as urban perspective. It also outlined the structure of GATS and drew attention to specific concerns for countries of AP. It pointed out that there are policy options that can be exercised within GATS and outside it, at national levels. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 19 The following observations were made: \u2022 Glaring gaps in \u201cservices poverty\u201d \u2013 inequity in access, affordability; opportunity for jobs & growth \u2022 Need for domestic regulations and policy reforms \u2022 Need for heavy public and private investments attached with social obligations; role of foreign participation in provision of these services \u2022 Look for approaches within and outside GATS; strategic responses to negotiating requests \u2022 Policy thrust: ensure access at affordable prices to the poor The following policy options were suggested for the countries of Asia-Pacific: \u2022 Human development is directly related to water and sanitation? (W&S), energy and health issues. \u2022 Prudence over ideology to court private investment. \u2022 Unilaterally, innovative leveraging of FDI to honor social obligations on access and affordability. \u2022 AP countries should use GATS flexibility to negotiate strategically. \u2022 Seek win-win outcomes. The discussant of the session reiterated the importance of basic services in achieving MDGs. The important goal should be to ensure \u2018affordable\u2019 services to the millions in Asia and Pacific. This calls for huge investments and need for foreign direct investment (FDI). The challenge then would be to find the balance between attracting FDI and fulfilling social obligations. There is also a need to explore private-public participation models for provision of basic services and replicate successful models. The following issues deserve greater attention: \u2022 Linking health, water and sanitation issues \u2022 Tourism sector is an emerging sector in many countries of Asia-Pacific. \u2022 Intellectual property rights: patents are important issues. \u2022 AIDS is a major threat, which requires huge levels of expenditure. \u2022 Subsidies in provision of basic services: it has been seen as to how much government loses out due to failed projects in basic services. In addition to the above, floor discussions raised further concerns: \u2022 The question is how to provide basic services: whether through GATS framework vs. non-GATS framework? \u2022 The sequencing of private investment is important in electricity services: generation, transmission and distribution are three steps in provision of electricity. Which of these should be privatised and what incentives should be given to the private operators? \u2022 Judicial activism has played an important role in the way services are provided in India. Similar role of judiciary in other countries has to be examined. \u2022 The issue of brain drain has to be addressed. \u2022 A distinction has to be made between permanent and short term migration \u2022 Public opinion is important in the provision of basic services as these determine the quality of life of the population. \u2022 The effects of pluralism have to be borne in mind while opening up basic service sectors to private players.

Also, it has to be borne in mind that trade is not a panacea; it can be used only as a means to solve the problems, not an end in itself. GATS has to be confronted with indigenous, unilateral, bilateral and multilateral approaches. Trade Liberalisation and Employment The next presentation emphasised the relationship between trade liberalisation and employment by bringing out emerging issues and shedding light on evidence. \u2022 Key issues: jobless growth in the manufacturing sector, intensification of informal employment and the limited success of liberalisation in some countries while others did not benefit. \u2022 Evidence points to the following facts: o The impact of trade liberalisation on employment generation and poverty reduction has been ambiguous. o Trade has direct as well as indirect links with poverty. o Short-run vs. long-run: while the short run impact has been negative, there have been gains in long run. o Domestic economic policies and production/consumption patterns of a country are a key factor in determining the impact of trade on employment. o Unequal distribution of benefits of trade liberalisation o Trade liberalisation accompanied by macro policies at national levels. o Varying impact: Net impact on employment depends on political and social factors and varies from country to country and period to period. \u2022 A study of employment elasticities points to the following: o Low employment elasticity in most Asian countries (below 0.40). o Agriculture is no more the refuge sector for the unemployed. o Rather, the service sector emerging as the refuge sector (except possibly in Sri Lanka & India). o Employment elasticity of manufacturing declined in post-liberalisation period. o In 18 out of 28 industries considered, rate of employment growth was higher in the \u201990s than in the \u201980s at the three-digit level. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 21 Based on these findings, two major conclusions can be drawn: \u2022 Trade Liberalisation needs to be coherent with other macro reforms, particularly industrial and exchange rate policies because real exchange rate has appreciated in recent years. \u2022 Successful export promotion requires a range of complementary policies, the most important of which relate to infrastructure and credit provision. The suggestions and issues raised after the presentation can be summarised as following: \u2022 Need to discuss issues of unemployment and underemployment in greater detail. \u2022 Liberalisation has had adverse impact on labour and employment in many countries. Privatised industrial sector does not offer adequate employment generation opportunities. Agriculture in developing countries still absorbs surplus labour. \u2022 Trade has impacted not only employment but also wages. Effect on real wages is important in determining outcomes for human development. \u2022 Exploitation of labour is a major concern. This calls for labour reforms. \u2022 Training of labour and market access needs to be ensured for higher efficiency of labour. The service sector has many access barriers, for example level of literacy. \u2022 Existence of working poor is a common phenomenon in AP. It is necessary for employment to provide a minimum living wage for employment employees to have a sufficient positive impact on human development. The case of non- remunerative employment is more prevailing in agriculture and services, less in the manufacturing sector. \u2022 Gender-based differential in wages leads to adverse working conditions. Women are often paid less and made to work longer hours. Though trade liberalisation has opened new avenues for women employment, it has made working conditions worse than before. \u2022 Jobless growth, worsening work conditions and low productivity of labour are important impediments of growth and better standards of living. \u2022 Domestic policies reforms are also important along with trade policies. \u2022 Foreign Direct Investment cannot be overlooked when dealing with employment generation. Field Research: Methodological and Practical Issues Though the data was yet to be collated (at the time of presentation) and analysed to arrive at specific conclusions, the presentation pointed towards broad and general issues that needed to be discussed in the trade-human development relationship. The composition of stakeholders would also be revealed when data had been processed.

Field research was an innovative way of capturing perspectives across countries and then analysing data to study how trade has impacted human development. The floor discussions pointed out the following concerns about the methodology, sample size and analysis: \u2022 Generalised analysis: it was felt that the analysis did not seem to follow directly from the data. A cautionary note was that too much generalisation should be avoided as the sample size was too small. Data should account for specific economic and political situation to avoid generalising. How data was analysed would give grounds to the message imparted. \u2022 Nomenclature: It was also pointed out that it could not be called a survey as the sample size was too small. Different nomenclatures were suggested like interview, investigation, perspective, and anecdotes. \u2022 Limitations of field research: these included: ability of the researchers to understand the local conditions, format of questionnaires, language barriers. One conclusion from the investigations pointed out that the respondents did not have a macro picture and could not see obvious linkages between trade and HD. It was also suggested that the data be analysed to bring out the gender profile, work profile of stakeholders. Also, the social and cultural factors are important and should get reflected in the analysis. \u2022 In-built bias of data: the general assumption is that people do not make rationale choices. Moreover, choices are made on social and other important factors, not only economic. Findings should be packaged appropriately to highlight specific issues. Data to be used as a launch pad for further survey and research. What Could be the Main Messages of the RHDR? The session aimed to draw main messages for the UNDP\u2019s RHDR on International Trade and Human Poverty. It was pointed out that the UNDP\u2019s human development reports are advocacy documents, which aim to draw attention of varied people like economists, policy makers, general public and media. HDRs should be neither too academic nor too journalistic. Human development issues are the key focus areas and data analysis should break new grounds without losing the trade aspect. The RHDR on International Trade and Human Poverty aims to answer the following: \u2022 Who are the winners and losers from trade? \u2022 Which specific Asian countries have high growth and no jobs - and why? \u2022 Which countries have high growth with new jobs creation and why? \u2022 Which countries can show that trade has been good for human development? \u2022 Which countries show the opposite and the reasons? While suggesting key messages, the following issues have to be considered: \u2022 What is being advocated- internationally as well as nationally? \u2022 How to ensure that regional trade be more equitable? \u2022 Policy interventions at national and local levels. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 23 The aim of the session was to identify five to eight key messages for the RHDR on International Trade and Human Poverty. The participants were requested to suggest short and specific messages and provide possible policy options. Some of the key issues, especially from the point of view of dissemination, identified were as follows: \u2022 Highlight contradictions, paradoxes. Use contrasts and comparisons to clarify main points. \u2022 Need to raise issues; indicate options; suggest ways of avoiding mistakes; search for solutions that are realistic, practical and feasible; and disseminate knowledge of good practices. \u2022 Trade RHDR should influence policy makers, perhaps change lives for the better. \u2022 Clarity of words: Say what you mean and mean what you say. Need to use sharp and crisp statements. \u2022 Jargon to be reduced/ avoided; abbreviations to be explained. \u2022 Need to be simple: not simplistic: points to be made strongly. \u2022 Trade RHDR should demystify concepts, rules of WTO. \u2022 Need to create \u2018news\u2019 to attract media attention.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e2211fbf-64bf-4632-b329-5b9f5adf30dc": {"__data__": {"id_": "e2211fbf-64bf-4632-b329-5b9f5adf30dc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-second-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Linkages between International Trade and Human Poverty Second Stakeholder Perception Workshop Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-second-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0c39665ad617f9320e9d36eeb59213ff4e69d74364889c4a502834c5726ac828"}, "2": {"node_id": "d29845ca-b52b-45d0-9a54-77ea9ef6c7cd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-second-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eed63b9dfaa746412c7c8713326594198cf7df6f28afaa91a31346a1ce140ebe"}}, "hash": "6840ef7c73cadca4c5543942a103fb0bbb881f26cfa87bc0e5870b0010e101c7", "text": "\u2022 Need to create \u2018news\u2019 to attract media attention.

Employment effect of increasing exposure to openness through international trade has been embedded while analysing the above-stated impact.i The finding presented here cannot be generalised or taken to represent credible patterns. This is due to the limited sample size and the nature (perception analysis) of the research. However, they are real life experiences and indicators of ground realities. Many findings conform to and reiterate the knowledge of the existing literature. But there are a few significant observations and experiences of stakeholders that may go against the findings of existing literature. For instance the findings of this study on the impact of abolitions of quotas on women and how it affect human development of the female stakeholders, do vary from the findings in the existing literature. Agriculture: Down, but not out In the countries of the Asia Pacific region, human development impact of trade is very high in the agriculture sector. This is due to the large number of people dependent on it and the backwardness of this sector. Though the share of agriculture in the national economies of the region is decreasing progressively, the sector still remains very important for the poor stakeholders in terms of employment and livelihood. Agriculture remains a cultural activity for many of the poor stakeholders in the region. It is observed that, even when they find it difficult to continue with farming, they do not leave the profession completely. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 26 In agriculture, the negative impacts of trade are more than the positives. Moreover, the changes occurring in this sector have considerably impacted the trade and human poverty linkages in other sectors studied under this research, except for outsourcing. The minor changes in the sector and resultant job losses create huge pressures on the jobs in other sectors. The impact trade has on the stakeholders of this sector vary within and across the countries of the region, and the outcomes at times defy a pattern. In general, the stakeholders of the agriculture sector think that trade has a considerable negative impact on them, and there is a greater chance now of people becoming poor and hungry. The destination of trade in food and cash crops show an important difference. In the case of food items intra-regional trade is high, and a large part of the produce is consumed within the region itself. Whereas the cash crops are traded mainly in the world market; even though countries of the region compete with each other in the global market. Impact on human poverty The impact of trade on human poverty in the agriculture sector manifests itself in many ways, both economic and non-economic. The human development impact is less discernible in terms of the realised positive impacts. On the other hand, the human development impact of negative effects are more observable from the stakeholder responses. The impact is often multi-dimensional, with specific impact bringing about both positive and negative effects on the human development of stakeholders. This often leads to difficulty in understanding clearly the real impact of overall trade openness on individual stakeholders and groups. For instance, the impact of trade openness on the subsistence farmers as producers and consumers may be different at times as the discussion in the following sections show. Therefore though an effort has been made to identify the beneficiaries and losers as the direct result of trade in each sector, wherever it was clear, the multiple impacts on the stakeholders are also described. At times, the impact of trade in a particular sector cannot be identified as either negative or positive. For example, international trade has increased the opportunities of smaller agricultural countries like Cambodia, with limited domestic infrastructure for value addition, to export their surpluses. Cambodia exports husk rice and fruits to Thailand and Vietnam, where they are processed and re-exported, including to Cambodia. This nonetheless discourages the development of domestic food processing industry; but benefits the rural farmers even though they are more exposed to international markets now. One of the most important repercussions of openness to trade in the agriculture sector, according to one stakeholder, is that \u201cagriculture has become a speculative business now\u201d, from being a traditionally stable source", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7ed707b0-376a-4173-a116-d2874d19cd6c": {"__data__": {"id_": "7ed707b0-376a-4173-a116-d2874d19cd6c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-second-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Linkages between International Trade and Human Poverty Second Stakeholder Perception Workshop Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-second-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dee448650552776bb7d4d3ba48091cfc1ae432a90addb66a48d4fbbf3192ea72"}}, "hash": "dee448650552776bb7d4d3ba48091cfc1ae432a90addb66a48d4fbbf3192ea72", "text": "of income. This particular change has acted as a catalyst for many of the negative impacts that have been experienced by stakeholders in this sector. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 27 Positive impact The positive impact of trade on agricultural stakeholders is visible only in a few countries and in the case of a few crops. Benefits from trade accrued to a few cash crops like oil palm cultivation in Malaysia; and to a lesser extent in Indonesia. Openness to trade has also benefited stakeholders who shifted to newer and exquisite/alien crops like different varieties of fruits. But the past experiences show that these benefits are accruing largely due to the gap in current demand and instability of supply; and the gains may be temporary. In the case of food crops trade has benefited the stakeholders in a few countries. Bucking the trend in the rest of Asia Pacific, the rice farmers of Vietnam and Thailand have done well under increasing openness to trade. However, their success has affected the rice farmers in neighbouring countries like Indonesia and Philippines. Negative impact Size matters The negative impact is the highest, in terms of reduction of income, for medium size farmers could this group be more precisely defined? What size exactly is being discussed? Actually the same applies to several places in this chapter. What, for instance, count as small-scale as opposed to medium-scale fishermen. Their main source of income is agriculture, as the size of their farms demands their complete attention and does not allow them to be involved in any other sector. The medium sized farmers find it very difficult to maintain their income level if they are affected by openness to trade. The small or subsistence farmers, when affected, try to find other sources of income by migrating to other places or become workers. The impact of trade on their lives is mostly indirect \u2013 through an increase in the volatility of prices in the local markets. Fall in prices Prices of agriculture produce, especially of food items, are falling in most countries. Exceptions are countries that provide high subsidies like Malaysia (both direct and indirect subsidies) and in the case of a few cash crops. In general, absolute and real incomes from farming per se have fallen drastically. The stakeholders are compelled to engage in additional or alternative employment for sustenance. The impact of fall in prices of produce is greatest on agricultural workers. Impact on intra-dependent rural communities The impact of loss of livelihood on human development in the rural areas is not limited to the family or even at times the village. The rural economies in most countries are intra-dependent, i.e. within the rural economy the stakeholders are linked together cohesively and their livelihoods are interdependent. Income loss to one section as a result of trade, in this case the farmers, has a cascading effect that reduces the incomes of others. For instance, in many rural areas of Andhra Pradesh in India, there were strange instances of suicides of rural blacksmiths as there was no demand for the farm implements they made. The cotton farmers of the villages who were the blacksmiths\u2019 primary consumers had incurred losses and stopped farming. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 28 Similarly, a gain to one section of the working population also results in the cascading effect benefiting others, even if to a lesser extent due to leakages from the system. Farmers becoming price takers Except in the case of a few crops in countries like Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia, most producers of agriculture goods have become price takers as a result of the openness of the agriculture sector to international trade. The result is that farmers fail to recover the cost of production, and easily fall into the debt trap. This is most evident in the case of essential food items like rice. Amongst the agriculturists, the rice farmers are affected the most in all countries of the region, except for these three countries. The former two due to their position as the price setters; and in Malaysia due to increasing and sometimes disguised government subsidies made available to the rice farmers. We do not have credible inputs on the condition of Chinese rice farmers. Shift from principal crops In most of the countries farmers are increasingly moving out of cultivation of their principal traditional crop- both cash and food; as the cultivation of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b30b801-2a7b-4529-b876-9ac987430944": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b30b801-2a7b-4529-b876-9ac987430944", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-second-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Linkages between International Trade and Human Poverty Second Stakeholder Perception Workshop Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-second-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7bacbe7c3bc35d8c6969d82911ed771b5b5bfac6868c0c3fe23185234d056d81"}}, "hash": "7bacbe7c3bc35d8c6969d82911ed771b5b5bfac6868c0c3fe23185234d056d81", "text": "these crops has become unprofitable under openness to trade. This is true especially in the case of essential food items like rice and wheat. Mostly, the farmers try to shift to cultivation of cash crops, often without proper understanding of the cultivation methods and the associated risks. Sometimes they even cultivate crops that are not suited to the land, increasing the chances of crop failure. They may also become manual labourers in many cases or alternate between being seasonal farmers and manual labourers to subsist. These changes often leave them vulnerable to high volatility of income. As a result, many farmers have been forced to leave their traditional occupations altogether and migrate to the cities. On the other hand, in some areas where the cash crops are traditionally cultivated, the farmers are shifting to cultivation of food crops, as the cash crops have become unprofitable. For instance, the tobacco farmers in the North West Frontier Province of Pakistan are shifting to cultivation of wheat since tobacco farming has become unprofitable. Here about 30 percent of tobacco farmers have shifted to the cultivation of wheat, and consequently tobacco output has declined. Yet, the farm gate price for tobacco did not increase due to the collusion between large transnational tobacco companies in the domestic market. Even in the case of cash crops the stakeholder perception is that open trade has affected the farmers negatively. In India, coffee farmers of Kerala have reportedly opened the gates of their plantations for the public to collect the produce free of cost, as reduction in prices due to cheaper imports has made it difficult to recover even the labour costs of harvesting the produce. Impact on allied activities There are some peculiar impacts of trade on the human development of the stakeholders in the agriculture sector. For instance in Philippines, import of pork at lower rates has eliminated household pork farming, which was common in the rural areas. These were known as \u201ctuition porks\u201d, after the practice of using the income from such activity to pay for the education of children. With the cheaper import of pork, this activity has become unsustainable, as the domestic farm gate price of pork has declined. As a result, children\u2019s education has been affected. But the consumer price of the pork remains high, as the middlemen have benefited from cheaper ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 29 imports. This way, trade can result in the crowding out of the most marginal domestic suppliers, especially in smaller countries. Conversely, consumers of chicken in the Philippines has benefited from the imports of chicken parts at cheaper rates from the United States, where chicken leg is preferred and the rest is exported. Availability vs. affordability of food Though in most countries the availability of varieties of food items has increased, the affordability has reduced due to a fall in income. A stakeholder from Bangladesh said, \u201cFood is not a problem. Income is the problem. For somebody with regular income, food is never a problem\u201d. Quality of food has increased to some extent. There are wide variations in the stakeholders\u2019 perception on the availability of food. For instance stakeholders from Indonesia say that the availability of food is fairly good in the rural areas of the country, as the poor stakeholders replace rice with other food items like Kasawa, when there is a shortage of rice. But the poor farmers in urban areas have been negatively affected due to trade as they lack this flexibility. Whereas the stakeholders in many other countries said that the availability of food is directly linked to the income. Who benefits, who does not? According to the stakeholders the sections of agriculturists that benefited from open trade are few. Mostly the stakeholders have experienced only temporary benefits. The volatility of prices as a result of openness to trade has enhanced the uncertainty in the agriculture sector of the region, where uncertainty was already high due to the dependence on weather conditions. Overall winners The stakeholders who have gained from the trade in the agriculture sector are mostly large cultivators of cash crops, fruits and vegetables or in rare instances, as in the case of Vietnam and Thailand, cultivators of staple food as well. Oil palm growers, both small and large, in Malaysia have benefited considerably. The rubber plantations in Sri Lanka benefited as the Malaysian rubber farmers shifted to oil palm. Tobacco growers, and independent large-scale sugar cane growers in Indonesia also benefited because of increased demand from the food and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b84fddea-5e5c-4671-b768-065af10ab241": {"__data__": {"id_": "b84fddea-5e5c-4671-b768-065af10ab241", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-second-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Linkages between International Trade and Human Poverty Second Stakeholder Perception Workshop Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-second-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "28e36ea5da3bbd7d39c105db63a42ce06b4242eb5dd35c03a96661bb5acf7ce5"}}, "hash": "28e36ea5da3bbd7d39c105db63a42ce06b4242eb5dd35c03a96661bb5acf7ce5", "text": "beverages industry. But there are concerns in these sectors. For instance, cheaper imports have affected the sugar industry of Indonesia and there are reports of suicides amongst small-scale tobacco growers of Indonesia. The producers of vegetables in a few countries have benefited from trade. For instance, vegetable prices for small-scale farmers have registered an increase of about 30 per cent in China. Similarly, producers of a few exquisite products like organic tea and yak cheese of Nepal has benefited from trade due to the opportunities to find new markets and the price premium. Farmers In terms of size, the large-scale farmers have been less affected, even in sub-sectors that have been impacted negatively by trade, as they took measures to reduce the cost of production, largely by reducing the work force and by shifting to cultivation of other crops and activities. The small- and medium-scale farmers were affected more as they had lower flexibility to bring down the cost of production. In the case of ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 30 subsistence farmers the direct impact of trade was less, as they are not directly linked with trade. But as consumers and labourers, they have been negatively affected as the cost of living has increased in general. In certain instances they have also gained as the availability of foodstuff has become cheaper in certain countries. Though farmers have been affected as producers, they have benefited as consumers in many countries from cheaper rice imports; and smuggling, especially in the rural areas of Indonesia and the Philippines. In the small islands of South East Asia, smuggling has an important role in maintaining the food security, in terms of both availability and keeping local prices under check. In the absence of smuggling, these areas could have been the worst affected due to their remoteness. Workers Most of the agricultural labourers that we have interviewed have been negatively affected, except maybe for the workers in the oil palm sector. The general perception is that the labourers in the agriculture sector have become increasingly vulnerable to extreme poverty and hunger under openness to trade. The incomes of the labourers have reduced considerably as employment opportunities have declined and wages have fallen. Job security has become low in the agriculture sector as a result of openness to trade. Similar things have occurred even in sectors like tea that traditionally featured organised labour, mainly due to unethical managerial practices. For instance, in Sri Lanka the workers in tea estates are forced to forgo benefits as the plantations are running at losses, on paper, allegedly due to the 33 percent service charges paid to management agencies, which are comprised of owners of the estate. These are accounted as additional costs and they act as the major reason for the accounting losses. Consumers The low farm gate prices that the farmers receive for their food crops do not get converted into lower consumer prices, due to the high margins that the intermediaries maintain. The intermediaries act as the stumbling blocs to the lowering of consumer prices at the retail markets. In most countries except China, trade has given opportunities for the intermediaries to import food items cheaply, hoard it and sell it at high profits. The role of intermediaries in the consumer markets of China could not be ascertained. Blessing in disguise In China, farmers are more or less insulated from the open market and trade due to government procurement and price supports. The food security issues do not arise, as the rural economies are said to be self sufficient in food items. In the villages the field research were conducted even non-agricultural families grow food items and nobody bought rice and most of the other food items from the market. An explanation for this could be that the consumption is limited to a few items in this area. Subsidies Subsidies have come down for the farming sector in general and the cultivation of food items in particular in all countries, except China and Malaysia. In the case of Malaysia, the government finds ingenious ways to subsidise the rice farmers like ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 31 providing subsidies and cheap loans to the wives of the farmers. This is done to ensure that the male farmers do not fret the money received in the form of subsidies.

Regarding the preferred mode of subsidies, the stakeholder perception is that more than direct subsidies during farming stages, minimum price support for the output is helpful. Subsidies during farming stages find favour with only few farmers we interviewed. Public procurement The government procurement system is ineffective in most countries and affects the long-term sustainability of farmers. The illogical price support mechanisms of the past have reduced the competitiveness of most of the farmers, and made subsidies in the present inevitable. The stakeholders opine that farmers are exposed to the market as the public procurement system in place in most countries are ineffective in absorbing the domestic production, for instance in Indonesia it can absorb only ten per cent of the total production. Fuelling migration Small-scale farmers are becoming workers in most countries except China. Farmers become seasonal workers when they face problems. They migrate to cities to work in menial jobs and go back to their villages during harvesting. A similar pattern of labour movement is found across all countries including China. In some countries like Indonesia the young women of the agricultural families become migrant workers in other countries. Role of middlemen Openness to trade has given opportunities for the exploitation of the less informed stakeholders by the well informed, in the transition economies where asymmetric information on the market conditions exist, even if in reality trade may be beneficial or does not have any negative impact. Most of the small- and medium-scale stakeholders have very little knowledge about market mechanisms, market prices or the functioning of trade. Most of them remain unaware about trade, yet are affected by it. Their failure to participate in the supply chain in an informed manner makes them vulnerable to the exploitation by the intermediaries. Lack of access to quality information on the market conditions is one of the most important causes of the plight of the small-scale farmers. Landlessness There is a considerable increase in landlessness among small farmers in most of the countries due to the reduction in incomes as a result of trade. The farmers have had to sell off their properties, as they are unable to repay old debts and farming has become unprofitable. The exception is landlessness amongst farmers in Sri Lanka and the urban areas of Indonesia where landlessness is increasing more because of the pressure from urban housing than trade. Lack of affordable credit Indebtedness due to non-availability of credit at lower rates is cited as one of the prominent causes of difficulty to the farmers. Farmers in the rural areas are forced to go for funds provided by the local moneylenders at high rates of interest, as the banks ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 32 are reluctant to lend to the agriculturists since agriculture is seen as a high-risk and low return activity. A stakeholder from India pointed out the anomaly in the lending policies of banks, where a vehicular loan is sanctioned in less than five minutes, without mortgage. But for agricultural loans the processing time is usually many more months, if at all the loan is sanctioned. HYVs reaping low High yielding variety (HYV) seeds have replaced the traditional seeds in most countries. HYV are purchased from the market unlike in the case of traditional seed varieties that farmers can produce themselves. Often the seeds purchased from the markets are of poor quality or outdated, as the illiterate farmers cannot understand the labels and instructions. The farmers have little knowledge of the scientific cultivation methods required in the farming of newer varieties. The shift to HYV varieties have not benefited farmers much as the productivity of these varieties comes down each year and additional expenses have to be incurred on higher quantity of fertilizers and pesticides in an effort to maintain output. This degrades the agricultural land and productivity falls further in successive years. Efficiency and productivity Efficiency and productivity of farmers show a mixed trend in the region during the openness to trade. Though the overall improvement in efficiency may be dependent on multiple factors including government policies, it is found that the inducement for efficiency and productivity is given by openness to trade and the related difficulties. In general the large-scale farmers have improved their efficiency through methods like use of efficient seeds, intensive cultivation and inter-cropping. The small- and medium-scale farmers have registered average to no improvement in efficiency and productivity in the countries of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c71c4b3c-46f3-4897-961f-c70660ae94ea": {"__data__": {"id_": "c71c4b3c-46f3-4897-961f-c70660ae94ea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-second-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Linkages between International Trade and Human Poverty Second Stakeholder Perception Workshop Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-second-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1035ee8dc33e1d286e39f2cd9982de8aafd02892181cbbb9c2180f8c695f1e95"}}, "hash": "1035ee8dc33e1d286e39f2cd9982de8aafd02892181cbbb9c2180f8c695f1e95", "text": "the region. In some countries like India and Malaysia the small-scale traditional farmers have experienced a reduction in their efficiency and productivity, mainly due to the intensive cultivation methods practised in the past. Corporatisation and contract farming Corporatisation in agriculture is increasing in most countries. Many trans-national corporations like Cargill and Monsanto are operating both in the farming and distribution of food items, especially in countries of South East Asia. In Indonesia most of the corporate agricultural companies are fly-by-night operators i.e. they borrow money from the public for cultivation of cash crops by offering huge returns, and shut shop and flee after collecting funds. Contract farming is on the rise in many countries of the region. The companies that engage in contract farming are both domestic and multinational firms. Helpless governments According to many stakeholders the ability of governments to help farmers under increasing trade openness is marginal or non-existent, due to the opening up of economies and the sustained pressure to liberalise further. But in the entire region, in contrast to sectors like textiles, the stakeholders in agriculture still look to the government as the only means of support. According to the stakeholders, to ameliorate the problems of the farmers the government should involve them in policy making. Some hold the view that governments should take up a more proactive role in the agricultural sector and encourage research on drought resistant varieties of crops, as water is becoming a scarce commodity in the region. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 33 The foreign hands Many stakeholders were of the view that the programmes of international lending institutions have considerably reduced the government\u2019s ability support them. But in some countries they also see it as an opportunity to clean up the corrupt system and increase transparency in governance. In countries like Indonesia, where transparency in governance was low during past regimes, stakeholders see this as an important condition for escaping poverty. Fisheries: Winners take it all The fisheries sector, like agriculture, shows a mixed trend in the Asia Pacific region, though the impact of trade and openness on different stakeholders is clearer here. The fault lines are more or less demarcated between the losers and gainers within the fisheries supply chain. There are major human development implications in this sector as well. They are mainly related to the loss of income and opportunities to find continuous employment. Fisheries are one of the sectors under consideration in this study that is well integrated with the world economy. Most of the exports are higher value products, and trade is both intra Asia-Pacific and outside the region. The fish exporting countries of the region are competitors in the world market, mostly in same varieties of fish. A major part of the produce of this sector is consumed in the domestic market as well, though the domestic demand, especially from the household sector, is mainly for low priced varieties of fish. Yet, stakeholders supplying to the domestic markets often have to compete with suppliers to the international markets. The sector supports a large number of female and young stakeholders who are both directly and indirectly related to the channels of international trade. The job responsibilities in this sector are well defined, with men engaged in fishing and women in the allied activities. Fishing, mostly, is a community activity and a traditional occupation in the Asia Pacific region. In most cases, the whole family is involved in the sector in one way or the other. This dependence makes the impact of trade heavier on the stakeholders. The activity is also highly seasonal. Hence, the stakeholders have to raise major parts of their income in the few months when they can fish in the sea. The sector supports many stakeholders both in inland and in costal fisheries. Inland fishery is increasing mainly due to the export demand for shrimp and prawns. The Tsunami that struck the Asia-Pacific region recently had a discernible impact on this sector. The Tsunami has affected the fishing community the most, as the community lost many lives and much of their equipments were lost or damaged. Fishermen are entirely dependent on the catch for their income. In times of such natural calamities they are unable to earn any income. In addition, social security measures are absent in this sector. The exporters were relatively less affected by the effects of the Tsunami, as they did not suffer capital damages and had the cushion of existing stocks. But the Tsunami affected the prospects of future", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "23d7da29-0e2b-430c-97d1-6ce1b55d336a": {"__data__": {"id_": "23d7da29-0e2b-430c-97d1-6ce1b55d336a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-second-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Linkages between International Trade and Human Poverty Second Stakeholder Perception Workshop Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-second-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "491bce9f8db426b78cd201cc60dafac5af6c171f982e4d1f1d4e41feb5171382"}}, "hash": "491bce9f8db426b78cd201cc60dafac5af6c171f982e4d1f1d4e41feb5171382", "text": "fishery exports in many countries of the region.

On the other hand, small-scale fishermen and women and workers have been adversely affected in terms of security of livelihood and new opportunities. Impact of trade openness Gearing up for trade; but at what cost? With the increasing prospects of international trade, there is greater emphasis from governments of the region on the measures to increase fishery exports. This often affects the livelihood of the ordinary fishermen. For instance, the establishment of marine parks in the Philippines for promoting exports resulted in small fishermen being evicted from their traditional fishing grounds. The only benefit the local fishermen could garner was that a few of them were employed as guards at such establishments. In Thailand, the government has a new policy to promote exports. They encourage the fishermen to invest money on raising lobsters in specially designed boxes. However, this requires huge investment on the part of the fishermen. Due to government inducement, fishermen are leaving their regular fishing activities and are growing lobsters. They feed the lobsters with small fish from the sea, which are harvested using small nets. This practice is adversely affecting the eco-system and depletes fishery resources. Moreover, such activities have increased the vulnerability of the stakeholders to poverty. In the past the fishermen dealt in diversified catch, which was less risky. At present they are investing their resources in one product and in the event of lobsters being affected by diseases, the fishermen will lose heavily. Degradation of arable land Orientation towards international trade has a negative impact in terms of extensive prawn and shrimp cultivation by converting agriculture fields into fish farms in many countries of the region. This activity results in the degradation of the land as this method of farming usually uses artificial saline water. These farms are run for 3-5 years. Once the activity is finished, the topsoil of the land contaminated with salt sedimentation has to be replaced with new topsoil to make the cultivation of crops possible again. This is a very costly activity for the small-scale farmers, and as a result the farms are often left barren. The impact of trade on this sector manifests itself in different ways for various stakeholders. Looking at the perceptions and experiences of different stakeholder groups can bring out the whole gamut of impacts. Fishermen/woman Generally, in the countries of the region the impact of openness on the small-scale independent fishermen and fisherwomen has been negative in terms of lower incomes and loss of employment. The income loss has had significant negative human development impact in terms of their ability to avail basic services like health and education. In India, for instance, the children of the fishermen communities enter fishing at the very young age of 14. Many children do not attend schools even if there are schools in the near vicinity. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 35 Asymmetric information It was difficult for the stakeholders to point out the destination of their produce. They stay disconnected even from the domestic markets in many countries. They are highly vulnerable to exploitation by the middlemen who act as their only contact with the markets - both foreign and domestic. During the increased openness to trade, their prices have either declined or not improved at all, affecting their overall income. Linked or de-linked\u2026 but affected The local fishermen and fisherwomen, who are not directly linked to trade, are also affected, as they have to compete with commercial fishing and large buyers respectively. They are price takers and their bargaining capacity is non-existent. Their incomes are most volatile as there could be instances when they do not get any catch or fish for retailing. Gender dimension The women fish vendors are badly affected, as they have to work longer hours and even during the night. The prices of their produce are not improving while cost of living is increasing. In India, even old women, who work as fish vendors in the domestic market, have to stay in the harbour for long hours in difficult conditions. The impact of trade on them is that they have to compete with the middlemen who procure fish for the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e2682b95-0e6b-4f92-ace2-0757c71d9c70": {"__data__": {"id_": "e2682b95-0e6b-4f92-ace2-0757c71d9c70", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-second-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Linkages between International Trade and Human Poverty Second Stakeholder Perception Workshop Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-second-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bee1eb6e40d9104953f1ef97a897b0ad1a64f8341a8a64ff435afbb9ae57e49b"}}, "hash": "bee1eb6e40d9104953f1ef97a897b0ad1a64f8341a8a64ff435afbb9ae57e49b", "text": "export houses. They do not have any alternative source of income. They survive because of their personal relationships and local customs to set apart a small share of the catch for them. But when there is scarcity of fish they may not receive these favours. These small-scale fish vendors (majority of them are women) run their business by borrowing funds on a daily basis at exorbitant rates (usually ten per cent/day). Due to the high interest rates they do not have much savings and they are forced into a hands-to-mouth existence. Lack of alternative skills The fishermen, when they are unemployed in the off-season period, sit idle, as they do not posses multiple skills to do other jobs. However, in Thailand, it is found that some fishermen earn income during the off-season by acting as guides to tourists for scuba diving. Alcoholism and related problems are high among fishermen. Imperfect markets In India stakeholders had high expectations from the open trade but failed to receive a higher price as the local buyers (middlemen) collude to keep the prices low. The local buyers also do not allow buyers from outside the locality, who offer better prices, to operate in their area. Contract fisheries In the open trade era, many fishermen become sub-contactors for exporting companies in the Philippines. This is more prevalent in crab farming and seaweed farming. The company enters into a contract with the fishermen and provides initial capital, seaweed seeds and solar dryers to them. The price of the final output is fixed at the time of signing of the contract. The company gains in operation costs. For the fishermen also it was attractive. But when a disease called \u201cice disease\u201d affected the seaweeds, the fishermen lost heavily. Also, the seaweed farms became breeding grounds for fish. They ate away the seaweed and inflicted loss on the fishermen. Though the fishermen lost in the process, the seaweed farming helped in restoring the local environment and fish stock. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 36 Fisheries workers The effects of trade openness vary according to the size of establishments the individual stakeholders are linked to. Boat workers Trade has negatively affected workers in the small, mechanised boats, as their catch is reduced because of the increase in number of small and big boats and the shared income is also coming down. Workers do not earn wages. This sector follows a catch sharing system in all the countries. They receive income only if there is catch. Therefore, their income is uncertain and poverty and hunger is persistent. Their working hours have doubled in India, and quadrupled in Cambodia. They also have to fish farther out in the high seas as catch is reducing due to commercial fishing. For instance, in the Philippines the catch reduction is about 75 per cent as the local mangroves are destroyed. Workers of bigger boats (not trawlers) derive marginal to considerable benefits depending to the size of the vessels and do not face problems in getting employment. The mechanisation has reduced hard work for the workers of these boats. However, they also have to work for longer hours than before. We do not have inputs from workers of trawlers. Workers in export units They have been negatively affected as their working hours have increased and working conditions have been deteriorating. This sector comprises mostly female workers as they could be paid less than the male workers and are abused. The processing of fish has to be done as soon as possible as the raw material could decay easily. Therefore, in India it is found that the workers usually are made to live in cramped rooms within or close to the processing units. They are allowed to take rest only when there is no work, irrespective of the time of the day. They have to start working when the stock of raw materials reach the factory, even if it is midnight. In Bangladesh, many male workers of the processing units have to engage in other jobs to raise additional income, after their work in the fishery units. Their bargaining capacity is non-existent as the job is unskilled and there is a lot of pressure from the unemployed to take up their positions. Their working conditions have worsened. Boat owners The small boat owners suffer because of the large number of players, reduced catch and rising input costs. For instance, the local vendors sell the fuel to them at exorbitant rates, sometimes at 3 times the market price.

Middlemen in India, Indonesia and Bangladesh acknowledged to benefiting greatly from more open trade and their prices have increased. In Bangladesh, there is an increase of about 200 percent in the selling price of fish by the time the produce reach the exporter from the fishermen. About three- fourths of this increase accrues to the wholesaler who supplies fish to the export houses. The incomes of the middlemen have increased considerably. However, their bargaining capacity has come down and they are also price takers linked to the export houses. Yet, they receive good prices on an average. When they develop good relationship with the companies that buy their goods, they also receive credits and storage facilities from the company. Exporters Exporters experienced a surge in demand but not corresponding increase in prices. In general they hold the view that trade liberalisation has helped them. But they also experience reduction in their bargaining capacity with their buyers as the demands on environment and sanitary grounds are increasing. Textiles & Clothing The textiles and clothing sector is one of the most important sectors for the countries of the region. The sector stands next only to the agriculture sector in terms of the employment. The governments see this sector as one of the important growth vehicles for their countries, especially with the abolition of the quota system, which restricted the ability of the countries to trade. But there are concerns about the ability of countries having small production capacities to compete with the bigger countries like China and India. While big countries are trying to pocket as much gains as possible, the smaller countries\u2019 effort is to stem the loss of their export markets. The majority of the stakeholders view the scenario unfolding to be a zero-sum game with winners and losers drawn out within and across countries. According to the stakeholders the ability of the producers and countries to withstand the changes depends on the ability to make large-scale production and marketing efficient at the earliest. A remarkable feature of the post-quota regime is that the changes occurring in the industry has a regional pattern. Changes are similar across the countries of the region, irrespective of the size of the economy or the strength of the textiles and clothing industry. The dissimilarity is the experiences of the stakeholders and their perceived benefits. Human development impact In textiles and clothing, the trade linkages are very complex and it is most (as compared to other sectors in this study) difficult to clearly identify the winners and losers among the stakeholders and the human development impact of opening up to trade. A large number of workers, especially women workers, are seemingly gaining ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 38 access to employment from the advent of the open trade regime in this sector. However, ironically, the negative human development impact of trade, especially on women, is also among the maximum in this sector. Varied yet shared experiences The stakeholders\u2019 experiences with the open trade regime are varied in the Asia- Pacific region. Stakeholders in countries like India and China are of the opinion that the removal of the quota system has benefited the industry. On the other hand, the rest of the textile exporting countries in the region face problems in the post-quota regime and there is considerable loss of employment. But the structure of employment in the industry has tilted in favour of women workers - even in countries that have been negatively affected - so much so that male workers are finding it extremely difficult to keep jobs or find new ones. Deepening fragmentation In the post-quota era the industry is undergoing fragmentation at a faster rate in the whole region. Factories are becoming assembly lines in countries like India. Fragmentation has allowed the factories to sub-contract work, creating more components within the supply chain.

In order to understand the human development impact of trade openness better, we are considering the experiences and perceptions of the different stakeholders within the textiles and clothing value chain. Workers Lack of awareness In all the countries the common workers that we interviewed did not understand how trade functions and could not specifically point out the linkages between trade and their condition, due to lack of awareness. For instance, the garment workers in India have not heard of the Multi Fibre Agreement (MFA); whereas, the women garment workers in the Philippines were aware that the garment trade and employment in the industry is shifting to China and India, despite being unaware about MFA or the free trade regime. A mixed bag of benefits Representatives of workers in India, who otherwise oppose globalisation, are of the view that the new regime has helped workers by increasing employment opportunities considerably. The workers in Chennai, India are able to find employment throughout the year now, unlike in the past (during the quota regime) when they were out of work often. But the work has become more demanding and the opportunities to earn more than the stipulated wages have in fact declined. However, they are somewhat content with the situation as it is an improvement over the frequent unemployment and poverty of the past. They hold the view that \u201cglobal trade is not preventable\u201d and are awaiting a clearer picture to emerge in the future to know the complete impact of the openness. However, there are regional disparities within countries. For instance in India, while the workers in the garment factories in Chennai felt that they have benefited to some extent, the representatives of the unorganised small-scale factory workers in Delhi is ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 39 complaining that their job security and incomes are going down, as jobs are shifting to other places. Impact on collective bargain In places where the workers are unionised; awareness, security of employment and employment benefits are relatively higher. One of the initial causalities of the free trade regime was the loss of the right to organise and engage in collective bargaining in many of the countries. Even in countries like the Philippines and Indonesia, where labour laws are strict, the companies look for different ways to circumvent the laws like employing labourers in contractual employment, or form trading companies and raise profit in the transaction between the producing outfit and the trading outfit. On the whole, in countries where labour is organised, the impact of trade is less adverse or even sometimes positive. The unionisation of labour is largely dependent on domestic labour laws. In some countries like Thailand where unionisation is discouraged due to political reasons, the bargaining capacity of the workers and resultantly their incomes and benefits are also low. Women gain, men lose According to many stakeholders, in the post-quota regime across the countries where the textiles and clothing sector is significant, mostly women workers are gaining employment, allegedly because they are less demanding, less prone to unionisation and can be paid less than the male workers of the same category. This is evident in the garment sector, where concentration of women workers is traditionally high. Most garment export units employ 75-90 percent women workers. But women workers are usually employed as common workers like tailors, with the exception of India where it is found that women also work as line managers and do skilled jobs. It is increasingly difficult in all the countries for non-technical male workers to get employment in the post-quota regime. In countries like Indonesia, India, and the Philippines men do menial jobs like carting and packing in the garment units and are easily replaced with female workers. Job security and income Overall, the job security of workers has reduced considerably in both medium and large enterprises. In the unorganised small-scale sector, job security is absent. Similarly, incomes have declined considerably, even though on paper salaries have remained the same in most countries. In the past, workers earned more income by working overtime.

They also lost peculiar benefits like menstruation leave that was prevalent in Indonesia. Female workers were also made to work in the night shifts in India, which was not the practice earlier. There were other human development implications emerging in the post-quota regime, like in Delhi, the garment companies had introduced a token system to limit the use of toilets during working hours. Sometimes the companies use the threat of post-quota regime and closure as an excuse not to increase pay, even when they were making profit. The name game Strict labour laws enforced to ensure minimum salary and social security of the workers have an undesirable impact in some countries. In Indonesia and Philippines the strict labour laws on minimum wages and unionisation has ensured minimum salaries stipulated by the governments, though they still lose benefits. In order to circumvent the laws and unions, the employers offload workers, change names of the company and employ new and existing workers on six months\u2019 contracts, so that they do not have to pay social security benefits or minimum salary. There are instances in Philippines, where the workers are forced to change their names to retain their jobs. This started to take place even before January 2005, especially in signature brands trading, which was not part of the quota-regime. Problems with adaptability The change in the demand pattern also has a bearing on the human development of the stakeholders. In the garment sector, styles and fashions change very fast, in some cases, every two weeks. The new styles are more complex and time consuming to make. Workers are expected to learn the new styles quickly and produce the same output they produced with the old styles, compounding to their problems with adaptability. Are women actually benefiting? According to the stakeholders, the changes in the sector have affected the women workers the most. The vulnerability of female workers has increased as they are sexually exploited and their social security measures are reduced. In many families they have become the sole income earners as their husbands, employed in the garments units, have lost jobs. The married women have to endure this additional burden along with the responsibility of looking after the family. The family income has reduced as the women workers are paid less. The older female workers, who are above 35 years, find it difficult to retain their jobs, as they are not considered efficient any longer. For young female workers in some countries like India, Cambodia and the Philippines, it is difficult to find alliances for marriage as they are looked down upon by the society, because of the negative image the garment industry earned over the years. Many of the women garment workers, it is said, live alone and have broken families. However, this perception about the women workers is not the same in all the countries of the region. For instance, in Pakistan, the garment industry is considered to be one of the few sectors where women can work as they will be working amongst many other women. In Pakistan, this sector has provided employment to a higher proportion of women as compared to other sectors. About 30 percent of the total work force is women. The changes in the Pakistani textiles sector have put pressure on women\u2019s employment. If there are job losses due to the impact of trade, these women will be ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 41 rendered unemployed as they will not be in a position to shift to other occupations like the men. Unemployment in turn will considerably impact their ability to achieve human development. Mixed positive impact There are unexpected positive impacts on the women workers as well. The expansion of the export sector has allowed women workers in India and Indonesia to be confident of finding new jobs within the sector even if it is paid lower or take up home based piecework.

Some workers who are employed in the garment sector join the entertainment industry for the extra income. Working conditions and standards In the post-quota era, working conditions have generally deteriorated; occupational hazards and diseases are on the rise in many countries. The emphasis on exports results in safety issues being undermined. In one instance in Bangladesh 400 workers died at an export house when the building, that was built flouting construction laws, caved in. The stakeholders say that the clients are not very particular on environment and labour standards. The workers in many countries wanted the buyers to insist on labour standards. Sometimes the demands on standards are used merely as a bargaining chip to reduce prices. Producers/Exporters They feel that it is too early to know clearly the impact of free trade regime on the sector. Some hold the view that trade in textiles is not yet free. The opinion on the impact of open trade is varied across countries. Generally large-scale producers in all the countries have benefited. The small- and medium-scale firms have been affected negatively in most of the countries except China and to some extent India. The producers/exporters in China could clearly say that the new regime has benefited them considerably as there are fewer restrictions. In contrast, the producers/exporters in Indonesia and India hold the view that in the open era the going is tough and they have to make extra effort on marketing and management to stay in the business due to increased competition from China. Some producers have diverted their focus to the domestic market. A producer/exporter in India who is finding it difficult to compete with China, said \u201cquotas killed the Indian garment sector by preventing its development\u201d. He is also of the view that in this transition period the units should not be protected. According to him the competitiveness of the export sector vis-\u00e0-vis China will improve considerably if adequate changes in areas like infrastructure are implemented. The Indonesian Textiles Association corroborated this view. But they see their problems as mostly internal relating to old machinery, credit availability and bureaucratic hurdles on improvement of the sector. Impact on prices The prices of garments in particular have decreased up to 50 percent depending on the variety. Price has become the most important selling point in the post-quota era. But ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 42 producers expect the downward spiral of prices to be arrested in the near future, as the market becomes more quality and style conscious. Government\u2019s role The independent producers in most countries did not want or expect much direct help from the government. On the other hand, the producers\u2019 association in Indonesia wanted help from the government. However, a producer from India says that the government has an important role to play in providing the political climate, in terms of good relationship with other countries, in which trade can take place. Access, yes, market not yet Producers acknowledge that access to foreign markets has increased considerably, but access in itself does not convert into exports. Since price is the most important issue, the producers have to concentrate on marketing and management to find the buyers and produce efficiently. Changes at the industry level Consolidation, mergers, and takeovers are increasing in the industry, even though at a slower rate. These changes are mostly taking place in countries like India and China that are doing well at the moment. In the rest of the countries the smaller units are mainly closing down. For instance, according to the Nepal Garment Association, since the expiry of the quota regime many companies have closed down. Of the 150 garment factories in Nepal only 25-40 are functional now. The few large factories remaining are also under the threat of closure. Approximately 40,000 workers have been laid off. Impact on traditional producers The traditional producers of the sector have had a mixed experience from trade. The producers of pashmina shawl in Nepal has benefited from open trading through increases in efficiency and productivity. Productivity has increased with the use of better quality pashmina thread imported from China. Similarly, in Pakistan, traditional producers of carpets and handicrafts have benefited as they cater to niche markets. But in many other places the traditional producers have lost because of their inability to change and innovate.

Short-term Economic Migration There is prominent human development impact on the individual stakeholders from migration for economic reasons. Feedback from stakeholders engaged in low-skilled jobs in both the organised and unorganised sectors was gathered. These stakeholders belong to the low-income groups in their respective countries. Destinations of economic migrants are mainly the Middle East, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, Japan, Thailand and India. Western countries like the Unites States of America (USA) and Europe are emerging as important destinations for service sector jobs like nursing from countries like India and the Philippines. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 43 Characteristic features A striking feature of overseas migration is that people go abroad with a short-term intention but usually end up serving long-term. Mostly people embark on work outside their countries to make some quick money, pay off debts or because of underpaid jobs in their countries. Notably, the stakeholders from countries like India, Sri Lanka and the Philippines say lack of jobs in the home. On the other hand, in countries like Bangladesh and Indonesia scarcity of jobs in the home country is an important reason for economic migration. In fact, many of the economic migrants were engaged in comparatively better-paid jobs in their home countries, although the majority (especially women) appears to have received higher incomes abroad. In some cases the stakeholders have more than high school education. But their work is often not related to their education and skills. Demonstration effect The biggest inducement for economic migration is the demonstration effect \u2013 people often acquire information about economic opportunities in other countries through informal channels in the same locality. Often this information is asymmetric as it is based on hearsay. The asymmetric information on actual wages, working conditions, and responsibilities is one of the important reasons for the negative human development impact of economic migration on the stakeholders. The implication of the demonstration effect at the societal level is that many villages in countries like Bangladesh and India have at least one member of each family working abroad. Debt trap Most of them borrow money at a high rate of interest to finance their travel abroad in the hope of receiving the promised wages and repayment of debt on time. The burden of such borrowings often works out to be more than a year\u2019s income they receive by working abroad. Often the stakeholders fail to execute their plans and fall into debt traps that force them to work abroad longer than they have planned. Gender ratio In most countries, more men go abroad than women. Though in Philippines and Indonesia the number of women who are economic migrants is higher than men. In many communities in South Asia and South East Asia women are not encouraged to go abroad for work or studies because of societal attitudes against such movements. Exceptions to this trend are found in India, Indonesia and Philippines, where significant outward movement of women for work is observed, despite the presence of strong negative attitudes in Indonesia and India on economic migration of women. This apparent contradiction may be due to the high level of poverty in the rural areas and declining employment opportunities in principal employment sectors like agriculture in these countries. For instance, in Indonesia many poor women became domestic workers overseas, as the rural agricultural sector declined. Increasing opportunities for women Sometimes market conditions induce increased overseas economic migration of women. For instance, according to stakeholders, in Indonesia it is easier for women to go abroad than men, due to the high demand for female domestic workers abroad. Women do not have to make upfront payments for visa, airfare and other expenses that the men have to incur. The recruitment agencies usually bear the burden on ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 44 behalf of the women workers and the stakeholders pay this amount back through their salaries. Better income According to most of the economic migrants the overseas movement has provided them with better incomes than at home. Women have received higher salaries abroad as compared to men, as women\u2019s salaries at home were very low. Men complained of receiving lesser salaries and being cheated in foreign countries. The recruitment agencies at the home have cheated most migrants with offers of high salaries abroad. Often they received half the promised salary.

They work in harsh conditions and long hours. They are generally deprived of basic human rights, and end up working much longer than what they were planning to. Because of the low salaries and living expenses abroad they do not save much in the initial years and they have to comeback to work in the same country or look for opportunities to work in other countries. Benefits family back home The families of the economic migrants in the home countries said to enjoy better economic and social status and better access to health and education. In many communities of South Asia, especially areas where a joint family system is prevalent, the stakeholders point out that the rest of the family members look after the people who are left behind as the family reach a negotiated decision prior to the migration of stakeholders. However, many stakeholders who have smaller families said that lack of parental care affect the health and education of their children. There are instances of strained marital relationships as the spouses at home have gone for other partners. Risk of harassment and imprisonment Economic migrants risk becoming illegal workers in the host countries whenever they strain their relationship with their sponsors. They are harassed by the police and often end up in jail, when they encounter problems in the host country. Sponsors often retain/confiscate passport and visa documents of the employees. This increases their vulnerability and denies them basic human rights. There are migrant workers in Malaysia who have been unemployed for 11 years but cannot leave the country as they have lost their identity documents or are forced to stay in the country as illegal migrants once their work permits expire. They said that they receive inadequate support from diplomatic missions of their countries when they face problems with the laws of the host country. The host country laws are often pitted against them and they are generally paid much less than the local workers. The most important expenditure that economic migrant incur at home is on collateral assets like house and land, though it varies across countries. Once they return finally, they usually spend their savings on starting their own businesses. Impact on women Vulnerability of women increases by the overseas movement, especially people engaged in low skilled jobs like housemaids. They are often subjected to physical and ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 45 sexual abuse in the host countries. One domestic worker has survived six rape attempts. However, the women economic migrants, especially domestic workers, have better savings than the men and send more money home. Women cite children\u2019s education as one of their important expenses. According to the female economic migrants, they receive respect in the family and society as long as they are able to work abroad and have money. Their marital life is often under stress and single parenthood is common. The money the women send home is sometimes wasted by their spouses and relatives; often prolonging their stay abroad. In some cases when the stakeholders cannot go abroad again, due to HIV infection for instance, they have to change their names, identity and houses to live in their home countries. In such circumstances they often do not seek treatment because of the fear of social exclusion. In Philippines, 35 percent of the total detected HIV cases are overseas migrants. This figure is high because they are subjected to routine check up. Underemployment Overseas economic migration causes high underemployment. Even well-educated people are willing to be underemployed for higher salaries that change the preferences for education at home. There are instances of professionally qualified students studying courses like nursing to enable them to make use of higher demand for such workers. Reality bites Many stakeholders think that the job abroad is not beneficial in real terms, as they may have to work twice as much than in their home countries. For instance, some domestic workers had to work from early morning to midnight. But they are forced to continue working abroad because in their home countries the opportunity to earn that much money is absent. More benefits to host country According to a recruitment agency in Bangladesh, the migration of workers is very beneficial to the host countries as they charge high security fees, visa fees etc from the stakeholders, which amounts to about two years of the salary they are paid in the host country.

Outsourcing: An emerging sector Work in outsourcing has resulted in considerable improvement in the income of the stakeholders but living standards are said to have improved only marginally. Women friendly Employment opportunities for women have increased. The male-female ratio of the work force is almost the same. There are odd timings for the stakeholders but they do not worry much about it. Job-related stress is very high in outsourcing. Usually the workers in outsourcing spent long times in commuting. Mixed opportunities According to stakeholders outsourcing has considerably increased the chances of people being tied up in low skilled employment. For instance physical therapists and ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 46 architects work in business process outsourcing services (BPOs) due to the higher income they offer. Conversely, outsourcing increases the chances of people with average education to earn much higher than what they will command in the local job markets, provided they know the particular language (in the case of voice-based services). Impact on family life Outsourcing is said to be affecting their family and community life, due to the odd timings and work-related stress. Perception about employers Many stakeholders feel that companies are under-paying, considering the value of their services and the high stress levels. Tourism Currently norms for the movement of tourists are much relaxed in the countries of the region. Increasing trade between countries has resulted in an increased flow of tourists. On the whole, the stakeholders\u2019 perception is that employment opportunities have declined considerably. Income has also decreased substantially. There are variations in the distribution of employment within each country itself. For instance, in Malaysia, while employment in the tourism industry in Penang has reduced, in Kuala Lumpur it is rising. Job creation Whereas, in countries like Vietnam, jobs have been created not only in urban areas but also in remote areas. There has been an overall improvement in income, more so for rural areas as eco-tourism is developing. These are cultural and community based tourism which promotes home-stay in villages. These activities generate a lot of indirect income in the rural economies. The ailments The Tsunami that hit countries of the region has affected the movements of tourists in the costal areas. So the workers in the tourism industry have to move to new places in search of employment. In Nepal, political instability has reduced tourism inflow. Increased cost of living Cost of living in tourist spots is higher and it is difficult for the residents to find housing facilities. The average rent has increased in tourist spots. Land prices have increased due to the increase in tourism related activities. In most of the countries, the high property prices have induced people to sell their properties and move to the outskirts of the city. Long working hours A general perception of stakeholders is that workers in the tourism industry work considerably longer hours than in other occupations. For instance, many of the shopkeepers have to work longer during the season. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 47 Impact on infrastructure Stakeholders see that a rise in tourism activities is having a mixed impact on the infrastructure facilities of the tourist centres. In Sri Lanka, for instance, infrastructure facilities have improved due to the expansion of tourism. Whereas in Malaysia, the view is that the basic facilities have improved only marginally because of tourism. Impact on environment In terms of the impact on the local environment also there is no unanimity of opinion in the region. In Malaysia the stakeholders think that the local environment is not polluted because of the rise in tourism activity as the hotels are increasingly adopting environment friendly practices. In the case of Nepal, on the other hand, the local environment is said to be polluted due to the increase in tourism activities. Impact on society According to many stakeholders, social evils have increased considerably in most of the tourist destinations. Tourists influence teenagers\u2019 behaviour. In many places there is abuse of drugs and partying long in to the night. The local cultural milieu is affected. Energy Services Most countries of the region are dependent on international trade to meet a major part of their energy needs. Many of the countries are following a flexible administered price mechanism under the ambit of liberalisation and reducing fiscal deficits.

The impact of energy price rises is severe on the poorer stakeholders with unstable incomes, as their use of energy is more or less constant at even lower incomes. Lower incomes for the stakeholders would mean that they regularly spent a significant part of their daily wages on energy and the price rises has considerable impact on them. Since energy price increases usually result in an upward movement in the general price level this could be better formulated, saying something like \u201cbecause energy is a basic commodity that is used in virtually all sectors, price increases in energy usually result in an upward inflationary movement\u201d the overall impact on the poor stakeholders with unstable income is therefore multiple. Incessant price increases In all the countries of the region energy prices are increasing as government subsidies on energy are reducing. The stakeholders in the Philippines say that there are weekly increases in petrol prices. The impact of increasing cost of energy on the poor cannot be seen in isolation from the overall impact. Increasing cost of energy results in overall price increases, severely affecting the poor. Dependence on polluting sources In many rural areas the poor do not have access to cleaner sources of energy and are dependent on wood as the main energy source for cooking, though their use is reducing. Even in urban areas the poor\u2019s dependence on the traditional fuels like wood are high, due to high cost and lack of availability of alternate sources of energy. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 48 Kerosene is the second most important source of energy for the poor stakeholders. Both these sources are highly polluting sources of energy and affect especially the women of the family. Availability up, but affordability down The stakeholders say that the availability of energy has improved. Though due to poor affordability they have not benefited. In countries like Indonesia, even though there are specific government policies for supplying energy at reduced rates to the poor, such connections are not provided. Burden on women Most stakeholders say the use of polluting sources of energy like wood and charcoal has come down, though it remains the major source of energy in many countries. In many urban areas where the switch to non-wood fuels is prominent, the burden on women to secure energy has reduced considerably. But in urban areas like slums, due to lack of affordability of the cleaner fuels the burden on the women has increased. They have to steal fuel wood from public properties where entry is prohibited, at the risk of harassment by security guards. Poor pay higher Electricity is out of reach for most of the poor stakeholders. In Delhi, the slum dwellers pay a higher rate than the prevailing commercial rates to the contractor for limited use of illegal electricity connection, which allows them to light only one bulb. When they try to get illegal access to electricity from the public distribution network on their own, they are jailed. What governments can do? On the possible measures by the government to improve access to energy, most primary stakeholders say increased competition may not be helpful, since affordability is the primary concern. They advocate selective subsidies and price control. One stakeholder was of the opinion that the government will not implement the measures they suggested to improve their access to energy, \u201cbecause we are poor. It is like; the lion will not listen to the dog. It is just like that\u201d. Environmental Services Water and sanitation are one of the most important factors that affect the human development of the poor. There is a considerable difference between the urban and rural areas in terms of the access to these basic services. More so in the case of urban poor as their chances of access to free, safe public sources of water is limited, unlike in the rural areas where community water bodies and wells are still the major sources of water. But in many rural areas, safe drinking water is not available, as much of the ground water is contaminated mainly because of the over use of pesticides in the agriculture fields. Whereas drinking water is available in the urban areas for a price, the rural areas hardly have any access due to lack of reach of the public water distribution system. Similarly, the access of the poor to proper sanitation is limited both in the urban and rural areas.

In most countries where water is distributed by government entities, parallel private water distribution networks have emerged due to the inadequate reach of public services. These private networks charge higher than the government rates for their services. Even though the stakeholders are spending more, the quality or availability of water supply is not ensured. Access The ability of public entities to service the whole population even in cities is limited. For instance in Dhaka, public utilities manage only 30 percent of the sewage and less than 50 percent of clean water supply. The availability of clean drinking water is declining. The access of the poor to clean water and sanitation is limited in most urban areas. One exception to this trend in the region is Sri Lanka, where the quality and availability of the water supplied by the government has improved marginally over the past 10-15 years. Also, garbage management in Sri Lanka is privatised and the service has improved. In the rest of the region, stakeholders say that the access to the environmental services has not improved at all under openness to trade. Access is very bad in many poor and rural areas. On the other hand areas where the poor have access, the affordability has reduced due to increasing user chargers. Private water supply does not lead into improved access or quality in most countries. Many of the private operators merely take over the infrastructure from the government, and operate without increasing capacity or infrastructure. In some places like Philippines and Indonesia water for irrigation is also privatised which causes great difficulties for the poor farmers. Scarcity of drinking water Direct supply of safe drinking water is not available in any country, including China. People do not regard tap water as safe. People have to buy bottled water for drinking and cooking. In villages, people are forced to go back to the wells due to the bad quality and availability of pipe water. Impact on urban poor The access issue is most important for the poorer sections mainly in the urban areas as they are mostly excluded from the water distribution net due to lack of entitlements. But as the public distribution fails, there is greater difficultly for the poor to get access to water, they often have to resort to stealing water from the public distribution system, polluting and contaminating that source. Lack of access to water has affected the poor housewives in the city, as they have to travel longer distances looking for public taps. There are often altercations in the slums for obtaining water. Sanitation Lingering access Sanitation facilities in most countries are still provided by the government (mostly in cities). Their coverage is not good and the poor are often excluded from the networks. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 50 In the rural areas public sanitation facilities are mostly some words are missing here. In some urban areas in India where the private players also provide sanitation facilities (for instance, public toilets), the access of the poor has not improved, as the user charges are not affordable, even though the spread of such services has improved considerably. For instance, a slum dweller in Delhi has to spend up to Rs. 10 per person for using the sanitation facilities provided by the private player. However, his average monthly income of Rs.1000 does not permit him to use the facility. In some countries governments have experimented with the idea of free mobile toilets for the slum dwellers. This attempt has failed in most countries due to poor maintenance. According to the stakeholders, the environmental services pose a bigger threat to health with the quality and availability of drinking water deteriorating and the failure and inadequacy of sewage and sanitation facilities in most areas. Health Services Health services have important human development implications for the poor stakeholders. The access to and quality of health services determine to a great extent the ability of the poor to fend off poverty by making use of the opportunities available in the economy. The expenses incurred on health services come as an additional, unexpected expense for the poor, who usually do not have savings to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9970103e-9f44-40a6-a47e-3361069ebafe": {"__data__": {"id_": "9970103e-9f44-40a6-a47e-3361069ebafe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-second-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Linkages between International Trade and Human Poverty Second Stakeholder Perception Workshop Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-second-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "276dc558a44654440a2fb851c38141f71bd4ed9944612e3dbbef8132fc9cc10d"}}, "hash": "276dc558a44654440a2fb851c38141f71bd4ed9944612e3dbbef8132fc9cc10d", "text": "meet such needs. The disease burden on the poor is higher as they are mostly daily wage earners and the loss of employment due to illness would mean further weakening of capabilities to work and ability to escape poverty. This often forms a vicious circle, whereby the poor are often prevented from seeking safe treatment. Prominence of the governments In the Asia-Pacific region the government is the major health service provider to the poor. Primary health centres run by the government is the single most important source of health services for the poor in rural areas. But the government\u2019s role is being increasingly taken over by the private sector in many countries as the governments are limiting their role in health service delivery and budgetary spending on health is coming down. However, in countries like India, where the public sector is still dominant, most poor stakeholders trust the government sector more for quality of service and care. Few stakeholders have opined that the doctors in the government hospitals take steps to give them free medicines unlike the private hospitals that are mostly profit oriented this could be rephrased since private hospitals by definition are profit oriented. Change of usage patterns In terms of the use of health services, there is a considerable shift within different income groups. The stakeholders belonging to the higher income groups are using more of high-end private hospitals that are coming up in different countries of the region. The poor, as mentioned earlier, are largely dependent on the government institutions. But the shift in the user pattern amongst the rich has not benefited the poor much as the governments\u2019 role is coming down or the quality of the services has declined. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 51 Impact on availability and access According to stakeholders, the liberal trade has a negative impact on the poor stakeholders with marginal gains in countries like Indonesia and India, where the availability of health services has improved (though not access). In India, the availability of essential drugs has reduced in the government hospitals. At the same time, essential drugs are freely available in the private drug shops to those who can pay. Overall, affordability of health services has reduced to a great extent in all countries where open markets exist. Affordability Affordability of essential drugs in particular has been considerably reduced in most countries. Affordability coupled with poor access has created informal and illegal trade of drugs between contiguous countries of the region. In Pakistan, smuggling of drugs from India has increased due to the higher prices and non-availability of drugs in the domestic markets. Similarly, stakeholders in the border areas of Bangladesh go to India for availing health facilities. Convenience as a determinant of use Convenience is an important factor in deciding the poor\u2019s access to and choice of health services. In Delhi, India, the poor slum dwellers prefer costly private sector services for health care, as they have to spend large amounts on travel to the government hospitals and the over burdened government systems are slow in providing health care. Ultimately they would incur the same expense or more than what they would spend in private hospitals if they were to rely on the government institutions. Inefficiency of public sector In India, doctors in public sector hospitals use their job to get patients for their private practices. Patients under treatment in the public sector hospitals, have to pay bribes to doctors for proper care. Apart from the doctors, the employees of the hospitals also have to be paid bribes in most of the government hospitals if the stakeholders have to get medical care. Impact of changes in other sectors Reduction in income and health security benefits for the factory employees is a major concern for stakeholders. Many lose such privileges when there are changes in other sectors like textiles and clothing. So the impact of opening of trade on stakeholders\u2019 health is multi-dimensional and intrinsically linked with developments in many sectors. Similarly, overseas movement of people has created demand for traditional medical practitioners. For instance, the increasing number of Indonesian migrant workers has created demand for Indonesian traditional medicine in Malaysia. Increasing use of health insurance There is an increasing trend of use of health insurance in most countries including China. The rich usually practices this, except in China where most patients of chronic illness and non-workers have to make use of the health insurance facilities. Health insurance facilities for the poor would have been highly beneficial, as they", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "90496045-08bb-4311-9db8-1c47d06eb997": {"__data__": {"id_": "90496045-08bb-4311-9db8-1c47d06eb997", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-second-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Linkages between International Trade and Human Poverty Second Stakeholder Perception Workshop Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-second-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7542c8c8df68f60cc519b39b7f4cc9eed3d53205b0c7f0b4918b4614cc1aafd6"}, "3": {"node_id": "fbeaff06-a87c-4562-a248-a41d38d2a789", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linkages-between-international-trade-and-human-poverty-second-stakeholder-perception-workshop-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "74fb5d35c304297c298f1955d5b0a58bf88be2a275e20cdbb66b34298a1c611d"}}, "hash": "54b6fa56ab9b866ebe8d5f2e435f07a0f6a8a3493a5d92de646932e93894f60d", "text": "would not have to make payments upfront. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 52 Increasing indebtedness Indebtedness due to high health costs is increasing in the rural areas of most countries. In most countries the poor in the rural areas have access only to primary health care. They usually have to incur huge expenses in travelling and accommodation to get access to treatment for major diseases in the big cities. The distance often prevents the poor from availing timely and safe health care. In rural areas accessibility is an important factor in the choice and availing of health care. Attitudes The rural health care in Vietnam faces a peculiar problem. The stakeholders are willing to pay only for the medicines and not the consultation. So the doctors in the rural areas over-prescribe medicines and vitamin tablets to make up their incomes, resulting in wasteful expenditure and improper health care for the patients. Impact of perceptions In many countries like Sri Lanka and Vietnam the perception is that, medicines made in the developed countries are of higher quality, even though their prices are much higher than the rest of the medicines. As a result in Sri Lanka, the same medicine is available at drastically different prices depending on where they are imported. Medicines imported from India are cheaper, whereas the notionally \u2018superior\u2019 German and Japanese medicines are far more expensive. But the positive impact of this for the poor is that, cheaper medicines are available round the year. Perception on drug companies The perception of most stakeholders is that drug companies are interested in profits, an allegation that the stakeholders of drug industry vehemently deny. Positive impact of openness There is a positive impact in some areas due the openness to trade in some countries like Nepal. Indian companies have established diagnostic centres in Nepal. This has reduced the prices of testing and diagnosis in the local markets. For instance, for thyroid testing there was only one government centre that provided service once a week at a cost of NRS 1200. With the entry of SRL Ranbaxy, an Indian company, in the market, the rate has been reduced to NRS.210 and testing is done daily. The Chinese model In China the government has a prominent role in health service delivery. The government health benefit scheme is linked to salaries. Even the pensioners get a non- transferable health account, equal to one month\u2019s pension. If the health expenses are within this amount the stakeholder has to pay only 10 per cent of the bill. But the users have to pay a token annual amount- in case of retired workers RMB 240, and for the continuing workers RMB 1,400. Though this model supports only workers, and excludes most of the non-regular workers, self employed and migrant populations, it is said to be highly effective in ensuring affordable health services to the targeted populations. The well to do of the excluded sections usually avail the health insurance facilities, and the impact on the rest was not discernible. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 53 Manufacturers\u2019 views According to drug manufacturers, the impact of the new regime can be bad if there are no adequate laws to protect the domestic sector. Their opinion is that product patent will increase drug prices. But 95 per cent of drugs in India are in generics and can be produced in the new regime. The unorganised sector\u2019s drug manufacturers may be wiped out completely in the new regime, while small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) manufacturers will face problems. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 54 Conclusion and Recommendations In the year 2000, international community pledged to reduce poverty by half by the year 2015.

But the question remains: can aid replace trade? A more important issue is the fact that even if Millennium Development Goals are achieved at the global level, wide gaps may exist at the local level. Increasing openness through trade can, by no means, achieve Millennium Development Goals, unless several other human development issues are taken into consideration. Thus, international trade needs to be looked at from a wider angle than just cross- border exchange of goods and services. The changing nature of trade and its impact on various facets of development (in particular, human development) is evident in recent times. It is also true that the last two decades or so have witnessed a paradigm shift about the role of international trade in human development. A significant array of literature exists on the impact of international trade on poverty. It has been found that in the 1990s, the impact was positive overall. However, it varies among regions. Most Asian countries have gained from trade liberalisation, as far as its impact on poverty reduction is concerned. There were attempts to analyse why some countries gain from trade liberalisation relatively more than other countries. Various explanations were given, but one factor stands out clearly. Countries having good infrastructure vis-\u00e0-vis human development tend to gain more. This supports an oft-repeated adage: international trade is a means to an end, not an end in itself. This study is an attempt to test this macro conclusion. There is little or no attempt to understand human development implications of international trade from the point of view of add \u201cpoor\u201d stakeholders and look at how they are directly and/or indirectly affected by increasing openness through international trade. Though this study corroborates the overall conclusion that international trade can help achieve better human development, provided complementary policies (with respect to health and education in particular) and institutions are in place, it is not conclusive. Results of this study were derived from field research conducted in 13 Asian countries, but the sample size was not representative. At best it provides some ideas on human development implications of international trade. The methodology adopted for doing this study was tested on the ground. It has been found that the methodology was more or less acceptable, but surveys should be ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 55 more intensive as well as extensive in order to better understand the linkages between international trade and human development. Despite this lacuna, two issues stand out clearly from this study. First, international trade is increasingly impacting livelihoods of people. There are opportunities as well as threats. At the same time, there are not much concerted efforts at the local level to help people, especially the poor, to avail opportunities and to face threats. The second issue is derived from the first. Whatever little evidence we have gathered, it has been found that institutions and their governance play a major role in helping the poor to avail opportunities and design effective safety nets to insulate the poor from adverse shocks. As stated above, it is difficult to derive policy recommendations from grassroots evidence that has been gathered in this study. However, an attempt is made below. In doing so, only those sectors are taken into consideration, which are found having significant trade-related human development implications. No separate recommendations are made with respect to services: public health, energy and environmental services. This is because in all cases it has been found that availability is not an issue. How to ensure poor people\u2019s access to basic services at affordable price is the issue that policy-makers should ponder over. Micro survey tools (like public expenditure tracking survey, quantitative service delivery survey) are to be used extensively in order to find out the problems faced by frontline service providers as well as recipients. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 56 Policy Recommendations General Role of government: better governance is an important condition to have a larger say for the local bodies and ultimately people in deciding about liberalisation. Improvement in transparency in governance could also reduce the cost of doing trade. This is one way of mainstreaming international trade to national development strategy.

Failure of new crops is one of the primary reasons of the vulnerability of farmers. They cannot be left with something funny here to learn by trial and error methods. The role of agriculture extension services is important in this respect. New crops should be popularised along with adequate information dissemination and training programmes. In many countries the farming population is ageing, as the young generation is not much interested in farming. It is suggested that the government should impart training to young farmers to create a professional farming population. Storage and marketing Lack of efficient storage and marketing facilities are among the major ailments. This lack of facilities means farmers have to dispose of their harvest quickly and cannot make use of higher market prices later. If common storage and refrigeration facilities are provided along with provision of transport facilities for the collection of agricultural produce, the impact of trade on farmers can be made positive. Ensure quality and safety of food Competent bodies should ensure the quality and safety of food, as food security is not just about quantity but also the nutritional quality of food. Labelling and other methods of information dissemination should be adopted to ensure the quality and safety of available food. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 57 Subsidies Though the ability of the governments, especially of poorer countries, to provide subsidies has come down, the utility of subsidies as a strategic poverty reduction tools is still important given the uncertainties existing in markets. But subsidies have to be made efficient and strategic. Even a majority of stakeholders do not show interest in blanket subsidies. Many stakeholders have advocated subsidies in the form of price support for outputs than subsidies at the farming stages. Land entitlement Land reform is a major policy tool to ensure access and control of land by the poor and marginal farmers. This along with the provision of micro credits could go a long way in reducing the chances of loss of livelihoods. Use trade remedies Governments should effectively use provisions in trade agreements to safeguard the interest of farmers. Social safety nets To ameliorate the problems faced by small and marginal farmers and agricultural workers, there needs to be systems like crop insurance, health insurance, employment guarantee scheme. Effective institutions are to be in place from these systems to function for the benefit of the poor. Fisheries Linking poor with the markets Government intervention is indeed helpful, especially for the small-scale fishermen. Most large stakeholders are doing fine under trade openness, and do not need government support. So government policies should discriminate in favour of the poor and marginalised. One of the basic problems of poor stakeholders in this sector is their lack of linkage with wholesale buyers and therefore lack of receiving better price for their produce. The pervasive role of middlemen in this sector is one of the major ailments. Policy tools can vary from dissemination of information on market prices and market opportunities to encouraging formation of local fishermen\u2019s cooperatives to deal directly in the market place. Strategic regulatory intervention Regulatory role of the governments itself could greatly benefit poor stakeholders of this sector. For instance, ensuring access to basic services like energy. Many poor stakeholders buy fuel from private hoarders at rates many times higher than the market price. Here subsides are not relevant. Ensuring supply of fuel at the existing market price itself can act as a subsidy. Governments may do this either through increased competition or by enabling fishing cooperatives to supply fuel to its members. Ensuring credit Access to micro credits at cheaper rate of interest and with fewer requirements on security will benefit poor stakeholders. Lending policies of banks are to be changed. Fishermen cooperatives can be entrusted with this responsibility as well. Banks can lend to cooperatives rather than individuals and the whole community will be ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 58 responsible for repayment.

Social security schemes Strengthen social security schemes for workers either through contributions from employers, government and workers, or participatory schemes with contributions from employers and employees. Extend the social security schemes to the unorganised sector. Economic Migration Coordination Better cooperation between home- and host-country governments is required to overcome problems such as overstaying. Regulation Governments of both home and host countries should regulate operations of recruitment agencies with adequate guidelines on transparency. Regulation should include ensuring minimum social standards for migrating employees. Tourism Regulation Tourism is largely unregulated and therefore, though it is providing employment to a large number of unorganised labour, the quality of employment can be made much better. Regulation should not only cover social and environmental issues associated with tourism, but also issues relating to skills development, social security, etc. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 59 Annexure ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ \u201cInternational Trade and Human Poverty\u201d - Second Stakeholder Consultation Report, June 2005, India HDR/MDGI, UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo www.undprcc.lk 60 Annex 1 \u2013 Agenda Day One: 1st June 2005 (Wednesday) 0900-0915 Registration 0915-10:15 Inaugural Welcome remarks - Ramesh Gampat Objectives and Stocktaking \u2022 Moderator: Bipul Chatterjee, CUTS-CITEE \u2022 Presenter: Anuradha Rajivan, UNDP-APRI, RCC Session I 1015-1130 Framework for Analyzing Linkages between International Trade and Human Development \u2022 Moderator: Ramesh Gampat, UNDP-APRI, RCC \u2022 Keynote Presentation: Framework for analyzing the two-way linkages between international trade and human development - Manuel Montes, UNDP-APTII, RCC \u2022 Discussant: C.
