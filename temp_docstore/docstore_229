India provided some examples of bilateral agreements, such as meeting every two years with some of the major countries of destination, and providing social security to professionals (software, IT sector), where the migrant worker is eligible to receive benefits even in the receiving countries. While it may be convenient to refer to countries as \u2018sending\u2019 and \u2018receiving\u2019, it is to be remembered that many countries are a mixture of being countries of origin, transit and destination, and internal migration is also a major issue for some countries. This means that the responsibility to promote the health of migrant workers does not lie purely on the shoulders of \u2018receiving\u2019 countries. There are inexpensive and simple interventions that countries of origin can implement with potential migrant workers, such as providing a basic package of information on their rights, health and services, so that migrants are better prepared before they migrate. We also cannot forget that people are not being simply \u2018sent\u2019; there is a will to migrate, because in reality, many migrants do not have access to services even in their own countries. This also raises the challenge that countries of origin find it difficult to impose conditions on migration with the destination countries. This particular Dialogue was a first step, to build some common understanding and position among countries of origin (Thailand and India, however, are also prime examples of countries that are also destination countries). In the long run, it is critically important to engage major destination countries in these international dialogues. Greater advocacy should also be undertaken towards the ratification of key international Conventions. Monitoring migrant health and the design of public health systems are based on the assumption that populations are essentially static. This needs to change, as migration increasingly becomes a fact of life. Primary health care systems need to ensure access to migrants as well. At the implementation level, this means that health care system capacity and available resources (cost implications) need to be reviewed. Migrant workers vary widely, encompassing the spectrum from high-skilled professional workers to low-skilled labourers, and irregular and undocumented migrants. It is particularly challenging to address the situation of those who fall on the lower range of the spectrum. It would be useful to include employment agencies and organizations that work to develop the capacity of low-skilled labourers to be included in discussions/negotiations on migrant health.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "79eabca5-2fbc-467e-bcef-cea932b76bc0": {"__data__": {"id_": "79eabca5-2fbc-467e-bcef-cea932b76bc0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-dialogue-health-challenges-asian-labour-migrants-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional Dialogue on the Health Challenges for Asian Labour Migrants -

Civil society participation should be emphasized in interventions done in-country, as often times CSOs can reach populations that are otherwise hard to reach. Migrant workers themselves can play an important role in the design and implementation of services. Capacity-building of migrant workers is very important. Programmes need to help migrant workers understand their sexual reproductive health, to specifically talk about sex and to address their abilities to handle situations. Programmes can also increase migrant workers\u2019 awareness of their rights, as well as warn them as to the dangers of trafficking, to allow them to make informed decisions regarding migration.

Although Qatar does not allow entry to migrant workers who are HIV- positive, if a migrant worker is already in the country and found to be HIV-positive, he or she is then allowed access to treatment and is not deported. Participants were reminded that the existence of mandatory testing skews the data on HIV prevalence. Because more migrants are tested for HIV, more migrants will be found to be HIV positive. Questions were raised for deliberation: \uf0b7 Who bears the cost of providing health care? Health financing is a tricky issue, as was shared in the Thailand presentation. \uf0b7 What has been the actual impact of globalization on migrants\u2019 health? \uf0b7 Are countries of origin in the position to negotiate MOUs and contracts with the host/receiving countries, to protect migrant workers? Has a health component been included in these agreements? \uf0b7 Bilateral and multi-lateral negotiations are taking place. How do we bring international instruments into the migration process and make them binding? SESSION 2: HEALTH CHALLENGES AND RESPONSES FROM THE REGION (SHARING OF EXPERIENCES AND MODELS) [43] DISCUSSION In the presentations and the intervention by the discussants, the importance of leadership and civil society participation were emphasized in addressing the health challenges of migrant workers. We must all remember to be conscious in our language, that we are not stigmatizing migrants as \u2018carriers of disease.\u2019 There is often denial among the public regarding social problems\u2014for example, that there is no HIV problem or injecting drug use\u2014and the misconception that problems are caused by migrants is common. Mass media campaigns are being used to address this in countries such as Pakistan and Thailand, among others. However, it is still difficult to address issues related to sexuality and reproductive health in public campaigns, as these subjects are socially taboo. Sexuality is a challenging topic. In Sri Lanka, research was done on what were the motivating factors for women to engage in sex, and the main reason was to satisfy their own desires. The important thing is that interventions are evidence-based and that they address the necessary topics, even if they are difficult. In addition to the Philippines and Sri Lanka, other countries such as Pakistan also provide pre- departure orientations to their departing migrant workers, not only about HIV and communicable illnesses, but chronic illnesses such as diabetes and hypertension that are associated with life-style changes as people migrate. It is a reality that pre-departure medical examinations take place. These examinations take place in the country of destination, which means that the countries of origin have the legal power and the opportunity to ensure that the examinations follow standards and conditions. Rather than being used to exclude the potential migrant worker from work, these medical exams should instead allow the migrant worker to access necessary treatment and services. For example, the Thai-Cambodia bilateral agreement ensures that Cambodian migrant workers who are found to be HIV-positive can return home with their own test results and medical records, so that they can follow up. The issue of access to justice was discussed. Most migrant workers such as domestic workers do not have access to legal support when abroad, even when they are exploited or abused. Even when the migrant worker has the choice to report their case to the authorities, it can hinder their ability to proper financially. On the matter of \u2018illegal\u2019 migrants, the point was raised that it is impossible to police all borders. It is better to move undocumented migrants into semi-legal and then legal status; in that way, the government has a better grasp of the situation of migrants in its country.

RECOMMENDATIONS The participants recommended the following actions to improve the health and wellbeing of migrant workers and their families throughout the migration cycle: At national level: 1. Strongly encourage and support relevant government ministries to review existing policies, laws and practices related to labour migration and health, aiming an overall coherence among policies that may affect migrants\u2019 health and their ability to access services. 2. Identify and/or designate a focal entity for migration health within concerned ministries tasked to initiate inter-ministerial and cross-sectoral dialogue. 3. Increase participation of migrant workers in all aspects of their health and welfare, including policy formulation and programme implementation. 4. Conduct advocacy and public education activities at national and community levels through participatory and collaborative efforts between civil society organizations, international SESSIONS 3-5: THEMATIC DISCUSSIONS, DEVELOPMENT AND ADOPTION OF JOINT RECOMMENDATIONS [48] organizations, and governments in order to build support among stakeholders for migrant- inclusive policies, national strategies and action plans. 5. Encourage the inclusion of key migration variables during data collection, ensuring the proper use and confidentiality of data, in national censuses and surveys, including those used in national housing, health, labour, education and migration statistics. 6. Ensure that the existing practice of medical testing done in connection with overseas employment is done in compliance with internationally-accepted quality standards with due consideration to confidentiality and counseling, as well as rights-based access to preventive, curative and rehabilitative health services. 7. Provide health information and education for migrant workers through the ministries of health, labour, migration, and other relevant government agencies to ensure the protection of public health. 8. Promote and support voluntary health assessments/testing of returning migrant workers and guarantee adequate management of potential health conditions, e.g. non communicable and infectious diseases, as well as mental health. Ensure that feedback from returning migrants is included in pre-departure orientation and awareness-raising activities with the active participation from migrants themselves. 9. Develop national standards within primary health care systems that include culturally- and linguistically- appropriate health services for migrants and their families. Enforce such standards and regulations that prohibit discrimination. Encourage health access for family members of migrants left behind. 10. Promote better understanding of migrant health concerns, including barriers to accessing health services encountered by migrants throughout the migration cycle, among the health workforce, embassies, partner organizations and other stakeholders. 11. Dedicate special attention to the health needs and vulnerabilities of migrant women in light of the high number of women migrant workers in this region. 12. Further develop inter-ministerial collaboration, including with other stakeholders, to strengthen mechanisms of health education and delivery of country- and occupation-specific information, covering major health risks, prior to overseas travel for employment. 13. Promote migrant health needs in existing national budgets and encourage regional and global funding mechanisms. 14. Collaborate and coordinate with civil society organizations on issues related to protection of the rights of all migrant workers and their families, with special attention to health issues. At bilateral, regional, intra-regional levels: 15. Examine the possibility of bilateral agreements with a view to ensure social protection, portability of entitlements, including health insurance, and monitoring of the overall migration process by Governments. 16. Conduct multi-sectoral advocacy among health and non-health networks and labour migration frameworks to build support among public, government and key stakeholders, SESSIONS 3-5: THEMATIC DISCUSSIONS, DEVELOPMENT AND ADOPTION OF JOINT RECOMMENDATIONS [49] including civil society organizations, for migrant-inclusive policies and adoption of regional and international conventions and standards. 17. Develop guidelines and minimum standards to assist countries of origin and destination, based on effective practices and existing models, for migrant workers, including health financial schemes and social protection in health, i.e. mandatory health insurance, that will benefit migrants as well as their families, regardless if they are joining migrant workers or staying behind. 18.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1067da81-7618-44b5-8d7c-5ac00bbfa809": {"__data__": {"id_": "1067da81-7618-44b5-8d7c-5ac00bbfa809", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-dialogue-health-challenges-asian-labour-migrants-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional Dialogue on the Health Challenges for Asian Labour Migrants - Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-dialogue-health-challenges-asian-labour-migrants-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4becd92a9928e8167596b5cf4dcdbcd2ee0dbe2808a5b75513e845e7e5cb1d7d"}, "2": {"node_id": "53b14684-e3d6-485d-be69-341f433fe9e4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-dialogue-health-challenges-asian-labour-migrants-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d20dfef8a2b96e5b9df4e92a26912465e82fe7e9072fdd14a6231a88e1668ca4"}}, "hash": "4ad24c0918670826605c91c430c4309ca139dcd57a021836cd4e5f672cdc7e7c", "text": "18.

We hope that the Dialogue has provided a space for you: \uf0b7 To build and strengthen your ties with colleagues from the region; \uf0b7 To deepen your understanding of the issues at hand; and \uf0b7 To clarify what actions you need to take to help improve the health and well-being of labour migrants of this region. The Joint Recommendations are a comprehensive, forward-looking document. At the same time, it is only a tool. It can only be as good as what each and every one of you do with it. We therefore call upon you, the participants, to take the outcomes of this Dialogue to the next level. You have already identified various venues, such as the upcoming Colombo Process meeting in Dhaka, where you would be able to raise awareness and bring the key messages of the Joint Recommendations to discussions with national, regional and global counterparts. Please share the Joint Recommendations with your ministries and partners in your countries, and brief them of this Dialogue. Use it as a framework to build consensus and commitment among your national partners, and to inform your policies and programmes that affect labour migrants. Health challenges and labour migration are complex issues that affect large numbers of people in our region. Such issues cannot be dealt with by one ministry or one country alone, and I hope that this Dialogue provides an example of the benefit of collaboration and discussion across traditional borders. In the end, we should always remind ourselves that all these efforts bear fruit at the level of the individuals and the communities. When we are successful, we will see it in the improved lives of the labour migrant, his or her family and their communities, all of which will contribute to a better society and state. We look forward to building on what has been achieved in this Dialogue and working further with you towards this vision. Thank you and have a safe journey home. CLOSING SESSION [59] MR ANDREW BRUCE, REGIONAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR SOUTH EAST ASIA, INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR MIGRATION (IOM) Mr. Chairman, Dear Participants, IOM and the co-organizers would once again like to thank you all for your participation in this dialogue. The health of migrant workers is an issue that governments are increasingly recognizing the importance of as is witnessed by your presence here and your active participation in the discussions. As has been often stated over the last two days, the participation of three ministries from each ministry bodes well for the future. Of the many positive outcomes of this dialogue, including the recommendations, we are particularly pleased to see a bridge being built between SAARC and ASEAN, which we believe will help move the issue up the agenda of concerned governments. As we leave here today, we at IOM are pleased to play a support role on this issue in the future. We now however look to you and your governments to take it forward at the national, regional and global levels. Thank you.

Such interaction and dialogue would of course have to be a continuous process and we hope that this would mark the beginning of many more such dialogues in the future. We have just come in from a very active session on the \u2018Adoption of the Joint Recommendations\u2019- I would like to thank you all for your active participation and valuable contributions, and congratulate you for adopting a comprehensive and practical set of recommendations for the Asian region. The joint recommendations adopted, I believe, would not only facilitate our individual national efforts, but also encourage further coordination and collaboration in the region to address the challenges of migration. Among the various recommendations adopted, I take this opportunity to mention a few notable ones: CLOSING SESSION [60] At national level: 23. Encourage and support relevant government ministries to review existing policies, laws and practices related to labor migration and health. 24. Support the establishment of migration health focal units within health ministries tasked to initiate intra- ministerial and cross-sectoral dialogue. 25. Encourage inclusion of key migration variables in national census, surveys and routine health information systems. 26. Promote better understanding of migrant health concerns including barriers to access health services encountered by migrants throughout the migration cycle, among the health workforce, embassies, partner organizations and other stakeholders. 27. Develop inter-ministerial collaboration as well as with other stakeholders to strengthen mechanisms of health education and delivery of country and occupation specific information accommodating most important health risks prior to overseas travel for employment. 28. Strengthen the national inter-ministerial coordination on migration management issues, including health challenges for labour migrants. 29. Promote migrant health needs in existing national and regional funding mechanisms. 30. Collaborate and coordinate with civil society organizations on issues related to protection of the rights of all migrant workers and their families, with special attention to health issues. At bilateral, regional, intra-regional level: 1. Governments will examine the possibility of bilateral agreements with receiving countries with a view to ensure social protection, portability of entitlements and monitoring of the overall migration process. 2. Conduct multi-sectoral advocacy among health and non-health networks and labor migration frameworks to build support among public, government and key stakeholders for migrant-inclusive policies and adoption of international conventions and standards. 3. Develop guidelines and standards to assist countries of origin and destination based on effective practices and existing models, including health financial schemes and social protection in health that will benefit migrants as well as their families, regardless of whether they are joining the migrant workers or whether they stay behind. 4. Support multi-country partnerships to facilitate uninterrupted management for conditions requiring long term treatment (e.g TB, HIV). These are to name a few. There are more such practical and realistic recommendations, which will help enhance coordination and collaboration amongst us, but also bring us all closer to developing a more comprehensive and effective migration management system, particularly in the area of migration health. [Distiguished participants] I am also pleased to announce that the discussions and recommendations from this dialogue will be taken forward in the upcoming Ministerial Consultation for Asian Labour Sending Countries will be hosted by the Government of Bangladesh in Dhaka in the third week of October [19-21]. This Ministerial Consultation for Asian Labour Sending Countries [also known as the Colombo Process Ministerial Meeting] will primarily aim to continue providing a forum for dialogue among member states to strengthen CLOSING SESSION [61] migration management in the Asian region - many of the countries present here today will also participate at the consultation. The theme of this Colombo Process Ministerial Meeting is Migration with Dignity and the agenda includes a number of thematic round table discussions on issues such as protection and provision of services to overseas workers, capacity building, data collection, and inter-state cooperation amongst the member countries. The Government of Bangladesh and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), as the Secretariat, will certainly ensure that the issues discussed here on the health concerns of migrant workers will also be reflected in the agenda at the Colombo Process Meeting. [Ladies and Gentlemen] with these words, I would like to end my concluding remarks- I wish to place on record our deep appreciation to IOM, UNDP, UNAIDS and WHO for their support in holding this programme. [Dear Participants] Let me end by reiterating the hope that this meeting will be one of many such initiatives and I, on behalf of the Government of Bangladesh look forward to working together with all to successfully address migration challenges in the region.

There are an estimated 55.6 million migrants in Asia, representing 29.6% of the total migrants in the world4. In 2000, the major Asian countries of origin officially deployed over 2.4 million workers overseas5, with the 2005 estimated top three migrant-sending countries situated in Asia, namely China (35.0 million), India (20.0 million) and the Philippines (7.0 million)6. While there is considerable amount of migration in the region, especially within South East Asia, the Arab States are the primary destination for many labour migrants from South and South East Asia. Of these migrants, a considerable number are women. The economic gains generated by labour migrants for both countries of origin and destination are considerable. Remittances, for example, reached as high as 21% of the national GDP of Nepal7 and 13% in the case of Bangladesh8 and the Philippines9. In terms of benefits to the host countries, labour migrants supply much needed labour while contributing to the host countries\u2019 GDP. Yet, there is a significant disparity between the economic contribution of labour migrants and the poor working conditions and social support they experience throughout the migration cycle. Among the notable gaps is labour migrants\u2019 access to health care services while abroad. Major health challenges include, but are not limited to, lack of health education and health promotion, lack of universal access to HIV prevention, care and support, lack of psychosocial assistance, workplace injuries, and high risk of communicable disease such as tuberculosis and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Many of these not only affect the labour migrant, but their families and the communities with which they interact in the destination countries as well. Well managed migration health care mechanisms address the health needs of migrants and integrate these into the public health systems of host communities and thus help to meet the emerging challenges associated with hosting large migrant populations. \uf0a7 International commitments to protect the rights of labour migrants There are a number of international conventions that address the rights of labour migrants, most notably the 1990 International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, which has been ratified in this region by the Philippines and Sri Lanka and signed by Bangladesh, Cambodia and Indonesia,10 and the ILO Conventions No.97, which 4 UNDP HDR 2009 Overcoming Barriers: Human mobility and development.

Countries of origin and destination were asked to work together to enable labour migrants to fully contribute to the development of both countries of origin and destination14. At the global level, in 2010, guided by the above mentioned Resolution, the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the Ministry of Health and Social Policy of Spain, organized a Global Consultation on Migrant Health in Madrid, Spain on 3-5 March. Experts from various government sectors across the world, representatives of non governmental agencies, United Nations agencies, inter governmental agencies, migration networks, academics and experts, worked together to review the obstacles to generating comparable global data on the health of migrants; to identify policies and legislation that advances the health of migrants; to identify key actions to create migrant-sensitive health systems; and to develop or strengthen national, regional and global platforms to foster dialogue between the various sectors involved in migration and health15. In follow-up to the Global Consultation, a panel discussion was organized by the governments of Portugal and Spain on the sidelines of the World Health Assembly (17 May 2010, Geneva) to discuss migrant health., Strong support for the issue was expressed by Member States, including the Secretary of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of Bangladesh. \uf0a7 Regional commitments on health for migrants Within Asia, governments have indicated their commitment to address labour migrant\u2019s rights and health issues. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) leaders have signed two landmark declarations at the 12th ASEAN Summit (January 2007, Cebu, Philippines): ASEAN Declaration on the Protection and Promotion of the Rights of Migrant Workers and the ASEAN Declaration on HIV and AIDS. An ASEAN instrument is currently being drafted on the protection of labour migrants\u2019 rights. The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) includes Health and Population Activities under one of its seven areas of cooperation, and has adopted a Regional Strategy on HIV/AIDS (2006-2010), which includes a focus on migrants, and a SAARC Regional Strategy for TB/HIV Co-Infection. 11 ILO database of International Labour Standards 2010.

In Asia, the principle regional consultative process on migration is the Ministerial Consultations on Overseas Employment and Contractual Labour for Countries of Origin, also known as the Colombo Process. Its 4th meeting will take place in Dhaka, Bangladesh in October 2010. Its aim is to provide a forum for Asian labour sending countries to share experiences, lessons learned and best practices on overseas employment, and consult on issues faced by overseas workers, labour sending and receiving states, and propose practical solutions for the well being of vulnerable overseas workers. IOM provides the secretariat support to the Colombo Process. The upcoming Colombo Process Ministerial Consultations in Dhaka will have as its theme \u201cMigration with Dignity\u201d, which will focus on all aspects of the migration cycle such as economic, cultural, social factors and the well being of the labour migrants.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "40fa49fc-5a7e-4bad-a473-8448a96dc5f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "40fa49fc-5a7e-4bad-a473-8448a96dc5f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-dialogue-health-challenges-asian-labour-migrants-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional Dialogue on the Health Challenges for Asian Labour Migrants - Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-dialogue-health-challenges-asian-labour-migrants-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3a1fa2c54e809c0ec7ffdce5606e2d3e0c8add2662dc812d81bc5a9eaba245a2"}, "2": {"node_id": "a05814be-b988-41b1-9fd9-200a3fa73260", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-dialogue-health-challenges-asian-labour-migrants-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8ff4673708aca9b536fd1364a07e75e9ecb38e032653d5668db468f1800fc9da"}}, "hash": "324f7dfa2566fb520a8234f781c52327b2154a80aa56728ad3d4ec38bc67b167", "text": "PARTICIPANTS, OBJECTIVES AND EXPECTED OUTPUTS OF THE REGIONAL DIALOGUE \uf0a7 Participants Participants will include representatives from Ministries that are responsible for setting and implementing policies on health and/or labour migration, including Ministries of Health, Labour and Overseas Employment, and Foreign Affairs as applicable, from 14 countries of origin from South and Southeast Asia, including 11 countries of the Colombo Process.

Develop a common understanding on the main health challenges and priorities associated with labour migration in and from South and Southeast Asia and particularly to the Arab States, including, but not limited to, health education and health promotion, universal access to HIV prevention, care and support, psychosocial assistance, workplace injuries, and communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and STIs. 2. Facilitate dialogue and build consensus among the ministries of Health and Labour (Overseas Employment), as well as Foreign Affairs, to: \uf0b7 Agree on key recommendations for action that will improve the health and well- being of labour migrants\u2019 from South and Southeast Asia16 and their families; \uf0b7 Identify key advocacy venues such as ministerial meetings (viz Colombo Process, Abu Dhabi Dialogue, Global Forum on Migration and Development and preparatory meetings) where policy measures and effective collaboration can be discussed and agreed upon, especially with the primary countries of destination in the Arab States. Overall, the Regional Dialogue aims to follow up on the 61st World Health Assembly Resolution on Health of Migrants and address some of the issues raised at the subsequent Global Consultation on Migrant Health in Madrid. It will be organized following the model of the High Level Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue on HIV Prevention, Treatment, Care and Support in the ASEAN Region (12-13 February 2009, Bangkok), which was organized by JUNIMA17, the ASEAN Secretariat and CARAM Asia.18 \uf0a7 Expected Outputs 1. Joint recommendations for action to improve the health and well-being of labour migrants\u2019 from South and Southeast Asia and their families; 2. Identified key advocacy venues and messages, especially for the Colombo Process meeting in October; 3. Identified technical assistance needs to implement the actions outlined and achieve the commitments made. \uf0a7 Venue and Dates The venue will be Bangkok, Thailand. The dates are 13-14 July 2010. 16 While this Dialogue will focus on the perspective of countries of origin, it is to be kept in mind that many of the participating countries are also transit and destination countries, and are faced with the need to address migrants\u2019 health in those capacities as well. 17 JUNIMA is the Joint United Nations Initiative on Mobility and HIV/AIDS in South East Asia. It brings together governments (including the ASEAN Secretariat), leading NGO networks (APN+, Migrant Forum Asia, CARAM Asia and its national affiliates), and international organizations (UNDP, UNAIDS, IOM, ILO and UNESCO). The Joint Initiative promotes universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support for migrant and mobile populations in South East Asia and Southern China and focuses its work in three main areas: 1) Strategic Information, 2) Policy and Advocacy and 3) Multi-stakeholder and Multi- country mechanisms. 18 The 2009 Dialogue was attended by representatives from Ministries of Health, Labour and Foreign Affairs and civil society organizations from the 10 ASEAN countries, as well as international organizations. It produced a set of progressive recommendations (http://www.junima.org/news_documents/RecommendationsMSD230209Final_000.pdf).

This Reference Resource documents key protective laws focused on HIV, men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender people in five countries in South Asia. The two primary objectives of the Reference Resource are to: 1. build the capacity of legal professionals to analyze protective laws (focusing on people living with HIV, MSM and transgender people);1 and 2. develop a resource to support legislative drafting, law reform and advocacy initiatives. The South Asian Roundtable was a joint initiative of SAARCLAW, the International Development Law Organization (IDLO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the World Bank; under an overarching goal to promote a legal enabling environment and strengthen the legal response to HIV in South Asia. The Roundtable built upon the momentum of the Asia Pacific Regional Dialogue of the Global Commission on HIV and the Law (February 2011). The Roundtable was designed to build an informed and engaged group of legal professionals and advocates committed to leading the legal response to HIV. In pursuance of this aim, the Roundtable created a forum for the examination and evaluation of legal and policy barriers to the HIV response in South Asia. Roundtable delegates identified the following key legal and policy barriers to the HIV response: 1. the criminalization of behaviors of key populations at higher risk of HIV (key populations); 2. punitive law enforcement policy and practices; 3. a broad lack of sensitivity, knowledge and awareness of HIV by law and justice sector stakeholders; 4. the gap between black letter law and practice; and 5. a lack of coordination and collaboration within the law and justice sector (in the HIV response). Delegates developed recommendations linked to these issues and agreed on the critical role of policy, advocacy and broader law and justice sector mechanisms in strengthening the enabling legal environment, whilst long-term law reform efforts are in progress.2 The Roundtable supported the commitments of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) under Resolution 66/10 which underscores the need \u201cto ground universal access in human rights and undertake measures to address stigma and discrimination, as well as policy and legal barriers to effective HIV responses, in particular with regard to key populations.\u201d The Roundtable further supported commitments in the Resolution to advance human rights to reduce stigma, discrimination and violence related to HIV; as well as the region-specific commitments contained in ESCAP resolutions 66/10 and 67/9.

To the extent that stigma and discrimination occur in areas which are subject to legal regulation (e.g. employment, rental accommodation, education, health care and access to other goods and services), the law has a role to play in the response to HIV. The law can set normative standards which make HIV-related discrimination unacceptable. Legal education and interventions can help people living with HIV and key populations to assert their rights, while social mobilization and publicity can deter discrimination against others. Even in countries where mechanisms for legal action are weak, a government commitment expressed in law about the importance of addressing discrimination is an important component of the national response. The UN General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS in 2001, and the Political Declarations of 2006 and 2011, emphasized the role of the law in the response to HIV, including law reform, community education and enforcement mechanisms. \u201cCommit to intensify national efforts to create enabling legal, social and policy frameworks in each national context in order to eliminate stigma, discrimination and violence related to HIV and promote access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support and non-discriminatory access to education, health care, employment and social services, provide legal protections for people affected by HIV, including inheritance rights and respect for privacy and confidentiality, and promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms with particular attention to all people vulnerable to and affected by HIV.\u201d5 4 Tackling HIV-related Stigma and Discrimination in South Asia, 2010, World Bank 5 Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS: Intensifying our Efforts to Eliminate HIV/AIDS, 2011 3 In September 2008, UNAIDS published a technical guidance note on the role of the law in response to HIV (\u2018Addressing HIV-related Law at National Level\u2019). While acknowledging the importance of law reform, UNAIDS suggests that we should also focus on community empowerment to access law, and appropriate law enforcement. V. MAPPINg AND ReSOURCeS Each national Legal Reference Resource researcher was instructed to conduct a brief mapping exercise and identify related strategies and research on protective laws, people living with HIV, and sexual minority populations prior to commencing their research. Researchers did not identify any recent studies specifically focused on protective laws, people living with HIV, MSM, transgender people or sexual minority populations in South Asia. Researchers identified the following key strategies, reports, commitments and initiatives as primary resources on the issue of HIV, law and rights.

INTeRNATIONAL LAwS, CONVeNTIONS AND PRINCIPLeS The Yogyakarta Principles In 2006, recognizing the fact that the international response to human rights violations based on sexual orientation and gender identity was fragmented and inconsistent, the International Commission of Jurists and the International Service for Human Rights, on behalf of a coalition of human rights organizations, undertook a project to develop a set of international legal principles on the application of international law to human rights violations based on sexual orientation and gender identity. These principles, the Yogyakarta Principles, were designed to bring greater clarity and coherence to States\u2019 human rights obligations. From 6-9 November 2006, distinguished experts from 25 countries with diverse backgrounds and expertise relevant to issues of human rights law convened in Yogyakarta, Indonesia and unanimously adopted the Yogyakarta Principles on the Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity. The Yogyakarta Principles, comprised of 29 principles, affirm binding international legal standards with which all States must comply and reflect the existing state of international human rights law in relation to issues of sexual orientation and gender identity. International Covenants The Yogyakarta Principles draw upon the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are members of the United Nations and have ratified the UDHR, the ICCPR and the ICESCR.7 The UDHR stipulates that \u201call humans are born free and equal in dignity and rights\u201d (Article 1). It also puts forward the principles of equality before the law without discrimination (Article 7) and the right to life, liberty and security (Article 3) as well as the right to privacy (Article 12). Article 25 of UDHR provides for the right to the highest attainable standards of physical and mental health.8 The rights of non-discrimination, privacy and health are expanded upon in the ICCPR and ICESCR. The ICCPR recognizes the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family; and provides for non-discrimination and privacy. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) has made specific comment upon non-discrimination in relation to the right to health. \u2022\ufffd Article\ufffd26\ufffdNon-Discrimination:\ufffd\u201cAll\ufffdpersons\ufffdare\ufffdequal\ufffdbefore\ufffdthe\ufffdlaw\ufffdand\ufffdare\ufffdentitled\ufffdwithout\ufffdany\ufffddiscrimination\ufffd to the equal protection of the law. In this respect, the law shall prohibit any discrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination on any ground such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.\u201d 7 Pakistan voiced reservations on the ICCPR Article 3 (equal right of men and women), Article 6 (right to inherent life and death penalty abolition), Article 7 (capital punishment and torture), Article 12 (freedom of movement and no force expulsion), Article 13 (no forced expulsion of an alien of the citizen except national security concerns), Article 18 (freedom of choice of religion and no coercion), Article 19 (freedom of expression), and Article 25 (equal rights to all citizens in

the ICESCR \u201cproscribes any discrimination in access to health care [...] on the basis of, inter-alia, sex and sexual orientation [\u2026] which has the intention or effect of nullifying or

anti-discrimination provision, Article 2.2, which lists invidious categories of discrimination as including \u2018sex\u2019 and \u2018other status\u2019. Presumably, since the CESCR distinguishes \u2018sex\u2019 and \u2018sexual orientation\u2019 in its General Comments, it locates sexual orientation within the rubric of \u2018other status\u2019.

(2) No discrimination shall be made against any citizen in the application of general laws on grounds of religion, color, sex, caste, tribe, origin, language or ideological conviction or any of these.

Article 27 of the Interim Constitution of Nepal recognizes the right to information as a fundamental right and states that every citizen shall have the right to demand or obtain information on any matters of concern to him/her or to the public so long as the right of privacy contained in the Constitution or any other law is not violated.37 Pakistan Article 25 (1) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973 (Constitution of Pakistan) provides that \u201call citizens are equal before law and are entitled to equal protection of law.\u201d Article 25 (2) of the Constitution of Pakistan previously stated that \u201cthere shall be no discrimination on the basis of sex alone.\u201d This was amended by Section 8 of the Constitution (Eighteenth Amendment) Act 2010 (10 of 2010) which deleted the word \u2018alone\u2019 at the end of Article 25(2) (with effect from April 19, 2010).

Legal commentators suggest that while Article 25 of the Constitution of Pakistan is broad enough to accord protection to people living with HIV and sexual minority populations, in the absence of more specific laws, efforts to protect such rights are dependent on these provisions being invoked before and enforced by a court of law. Sri Lanka The Constitution of Sri Lanka guarantees that all people are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal protection of the law under Article 12(1). Article 12(3) provides that no person shall be subject to any disability, liability, restriction or condition on the grounds of race, religion, language, caste or sex. The Constitution of Sri Lanka provides for positive duties of the State under its directive principles; specifically in relation to the full realization of the fundamental rights and freedoms of all persons; the realization by all citizens of an adequate standard of living for themselves and their families, including adequate food, clothing and housing, the continuous improvement of living conditions; the promotion of welfare [\u2026] by securing and protecting as effectively as it may, a social order in which justice (social, economic and political) shall guide all the institutions of the national life.38 The Constitution of Sri Lanka does not make specific provision in relation to the right to health or privacy. VIII. ANTI-DISCRIMINATION LAwS There is no stand-alone anti-discrimination legislation which specifically protects people living with HIV or sexual minority populations in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan or Sri Lanka. Bangladesh has broad anti-discrimination laws, but no provisions that specifically provide for people living with HIV or people of diverse sexual orientation or gender identity.39 36 Although the Constitutionally enshrined right to privacy should protect against mandatory testing, under the Infectious Disease Control Act 1963, in certain circumstances, the Government of Nepal may issue any order to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Although there is no specific provision for mandatory testing for HIV, mandatory test orders may be issued to achieve the objectives of the Infectious Diseases Control Act. The Infectious Disease Control Act does not provide for informed consent for testing for any diseases. 37 Article 27 Interim Constitution of Nepal - Right to information: Every citizen shall have the right to demand or obtain information on any matter of his or her interest or of public interest. Provided that nothing shall be deemed to compel any person to provide information on any matter of which confidentiality is to be maintained by law. 38 Article 27 Constitution of Sri Lanka 39 UNGASS Report 2010, Bangladesh 11 In India, legal commentators suggest there are two statutes in place that provide some insight into the type of legislation and provisions that could be utilized in protecting people living with HIV or sexual minority populations: \u2022\ufffd The\ufffdEqual\ufffdRemuneration\ufffdAct\ufffd1976 (ERA) mandates that employers must equally remunerate men and women for the same work. This Act specifically addresses inequity and discrimination within the workplace but only in terms of gender based discrimination related to wages. Whilst this is not directly applicable to people living with HIV, legal activists have pointed out that this law is useful in terms of \u201cdetermining responsibility for discrimination by companies and corporations\u201d40 and \u201cconfirms the commitment and intent of the State to right the wrongs of discrimination.\u201d41 \u2022\ufffd The\ufffdPersons\ufffdwith\ufffdDisabilities\ufffd(Equal\ufffdOpportunities,\ufffdProtection\ufffdof\ufffdRights\ufffdand\ufffdFull\ufffdParticipation)\ufffdAct 1995 (PWD Act) attempts to give effect to the equal opportunity provision set out in Article 14 of the Constitution. The PWD Act attempts to alleviate the position of people with disabilities by providing that certain government bodies cannot dispense with, or reduce in rank, an employee who acquires a disability during his service; or deny a promotion to a person on the ground of their disability.42 While the application of this article is narrow (certain government bodies only), activists have advocated for the inclusion of people living with HIV in the PWD Act on the basis that the stigma and discrimination experienced by people living with HIV is similar to that experienced by other people with disabilities. The Country Code of Nepal contains some provisions related to certain types of discrimination on the basis of disease, under Chapter 19 on Decency/Etiquette (Adal).

Notably, the provision covers ill treatment at a social level only (place of residence), not ill treatment at an institutional level. The Nepal Civil Rights Act 1955 states that, subject to the provisions of the prevailing law, no citizen shall be denied equality before law and equal protection of law.44 It further states that appointments to the Government or any other public body shall be based on merit and that there shall be no discrimination on the grounds of colour, gender, caste and tribe or any of them, in making such appointments.45 These provisions do not expressly forbid discrimination in appointment to the Government or public service on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or on the basis of a person being infected with a disease. IX. HIV LAwS AND bILLS India, Pakistan and Nepal have developed bills specifically pertaining to HIV and the protection of the rights of people living with HIV and people vulnerable to HIV. None of these bills have been passed into law. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh have not drafted HIV specific laws or bills. 40 The Lawyers Collective, \u2018Legislating an Epidemic: HIV/AIDS in India\u2019, (New Delhi Universal Law Publishing, 2003); pg 13 41 Ibid.

Drafted by the Lawyers Collective after rigorous consultations across the country, the Indian Bill includes human rights principles and \u201cseeks to establish a humane and egalitarian legal regime to support India\u2019s prevention, treatment, care and support efforts vis-\u00e0-vis the epidemic.\u201d46 Building upon rights enshrined in the Constitution of India, the Bill specifically recognizes the rights to equality, autonomy, privacy, health and information. Chapter II of the Indian Bill prohibits discrimination related to HIV in both public and private spheres: \u201cNo person shall be subject to discrimination in any form by the State or any other person in relation to any sphere of public activity.\u201d This section goes on to comprehensively define areas of HIV-related discrimination stating that that no person may be discriminated against in employment, education, healthcare, travel, housing or insurance, based on their HIV status.47 This provision provides protection against discrimination by the state and by other actors. Significantly, discrimination is broadly defined to include \u201cany act or omission including a policy, law, rule, practice, custom, tradition, usage, condition or situation which directly or indirectly, expressly or by effect, immediately or over a period of time: \u2022\ufffd imposes burdens, obligations, liabilities, disabilities or disadvantages on, or \u2022\ufffd denies or withholds benefits, opportunities or advantages, from, or \u2022\ufffd compels or forces the adoption of a particular course of action by, any person or category of persons, based on one or more HIV-related grounds.\u201d The breadth of this provision hinges on the meaning of \u2018HIV-related grounds\u2019, which are framed", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2eac5587-f3b5-438b-ae86-660ad0786b8c": {"__data__": {"id_": "2eac5587-f3b5-438b-ae86-660ad0786b8c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-legal-reference-resource", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional Legal Reference Resource", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-legal-reference-resource", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "50842b44e3ea43d07a72f4ed23428deb069f61ccd94266fa5e4ccfa97153490b"}, "3": {"node_id": "1e7ea0fa-1914-4bc0-af0e-0ba0eca9832e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-legal-reference-resource", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5bcf36e215820efa645c02464e67eab6aec978891da1f31b115a8c5cfd5eacdf"}}, "hash": "693becc4451fa3d347ce330b1d60582e5180fb19f250e4b8a6dd06a6b75d539f", "text": "to include: \u201cHIV status, actual or perceived; actual or perceived association with an HIV-positive person; or actual or perceived risk of exposure to HIV infection; or any other ground where discrimination based on that ground (1) causes or perpetuates or has a tendency to perpetuate systemic disadvantage in respect of a category of persons, (2) undermines human dignity or (3) adversely affects the equal enjoyment of a protected person\u2019s rights and freedoms in relation to [HIV].\u201d This definition is drafted to encompass MSM, transgender people and populations at higher risk. The provision is intended to provide protection from discrimination which is practical and appropriate, enabling an effective response to the types of discrimination that undermine the HIV response. Chapter IV of the Indian Bill guarantees the confidentiality of HIV-related information (including the HIV status of a person) and outlines the exceptions for disclosure, including in certain circumstances in a Court of law or in certain circumstances as required by medical practitioners.48 46 Lawyers Collective HIV/AIDS Unit, \u2018Positive Dialogue\u2019, Newsletter # 20: Pg 1 47 The HIV/AIDS Bill 2007, Chapter II, Section 4.

Chapters XI and XII of the Indian Bill address and create innovative implementation mechanisms including institutional grievance redressal machinery, Health Ombuds in each district and HIV authorities that will take over from the National AIDS Control Organization and State AIDS Control Societies, with an independent and accountable structure. The Indian Bill also specifies special Court procedures including quick trials and creative redressal. For example, under these provisions, a Court may award damages and direct the person who perpetrated the discrimination to undergo sensitization and training, and undertake community service. Chapter XIV of the Indian Bill provides a comprehensive overview of special provisions taking into account the additional needs of particular groups (prisoners, women, children and guardians of the state).50 Chapter XIV also addresses the link between sexual violence and HIV and directs the State to set up sexual assault crisis centers where survivors of sexual assault may access services including counseling, treatment and management of STI\u2019s including HIV and AIDS and referrals.51 The Indian Bill was cleared by the Law Ministry in March 2010. Lawyers, activists and community groups have since lobbied the Health Ministry to take action but at the date of this report, the Indian Bill had not been tabled in Parliament.52 Nepal The first draft of the Nepal HIV and AIDS (Prevention, Control, Treatment, Re-integration and Protection of Rights) Bill 2067 (2010) (Nepal Bill), was developed in 2003, but has been amended a number of times. The following comments are based on a draft version of the Nepal Bill dated 6 October 2011. The Nepal Bill provides that \u201cno person shall be subject to any form of discrimination because of his/her being HIV infected or on a suspicion that he/she is HIV infected.\u201d Significantly, the ambit of this protection extends to discrimination on the basis of a suspicion that a person is HIV infected. Accordingly, this clause may be interpreted to protect MSM and transgender people (and/or other key populations at higher risk of HIV who are also the necessary in the initiation of such proceedings or for instructing counsel; or if it relates to statistical or other information of a person that could not reasonably be expected to lead to the identification of that person.\u201d 49 See Section 13. In dealing with \u2018partner notification\u2019 and the \u2018duty to prevent transmission\u2019, the Indian Bill also recognizes the vulnerability of women and specifies that the duty to notify partners is waived in the case of women who fear violence and loss of their homes in the event of notification. 50 The Bill recognises certain rights for women, children and persons in the care and custody of the State who find themselves more vulnerable to HIV and are disproportionately affected by the epidemic. Prisoners are provided with specific access to risk reduction strategies, counseling and healthcare services 51 See Section 74 52 In July 2011, approximately 300 people living with HIV staged a protest outside the Health Ministry demanding immediate passage of the Indian Bill and a meeting with the Minister of Health 14 Regional Legal Reference Resource subject of stigma and presumptions) who may be presumed to be HIV positive on the basis of stigmatizing views or lack of knowledge. This would be subject to evidence that the discriminating entity had made some presumption of HIV status or suspected the party discriminated against, to be HIV positive. Notes on the intention of the drafters and legislators would be useful in understanding the full intention of this effect of this section. While this represents an important step to extend anti-discrimination provisions to protect people from discrimination \u2018on suspicion\u2019 of their status, the practicality of enforcing such a provision and the challenges in proving a person held such a suspicion must be considered. The Nepal Bill expressly extends this degree of protection to the public, private and personal spheres. It provides: \u2022\ufffd \u201cNo public or private enterprise shall discriminate against any person because of his/her being HIV infected or on a suspicion that he/she is HIV infected, in access or distribution of any facilities, from appointment, transfer or promotion or while nominating for training or study in any public or private enterprise.

Notably earlier versions of the Nepal Bill extended this protection to family members of the person infected or suspected to be infected with HIV; the ambit of protection has since been narrowed. The Bill recognizes a person\u2019s right to privacy and confidentiality of his/her HIV status and provides: \u2022\ufffd a person shall not be required to disclose his/her HIV status unless otherwise required by the provisions of the Bill of any other law in force. \u2022\ufffd all health professionals, people working in the health sector and any doctor, nurse, or other staff or worker in the government or the private sector, who has the responsibility to maintain documents or any records, reports or reports of health-related testing, [must] keep confidential any details related to the [HIV] status of any person that comes to his/her knowledge in the course of his/her work. These provisions are in line with the constitutionally enshrined right to privacy. However, the Nepal Bill imposes an obligation only upon health professionals who may have access to the HIV status of a person in the course of their duties. A greater degree of protection could be achieved by extending this obligation beyond the health sector to other persons who may have direct or indirect access to such information; and by creating practical and accessible complaints mechanisms, with clear repercussions for a breach, The Nepal Bill prohibits mandatory testing for HIV unless otherwise provided for in the Nepal Bill. Testing for HIV and research on HIV may not be conducted without the consent of the concerned person. Instances in which the consent of the concerned person shall not be required for HIV testing are: (a) in the course of investigation of crime under the provisions of the Nepal Bill53(b) pursuant to a court order, and (c) in the course of treatment of a minor or an individual who is unable to take his/her decision because of physical or mental state.54 The Nepal Bill does not define the manner in which consent for HIV testing should be given. The Nepal Bill could be strengthened by defining \u2018consent\u2019 as informed, written consent, free from coercion.55 This version of the Nepal Bill was submitted by the HIV/AIDS and STD Control Board to the Ministry of Health and Population in 2010. Research indicates that the Nepal Bill is being amended and reviewed by Ministry of Health and Population, pursuant to which it will be forwarded to the Ministry of Law and Justice and finally tabled before Parliament for endorsement and enactment. Civil society has lobbied against delays in this process. 53 This includes circumstances to determine if a person has intentionally or negligently transmitted HIV - an offence under the Nepal Bill. 54 This would be based on a written consent or recommendation of the individual/minor\u2019s family member, and if no family member is available, at the recommendation of the concerned hospital or the health officer. 55 The Nepal Bill requires that every individual who undergoes HIV testing be given compulsory pre and post-test counselling by the testing agency. The Bill further states that \u201cSuch counselling (pre and post-test counselling) shall be confidential\u201d. The pre and post-test counselling shall be conducted in accordance with the regulations that may be framed in this regard. 15 Pakistan Pakistan developed the draft HIV/AIDS Prevention and Treatment Act in 2007 (Pakistan Bill). The Pakistan Bill proposes to support the Government of Pakistan to establish an enabling environment by: \u2022\ufffd According care, support and treatment to people living with HIV; \u2022\ufffd Protecting vulnerable populations against stigma and discrimination on the basis their HIV status; \u2022\ufffd Providing for increased prevention, care, support and treatment programs, thereby reducing the risk of HIV infection among vulnerable populations, including preventing its transmission into the general population; and \u2022\ufffd Giving effect to all the national and international endeavors in this respect. The Pakistan Bill defines most at risk populations as \u201cpopulations at disproportionately high risk of HIV infection, whose members and their families often experience a lack of human rights protection, such as discrimination and/ or are otherwise marginalized by their legal or other status, which consequently may disempower members of these populations to avoid seeking HIV tests and other HIV infection prevention measures and to cope with HIV/ AIDS, if affected by it.\u201d MSM and transgender people in Pakistan would benefit from a definition of most at risk populations with less ambiguity.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c3a5fc89-735f-445e-a3fa-22c48f8375ce": {"__data__": {"id_": "c3a5fc89-735f-445e-a3fa-22c48f8375ce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-legal-reference-resource", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional Legal Reference Resource", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-legal-reference-resource", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b1d0acd531ef880dbebe1b80cf56f0c701cdaf68e6c7934799848c9e28256e91"}}, "hash": "b1d0acd531ef880dbebe1b80cf56f0c701cdaf68e6c7934799848c9e28256e91", "text": "A provision which expressly names the most at risk populations would preclude doubt as to their inclusion in this category. Section 2(e) of the Pakistan Bill defines discrimination to include: \u201cany act or omission including a policy, law, rule, practice, custom, tradition, usage, condition or situation which directly or indirectly, expressly or by effect, immediately or over a period of time imposes burdens, obligations, liabilities, disabilities or disadvantages on, or denies or withholds benefits, opportunities or advantages, from, or compels or forces the adoption of a particular course of action by any person or category of persons, based solely on a person\u2019s HIV status, actual or perceived.\u201d This is a broad protective provision and importantly provides protection for people living with HIV or \u2018perceived\u2019 to be living with HIV. Similarly to the Nepal Bill, this provision may be interpreted to cover MSM, transgender people and other key populations at higher risk of HIV. However, given the Pakistan Bill specifically defines most at risk populations but does not use this term in section 2(e); Courts may construe this section to exclude most at risk populations. Notably, this provision would offer greater protection if it was amended to delete the word \u2018solely\u2019 \u2013 allowing the Pakistan Bill to capture cases of discrimination where discrimination occurred on the basis of a number of factors, one of which was the person\u2019s HIV status. The Pakistan Bill could also be strengthened by extending the coverage of Section 2 to include associates of people believed to be living with HIV, whether such person\u2019s HIV status is actual or perceived. Section 11 of the Pakistan Bill prohibits discrimination in both the public and private sector: \u201cNo person shall be discriminated against on the basis of his HIV status in any form in relation to any activity in the private or public sectors.\u201d The Pakistan Bill also prohibits anyone from publishing, propagating, advocating or communicating whether by words, or by actions, against any person on grounds of his/her suffering from HIV. Section 12(2) of the Pakistan Bill makes it \u201cobligatory for all public and private sector organizations to keep confidential the medical and personal record of people, their employees, students and members, as the case may be.\u201d Section 12 of the Pakistan Bill makes it illegal to coerce a person, contrary to the provisions of the Bill to test for HIV for the purposes of employment, promotion, training, or benefit (either in public or private sectors); membership in any organization; admission to any educational institution; admission to any public or private place of accommodation; marriage; immigration to, emigration from, or citizenship of, Pakistan; and visiting another country for including but not limited to, tourism, studies or work. The Pakistan Bill provides for a fine in the event of violation of the provisions on discrimination (specifically section 11 in relation to the public and private sector) and mandatory testing (section 12). Section 39 states violation 16 Regional Legal Reference Resource of these sections is punishable by a fine of not less than 50,000 Pakistani Rupees or more than 300,000 Pakistani Rupees. Section 40(1) of the Pakistan Bill recognizes the role of the Courts and provides \u201cnotwithstanding any other law for the time being in force, in the adjudication of any proceedings, which are instituted under the same, the Courts are permitted to pass appropriate orders having regard to the circumstances of the case to (i) prevent breaches of the provisions of this Act; or (ii) redress breaches of the provisions of this Act.\u201d Legal commentators suggest a lack of political commitment has impeded the passage of the Pakistan Bill. A consistent and effective long-term response to HIV depends heavily on bipartisan, multi-sectoral commitment. Competing political, social and economic priorities have resulted in a situation where the Pakistan Bill has been pending for five years. In Islamabad, legislators have addressed the issue of HIV in a separate bill applicable only in the jurisdiction of Islamabad. As at the date of the report, the HIV/AIDS Safety and Control Bill 2010 (Islamabad Bill) had been accepted by Parliament for review. The Islamabad Bill provides at section 10: \u201cNo person will by publication, by advocacy or propaganda spoken or written spread prejudicial reports regarding a person or persons of [HIV] in a way that could cause psychological, physical or mental trauma to that individual or individuals or result in their being victimized or discriminated against by the society, by employers or prospective employers or associates. A person advocating or discriminating against an infected person will be guilty of a misdemeanor and is liable to imprisonment or fine or both.\u201d56 The key", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8ee4ad0-2ead-450d-9a2b-58f015746a41": {"__data__": {"id_": "e8ee4ad0-2ead-450d-9a2b-58f015746a41", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-legal-reference-resource", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional Legal Reference Resource", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-legal-reference-resource", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7be22037adec21794e2b2d5086994a0cad51270117b3f02710d41df40f3138e7"}}, "hash": "7be22037adec21794e2b2d5086994a0cad51270117b3f02710d41df40f3138e7", "text": "term in this section is \u2018prejudicial reports\u2019 \u2013 protection is prescribed only in the circumstance of a prejudicial report.

This section does not offer protection on the basis of presumed HIV status or on the basis of association.

COURT DeCISIONS AND IMPLeMeNTATION Of PROTeCTIVe LAwS Bangladesh Research failed to identify Bangladesh Court decisions related to the rights of people living with HIV, MSM and/or transgender persons. India There have been a number of Court orders related to the Constitutional guarantee of non-discrimination with specific regard to people living with HIV, MSM and transgender people in India. Notably, \u201cin the absence of any law or statute that specifically addresses the issues that are raised in the HIV context in India, both appellants and the judiciary have had to make their complaints, decisions and rulings by extrapolation from a variety of law sources.\u201d57 56 While the Islamabad Bill seeks to accord protection to people living with HIV in Islamabad, it also seeks to make HIV testing mandatory for marriage, prison inmates, commercial sex traders, sex offenders, victims of crimes which have exposed them to risk of acquiring HIV, habitual drug users, truck drivers, and patients receiving repeated transfusions of blood. 57 K.

Delhi High Court Decision on Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code The Delhi High Court relied upon Constitutional provisions to read down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code which criminalized \u201ccarnal intercourse against the order of nature\u201d, or, in effect, same sex, consensual sexual activity. In an historic judgment in June 2009, Justice A.P Shah declared this law to be unconstitutional and proclaimed, \u201cIt cannot be forgotten that discrimination is the antithesis of equality and that it is the recognition of equality which will foster the dignity of every individual.\u201d This historic judgment used the Indian Constitution and foreign case law to rule on the basis of fundamental rights. The Delhi High Court ruled that this section was a violation of the fundamental right to privacy; that a human rights approach protecting the rights of vulnerable populations is critical to HIV prevention; and that discrimination on the basis of sex includes sexuality and sexual orientation. The judgment also highlighted a critical distinction between public and constitutional morality declaring that the State cannot limit individual rights on the grounds of what the public may disapprove of, but must rely on constitutional principles of equality, plurality and inclusion. This decision has been hailed globally as marking \u201cthe beginning of the end of the legal subordination of India\u2019s sexual minority populations.\u201d Appeals against the decision were being heard in the Supreme Court of India in June 2012, while this Reference Report was drafted. 2. Public Interest Litigation on Access to Healthcare Services In 1999, the Lawyers Collective filed public interest litigation through Sankalp Rehabilitation Trust to address barriers that impeded the access of people living with HIV to healthcare services, especially discrimination in hospitals. In 2008, the Supreme Court of India passed an order endorsing fourteen points addressing these issues. These points included non-discrimination of people living with HIV in heath care settings; rapid upscale of ART centres; ensuring adequate infrastructure in ART centres \u2013 adequate seating space, clean toilets and safe drinking water; the establishment of grievance redressal mechanisms via a complaint box in every ART Centre (and the appointment of nodal officers to review the complaints) as well as through the creation of a State Level Grievance Redressal Mechanisms. 3. The Supreme Court of India on Protection of Life and Personal Liberty The Supreme Court of India has, in a number of rulings interpreted Article 21 of the Constitution of India to include the right to health and to access to proper treatment to cure diseases.

Bombay High Court Decision on Employment Discrimination and HIV Status In the case of MX v. ZY AIR 1997 Bom 406 the Bombay High Court ruled \u201cno person could be deprived of his or her livelihood except by procedure established by law and that the procedure must be just, fair and reasonable. It held that: 1. If a person is fit to perform his job functions; 2. is otherwise qualified and 3. does not pose a substantial risk to fellow workers; Further, the Court held that a public sector employer cannot deny a person employment solely because he is HIV positive. Each determination of whether a person is incapable of performing the job must be made by conducting an individual enquiry taking into account the state of medical knowledge at the time. Accordingly, the High Court found that MX\u2019s dismissal was arbitrary, unjust, and unlawful. The court further held that in proper cases where a person can show that he or she would not be able to prosecute his or her if his status is disclosed and in the interests of the administration of justice, the Court will permit the party before it to suppress his or her identity and prosecute or defend the proceedings under an assumed name.\u201d61 Nepal 1. The Supreme Court of Nepal and Non-Discrimination In the case of Sunil Babu Pant v.

The Supreme Court of Nepal and the Right to Privacy The Supreme Court of Nepal also dealt with issues related to privacy in the case of Sunil Babu Pant v. Government of Nepal. The petitioner challenged No. 1 and No. 4 of Chapter 16 (on bestiality) of the Country Code 1963, which is interpreted to criminalize homosexuality as \u2018unnatural sex\u2019.64 The Supreme Court, founding its arguments on fundamental right to privacy contained in the Constitution, clarified that these provisions did not apply to homosexuals and transgender people. The Supreme Court of Nepal found that: \u201cNo one has the right to question how two adults perform sexual intercourse and whether this intercourse is natural or unnatural. In the way the right to privacy is secured to two heterosexual individuals in sexual intercourse, it is equally secured to the people of third gender who have different gender identity and sexual orientation. In such a situation, therefore, gender identity and sexual orientation of the third gender and homosexuals cannot be ignored by treating the sexual intercourse among them as unnatural.\u201d In delivering this decision, the Supreme Court also referred to Article 13 of the Interim Constitution of Nepal, which provides that every citizen and every person shall obtain rights on equal basis, such as the right to have one\u2019s own identity, and the same cannot be restricted by laws that are discriminatory and arbitrary. 3. Privacy and Confidentiality in Court Proceedings In the case of Forum\ufffdfor\ufffdWomen,\ufffdLaw\ufffdand\ufffdDevelopment v. Government\ufffdof\ufffdNepal\ufffd&\ufffdOrs, the petitioner contended that although Article 28 of the Constitution and various international human rights instruments ratified by Nepal, provide for the right to privacy, no specific provisions exist to protect the privacy of persons living with HIV were involved in litigation.65 The petitioner contended that if the privacy of these persons is not protected then they would be unable to exercise their right of judicial remedy, due to the stigma surrounding issues related to their cases. The Supreme Court issued a directive order to the Prime Minister and the Office of the Council of Ministers as well as the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Management to enact law for maintaining privacy in litigation in which \u2018victims\u2019 who are women or children or people living with HIV are involved. This law has not been passed, and does not provide for MSM or transgender people. However, the Supreme Court has issued guidelines to be complied with on this matter, until relevant law comes into force. The guidelines require that in certain lawsuits, the \u2018personal introductory information\u201966 of a person living with HIV is kept confidential at the time of registration of the case, and is maintained, even after the disposal of the case.67 It further lays down the rights and duties of the concerned 64 No 1: No one may penetrate an animal or make an animal penetrate him/her or may do or make another person do any kind of unnatural sex.

The Supreme Court of Nepal and the Right to Information Finally, in the case of Gopal Krishna Shiwakoti v. HMG/N\ufffd&\ufffdOrs, the Supreme Court of Nepal discussed Article 16 of the 1990 Constitution of Nepal which had a provision on right to information similar to that contained in Article 27 of the present Interim Constitution of Nepal.68 The Supreme Court held that the government has an obligation to provide information on any matter of public interest, including public health, and that the Court may fill the gap if any procedural difficulty arises in the application of this right. Therefore, citizens can invoke their constitutional right to privacy to demand access to information on HIV. However, no law has been framed that specifically requires information to be disseminated to the general public on sensitive matters of public health and/or on the process of obtaining information.69 Pakistan 1. The Supreme Court of Pakistan Recognizes the Rights of Eunuchs In a landmark decision in 2009, Pakistan recognized the rights of eunuchs as citizens of Pakistan. A Constitutional Petition was brought by Islamic jurist, Dr Mohammad Aslam Khaki, before the Supreme Court of Pakistan. The case addressed the molestation and humiliation of eunuchs by the Rawalpindi Police during the raid of a wedding ceremony in Taxila, a town situated towards west of Islamabad. The Supreme Court of Pakistan held that \u201c[n]eedless to observe that eunuchs in their own rights are citizens of this country and subject to the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973, their rights and obligations including the rights to life and dignity are equally protected. Thus no discrimination, for any reason, is possible against them as far as their rights and obligations are concerned.

There is an argument that neither the \u2018O\u2019 (considered derogatory) or the \u2018E\u2019 (considered eunuch specific, this excludes people of other diverse sexual orientation) are satisfactory to intersex and transgender groups. Notwithstanding this, this is a step forward in terms of state recognition of diverse sexual orientation. The Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations 2002 specifically forbid physicians to deny treatment arbitrarily, and state that in an epidemic, \u2018the physician should not abandon his duty for fear of contracting the disease himself.\u2019 These regulations are relevant in the context of denial of treatment for people living with HIV and are usually called upon by Courts to determine if a physician has been negligent in his/ her duties. Sections 341 and 342 of the Indian Penal Code 1860 make wrongful restraint or confinement of any person an offence. Section 383 and 389 of the Indian Penal Code criminalize extortion. Extortion through threat of arrest is a very serious crime and police are obliged to respond if individuals file first information reports alleging this. These provisions are useful to consider with regard to protective laws because despite the current status of section 377, various other provisions in the Indian Penal Code make it possible for the police to harass, blackmail and extort money from the LGBTI community in India. Legal commentators have suggested that it would be useful for LGBTI organizations and individuals to be aware of protections under the IPC and to leverage the existence of a rule of law framework. However, the reality is that many people from the LGBTI community are deterred from filing complaints against the police due to the risk of their families\u2019 learning of their sexuality and fear of the stigma that may accompany this. Sri Lanka Sri Lankan national HIV-related strategies and policies have broadly focused on the prevention of transmission of HIV, with some recognition of the importance of a rights based approach. Notably, policy is not enforceable. Sri Lanka achieved an important milestone through the adoption of the National HIV/AIDS Policy in 2011. This draft policy was first presented at the National AIDS Committee (NAC) meeting in October 2005. Legal commentators indicate that the adoption of the Sri Lankan National HIV/AIDS Policy is a result of many years of advocacy by civil society.78 The Sri Lankan National HIV/AIDS Policy provides a rights-based framework with which laws and policies should be aligned. The Sri Lankan National HIV/AIDS Policy outlines the purpose of the National AIDS Committee and establishes a sub-committee on Policy, Law and Ethics. This sub-committee is comprised of government, civil society and development partners. Section 3.11 of the Sri Lankan National HIV/AIDS Policy addresses human rights. It provides \u201cThe Government of Sri Lanka will ensure that the human rights of people living with HIV/AIDS are promoted, protected and respected and measures taken to eliminate discrimination and combat stigma which will provide an enabling environment to 78 The adoption of the National AIDS Policy was an action point in the National Strategic Plan on HIV and AIDS (2007-2011). 23 seek relevant services. These include the rights of everyone to life, liberty and security of person, freedom from inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, equality before law, absence of discrimination, freedom from arbitrary interference with privacy or family life, freedom of movement, the right to work (rights of the people living with HIV in the work places) and to a standard of living adequate for health and well being including housing, food and clothing, the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the right to education, the right to information (which includes the right to knowledge about HIV/AIDS/STI related issues and safer sexual practices), the right to capacity building of the individual in dealing with this condition, the right to participate in the cultural life of the community and to share in scientific advancement and it\u2019s benefit.\u201d The Sri Lankan HIV/AIDS Strategy Policy goes on to imply an endorsement of criminalization of transmission \u201cHowever, steps shall be taken to prevent persons from willfully and knowingly infecting HIV to other persons.\u201d The National STD/AIDS Control Programme (NSACP) of the Sri Lankan Ministry of Health develops and implements the National Strategic Plan.

CONCLUSION Notwithstanding the ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights by all states, and the increasing recognition of the Yogyakarta Principles, there are limited domestic legislative protections which specifically protect the rights of people living with HIV, MSM and transgender people. In all States studied, broad Constitutional protections guarantee equality, non-discrimination, and some recognition of the right to health. While these articles represent significant commitments of the state, rights expressed within national statutes tend to be more accessible to citizens and law enforcement agencies, and easier to claim in a Court of law. Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have put in place policies and strategies relating to public health and HIV; but have not enacted laws or bills to specifically protect the rights of people living with HIV, MSM and transgender people. In India, Nepal and Pakistan, progressive Court judgments and HIV bills evidence some state commitment to extend the laws of anti-discrimination and privacy to people living with HIV, MSM and/or transgender people. The Section 377 decision of the Delhi High Court has had a significant impact, not only nationally, but also regionally and internationally. It has formally reoriented thinking on sexual orientation, in a manner which recognizes the dignity and rights of all people. The rulings of the Nepal Supreme Court and Pakistan Supreme Court recognizing the third gender (noting the limitations outlined in the body of the Reference Report) also represent 24 Regional Legal Reference Resource ground breaking steps in protecting and promoting the rights of people of different (non hetero-normative) sexual orientation and gender identity. Anti-discrimination provisions in the HIV Bills drafted by India, Nepal and Pakistan go some way in addressing discrimination on the grounds of HIV status. Importantly, anti-discrimination provisions extend beyond the public sector, to encompass the private sector (Pakistan, Nepal and India) and \u2018familial and personal life\u2019 (Nepal). Equally, the extension of discrimination on the basis of HIV status to presumed HIV status (for example, \u2018on suspicion\u2019 that a person is HIV positive \u2013 in the Indian, Nepal and Pakistan Bills) represents an important recognition of the impact of stigma on key populations at higher risk. Provisions in the Nepal and Pakistan Bills could be further strengthened by express provisions to include key populations at higher risk under these anti-discrimination provisions. Notably, in India, Nepal and Pakistan, the HIV bills have remained in draft form, for not less than five years. There is now a reasonable argument to suggest there is a need for comprehensive review of all three bills to ensure they reflect national developments and international lessons learned. The challenge of gathering sufficient political will to pass these bills remains. Given the personal and political agendas which change and shape a bill during its passage through parliament, the question needs to be asked whether omnibus HIV laws hold the answer to protecting HIV-related rights. These bills must be viewed in light of their potential to progress the rights agenda and potential to harm the rights-based response to HIV. 25 ANNeX A The Regional Legal Reference Resource recognizes

the existing laws, policies and executive orders in order to understand the effectiveness of the Nepali legal provisions in addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The objective of the legal audit was to measure (by way of an audit tool comprising of a questionnaire) the extent to which Nepal\u2019s legal system is consistent with the standards contained in the International Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights, 1996. The results of the legal audit were published in a report titled \u201cHIV/AIDS and Human Rights: A Legislative Audit\u201d in June 2004.80 The scope of the report has been limited by specific questions forming part of the audit tool.

The findings suggest that these laws so have a direct impact upon the ways in which these men live and have sex with other men. Amending such laws such as Section 365a of the Penal Code would also have a direct impact upon services, including the NSACP, working with these men, for they would no longer be viewed legally as criminals.

Health Care. With regards to health care it was found that PLHIV faced many difficulties when obtaining medical treatment. These were identified as: Lack of confidentiality, lack of informed consent, discrimination against the patients and their families by the hospital staff, lack of basic services and refusal to treat. 2.

It was reported that those who were employed and whose HIV/AIDS status was made known to their employers and co-workers were subject to much discrimination and had to face the lack of regard for confidentiality pertaining to their HIV/AIDS status. 3. Social Life. Due to ignorance and fear, people living with HIV/AIDS and their families are often treated with insensitivity and cruelty. Lack of awareness on what HIV/AIDS is and how it can be transmitted has left many people with misconceptions about the disease. Fear and ignorance can lead to various discriminatory practices, which sometimes turn violent. Conclusion: In addition very little attention is given to a rights based framework in relation to the HIV/ AIDS response, raising issues including the rights and dignity of PLHIV and their families, informed consent, confidentiality, participation and inclusiveness in decision making. For an effective response, it is crucial to have a rights based approach coupled with good governance principles ensuring the decentralisation of health care and decision making in relation to the response.\u201d \u2022\ufffd First\ufffdSri\ufffdLanka\ufffdNational\ufffdConsultation\ufffdMeeting\ufffdon\ufffdMSM,\ufffdHIV\ufffdand\ufffdSexual\ufffdHealth,\ufffd2009,\ufffdreport\ufffdby\ufffdCompanions\ufffdon\ufffd a Journey (supported by UNAIDS, Naz Foundation International, UNDP and the Asia Pacific Coalition on Male Sexual Health) http://www.msmgf.org/files/msmgf//Asia/ART_EN_181109_FIR.pdf Recommendations: Among the recommendations of decriminalizing homosexuality and sensitizing law enforcement officials, a specific recommendation was made under section 3.6 as follows: \u201cMSM and transgenders need to be recognized both institutionally and legally as active participatory citizens in their countries.\u201d \u2022\ufffd People\ufffdLiving\ufffdwith\ufffdHIV\ufffdStigma\ufffdIndex\ufffdSri\ufffdLanka,\ufffdpublished\ufffdby\ufffdthe\ufffdNational\ufffdSTI/AIDS\ufffdControl\ufffdProgramme,\ufffd2010,\ufffd Family Planning Association of Sri Lanka with support from UNAIDS http://www.aidsdatahub.org/dmdocuments/UNAIDS,_Family_Planning_Association_Sri_Lanka_and_ Partners_(2010)_People_Living_with_HIV_Stigma_Index_Sri_Lanka.pdf \u201c13% of respondents claimed that they had their rights abused, but only 38% of these (5 respondents) attempted to get legal redress, of which 3 respondents indicated that nothing happened and 2 claimed that the matter was still being dealt with.

Although, the relevant penal provisions are rarely used, their existence contributes to the ongoing stigma and discrimination these groups face in the community and harassment in the hands of law enforcement agents. 2. Legal provisions drive the MSM community and sex workers underground. 3.

However, opposition to the bill was voiced by some Muslim and Catholic MPs, who stated that homosexuality was not recognised by their faiths. As a result, the sponsors withdrew the bill, fearing that it would spark a damaging debate on religion and ethnicity and create further polarization in an already divided country. After the bill, aimed at decriminalizing homosexuality, was withdrawn, it was pointed out that the wording of the existing \u201canti-homosexual\u201d provision referred only to \u201cman\u201d, and that this was discriminatory. Therefore, the word \u201cperson\u201d was used to replace \u201cman\u201d, resulting in legislation that criminalizes both men and women for same sex sexual activity. In this way, the introduction of a bill aimed at decriminalising homosexual conduct between men ultimately resulted in a widening of the scope of the original law. An anomaly of the legislative process in Sri Lanka means that there is a constitutional bar on judicial review of legislation. This makes it impossible for any legislation, such as the laws against homosexuality, to be challenged in the courts on the grounds that it - or provisions within it - violates the national Constitution\u201d.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3a8be1e1-8c8e-43f4-9bdb-9ed50f823f91": {"__data__": {"id_": "3a8be1e1-8c8e-43f4-9bdb-9ed50f823f91", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-legal-reference-resource", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional Legal Reference Resource", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-legal-reference-resource", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "35e526f8d26062c2806a5d3818b0b6ec1834ce3b0ad72ed226dcb49e15c88755"}, "2": {"node_id": "7d30207a-f2b4-4e3b-bbe2-db5af79dc3ed", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-legal-reference-resource", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1d5880b53cdef94e65f7eaa445cf89bd81845a5acbf1ac010f24fd577b61e537"}}, "hash": "b9d68e95c8f9d84e6abd509593ac502817987a96510ca218ce198b9e3aa417ba", "text": "\u2022\ufffd Legal\ufffdenvironments,\ufffdhuman\ufffdrights\ufffdand\ufffdHIV\ufffdresponses\ufffdamong\ufffdmen\ufffdwho\ufffdhave\ufffdsex\ufffdwith\ufffdmen\ufffdand\ufffdtransgender\ufffd people in Asia and the Pacific: An agenda for action, 2010, UNDP http://www.snap-undp.org/elibrary/Publication.aspx?id=629 The key recommendation made for Sri Lanka on the legal environment for Sri Lanka focuses on reading down the sections of the Penal Code to decriminalize consensual sex between adults and strengthen local and national advocacy efforts with government, educational establishments, medical schools, law enforcement agencies, and the judiciary towards the same as well as reduce discrimination meted towards MSM.

Special thanks to UNDP Bangkok Regional Hub, UNAIDS Regional Support Team and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN ESCAP) for their contribution and review during development of this Report. Acknowledgements 3 The United Nations Country Team, Malaysia T he law can have a profound impact on the lives of people \u2013 especially those who are vulnerable and marginalized. The true test of an inclusive and caring society is reflected in its commitment to protect the rights of minorities. In Malaysia, the HIV epidemic continues to be concentrated among key populations, who often represent highly ostracized and stigmatized segments within all societies. Members of these communities are not only rejected socially, but further marginalized through legal frameworks that cast them as criminals. Criminal laws and discriminatory practices based on moral judgment, superstition, ancient beliefs, fear and misinformation, punish instead of protect. They drive at-risk communities underground, preventing them from accessing lifesaving treatment and prevention information and services, heightening their risk for HIV. The Global Commission on HIV and the Law (2010-2012), a high-level initiative launched in 2010 by UNDP Administrator, Helen Clark, examined how law and practices can transform the global AIDS response.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b8ec046-774d-4246-bd38-1a0955900fe0": {"__data__": {"id_": "0b8ec046-774d-4246-bd38-1a0955900fe0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-and-consultation-policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Review and Consultation on the Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV Services in Malaysia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-and-consultation-policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "00133bc58820bf304973233234483944ec39380e4ae2b1b4ba5e93d5a97efda1"}, "2": {"node_id": "02fbbcd9-5f4c-4fe0-9761-e2aff43d0893", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-and-consultation-policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1046632f74ddfe2da4b5c95999bb4af077f418872f9dbfcb7575cd69195bbc0e"}}, "hash": "6f7ecdcde077e9ba4c910d25f2dd170ec416b0db9c8747b04bb6a6fcdab5dfcc", "text": "The Commission\u2019s findings and recommendations reveal that evidence-based laws and practices firmly grounded in human rights are powerful instruments for challenging discrimination, promoting public health, and protecting human rights.

Now, more than ever, it is time for the country to ensure a policy and legal environment that can support an effective national AIDS response to mitigate the impact of HIV and promote and protect the human rights of people living with HIV and AIDS and those most vulnerable to HIV. I welcome the Review and Consultation on the Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV Services in Malaysia. This review of HIV-related laws and policies identifies legal barriers to accessing health and HIV services for key populations and presents a set of recommendations that can save lives, save money and help end the AIDS epidemic in Malaysia. I hope that individuals and civil society organizations will use this resource to claim their rights, and also that policy and lawmakers, officials responsible for criminal justice, law enforcement officers, national AIDS programme officials, and donors will use it to inform the development and implementation of an enabling legal environment for effective HIV and heath responses.

At the Asia Pacific regional level, governments signed on to the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) Roadmap to 2015, a framework for the implementation of the 2011 Political Declaration. Specifically, the ESCAP Resolutions 66/10 and 67/9 pertaining to the removal of legal and political barriers to universal access and the review of national laws, policies and practices to eliminate all forms of HIV related discrimination, the outcome of the Asia Pacific High Level Inter-governmental Meeting on the Assessment of Progress against Commitments in the Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS and the Millennium Development Goals led to the undertaking of this review and consultation. The review and consultation process adopted the guidance document for Asia and the Pacific Region \u2013 Creating Enabling Legal Environments: Conducting National Reviews and Multi-Sector Consultations on Legal and Policy Barriers to HIV Services (Ad-Hoc UN Regional Interagency Team on AIDS on Enabling Legal Environments, 2013). PART ONE 8 Review and Consultation on the Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV Services in Malaysia There are two main components to this Review: i. Analysis on the policy and legal environments in the context of access to and delivery of HIV services. ii. Multi-stakeholder consultation to discuss the preliminary findings of the study and propose policy and legal reforms to strengthen access to and delivery of HIV services to the Malaysian government. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (ISEAN-HIVOS regional initiative) provided funds for this project. Methodology For this study a qualitative approach was deemed suitable to collect data as respondents\u2019 experiences in law and policy making and enforcement were sought. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with representatives from select entities from the governmental and non-governmental sectors. These organisations were selected by the Project Technical Steering Group Committee as they were directly involved in HIV and AIDS initiatives and engaged in dialogue on related laws and policies. The respondents included the Ministry of Health, Federal Territory Islamic Affairs Department (JAWI), Human Rights Commission Malaysian (SUHAKAM), Kuala Lumpur Legal Aid Centre, Malaysian AIDS Council and PT Foundation (PTF). The Attorney-General\u2019s Chambers was unavailable for an interview. In addition, data was obtained from the proceedings of the national Review and Consultation on the Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV Services in Malaysia, specifically the recommendations that were produced by participants. A literature review was undertaken on laws, policies and practices that affect key populations or most-at-risk populations such as persons who use drugs (PWUD), men who have sex with men (MSM), transgenders and sex workers and their access to HIV services. Sources of literature were peer- reviewed articles (e.g. social sciences and health sciences); articles specific to Malaysia were limited indicating a dearth in HIV and AIDS research. Document analysis also included primary sources such as strategic plans, articles of law (Constitutional and Sharia law), as well as other documents such as local, regional and international reports on law, health and HIV and AIDS.

Resources that were of relevance to this topic were also used to provide a broader perspective on legal aspects that effected HIV interventions and the implications for public health. The literature encompassed peer reviewed articles, government reports, non- governmental documents and findings from studies and reviews by other agencies, including the Global Commission on HIV and the Law. The consequences of laws and their enforcement and HIV are well documented in many countries and settings. In particular, the key populations or most-at-risk populations of sex workers, men who have sex with men, transgender and injecting drug users affected by the epidemic are also the populations most effected by laws primarily due to their engagement in illicit behaviour and are criminalised[1].", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7788b9f3-fec5-44be-ab41-b757bfd25279": {"__data__": {"id_": "7788b9f3-fec5-44be-ab41-b757bfd25279", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-and-consultation-policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Review and Consultation on the Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV Services in Malaysia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-and-consultation-policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "922868e739dd5589241458f875972b874163442a542ca40e14ed9333e93e96b1"}, "2": {"node_id": "88cf3932-3c18-4c78-8cae-c5054fdd0610", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-and-consultation-policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "627368d18d6de7b3174c18d8138b760a385bbb7956ed25aa4b2f38bfc3db645d"}}, "hash": "a1d64ae837f6e54b236d544455360462bfb2cc2584ca93da6dbd13112a2fc5e5", "text": "In addition, there are HIV-specific legislations to prosecute intentional HIV exposure, nondisclosure and transmission cases.

Their vulnerable and marginalised status places them at increased risk of HIV transmission, and criminalisation heightens these risks and reinforces stigma and discrimination. The immediate effect of illegality is these populations retreat into spaces that are difficult to access by service providers, i.e. underground, with dire ramifications for public health interventions. Outreach to these populations to deliver education on HIV are hampered as is their access to prevention initiatives (including harm minimisation programmes, e.g. syringe and needle exchange, medication-assisted treatment for opioid dependence and condom distribution), healthcare services (e.g. voluntary testing and counselling services) and antiretroviral therapy. PART TWO 10 Review and Consultation on the Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV Services in Malaysia In the report \u201cRedefining AIDS in Asia: Crafting an Effective Response\u201d by the Commission on AIDS in Asia [3], it was emphasised that the need for \u2018an enabling environment\u2019 was critical in minimising the impediments to prevention and care initiatives and the delivery of services. An enabling environment that relates to the law and HIV entails that \u201claws and policies against discrimination on the basis of HIV status, risk behaviour, occupation, and gender are in place are monitored and enforced\u201d [4]. Structural level intervention is a key strategy in facilitating an environment conducive for individual and programmatic approaches and initiatives to mitigate HIV transmission. Malaysia \u2013 HIV, laws, regulations and policies Status of the epidemic The HIV situation in Malaysia is characterised as a concentrated epidemic with most cases reported among injecting drug users, MSM, transgenders and sex workers. Injecting drug users represent between 70-80 per cent of the total reported HIV cases, with 65,032 as of end 2011 [5]. While HIV transmission through injecting drug use remains significant, since 2011 HIV infection through sexual transmission, including among young people, transgender persons and men who have sex with men, accounted for more of the new cases than through injecting drug use [5]. In response to the current and projected HIV situation, stated in the National Strategic Plan on HIV and AIDS 2011-2015[6], is the key strategy of \u201cimproving the quality and coverage of prevention programmes among most at risk and vulnerable populations\u201d (p.19). To facilitate the implementation of this strategy is the tandem strategy of \u201cmaintaining and improving an enabling environment for HIV prevention, treatment, care and support\u201d (p.19). However, it is difficult to identify tangible programmes that directly address the increasing sexual transmission rates among key affected populations. Furthermore, it is unclear how the MoH allocates resources (funds and technical support) to implement such programmes. Law and regulations The legal system instituted in Malaysia is that of common law, which was inherited from the country\u2019s last colonial power, the British. Similar to most countries, Malaysia has laws that reflect its unique circumstances and, as in this case, this has manifested in a dual justice system. Sharia law applies to people who adhere to the Islamic faith and is parallel to the other spectrum of law under the Constitution; it deals with all conducts of Muslims in the country specifically in the matters related to family law and religious administration.

As will be evident in the analysis that follows the requisite enabling environments to facilitate development of policies and implementation of effective programmes, have not for the most part been established. Most-at-risk populations or key affected populations Injecting drug users or people who inject drugs Malaysia has a punitive approach to \u201cdadah\u201d or illicit drugs \u2013 zero tolerance and drug free \u2013and have wide-ranging policies and laws related to prevention, treatment and rehabilitations (e.g. drug use, possession and trafficking). Alarmed by the rapid increase in illicit drug use in the 1970s, particularly among males in the workforce, the government took a hard-line stance and declared the drug problem as a threat to national security[7]. The prevailing response spearheaded by the United States of America and the United Nations during that period was the strict control of drugs, from its cultivation to use[8]. The government adopted this approach, setting the goal of becoming a drug free nation; punitive laws and harsh, compulsory detention and rehabilitation programmes for drug users convicted of drug offences were instituted. The criminalisation of drugs was further justified to curb the emerging HIV epidemic among injecting drug users. Numerous studies have shown that laws and enforcement practices of laws which criminalise drug use lead to an environment that increases the HIV vulnerability of drug users [9, 10]. Injecting drug 12 Review and Consultation on the Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV Services in Malaysia users face constant harassment and threat of arrest by police and law enforcement officers for the possession of injecting equipment (including sterile paraphernalia). They are reluctant to carry needles and syringes, thus, increasing the likelihood of sharing injecting equipment and exposure to HIV infection. In order to avoid run-ins with the police or raids, injecting drug users would hurriedly inject drugs and if they are sharing paraphernalia they are unlikely to be using clean equipment. As well, needles and syringes would be disposed of unsafely, e.g. dropped in the alleyways, and other users may pick up these unsterile equipment and reuse them. Aggressive law enforcement practices can lead to injecting drug user populations being driven underground or to become more hidden, inducing them to engage in riskier behaviour. For example, they may use the services of \u2018professional\u2019 injectors located in concealed locations who will administer the drugs to multiple injecting drug users, often using the same injecting equipment. Provision and access to HIV services Although harsh laws are the mainstay to the drug use problem there has been a major transformation in drug policy that has clear effect whereby HIV transmission rates have reportedly decreased among injecting drug users[11]. In the mid-2000s the pilot methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) and needle and syringe exchange program (NSEP) initiatives were approved by the government for implementation and subsequently resulted in positive outcomes[12, 13]. The MMT is administered through government healthcare centres and by private medical practitioners, and the NSEP is mainly delivered by NGOs[14]. A further discernible shift is the move away from addressing drug use as a purely criminal justice matter towards incorporating health and wellbeing strategies and requiring an inter-sectoral partnership approach [14]. As such, health sector entities, AIDS technical and policy committees and law enforcement agencies are now together endeavouring to deal with the prevention and treatment aspects of drug use. In 2010 the trajectory towards a client centred, voluntary, non- criminal approach to drug treatment and rehabilitation manifested in the establishment of the Cure and Care Clinics by the National Anti-Drugs Agency[15]. These clinics are slated to replace the approximately 28 PUSPENs (narcotics addiction rehabilitation centres) which are viewed as an unsuccessful programme with reported high relapse rates of between 70 and 90 per cent among those who underwent rehabilitation [16]. These substantial efforts in the past five years to curb the rapid increase in HIV among injecting drug users has seen a decrease in the rate of HIV transmissions through the sharing of needles and in 2011, reported cases of HIV infection through sexual transmission exceeded infection through injecting drug use [5].", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bed736ab-507f-4455-9581-7940873dd70a": {"__data__": {"id_": "bed736ab-507f-4455-9581-7940873dd70a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-and-consultation-policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Review and Consultation on the Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV Services in Malaysia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-and-consultation-policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eaa2143fce336d110aa54c8673bd2259026b76165ed6dd70e233b1475484254b"}, "2": {"node_id": "5f0f363f-e9d5-4d46-9356-9fbb93a6c764", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-and-consultation-policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "12c444d95c674a13a154bf3133c704dd4529399959d64eb61a07abd08e2292af"}}, "hash": "d8eeec8b89c8cde59ebf2d4af517c547c2e3da044389242a26fbdfe3ba8c55f6", "text": "As well, the government\u2019s undertaking of harm minimisation or reduction programmes to accelerate the response to HIV has contributed to, a) a fall in the number of drug users detained in PUSPENs, thus, lessening exposure to other communicable diseases; b) injecting drug users receiving MMT reportedly being more likely to adhere to antiretroviral therapy; c) a change to safer injecting behaviour; and d) the increased capacity of injecting drug users on opiate substitution treatment to retain employment", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9fa4bc5c-0d15-40f2-9cd4-18aae4c7c7c7": {"__data__": {"id_": "9fa4bc5c-0d15-40f2-9cd4-18aae4c7c7c7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-and-consultation-policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Review and Consultation on the Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV Services in Malaysia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-and-consultation-policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5aaccc96abc998b3e33af3ea6bbd021d8c03ab3d0a07287720ed53b0535c6a06"}}, "hash": "5aaccc96abc998b3e33af3ea6bbd021d8c03ab3d0a07287720ed53b0535c6a06", "text": "[13, 14, 17]. Furthermore, this shift in drug policy towards a focus on health and wellbeing of the individual signals a change in how drug users are viewed that may lead to decreasing stigma. In turn, this may encourage drug users to access healthcare services and treatment. The new approach and transition to harm reduction strategies has unsurprisingly not been without barriers. Although the Ministry of Health and the Royal Malaysian Police have made cooperative efforts to enable the implementation of the NSEP and MMT (i.e. the National Needle and Syringe Exchange Program: Police Standard Operating Procedure)[18],the fundamental \u201cclash\u201d between punitive drug policies and harm minimisation strategies has impeded the carrying out of these programmes. Illustrative of this conflict is the law on the possession of injecting equipment - Section 13 The United Nations Country Team, Malaysia 37 of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 \u2013which is contrary to the key component of the NSEP of providing sterile paraphernalia. It has been reported that injecting drug users accessing the needle syringe exchange and methadone provision sites continue to face harassment and arrest by law enforcement personnel around the vicinity [14]. As stated above, law enforcement practices often lead to the dispersal of drug users and their retreat to hidden locations. HIV services are interrupted when NGO workers are unable to locate the injecting drug users to deliver harm minimization information and materials, and they are unlikely to attend the drop-in facilities that provide services, including basic medical attention, counselling and respite care. The entrenched view that the appropriate recourse to illicit drugs and drug taking behavior is a prohibitionist approach deepens the stigma attached to drug users and discrimination towards them in many settings, including at health care facilities. Medical practitioners have been known to be hesitant in prescribing anti-retroviral therapy to HIV positive injecting drug users due to concerns regarding poor adherence [14]. As well, injecting drug users are unlikely to seek treatment and health services if they perceive they will be discriminated against. Laws and enforcement practices \u2013 enablers or impediments to HIV services In Malaysia, there are six main statutes pertaining to drug offences. These are the i) Dangerous Drugs Act 1852, ii) Poisons Act 1952, iii) Drug Dependants (Treatment and Rehabilitation) Act 1983, iv) Dangerous Drugs (Special Preventive Measures) Act 1985, v) Dangerous Drugs (Forfeiture of Property) Act 1988 and; vi) National Anti-Drug Agency Act 2004. The agencies responsible for the implementation and enforcement of the laws are the Internal Security Ministry and National Anti- Drugs Agency. The details of these laws are presented in Table 1. Laws Details Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 (revised 1980): \u2022\ufffdSection\ufffd9 Possession of prepared opium is an offence \u2022\ufffdSection\ufffd10\ufffd(2) Criminalisation of possession of utensils used to prepare opium \u2022\ufffdSection\ufffd15 Self-administering a dangerous drug is an offence Drug Dependants (Treatment & Rehabilitation) Act 1983 Mandatory to detain and rehabilitate a person with drug dependency National Anti Drug Agency Act 2004 Mandate: main agency responsible for policy formulation on drug use prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and enforcement Table 1 The main approaches to addressing laws and policies that are barriers to addressing HIV and AIDS and injecting drug use that should be considered are: a) decriminalising or depenalising individual drug use and possession, and b) integrating harm reduction into law enforcement and drug control 14 Review and Consultation on the Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV Services in Malaysia policy[19]. Evidence demonstrates that such approaches have not increased drug dependency or the prevalence of drug use[19]. Depenalising is a less punitive approach that would include practical diversionary methods to redirect the offender from the criminal justice system to non-punitive interventions such as community- based treatment and voluntary rehabilitation. This would reduce incarceration and the pressure on the prisons system and allow for access to a range of health and social services. Although the Ministry of Health and the Royal Malaysian Police have made efforts to cooperate on the implementation of the NSEP and MMT, the full integration of harm reduction strategies into law enforcement policies and practices is required. For on-the-ground policing to reflect incorporation of the strategies, comprehensive education and training of law enforcement officers are required; a significant gap exists of police personnel knowledge (at various levels) on harm reduction and its link to curbing the spread of HIV [18]. The above two approaches should be applied in tandem, as a single approach is unlikely to achieve the goals of reducing drug use and its potential harm to the individual and wider community, and mitigate the transmission of HIV.

In addition, law enforcement efforts can be re-focused on drug trafficking and securing public safety. Sex\ufffdwork\ufffdand\ufffdsex\ufffdworkers A study by Lim, Ang and Teh [20] reported there are an estimated 60,000 sex workers in the country, of whom 40,000 are female and 20,000 are transgender persons (mostly female transgenders); estimates of male sex workers is unavailable. An Integrated Bio-Behavioral Surveillance study conducted in 2012 reported a HIV prevalence of 4.2 per cent among female sex workers[11]. In the sex work industry many sex workers are based in venues such as brothels and entertainment outlets, while others do not work at specific locations and are street based. The Malaysian public\u2019s impression of sex workers and sex work is shaped largely through the media where police raids on brothels, massage parlours or karaoke outlets are reported to create sensational news[21]; or the tagging of \u2018red light\u2019 areas identified with sex workers and brothels. The negative and illicit image is compounded by the close association of sex workers and sexual transmission of HIV, and combined with the overlay of criminalisation of sex work, pose serious challenges to HIV policies and programmes. The illegality of sex work exposes the vulnerable position of sex workers to HIV, which impact on their access to HIV programmes. Sukhtantar [22] posits there are several factors that contribute to their vulnerability - the work, violence and limited access to healthcare services. The conditions surrounding sex work such as concealment of sexual relations and threat of exposure lead to inconsistent safe sex practices. The threat of and actual harm to and victimisation of sex workers by perpetrators (e.g. clients and law enforcement personnel) place sex workers at higher risk of being infected [23]. The inadequate access to prevention and treatment services, often due to stigmatisation and discrimination by healthcare and welfare providers, limit sex workers\u2019 capacity to protect against infection and obtain antiretroviral therapy and sexually transmitted infections screening and treatment[24]. The criminalisation and harsh law enforcement practices targeting sex workers in Malaysia has raised multiple layers of issues [25-27], including: 15 The United Nations Country Team, Malaysia \u2022\ufffd harassment\ufffd by\ufffd personnel\ufffd from\ufffd the\ufffd many\ufffd law\ufffd enforcement\ufffd bodies\ufffd (i.e.\ufffd police\ufffd vice\ufffd squad,\ufffd immigration department, anti-drugs agency and the religious police), and allegations of extensive corruption; \u2022\ufffd the\ufffdthreat\ufffdof\ufffddetention\ufffdfor\ufffdengaging\ufffdin\ufffdsex\ufffdwork\ufffdby\ufffdlaw\ufffdenforcement\ufffdofficers\ufffdif\ufffdsex\ufffdworkers\ufffdare\ufffd found to possess condoms (exceeding three); used condoms taken and used as evidence of sex work activity, thus, countering HIV prevention interventions, i.e. condom promotion and safe sex behaviour; \u2022\ufffd pervasive\ufffd abuse\ufffd against\ufffd sex\ufffd workers\ufffd (e.g.\ufffd by\ufffd pimps,\ufffd clients,\ufffd partners\ufffd and\ufffd law\ufffd enforcement\ufffd personnel); and \u2022\ufffd disempowerment\ufffdof\ufffdsex\ufffdworkers\ufffdas\ufffdthere\ufffdare\ufffdimpediments\ufffdto\ufffdcomplaints\ufffdand\ufffdrecourse\ufffdagainst\ufffd violations by law enforcement personnel (both civil and religious). Provision and access to HIV services The context of sex work (i.e. illegality, invisibility and social marginalisation) poses many challenges to delivering HIV services to sex workers and their clients in Malaysia. The few service providers are mostly community-based organisations who are best skilled and experienced to work with the community. Provision of services include outreach work (e.g. to brothels), peer-to-peer education and drop-in centres which provide education on HIV and sexually transmitted infections and safe sex practices, commodities (e.g. condoms and lubricants), and information on voluntary testing and counselling. A legal environment that facilitates and empowers is a pre-requisite for prevention and treatment programmes to be effectively carried out. Critically, how these laws are interpreted by enforcement officers is a key factor to ensuring programmes are not challenged and sex workers have unimpeded access to health promotion and social services. For example, an essential prevention strategy is education on safe sex practices and the appropriate use of and distribution of condoms and lubricants.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01f8e4c1-2fe9-45ac-b250-dcea04c10b02": {"__data__": {"id_": "01f8e4c1-2fe9-45ac-b250-dcea04c10b02", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-and-consultation-policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Review and Consultation on the Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV Services in Malaysia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-and-consultation-policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "68669fc08dbc7abed796296c40b24e7f8adb5ff35b00dd89ca031466efd7bb69"}, "2": {"node_id": "a6d1b178-d503-4a59-a285-3c4644679ae5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-and-consultation-policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3e19edf256b5e6e92bcb3728023b49c2e21a646319dac726f894fc8e6868be29"}}, "hash": "7c281c043c09538324dd01971f94672f85e5c939c8329f1afe5d7e5dc3f62fcf", "text": "Yet, a common enforcement practice is to cite possession of condoms as evidence of sex work (see above) which undoes prevention efforts and also damages working relations (i.e. trust is fractured) between field/outreach workers and sex workers, jeopardising future service provision.

For example, sex workers are reported to have avoided seeking treatment for sexually transmitted infections and reproductive health services at most public health care clinics [28] as they encounter staff", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "582ffa4e-3136-4d65-b2c9-793ff945b967": {"__data__": {"id_": "582ffa4e-3136-4d65-b2c9-793ff945b967", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-and-consultation-policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Review and Consultation on the Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV Services in Malaysia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-and-consultation-policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0bcf93b75c2f703b3c102cf9e68cd4249f136b7823c200a735dcc57898463858"}, "3": {"node_id": "6120c1ac-5a0b-4261-9c15-36da13e9ce93", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-and-consultation-policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "256664a36507841e45cb9e70b9fd195ee2173c77b424331706107932088983a3"}}, "hash": "dccc4f8a3f00a10dd3606227c21f8315b50ab46dcf0be5a81b48ee967b7f5c4a", "text": "that have not been appropriately trained to administer to sex workers and their specific needs, instead disregarding sex workers as individuals with rights to health and health care. Adverse consequences also directly affect the staff of organisations which provide HIV services.

At drop-in centres a perceivable decrease in sex workers accessing the facilities is noted when raids conducted by law enforcement authorities to expose \u201cillegal\u201d activities have been conducted in the vicinity, as sex workers would retreat underground. Also, law enforcement officers have been reported to harass sex workers as they access facilities that dispense HIV related services. 16 Review and Consultation on the Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV Services in Malaysia Laws and enforcement practices \u2013 enablers or impediments to HIV services The laws that criminalise sex work and sex workers in many countries are often: \u2022\ufffd criminal\ufffdoffences\ufffdpertaining\ufffdto\ufffdadult\ufffdsex\ufffdwork\ufffdand\ufffdthe\ufffdsex\ufffdindustry;\ufffd \u2022\ufffd public\ufffdorder,\ufffdvagrancy\ufffdand\ufffdother\ufffdoffences\ufffdselectively\ufffdenforced\ufffdagainst\ufffdsex\ufffdworkers;\ufffd \u2022\ufffd trafficking\ufffdlaws\ufffdthat\ufffdare\ufffdenforced\ufffdagainst\ufffdsex\ufffdworkers,\ufffdrather\ufffdthan\ufffdtraffickers. In Malaysia, the types of laws and offences applied to sex work and sex workers are consistent with the above categories. Sex work conducted in private is not illegal, however, the act of soliciting and operating a brothel are both illegal. The Penal Code (Act 574) and Minor Offences Act 1955 are laws that directly relate to sex work and sex workers. In addition, Sharia law is applied to Muslims who engage in sex work \u2013 the acts of \u2018zina\u2019 and \u2018khalwat\u2019. In Table 2, the details of the laws are provided. While the intent of the law is to penalise all elements related to the sex industry, strategies must be identified and applied to minimise the adverse consequences of criminalisation that compromise the national HIV response and to uphold the basic human right to health. A step-by-step approach to repealing laws and converting punitive law enforcement practices to collaborative initiatives among key stakeholder, within the government and non-governmental partners is required. Existing collaboration between the two sectors, albeit on a modest scale to curtail disruption of HIV services by law enforcement practices should be strengthened. These include developing standard operating procedures that accommodate HIV interventions, continued training for relevant government agencies on their role in contributing to a response that is health based (e.g. not presenting used condoms as evidence of sex work), intensifying the dialogues and negotiations at policy and operational levels to actualise practical agreements and actions (e.g. deterring abuse and violations of sex workers), and joint field expeditions to study successful measures applied by countries with similar situations (these approaches can also be applied to the drug use setting). A necessary step is a legal review of laws and criminal penalties pertaining to sex work, specifically the Minor Offences Act and the Penal Code (Act 574) (see Table 2), in conjunction with an examination of regulatory frameworks that have been applied to sex work venues (including brothels and entertainment outlets) and harm reduction programmes (i.e. condom promotion) in neighbouring countries that may be plausible and practical alternatives. It is important for the state to a) affirm the basic rights of sex workers in equality under the law and to access legal services and non- discriminatory health services, and b) sanction protection of sex workers from all forms of violence and exploitation. In addition, mechanisms for sex workers to report abuse by law enforcement officers should be established and penalties applied. Men who have sex with men The number of men who have sex with men in Malaysia was estimated to be 173,000 in 2008 [9]. As of end 2011 there were 2,406 reported cases of HIV among this population, or 2.5 per cent of the total reported cumulative cases of HIV[5]; incidence rates of HIV infection within this community is unknown. Compared with the HIV epidemic among injecting drug users, the reported cases of HIV among men who have sex with men is relatively low. However, HIV infection through sexual transmission is on the increase and has surpassed injecting drug use in the last two years [9].", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6120c1ac-5a0b-4261-9c15-36da13e9ce93": {"__data__": {"id_": "6120c1ac-5a0b-4261-9c15-36da13e9ce93", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-and-consultation-policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Review and Consultation on the Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV Services in Malaysia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-and-consultation-policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0bcf93b75c2f703b3c102cf9e68cd4249f136b7823c200a735dcc57898463858"}, "2": {"node_id": "582ffa4e-3136-4d65-b2c9-793ff945b967", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-and-consultation-policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dccc4f8a3f00a10dd3606227c21f8315b50ab46dcf0be5a81b48ee967b7f5c4a"}}, "hash": "256664a36507841e45cb9e70b9fd195ee2173c77b424331706107932088983a3", "text": "The men who have sex with men population is facing a rapid increase of HIV infections, in which MSM are disproportionately affected by the epidemic; men who have sex with men are 18.7 times more likely to be infected than in the general population[29].

The government heavily subsidises anti-retroviral treatments and associated medical treatments in public healthcare centres, e.g. hospitals, but from anecdotal testimonies of some HIV positive men who have sex with men, they prefer to seek treatment in neighbouring countries.

The social exclusion and continued marginalisation permeates most aspects of their lives, from attaining legal employment and accommodation to educational opportunities, leaving them with little recourse but to turn to sex work for a livelihood and to secure funds for hormonal treatments and sex re-assignment and related surgery surgeries[40]. The urgency to gain an income often increases risk-taking behaviours, such as acquiescing to clients\u2019 demand to abstain from the use of condoms.

Clients may assault them or refuse to pay for the service; transgenders are disinclined to lodge reports with the police regarding these transgressions for fear of reprisal from clients or threat of arrest (i.e. engagement in sex work) by the enforcement authorities.

If they are detained by law enforcement officers, they face an intimidating situation while in custody. These include procedural arrangements that place them in cells with men which jeopardises their safety, degrading and humiliating treatment (some transgenders have disclosed anecdotally that they have been forced to expose their genitalia), and persecution based on their gender orientation[27]. If they are incarcerated for a longer period (e.g. prison) they are likely to be targeted by other inmates and experience various forms of violence, including sexual abuse which increases risk of sexually transmitted infections (STI) and HIV[41]. Furthermore, access to medical care (i.e. sexual reproductive health [SRH] services) may be denied. Provision and access to HIV services The increased visibility of mak nyahs, in part, is attributed to their inclusion as one of the populations most-at-risk within the context of the HIV epidemic as many are engaged in sex work. Interventions to educate on HIV and AIDS, prevention methods and facilitating peer support have been carried out at the grassroots level by a few community-based groups. Cognizant of the high levels of stigma and discrimination against transgenders, the underlying approach of the programmes conducted by some community-based organisations (e.g. PTF) is to empower the individual and community which are manifested in modalities including development of the self and human rights. The HIV related aspects are interventions or programmatic areas that range from peer outreach to drop-in centres that incorporate safe sex education, counselling, peer support, basic health services and 21 The United Nations Country Team, Malaysia training related to legal rights. HIV services are concentrated in Kuala Lumpur, and transgenders located away from the capital city have scant options. While HIV prevention and treatment interventions are vital, another health related necessity for transgenders is sexual and reproductive health information and medical services. Specialised SRH services for transgenders is scarce and only provided by few providers, including private medical practitioners and NGOs (e.g. Family Health Development Association). The lack of services to an extent has led to a common practice among transgenders to share information and seek advice through their peer networks on SRH matters and hormone treatments. Often, this leads to inaccurate information and self-prescribed administration of medicines and hormone therapy. Few female transgenders are likely to view the public health sector as being able to meet their specific reproductive health needs, not least because of the discrimination they face but also few medical practitioners are trained and have the expertise to manage mak nyahs\u2019 complex health requirements and HIV related treatment. The judgemental attitudes of many health care workers and their poor comprehension of the multiple socio-economic and legal issues affecting transgenders create an unreceptive environment that deters their use of these facilities. The repressive environment and adversities experienced by transgenders often result in their low self-esteem and contribute to mental health issues. Drug use is not uncommon among transgenders which adds yet another layer of complexity to the health issues faced by them. Laws, policies and enforcement practices \u2013 enablers or impediments to HIV services As discussed in the above section on legislation and sex work, a punitive approach has adverse consequences for mitigating the impact of HIV on the sex worker population. For the many transgenders engaged in the sex industry, the ramifications are compounded by the unique set of circumstances related to their gender orientation and identity. Underlying their vulnerability to HIV is the absence of formal recourse to establishing a legal identity that records their self-identified gender and not the gender assigned at birth. In Malaysia, the legal framework does not recognise or allow for a change in sex . Without official identity documents mak nyahs encounter overwhelming barriers in conducting their day-to-day affairs, be it seeking employment or accessing public facilities. For example, most workplace regulations require employees to abide by a dress-code that reflects the employee\u2019s gender which creates a barrier for most transgenders to comply, thus narrowing their options of employment. In health care settings, transgenders have been known to have been turned away or treated discourteously which have resulted in non-access to medical treatment or deterring them from seeking health care services. The laws which apply to transgender sex workers are the same as for other sex workers, and these are the Penal Code and Minor Offences Acts under civil law, and Muslim adherents are subject to Sharia law on sex work and in addition, to a specific law on \u201cmale posing as a woman\u201d (Section 28), as presented in Table 4.

These arrests are often reported by the media in sensational terms and accompanied by inappropriate images of those arrested; it appears the intended aim is to cause deep embarrassment and shame. Public statements by Muslim religious leaders and senior government officers of religious affairs department such as those denouncing transgenders and issuing recommendation that are not evidence based to \u2018rehabilitate\u2019 transgenders further magnifies already prevalent stigma associated with mak nyahs [42].Such pronouncements do not aid the Department of Islamic Development in their strategy to reach out to the may nyah community offering pathways to employment, self-development and HIV education [43]. There is compelling evidence that that criminalisation and punitive approaches to transgenders, particularly mak nyah sex workers, undermine the provision of HIV prevention and treatment services. There are two major aspects in the legislative framework that should be considered for legal review, namely laws pertaining to sex work and the sex industry (i.e. the Minor Offences Act and the Penal Code Section 574), and legal gender change. A legal review of the laws regarding sex work and sex workers as presented above (pg 10-11) namely decriminalisation and depenalisation, apply to transgender sex workers and are highly vital as they are disproportionately at higher risk of HIV infection. Law enforcement practices, in particular, are cause for concern as it appears the authorities are allowed to carry out their duties that transgress ethical codes of conduct when dealing with mak nyahs. Standard operating procedures which integrate non-discriminatory regulations should be established and adhered to, and a mechanism established that enables transgenders to lodge reports of violations and abuses without exposing themselves to recrimination.

Young\ufffdkey\ufffdaffected\ufffdpopulation\ufffd(YKAP) Malaysia has a relatively young population with almost half comprising of children (0-14 years at 29.4%) and young people (15-24 years at 17.2%), as of 2010[44]. Of the total number of HIV cases, 35% are among young people aged between 13-29 years; the majority are heterosexual males who acquired HIV through injecting drug use[5]. The number of HIV cases for children below 13 years of age account for approximately 1% of total cases; most infections are attributed to vertical transmission [5]. However, the prevention of the vertical transmission programme has been relatively successful in stemming the rates of infection from mother to infant [11]. The lowered rate of new infections from mother-to-child transmission is not reflected in infection among older children or adolescents. The rate of infection for girls and women appear to be rising in the past 10 years, accounting for 20% of new reported infections in 2010 [5]. For this report, the focus will be on adolescents (i.e. less than 18 years) affected and infected by HIV, or young key affected people. There are many layers of complexity when responding to children in relation to HIV. As a starting point, children are not a homogenous population but are markedly different according to their 24 Review and Consultation on the Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV Services in Malaysia stage of biological, psychological and behavioural development (i.e. at different ages); the evolving capacity of the child to make independent decisions is a vital consideration vis-\u00e0-vis interventions that directly affect them - Article 5, CRC [45]. In addition, there are inequalities that directly affect the status of the child or adolescent, including gender and socio-economic position, which contribute to their vulnerability and risk taking behaviour, particularly among young girls. Studies have shown that globally many adolescent girls experience sexual violence and forced sexual intercourse at an early age which places them at increased risk of HIV infection. The varying levels of vulnerability and degrees of risk requires specific interventions for distinct groups of young people, such as adolescents who are marginalised and more vulnerable, adolescent girls and adolescents living with HIV [46]. There has been limited research on HIV knowledge and sexual behaviour among young key affected people in Malaysia. However, available information indicates that many respondents have low knowledge of HIV and prevention methods, are engaged in at-risk behaviour (e.g. unsafe sex and injecting drug use), and begin sexual activity before 18 years of age [47, 48]. This suggests a gap in accessibility to and provision of HIV prevention education and services. Provision and access to HIV services Much of the HIV initiatives for adolescents focuses on general information on HIV and AIDS and are designed for delivery in institutional settings. The avenues of information on HIV for adolescents are mostly public campaigns, school curriculum (but it is unclear if its delivery is consistent), government peer education programme among youths, school-based outreach by NGOs and youth drop-in centres that incorporate HIV education. Much of the education and distribution of information are targeted at the general adolescent population and limited to the larger cities, and few programmes address the segment of adolescents most vulnerable and at-risk of infection. Of particular concern is the segment of young key affected people who engage in injecting drug use, same sex sexual activity and sex work, exposing them to a higher risk of HIV infection. Knowledge on prevention in relation to these high risk activities that is specific for young key affected people is minimal and their (irregular, and if any) access to harm reduction information and technologies may only be through NGO outreach activities specific to adult most-at-risk populations. Similarly, health care services related to STI and SRH that is specific to the needs of adolescents is minimal and difficult for young key affected people to access. Adolescents, particularly the most-at-risk, would be averse to seeking services that in their views would breach their confidentiality and their identity would be disclosed to law enforcement officers and their parents or guardians. Also, they would be discouraged by the perceived stigma that is attached to involvement in illicit activities. As will be discussed in the section below, the provision of and accessibility to the prevention, treatment, and care and support package is determined to an extent by the legal framework which establishes the parameters that \u2018permit\u2019 the delivery of HIV and health related services to adolescents.

Further to the CRC, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No 3, sets out legal approaches for dealing with children and HIV and AIDS that include laws, policies, programmes which are non-discriminatory, facilitate children\u2019s access to HIV services, allow for their participation to shape responses, and prioritises the needs and best interest of the child. Subsequent to the Child Act 2001, the government developed the 25 The United Nations Country Team, Malaysia National Policy on Children and the National Child Protection Policy (2009) which focus on the rights of the child to survival, protection, development and participation, in alignment with the principles of the CRC.As well, the policies emphasise the protection of children from all forms of harm and strengthening social and welfare support services to address the specific issues of children in need. It is unclear whether strategies for the provision of practical and accessible HIV prevention, treatment and care services have been incorporated into the policies. The primary concerns in relation to HIV and young people include the various forms of stigma and discrimination they face (e.g. living with HIV, having a family member with HIV, gender and sexual orientation), access to STI and SRH services (e.g. medical care, prevention technologies, voluntary HIV testing and counselling), HIV treatment and care, and voluntary rehabilitation services. The accessibility of these services by young key affected people is bound by the national legislative framework which also has implications on service providers and the support they can offer. It should be noted that the mandate of the laws is to be protective of minors. A recent study on \u2018Addressing Barriers and Improving Access to Comprehensive HIV Health Services in Malaysia for Young Key Affected Population\u2019 [47] identified laws which impede young key affected people\u2019saccess to HIV prevention and treatment. These laws pertain to the legal determination of the age of a child, the age of criminal responsibility, and the age of legal capacity, illegal and illicit behaviour (i.e. same sex sexual activity, drug use and sex work) parental consent, legal age of marriage and consent to sex and the rights to confidentiality. In Table 5, an overview of these laws and the implications on access to HIV, STI and SRH prevention and treatment are presented. It is recognised there are multiple perspectives on the matter of the law, HIV and children. The priority is to ensure policies and strategies are in place to minimise the risk of young people, particular those most-at-risk, from HIV infection. Different approaches are required to address the challenges that arise from the legislative framework and policies which impede young people\u2019s access to HIV and related health care services, particularly within the context of the increasing rate of HIV infection through sexual transmission. One approach is to be cognizant of laws which are not harmonised, thus, contributing to contradictory translation of regulations among those involved in the care, support and protections of young people, including government social, welfare and health agencies, NGOs and parents/guardians. For example, service providers have the view that they are not permitted to make available SRH educational resources and clinical services to young people who have not reached the age of majority (18 years), without parental permission, or they can only be provided for \u201cspecial cases\u201d (e.g. young person living with HIV). However, the age of consent to sex at 16 years allows older adolescents to be legally sexually active. A coherent and systematic approach is required to ensure that legislation and policies reflect the current national situation of children affected by HIV, are based on evidence and have considered models for service provision. The evolving capacity of young person\u2019s capacity to make informed and independent decisions have to be recognised, and their participation encouraged in order to actualise their right to health and health care. People living with HIV The number of people living with HIV in Malaysia continues to rise. As of end 2011, the cumulative number of people living with HIV is reported at 79,855 [5]. Most would have contracted HIV through the sharing of unclean injecting equipment, however, since 2011 reports indicate that more people are likely to contact HIV through sexual transmission than injecting drug use[11]. 26 Review and Consultation on the Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV Services in Malaysia The role of stigma and discrimination continues to be pivotal as impediments to HIV prevention, care, support and treatment, and undermines effective responses to the epidemic.

Table 5 27 The United Nations Country Team, Malaysia Most people living with HIV in Malaysia would be doubly stigmatised as the public perceives individuals infected with HIV as having been involved in immoral and illegal behaviour. Malaysian PLHIV have reported experiencing stigma and discrimination in various settings including, at the workplace, religious sites, household and healthcare facilities [49]. Discriminatory actions against them include, dismissal from employment, forced HIV testing, isolation from others in institutional settings (e.g. drug rehabilitation centres), refusal of medical care and treatment, and ineligibility for health insurance. A few countries in this region have established anti-discrimination laws protecting people living with HIV. Malaysia does not have such a legal framework to protect the rights of people living with HIV, nor clearly identified rights to HIV prevention (e.g. commodities such as condoms and education). Godwin [50] notes the Persons with Disabilities Act 2008 institutes rights for persons with disabilities to access a range of public facilities, education and livelihood opportunities. The implications of this law for a person living with HIV is unclear, e.g. would being infected with HIV be viewed as a disability. Likewise the overarching Constitution of Malaysia provides for the rights to education and employment irrespective of sex, religion, race, descent and so forth, but articulation on prohibition of discrimination based on HIV is absent.

It is recommended that mandatory screening is replaced with voluntary confidential HIV testing with pre- and post-test counselling. Also, concerns have been raised that support (e.g. counselling) for discordant couples were inadequate and often they were discouraged from proceeding with marriage[54].

The Consultation was a platform to ascertain developments in the policy and legal arena and the implications on HIV and AIDS services, and to generate recommendations to strengthen enabling aspects as well as to address the impediments to programmes and initiatives. Participants comprised of representatives from key government ministries and departments, civil society organisations (CSOs), academia, clinicians and UN agencies (Appendix 1 \u2013 Participants list). Day One The first day of the Consultation was allocated for CSOs, particularly those working with key affected populations, to confer on the ramifications of legislation and policies on the implementation of interventions at the community level. This was to provide CSOs the opportunity to raise their concerns and consolidate recommendations to mitigate the negative consequences of laws and policies. To facilitate the participants\u2019 discussions, they were provided with an overview of key policy and legal issues pertaining to the access and utilization of HIV and AIDS services in Malaysia, as well as the practices of enforcement personnel in applying the related laws, by the project consultant. Following this, CSOs deliberated in separate groups, one focused on the drug user population and associated risk behaviours and the other centred on sex workers, men who have sex with men, people living with HIV, and young key affected population and children. The results of the CSO deliberations was captured in the \u201cCivil Society\u2019s Consensus Statement of the Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV and AIDS Services in Malaysia\u201d (Appendix 2), to be brought forward to the following day\u2019s consultation. The premise of the statement was that health is a fundamental human right with an emphasis on an anti-discriminatory approach towards people living with HIV and affected communities at all levels and settings. 29 The United Nations Country Team, Malaysia Day Two The second day of the Consultation brought together representatives from different government bodies, the UN, academia and the SUHAKAM, a broader group of stakeholders, in addition to the CSOs. The first part of the morning was focused on setting the frame and context for the day\u2019s deliberations. The latter half of the day was set aside for group discussion with the aim of identifying strategies and recommendations to address challenges and barriers to access and delivery of HIV services. The Consultation commenced with a welcome by the Chair of the Malaysia UN Theme Group, followed by the keynote address of the Vice-Chairman of the SUHAKAM (Appendix 4). The keynote speaker set the tone for the day\u2019s proceedings by emphasising that \u201cequality and non-discrimination is the pillar on which all other human rights are based\u201d, as instated in the country\u2019s Federal Constitution. The status of the epidemic and context of the national response to HIV was presented by the Senior Principal Assistant Director (HIV/STI) of the Ministry of Health The speaker highlighted notable developments in addressing the epidemic, including the decline in the HIV notification rate, the relative success of the harm reduction programme and the likelihood of the country reaching the MDG6 target. It was reported that a shift has occurred in the major transmission method from injecting drug use to sexual transmission, and the Ministry of Health has developed strategies to address this transition. It was noted that the reported HIV infection rate is increasing among the key affected populations, including men who have sex with men and transgender people (but to a lesser extent among injecting drug users).

As well, limitations to this review and suggestions for further research to augment understanding on this issue are forwarded. \u201cHealth is a basic human right, inherent to all peoples irrespective of their civil, political, economic, social and cultural background\u201d - SUHAKAM The rights-based approach to health is recognised as fundamental for the Malaysian population\u2019s well- being. The government\u2018s investment in healthcare for its people has produced a relatively low cost health care systems with universal and comprehensive services that has resulted in considerable health gains[55]; the government strives to ensure health care is affordable and accessible to those in need. In relation to HIV and AIDS, first line antiretroviral medication to people living with HIV is provided by the government through the public health care system at no cost to people living with HIV (for those eligible for treatment) while second line antiretroviral medication is heavily subsidised. Also, to prevent mother-to-child transmission, antiretroviral prophylaxis is provided to pregnant women and mothers at public hospitals and health care centres. More recently, antiretroviral therapy has been made available to inmates in incarcerated settings, ie prisons and drug rehabilitation centres (in selected sites). The initiative to roll-out the NSEP and MMT is a milestone in instating a national policy centred on halting transmission using a harm reduction approach in relation to injecting drug use. These programmes have been relatively successful as HIV infection rates are decreasing within the injecting drug users sub-population. To maintain the gains and turnaround the epidemic operational, collaborative and human resource issues have to be addressed, specifically, operational matters such as the inconsistent adherence to standard operating procedures (i.e. between the Ministry of Health and the Royal Malaysian Police). PART FOUR 31 The United Nations Country Team, Malaysia The noticeable increase in the HIV infection rate through sexual transmission since 2011 was addressed during the mid-term review of the current National Strategic Plan on HIV/AIDS 2011-2015. Stated in the National Strategic Plan is, Strategy 1: Improving the quality and coverage of prevention programmes among most-at-risk and vulnerable populations[11, pg 23]which includes an emphasis on the prevention of HIV infection through unprotected sex. A range of interventions were identified including harm reduction strategies (e.g. condom promotion), provision of health services (e.g. SRH), and voluntary testing and counselling facilities. A number of recommendations for the implementation of the interventions were proposed in the Mid-term Review Report, including the provision of prevention packages at premises or locations where key affected populations work or frequent, health and treatment related services (e.g. for SRH, voluntary counselling and testing (VCT), STI, and antiretroviral treatment at public (e.g. primary care centres) and private (e.g. family planning clinics) facilities, and the expansion of outreach services. It should be noted that much effort has been made to implement many of these HIV services which have been stymied by considerable challenges, namely a repressive legal and law enforcement environment (see Part Two). Social and cultural beliefs and preconceptions are powerful influences in shaping views of risk behaviours associated with HIV transmission, particularly behaviour linked to illicit and illegal activities, in turn leading to stigma of and prejudiced actions against persons involved in these activities. Often, structural frameworks, such as laws and policies, are perceived as endorsement of these negative perceptions as they prescribe punitive actions against those involved in these activities. Legislation and policies are critical elements in facilitating or impeding an environment conducive for the development and implementation of effective HIV programmes. The Commission on AIDS in Asia report [3]states, \u201clegal provisions should not hamper or disrupt efforts to control or treat HIV\u201d and recommends governments to put in place legislative and administrative directives to relevant bodies, including enforcement agencies (e.g.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3bc4e6f9-dd1e-4efb-801c-5b2898bc3b57": {"__data__": {"id_": "3bc4e6f9-dd1e-4efb-801c-5b2898bc3b57", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-and-consultation-policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Review and Consultation on the Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV Services in Malaysia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-and-consultation-policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b1a32024fbef56480fee74e18431ebe8c11ba5b814d99c3d14119fbd9918259d"}, "2": {"node_id": "57d80258-afb3-4e46-bed7-da4a545238cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-and-consultation-policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "10bcb9dd8bd72cd8efb40f5fb48600cdb937f99c952a65f90f6c0715848600c0"}}, "hash": "daf0c9637212bd8a5557d1c78479bc4220522033d0b58a3d96da404b21f15603", "text": "police) and correctional sites to expedite the provision of services to key affected populations[3, pg 12].

Therefore, a similar directive to that for the NSEP and MMT is necessary to curb the rise of HIV through sexual transmission. A preliminary step to policy development would be to expedite the establishment of a National Task Force on Mitigation of Sexual Transmission of HIV/AIDS, which is a recommendation from the Mid-term Review. A key mandate of the Task Force should be the study of evidence-based interventions and investigation of model legal frameworks and policies that facilitate an enabling environment for the development and provision of HIV services. Also, a priority should be the examination of existing local harm reduction strategies and health care initiatives to prevent sexual transmission that include education, promotion and distribution of condoms and lubricants, VCT, community care, STI and SRH services that are being implemented as these present opportunities for scale-up. The HIV epidemic can be reversed through strong political leadership which takes action to eliminate impediments to comprehensive prevention and treatment, namely structural barriers such as legislations which hamper HIV services. An effective response will facilitate socio-economic development and contribute towards the government\u2019s goal of achieving developed country status by 2020. 32 Review and Consultation on the Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV Services in Malaysia Recommendations The two-day consultation and interviews with key informants generated recommendations that are based on the frontline experiences of these stakeholders who attest to how laws and policies were being enforced and applied, and if they were barriers or enablers to an enabling environment. At many levels, these recommendations mirror the findings of operational research and reports from specialised thematic bodies, such as the Global Commission on HIV and the Law which have held regional dialogues on laws and practices relating to criminalisation of people living with HIV and populations vulnerable to HIV. The recommendations are varied as some proposals focus on the repeal of specific laws and others reflect concerns regarding the practice or enforcement of laws and policies that directly impact on the delivery of services to populations most-at-risk. Furthermore, recommendations were assigned for action according to short to long-term time frames. For example, the period for a structural level intervention such as the introduction of a HIV anti-discriminatory act would be expected to be a medium-term (and onwards) project. As well, cross-cutting themes (e.g. stigma and discrimination) are identifiable which may indicate the extent and pervasiveness of particular regulations or policies affecting service provision. It should be noted that many of the recommendations are aligned and iterations of strategies articulated in the NSP 2011-2015 and the Mid-Term Review of the NSP. The government is committed to implementing the activities outlined to achieve set targets to reduce HIV infection (particularly among the key affected populations) and to increase treatment for people living with HIV. To do so, it will have to address the structural barriers to creating enabling environments for the delivery of HIV services. The recommendations are presented according to the categories of i) prevention, and ii) treatment, care and support services Prevention services: This pertains to the interventions with key affected populations, and includes outreach, peer-to-peer education and support, drop-in centres, venue-based education, the NSEP and MMT. It is necessary to reiterate that often the use of the law as a threat to arrest by (some) enforcement personnel causes considerable disconcertment among NGO workers and most-at-risk populations. As well, the existence of punitive laws will drive the most-at-risk populations undergrown or into hiding. A.

Limitations to the Review A period of three to six months for a national review and consultation on the policy and legal environments related to HIV services was suggested in the review and Guidance Document for Asia and the Pacific Region (2013) for \u2018Conducting National Reviews and Multi-Sector Consultations on Legal and Policy Barriers to HIV services\u2019[56]. For this review and consultation in Malaysia, a shorter timeframe was only available to carry out this project. A drawback to this Review was not being able to secure interviews with all intended stakeholders, in particular with representatives from the Attorney-General\u2019s Chambers. A few of the respondents had limited time to be interviewed, as such restricted the data that could be obtained. Furthermore, all respondents were located in Kuala Lumpur and perspectives from stakeholders beyond the capital city were not gathered. Similarly, the two-day national consultation lacked the wider representation. 36 Review and Consultation on the Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV Services in Malaysia The brevity of the consultation only allowed for an abbreviated agenda, and the forum would have benefitted from a more comprehensive presentation of expert assessment on the legal framework vis-\u00e0-vis the epidemic and deliberation on practical inter-sectoral collaboration. Although many of the key stakeholders were present, there was a gap in the representation from the law enforcement sector, namely, the National Anti-Drugs Agency, Police and Immigration Ministry. Nonetheless, this project provided an opportunity for stakeholders to take-stock of the legal and policy situation, assess impediments and identify steps to collaborate towards generating an environment conducive for mitigating the spread of HIV. Conclusion The HIV epidemic in Malaysia has changed its course in the last five years mainly due to the government\u2019s policy on the NSEP and MMT which has resulted in the decrease of infection rates among intravenous drug users. The investment in the harm reduction programme must not be jeopardised by laws, policies and law enforcement practices that have been counterproductive and are barriers to infected and affected people accessing HIV prevention, treatment, care and support services. Resources are finite and if detrimental processes and actions are allowed to continue there will surely be ramifications for the scale up of the harm reduction programme for intravenous drug user, as well as for other key affected populations particularly those who are most at risk of HIV through unsafe sexual behaviour. The increasing rate of cases through sexual transmissions must be addressed decisively and urgently to avoid a situation akin to HIV among injecting drug users. There is no doubt that the gains made in the last few years to curb the epidemic must be built on and the momentum maintained. The premise of health and equitable access to health as every individual\u2019s fundamental right must underpin the determination of the laws, policies and law enforcement practices that directly impact on the realities of the population at ground level. The government, which has seen the rewards of its policy on harm reduction, must persevere and demonstrate continued leadership to play its part in the global community\u2019s commitment of \u201cGetting to Zero: Zero New HIV Infections, Zero Discrimination, and Zero AIDS-Related Deaths (2011-2015)\u201d. 37 The United Nations Country Team, Malaysia References 1.

APPENDIX TWO 44 Review and Consultation on the Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV Services in Malaysia United Nations Economic and Social Council, General Comment on Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) on the Right to the highest attainable standard of health states: \u2022\ufffd (right)\ufffdto\ufffdhealth\ufffdis\ufffdaccess\ufffdto\ufffdhealthcare\ufffdservices. \u2022\ufffd \ufffdProhibits\ufffddiscrimination\ufffdon\ufffdany\ufffdgrounds;\ufffd \u2022\ufffd Emphasises\ufffdequality\ufffdand\ufffdthe\ufffdspecial\ufffdobligation\ufffdof\ufffdStates\ufffdto\ufffdprovide\ufffdto\ufffdthose\ufffdwho\ufffddo\ufffdnot\ufffdhave\ufffd sufficient means with the necessary health insurance and healthcare facilities. Stigma and discrimination associated with the epidemic is widespread. Key affected populations, including those living with HIV, face tremendous challenges in their everyday living, whether at the workplace, healthcare setting or home environment. Their vulnerable and marginalised status places them at increased risk of HIV transmission and criminalisation heightens these risks, and reinforces stigma and discrimination. Civil society stakeholders at the \u201cMeeting on Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV and AIDS Services in Malaysia\u201d, on 28 October 2013, propose: (i) Consideration of a HIV anti-discrimination law that prohibits discrimination against PLHIV (in all areas), mandatory HIV testing and breach of confidentiality. (ii) A review of laws which impede HIV and AIDS prevention strategies and contravene public health interventions. (iii) Review criminal penalties for sex work and soliciting.

We recognise that discrimination, marginalization, stigmatization and a lack of respect for the human rights and dignity of individuals and groups have heightened their vulnerability to becoming exposed APPENDIX FOUR 50 Review and Consultation on the Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV Services in Malaysia to HIV/AIDS. SUHAKAM\u2019s vision is a world where HIV/AIDs would be recognised and more effectively responded to, through a combined, largely expanded health, social and economic development strategy, firmly grounded in human rights. Today\u2019s consultation on the policy and legal environment would greatly propel us in that direction. HIV and Law The laws in any country are an expression of a country\u2019s policies, and they are based on various cultural, religious, ethical and other norms that the local society considers important, reflecting what that society considers acceptable, or not, at any given period of time. Societal cultural and ethical norms are not fixed \u2013 they can and do change over time. Policy and law can be a human good that makes a material difference in people\u2019s lives. It is therefore not surprising that policy and law has the power to bridge the gap between vulnerability and resilience to HIV. Laws can protect the dignity of all people living with HIV, especially those most at risk such as injecting drug users (IDUs), sex workers, transgender people, men having sex with men, prisoners and migrants. At the same time, law can have a negative impact on the lives of people living with HIV or those in at-risk populations. Laws can prohibit or permit specific individual or group behaviours and actions. For instance, in many countries criminal law has been used as a regulatory tool to enforce moral values. Such laws may have the consequence of driving certain behaviours underground resulting in the unintended victimization and further discrimination of individuals. Evidence has shown that widespread use of criminal law to regulate sexual behaviour and drug use has had a profoundly negative impact on the epidemic and the social well-being of these sections of society, and consequently has impacted negatively on society as a whole. For health-related issues, particularly where a disease may have been contracted through practices that are illegal or considered unacceptable or unusual, this may prove to be problematic, as it can easily prevent provision of prevention advice, services or support. And this is particularly relevant to HIV \u2013 this is a virus often contracted through practices which many societies around the world would sooner not admit occur in their society, and around topics that many individuals find difficult to discuss openly \u2013 such as injecting drug use, sexual activity, sexual identity and so forth. In short, laws have proven to be discriminatory of persons with HIV status in many instances. Through HIV, many lessons have been learnt \u2013 one of which is, that despite the sensitive nature of these issues, it is important that they are discussed in society, and that the lessons learnt, not only within our own country but also internationally, are examined to identify what evidence there is on the effectiveness and the unintended consequences of existing laws and policies. And this is not a one-off discussion; it is an ongoing discussion to ensure that our laws reflect current society\u2019s perspectives on its cultural and ethical norms, and that the mechanisms available under the laws do actually achieve the intended results and minimize any unintended consequences. 51 The United Nations Country Team, Malaysia Stigma and Discrimination Key affected populations, such as injecting drug users (IDUs), men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender persons and sex workers are very frequently marginalized, stigmatized and discriminated against. This places them at significantly higher risk of becoming HIV infected. Stigma and discrimination against IDUs, MSM, transgender persons and sex workers erodes their access to and utilization of HIV services. IDUs, MSM, transgender persons and sex workers can face harassment and arrest from law enforcement agencies. Sex workers face harassment and violence, and this has a tendency to push sex work underground, where it is harder to negotiate for safer conditions and consistent condom use. Sex workers fear that carrying condoms can be used as evidence against them. Stigmatized and criminalized sex workers are unable to access programmes of HIV prevention and care. They may also be less likely to even get tested, with the result that there is a risk of further HIV transmission to other people.

For instance, the Principles recommend that the medical records of sexual minorities be \u2018treated with confidentiality\u2019 and that states \u2018ensure that all health service providers treat clients and their partners with non-discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity\u201d. It should not be forgotten that there are also people who may be infected by HIV not through any practices deemed unusual or unacceptable by others in society. Consider a child born to an HIV-infected mother who has not been able to access services that could have prevented the transmission of HIV to her child. Perhaps that mother had no idea of her HIV status, and perhaps she had contracted HIV from her husband or partner who had contracted HIV through earlier sexual contact with an HIV positive partner. Consider too a person who received a life-saving blood transfusion that was not adequately tested for HIV. Should the stigma, discrimination and fear in society, occurring because of the assumptions about sexual and drug practices which many consider are not \u2018the norm\u2019 or have no place in their society, also visit upon those who are innocent of any such practices? All people with HIV deserve our non-judgmental support if we are to be able to successfully combat HIV in our society. Gender and HIV/AIDS Women are biologically more vulnerable to HIV, but gender inequality and discrimination that are enshrined in customs and traditions rob women of their power to negotiate for safer sex. Sexual violence deprives women of their ability to control their lives and thereby protect their health, making them vulnerable to HIV. 52 Review and Consultation on the Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV Services in Malaysia Disclosure of positive HIV status also puts women at risk and in fear of violence. While the HIV infection among males in Malaysia is showing a significant decline beginning in 2003, the female infection rate is showing the opposite trend. Women and girls are increasingly getting infected with HIV and constitute around 21% of newly infected persons nationwide in 2011 compared to barely 5% ten years ago. Children and Young People Global experience has shown that young people tend to take risks, and that they are not aware of the level of risk that they may be taking \u2013 this is true whether it is driving at high speed, smoking tobacco, drinking alcohol or trying other drugs, and sexual activity. Sexually active young people are particularly vulnerable to HIV. They are vulnerable to pressure from peers or boyfriends to engage in risky behaviours. There is therefore a need for them to be able to access appropriate prevention information, and for good quality, comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services to be available to young people. There is also a need to provide and strengthen sex education among the young to prevent the spread of HIV. Indeed in 2006, SUHAKAM had recommended that compulsory HIV/AIDS education be made part of the secondary school curriculum. Young people living with HIV, who may become infected either by birth to HIV-positive mothers or through sex or drug injection, have particularly complex needs. Healthcare providers may deny young people\u2019s health services without parental consent. The proponent of such laws say that they protect children (a broad category including everyone from birth to 18), but in reality, fear of the disapproval and rage of their parents leads young people to avoid accessing reproductive health and HIV-related services. Age-appropriate comprehensive sexual and life skills education, including information on HIV prevention, serves the health of young people. Conclusion Today, we come together as a group of individuals from diverse backgrounds and experiences to share our perspectives on the role of policy and law in order to facilitate an effective and efficient response to HIV. What we share is our abiding commitment to public health and social justice. Many would say that the law can be complex and challenging and is best left alone. However, experiences from other countries around the world have shown us a very different perspective. Constructive dialogue on controversial issues can lead to better enforcement of existing law enforcement or sometimes progressive law reform. SUHAKAM looks forward to a day where there is a law to prohibit discriminatory practices toward people living with HIV/AIDS so as to enable them to live with dignity and without shame and stigma. 53 The United Nations Country Team, Malaysia Review and Consultation on Policy and Legal Environments Related to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8531ca4e-60a7-48bd-b97c-8c47495151af": {"__data__": {"id_": "8531ca4e-60a7-48bd-b97c-8c47495151af", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-and-consultation-policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Review and Consultation on the Policy and Legal Environments Related to HIV Services in Malaysia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-and-consultation-policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "af54f80c31d244363c917a3d7988e068d8a0f84df5fd52cedcab592a7664c553"}, "3": {"node_id": "c09ba45a-2fbc-477c-86d8-5ed883b32ac1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-and-consultation-policy-and-legal-environments-related-hiv-services-malaysia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1a2d57ccd18230a9f05ceb756328706b29fc2fd08ddb4cc10698975557df85e1"}}, "hash": "0cea87678f4e05278f400a6ed83e8c5a8d90604e5f23d68d7eee350ea936a00e", "text": "HIV Services in Malaysia List of Project Technical Steering Committee Members 1.

In addition, in March 2011, the UNESCAP Member States adopted Resolution 67/9, undertaking to initiate a review of national laws, policies and practices with a view to eliminating all forms of discrimination against people at risk of infection or living with HIV, in particular key affected populations. In February 2012, the Asia-Pacific High Level Intergovernmental Meeting on the Assessment of Progress against Commitments in the Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS and Millennium Development Goals was convened, in order to assess regional progress against the Resolution 66/10 and commitments in the Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS and Millennium Development Goals (MDG).

Review and Consultation on Legal and Policy Environments Related to HIV Services The United Nations Theme Group on HIV/AIDS in Malaysia has received some funding from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (ISEAN-HIVOS regional initiative) for a review and consultation on the Legal and Policy Environments Related to HIV Services in Malaysia. This is part of a regional initiative that will also take place in Indonesia, Philippines and Timor-Letse.

PROTECTION ORDINANCE, 2013 . . . 180 V FOREWORD The law can have a profound impact on the lives of people \u2013 especially those who are vulnerable and marginalized. The true test of a humane society is reflected in its commitment to protect the rights of minorities. In Pakistan, the HIV epidemic continues to be concentrated among key populations, who often represent highly ostracized and stigmatized segments within all societies. They are not only rejected socially but further marginalized through legal frameworks that have cast them as criminals. Criminal laws and discriminatory practices based on moral judgment, superstition, ancient beliefs, fear and misinformation, punish instead of protect. They drive at-risk communities underground, preventing them from accessing lifesaving treatment and prevention and heightening their risk for HIV. The Global Commission on HIV and the Law (2010-2012), a high-level initiative launched in 2010 by UNDP Administrator, Helen Clark, examined how law and practices can transform the global AIDS response. The Commission\u2019s findings and recommendations reveal that evidence-based laws and practices firmly grounded in human rights do exist and are powerful instruments for challenging discrimination, promoting public health, and protecting human rights. The benefits are felt beyond HIV responses to encompass health and development outcomes more broadly. Furthermore, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) Resolutions 66/10 and 67/9 recommended that punitive laws and policies targeting key populations be abolished to reduce levels of social stigma, discrimination, violence and broader human rights violations. Now more than ever, it is time for the country to adopt legal environments which can support an effective national AIDS response that mitigate the impact of HIV and promote and protect the human rights of people living with HIV and the most vulnerable to HIV. It is my great pleasure to welcome the Scan of Laws and Policies Affecting Human Rights, Discrimination and Access to HIV and Health Services by Key Populations in Pakistan. This scan of HIV-related laws and policies identifies legal barriers to accessing health and HIV services for key populations and presents a set of recommendations that can save lives, save money and help end the AIDS epidemic in Pakistan. I hope that individuals and civil society organizations will use this resource to claim their rights, and also that policy and lawmakers, officials responsible for criminal justice, law enforcement officers, national AIDS programme officials, and donors will use it to inform the development and implementation of an enabling legal environment for effective HIV and heath responses. Marc-Andr\u00e9 Franche Country Director, UNDP Pakistan In the aftermath of 18th Amendment of the Constitution of Pakistan in 2010, the Government of Pakistan devolved the federal ministries and delegated the responsibilities of programme planning and implementation, including health programming to the provinces.

The National AIDS Control Programme (NACP) continues to provide stewardship as an apex coordinating body; ensures the provision of technical assistance and capacity building for effective programming; and generates and collects HIV information and data. The effectiveness of health programmes depends enormously on a supportive enabling environment. Despite arduous efforts made by a large spectrum of stakeholders, Pakistan now faces a concentrated HIV epidemic. Without understanding intricacies of factors affecting access to HIV services by people living with HIV and key populations, critical evidence for planning cannot be ascertained which impacts the effectiveness of programmes. Stigma and discrimination experienced by people who use drugs, sex workers, transgender persons and men who haves sex with men, both by general public and service delivery providers including health service providers and police negatively effects access and utilization of health care services. A supportive enabling environment includes a conducive legal environment and public-friendly policies which protect the most vulnerable. One of the important determinants of health is the layer of society where religious, social, political, environmental and legal interfaces influence each other to set the mind of society. Pakistan is signatory to various international commitments encapsulating both health and human rights, and continues to be guided by the ESCAP Roadmap and recommendations from the Global Commission on HIV and the Law to complement the national HIV response. This assessment, titled as Scan of Laws and Policies Affecting Human Rights, Discrimination and Access to HIV and Health Services by Key Populations in Pakistan, is an invaluable effort undertaken by UNDP and the UN Country Team under the Multi-Country South Asia Global Fund HIV Programme. It provides ample information which many stakeholders may utilize to guide planning processes and implementation mechanisms in a human rights perspective. NACP appreciates the contribution of UNDP, the UN Country Team, the Global Fund, civils society, as well as the author of this report. The report will help advocacy initiatives to engage in constructive and open dialogues to address punitive laws and policies targeting key populations in order to reduce the levels of social stigma, discrimination, violence and broader human rights violations. This will ultimately contribute in keeping the treatment cascade intact and reduce chances of failure of adherence. Dr Abdul Baseer Achakzai Director/National Program Manager National AIDS Control Program Ministry of National Health Services, Regulation & Coordination Government of Pakistan VII ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The main objective of the Scan of Laws and Policies Affecting Human Rights, Discrimination and Access to HIV and Health Services by Key Populations in Pakistan is to identify the current status of legislation, policies, institutional frameworks in Pakistan that safeguard the universal human rights of the key affected populations with regard to the HIV prevention, care and treatment. The scan establishes a baseline on the current enabling environment (law, policies and institutions) in relation to safeguarding the human rights of the key populations and second, and it provides a set of recommendations to input into any reforms to promote an enabling environment where the human rights of the key populations are protected. We would like to thank the Steering Committee, comprising of the UN joint team on HIV (UNAIDS, UNDP, UNFPA, UNWOMEN, UNODC, WHO, UNICEF), representatives of the transgender community, representatives of men having sex with men, representatives of the Human Rights Commission, the Government of Pakistan and the International Development and Law Organization (IDLO) for their guidance and advice on the report. This report was authored by Sheeza Ahmed with support from Faiqa Zaman. The Punjab AIDS Control Programme and the Sindh AIDS Control Programme played an integral role in the preparation of this report; and their assistance and support is greatly appreciated. A special thanks for the support provided by Naz Male Health Alliance (NMHA), without whom, it would not have been possible to obtain such in-depth information on the key human rights issues being faced by the key populations affected by HIV and AIDS in Pakistan. Acknowledgement and thanks is also due to the facilitators who assisted with the section on Female Sex Workers and made it possible for us to conduct our study with this group; and we wish to thank Ms. Lubna of Sheed in Lahore and Ms. Rubab (associated with PAVHNA, Pehla Qadam), for all their support and help.

The lack of a uniform policy on key issues such as health, education and social welfare is reflected not only in some of our outdated laws but also the differences that exist in implementation of the key provisions of the main laws. 1.1.2 Additionally culture, custom and a fear of anti-religious sentiment not only interferes with implementation of the legal framework but also with the framing of progressive laws, that while within the constitutional parametres yet may be considered socially unacceptable, in a country which although signatory to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, yet continues to remain in denial about the occurrence of incest and child prostitution. 1.1.3 The need of the hour are new generation laws that not only uphold the rights of all citizens of Pakistan but also provide protection, in accordance with the provisions of Article 26 of the ICCPR; with a specific emphasis on social origin, in the context of the current Study. 1 2 HIV \u2013 Legislation and Policies 1.2.1 The number of HIV patients in Pakistan remains a matter of debate with the numbers of HIV cases ranging between 14,000 according to the official claims and 95,000 to 125,000 according to estimates by private medical practitioners. The facts remain however that since 1986 when the first AIDS patient was diagnosed in Pakistan, an estimated 5,800 people have lost their lives to the disease. 1.2.2 Since 1986 Pakistan\u2019s status as a \u201clow prevalence high risk\u201d country has changed to that of one in a \u201cconcentrated\u201d epidemic in high risk groups; yet in the past few years no uniform National HIV Policy has been formulated nor has any law / regulation been promulgated for the prevention of the spread of the disease and the protection of the key affected populations. 1.2.3 However during the tenor of the interim caretaker Minister for Law and Prisons, Sindh, Mr. Mehmood Mandviwalla, a law for the control and treatment of HIV and the protection of people living with HIV and key affected populations was presented to the Ministry of Law and with the efforts of the Minister, the Governor of Sindh granted his assent to the Sindh HIV Control, Treatment and Protection Ordinance, 2013 (\u201cSindh HIV Law\u201d) on May 22, 2013 as a result of which the Sindh HIV Law was promulgated as an Ordinance. Efforts are now being made to ensure that the Ordinance is ratified into an Act, by the new Provincial Assembly. 6 INTERNATIONAL BILL OF HUMAN RIGHTS Chapter 2 INTERNATIONAL BILL OF HUMAN RIGHTS 1

opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status\u201d. 2.1.3 The Human Rights Declaration, along with the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its two Optional Protocols together constitute the \u201cInternational Bill of Human Rights\u201d. 3 INTERNATIONAL COVENANT ON CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS 3.1.1 Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (\u201cICCPR\u201d) provides that every human being has an inherent right and this right shall be protected by law and no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life. 3.1.2 Article 7 of the ICCPR states that no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and in particular no one shall be subject without his free consent to medical or scientific experimentation. 3.1.3 In terms of Article 10 of the ICCPR all persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person. 3.1.4 Article 16 provides that everyone shall have the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law. 3.1.5 Article 17 states that on one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family or correspondence nor to unlawful attacks on his honor INTERNATIONAL BILL OF HUMAN RIGHTS 7 or reputation and everyone shall have the right to protection of law against such interference and attacks. 3.1.6 Article 26 states that all persons are equal before the law and are entitled

In this respect the law shall prohibit any discrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination on any ground, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. 3.1.7 Pakistan is a signatory to the ICCPR and has ratified the ICCPR with the reservation that Article 3 shall be applied in conformity with the personal law of the citizens of Pakistan and the Qanoon-e-Shahadat; and with regard to Article 25 has made the reservation that the same shall be subject to Article 41(2) and Article 91(3) of the Constitution. 3.1.8 Article 3 is the crux of the ICCPR and contains the undertaking of the State Parties to ensure the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of all civil and political rights set forth in the ICCPR; however given the fact that Pakistan earlier had reservations on Articles 6, 7, 12, 13, 18, 19 and 40 of the ICCPR; the reservation on Article 3 and Article 25 would have been less onerous had the reservation on Article 3 been restricted only to the Qanoon-e-Shahadat. 4 INTERNATIONAL COVENANT ON ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS 4.1.1 Article 2 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (\u201cICESR\u201d) reflects the provisions of Article 2 of the Human Rights Declaration and provides that the State Parties to the ICESR undertake to guarantee the rights contained therein without discrimination on the basis of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. 4.1.2 Rights with regard to health are recognised in Article 12 of ICESR and include, (a) reduction of the stillbirth-rate and infant mortality and for the health development of the child;

Any matter that was not specifically provided for on either of the Legislative Lists was within the jurisdiction of the provinces to legislate on. 2.1.3 The Federal Legislative List comprises of two (2) parts, Part I and Part II. The Federal Government shall have exclusive power to make laws with regard to any matter listed in the Federal Legislative List, as per Article 142(a) of the Constitution. 14 CONSTITUTION OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN 2.1.4 Prior to its abolition the following matters, pertaining to health and medicine were listed on the Concurrent Legislative List: (a) Drugs and medicines (Item 20) (b) Poison and dangerous drugs (Item 21); (c) Prevention of the extension from one province to another of infectious or contagious diseases or pests affecting men, animal or plants (Item 22); (d) Mental illness and mental retardation, including places for the reception or treatment of the mentally ill and mentally retarded (Item 23); (e) Environmental pollution and ecology (Item 24); and (f) Population planning and social welfare (Item 25). 2 2 18th Amendment 2.2.1 The Constitution has been amended by the Constitution (Eighteenth Amendment) Act, 2010 (\u201c18th Amendment\u201d) as a consequence whereof, inter alia the Concurrent Legislative List has been abolished and certain matters have been devolved unto the Provinces. 2.2.2 There now exists only a Federal Legislative List that lists matters in respect of which the Parliament has the right to draft laws; and any matter that is not listed on the Federal Legislative List falls within the domain of the Provincial Assemblies. 2.2.3 However, Article 154(1) of the Constitution provides that the Council of Common Interests shall formulate and regulate policies in relation to matters in Part II of the Federal Legislative List and shall exercise supervision and control over the related institutions. 2.2.4 The devolution of power to the provinces by the 18th Amendment of the Constitution has had a further impact on Pakistan\u2019s health sector. Each of the items pertaining to health care on the Concurrent Legislative List, that now stands abolished, has resulted in these matters becoming provincial subjects and shall now require provincial legislation in relation to the same. 2.2.5 The \u201cPrevention of the extension from one Province of another of infection or contagious diseases or pests affecting men, animal or plants\u201d a matter listed on the Concurrent Legislative List has now devolved unto the Provinces as a consequence of the 18th Amendment. From the perspective of HIV in Pakistan, this is perhaps the most important item on the Legislative Lists and the only one that should have retained its Concurrent status; in view of the fact that the majority of Key Affected Population by HIV in Pakistan comprises of the MSM / MSW and Transgender community and given the social and cultural taboo these communities are migratory in nature and travel from one city to another. Similarly the FSW community is also migratory in nature due to the social and cultural taboos. 2.2.6 However, it is interesting to note that the ongoing AIDS Control Programme falls within the jurisdiction of the Council of Common Interests. CONSTITUTION OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN 15 3 PRACTICAL IMPACT OF THE 18TH AMENDMENT 3 1 Ministry of Health 3.1.1 Prior to its devolution unto the provinces, the Ministry of Health was the division of the Federal Government responsible for all medical services, health policies and for the enforcement of the same.

The person being tested shall also be informed of the tests 3.2.4 In terms of Section 3(3) of the HIV Safety Bill any person can move the court for the purpose of seeking a test of another person if the person moving the court suspects such other person to have AIDS and if as a consequence of his / her association with such person, it can be proved that the person seeking the test is at significant risk of acquiring the disease. However, due to fear of punishment by the law, persons 30 HIV LAWS engaged in out of wedlock relationships usually refrain from moving the court even if there is significant risk of exposure to HIV. 3.2.5 Section 4 of the HIV Safety Bill, pertains to Mandatory Testing and provides that the following persons shall be required to undergo mandatory testing: (a) persons intending to get married and the test report of both parties shall be included in the nikahnama or a certificate to this effect shall be attached therewith; (b) ante-natal testing of pregnant women report of whom shall be submitted to the physician / surgeon involved in antenatal, post natal care of women; (c) high risk groups including the following: (i) all immigrant workers returning to Pakistan, at all entrance points, and the results shall be communicated to the person tested; and in case the results are positive than the tests of the family members shall also be conducted; (ii) jail inmates, commercial sex traders, sex offenders, victims of crimes that have exposed them to risk of acquiring infection, habitual drug abusers and truckers; (d) patients receiving repeated transfusions of blood. It is pertinent to note that this is contradictory to the HIV Bill of 2007 which prohibits the coercive screening and testing of individuals. 3.2.6 Section 5 of the HIV Safety Bill requires that before a person undergoes a test for HIV, consent form, in the prescribed format shall be signed by such person; and in the case of a minor under 16 years of age or where a person lacks the mental capacity to understand the consent form than the same shall be signed by the parents or the legal guardian of such person. In the event of an emergency where a person is unconscious or is not in a position to sign the consent form, the consent shall be obtained from the relatives available at the spot. 3.2.7 The sharing of information in respect of the results of pregnant women and couples that undergo HIV tests is provided for in Section 6 of the HIV Safety Bill; which states that the results of HIV tests of pregnant women and couples shall be disclosed to them, whatever they may be. And in cases where the results are positive, the \u201crelevant\u201d hospitals and clinics shall be responsible for their counseling and preparing them to live with the disease and stop transfusion of it to their relatives. 3.2.8 Section 6 (2) further provides that doctors can inform at risk person\u2019s partners, spouse and shared syringe users about the positive results. Section 6(2) further states \u201ctreatment facilities to be discussed follow up care and referral of positive person\u201d.

HIV LAWS 31 3.2.10 An exception to the Confidentiality provision contained in Section 7 has been provided in Section 8 (Conditions under which disclosure of blood results are authorized by laws); which states in sub-section (i) that \u201cResults can only be divulged to any other then specified in the previous section as specified by this law; unless public safety is at risk\u201d; and in sub-section (ii) that \u201cwhere there is ongoing control surveillance of disease\u201d. 3.2.11 Section 9 deals with penalties for breach of confidentiality and states that any person who negligently or willfully or maliciously divulges or directly or indirectly identifies an individual as having HIV that results in economic, bodily or psychological trauma / harm to person or persons than such a person shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by a jail period not extending beyond one (1) year and a fine of Rs. 50,000 or both plus court costs to be paid to the person or person whose confidentiality has been breached. 3.2.12 According to Section 10 of the HIV Safety Bill \u201cAny person who by publication, by advocacy or propaganda spoken or written spreads prejudicial reports regarding a person or persons of AIDS /HIV in a way that could cause psychological, physical or mental trauma to that individual or individuals or result in their being victimized or discriminated against by society, by employers or prospective employers or associates\u201d than the person so advocating or discriminating against an infected person will be guilty of misdemeanor and is liable to imprisonment or fine or both. 3.2.13 The HIV Safety Bill contains a \u201cSection B\u201d comprising of Section 11 (Information Dissemination), Section 12 (Documentation) and Section 13 (Training of Health Personnel). Section 11 sets out the details of the manner in which information about HIV should be disseminated including dissemination through the media, but it does not create any duties or obligations upon any particular organ of the government or the private sector. Similarly Section 13(i) simply states \u201cEntry in National Data Bank\u201d; there is no reference to a National Data Bank prior to this Section 13(i) nor is there any provision requiring the establishment of a National Data Bank; nor does this Section 13(i) state as to what has to be entered into the National Data Bank; however the later sub-sections do refer to information and it is open to interpretation that it is such information that is to be entered into the National Data Bank. Section 14 which pertains to Training of Health Professionals refers to training for health professionals as disseminators and counselors and that health professionals should be given sensitivity training with regard to the stigma attached to the disease; however this Section also does not create any special obligations with regard to such training and merely states that health personnel should receive such training. 3.2.14 Section C of the HIV Safety Bill pertains to safety measures and contains four sections, namely: Section 15 (Blood and blood products and tissue safety); Section 16 (Safety and sanitation standards); Section 17 (Health personnel and safety measures) and Section 18 (Criminal Offence and its prosecution). 3.2.15 Section 15 states that \u201cBlood banks and organ banks have to follow regulations and safety measures.\u201d It further provides that safety measures also have to be followed by organ transplant units, thalassemia, hemophilic and dialysis centres and all these facilities should be licensed. It is not clear as to what the intent of this section is, since it neither frames nor refers to any safety measures that should be followed by blood and organ banks and organ transplant units, thalassemia and hemophilic and dialysis centres.

As with the previous Section 15, this Section 16 also does not create any mandatory obligations on hospitals, clinics and / or medical practitioners. The law fails to ensure adherence on part of health managers and service providers both private and public to ensure the safe and environment friendly disposal of used syringes and sharps. 3.2.17 Although Section 17 states that dental professionals, surgeons, physicians paramedics are required to maintain occupational safety and standard guidelines for infection control; however it neither refers to any particular guidelines with regard to such occupational safety or infection control nor provides any such guidelines within the HIV Safety Law. Sub-section (2) of Section 17 states that all hospitals where there is a significant risk of acquiring HIV infection are required to take safeguards and sanitation measures to protect their employees; and it is mandatory for those health personnel to be tested every five (5) years for HIV who are at significant risk of exposure such as dentists, surgeons, phlebotomists. Despite the mandatory requirement for testing Section 17(2) does not impose any penalty for failure of any high risk professionals stated therein to test every five (5) years. 3.2.18 Section 18 of the HIV Safety Bill provides that any person who willfully exposes another person to HIV by not informing that person of his condition or by \u201c(i) engaging in unprotected sex.

HIV LAWS 33 4.2.2 It is pertinent to note that while the HIV Prevention and Treatment Bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of HIV status for admission into schools, health treatment, enjoyment of services and provision of goods etc.; it does not take into consideration mandatory HIV testing in cases of rape, sexual assault and unnatural offences under Section 377 of the PPC. Nor does it provide for mandatory testing by the Commission in armed forces / hostels of armed forces2; in injecting drug users. Additionally it requires informed consent for testing of prisoners and minors. Given the current state of HIV in Pakistan and its status as a matter of public health, it would have been more beneficial had the HIV Prevention and Treatment Bill provided for stringent testing and screening requirements. Furthermore, the HIV Prevention and Treatment Bill also does not take into account Section 269 and Section 270 of the PPC; which should have been incorporated into the HIV Prevention and Treatment Bill by reference since the same are most relevant to HIV. 4.2.3 Notwithstanding the above, the HIV Prevention and Treatment Bill has now lapsed as a consequence of the 18th Amendment and can only be adopted by the Provincial Assemblies as provincial legislation with such amendments as may be considered necessary by the relevant Provincial Assemblies. The HIV Safety Bill, however, may still be enacted as an act of the Parliament, since it is a legislation applicable only to the jurisdiction of the capital territory of Islamabad.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9440ee89-5473-41bd-9236-a8668a9a5bcb": {"__data__": {"id_": "9440ee89-5473-41bd-9236-a8668a9a5bcb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Scan of Law and Policies Affecting Human Rights, Discrimination and Access to HIV and Health Services by Key Populations in Pakistan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6c52ae75b4acfbf3636c9f854703c0d6b830cc5fd1f7f4cae7041cc79e2733dc"}, "2": {"node_id": "de95c0ad-33ef-40d7-aa1f-8c5a10e9e27f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2a175e7b6fef0fe6bdb38b856eceeb499b6875a2333e0bf72b870cb611ff9315"}}, "hash": "562afde216586eb7ed8148fa9f0db4449e16804843446cbbb7a58dc6e0932f5d", "text": "5 RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THE PAKISTAN PENAL CODE 5 1 Section 269 \u2013 Negligent Act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life 5.1.1 Section 269 of the PPC provides that whoever unlawfully or negligently does any act which is or which he knows or has reason to believe is likely to spread the infection of any disease that is dangerous to life, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to six (6) months or with fine or with both. 5 2 Section 270 \u2013 Malignant Act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life 5.2.1 Section 270 of the PPC pertains to the offence where a person", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9582a924-52dc-4d33-a58e-77b18c656016": {"__data__": {"id_": "9582a924-52dc-4d33-a58e-77b18c656016", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Scan of Law and Policies Affecting Human Rights, Discrimination and Access to HIV and Health Services by Key Populations in Pakistan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "51492ba01250da06eedd5bc1282fc9ce2bb29de6c92e2900a38b28beee102ae8"}, "3": {"node_id": "e8920d50-127c-4abe-ad0b-5ff7fc6643a4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b14d90a8ec5b56e4a98d1fd24b6f6d6dbbd1e70603c79d74a3dc11970530b693"}}, "hash": "59c420f2407810754a6975f6e4460e844aec13b9f7b88ff1008c3b9f1460479e", "text": "malignantly does any act which is or which such person knows is likely to he has reason to believe is likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life;

however negligent failure to disclose also constitutes an offence under Section 269. 5.3.2 In reliance upon Section 269 and Section 270 of the PPC, it is possible to legally seek prosecution against any person who has either knowingly with malice or unknowingly and thereby negligently caused any person to be infected by HIV. 5.3.3 Despite the availability of Sections 269 and 270 of the PPC, there are no instances of any relief having been sought by reliance upon these sections of the PPC in Pakistan, while case law on Sections 269 and 270 of the Indian Penal Code (which are identical to Sections 269 and 270 of the PPC) is available in India. No specific evidence is available as to why these provisions of the PPC have not been relied upon, however the cause may be a lack of awareness of the same.

However the permissible age of marriage as fixed in the original Child Marriage Restraint Act was 14 years for girls and 18 years for boys. The sentencing history of Child Marriage Restraint even during the colonial times showed a very bleak picture as out of 473 prosecutions only 167 were successful; with only 17 doing their full or partial sentence. The results of 1931 census also revealed that while the number of wives under 15 had increased from 8 million to 12 million; the number of husbands under 15 had also gone up from 3 to more than 5 million. 7.1.2 India has subsequently passed The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 which has raised the age for marriage to 18 for girls and 21 for boys. It also prescribes the punishment of rigorous imprisonment upto 2 years and a fine of upto one 100,000 Indian Rupees. The Act also provides for annulment of child marriage upto 2 years after the child reaches majority as child marriages are voidable 7 2 Child Marriage 7.2.1 A \u201cchild\u201d is defined in the Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929 (\u201cCMRA\u201d) as a person \u201cwho if male, is under eighteen years of age, and if a female, is under sixteen years of age\u201d. 7.2.2 A \u201cminor\u201d is defined in the CMRA as a person of either sex who is under eighteen (18) years of age. 7.2.3 \u201cChild marriage\u201d is defined in the CMRA as a \u201cmarriage to which either of the contracting parties is a child\u201d and the term \u201ccontracting party\u201d has been defined to mean, in relation to a marriage, \u201ceither of the parties whose marriage is or is about to be thereby solemnized\u201d. 7 3 Penalties for Child Marriage 7.3.1 The CMRA provides penalties under three specific heads for child marriage which are as follows: (i) Child Marriage of Male Adult above 18 Years Section 4 of the CMRA provides that when a male above the age of eighteen (18) years of age contracts a child marriage than he shall be punished with simple imprisonment that may extend to one (1) month, or with fine that may extend to Pak Rupees One Thousand or with both. (ii) Soleminizing a Child Marriage Section 5 of the CMRA provides the penalties for solemnizing a child marriage and states that whoever performs, or conducts or direct any child marriage CHILDREN AND LAW 83 shall be punishable with simple imprisonment that may extend to one (1) month or with a fine that may extend to Pak Rupees One Thousand only or with both, unless such a person can prove that he had reason to believe that the marriage was not a child marriage. (iii) Guardians and Parents involved in Child Marriage Section 6 deals with the role of guardians and parents of a minor involved in child marriage and provides that in the event the persons having the control of a minor, whether as a parent or as a guardian or any other capacity, lawful or unlawful, do any act to permit or promote the marriage of a minor, or for the same to be solemnized, or negligently fail to prevent the marriage of such minor from being solemnized than such a person shall be punishable with simple imprisonment that", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "701de4a5-74eb-44d9-8f98-8b195a47eff4": {"__data__": {"id_": "701de4a5-74eb-44d9-8f98-8b195a47eff4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Scan of Law and Policies Affecting Human Rights, Discrimination and Access to HIV and Health Services by Key Populations in Pakistan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8cbe4b7c5200457704ec5432c843677b0b7f7330c85921d87255e321513854c6"}, "3": {"node_id": "e430dd68-074d-4dce-bdac-64393d6ee0f9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "18db322900545bb4e41096f25a18e6b9d76d9bcad894be4fa713def830192750"}}, "hash": "1efe4b4ad4e45daadfd924d5557800c8b2380b4dd374e13cedfbd595dfe2dacf", "text": "may extend to one (1) month or with a fine that may extend to Pak Rupees One Thousand or with both; provided however, that no woman shall be punishable with imprisonment.

However no injunction may be issued against any person unless the Court has previously given notice to such person and has afforded such person an opportunity to show-cause against the issue of the injunction. Any person who disobeys an injunction knowingly shall be punished with imprisonment of either term which may extend to three (3) months or with fine that may extend to Pak Rupees One Thousand only, or with both, however no woman shall be unishable with imprisonment. 3 Omitted by Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 Section 12, with effect from 15.07.1961. 84 WOMEN AND LAW Chapter 11 WOMEN AND LAW 1 SEXUAL HEALTH AND REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS 1 1 Hudood Laws 1.1.1 The most controversial amendment to the Pakistan Penal Code was the incorporation of the provisions pertaining to Rape, promulgated by \u201cThe Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979\u201d popularly known as the \u201cHudood Laws\u201d. Sections 4, 5 and 6 of the Hudood Law are relevant for the purpose of this section of this report. 1.1.2 Section 4 pertained to \u201cZina\u201d being the act of the \u201cwillful sexual intercourse\u201d between a man and a woman without being \u201cvalidly\u201d married to each other. 1.1.3 Section 5 set out the situations for \u201cZina Liable to Hadd\u201d i.e. where \u201cZina\u201d is punishable by \u201cHadd\u201d literally translated to mean \u201cthe punishments prescribed by \u201cIslamic Shariah\u201d\u201d. These situations were as follows: (a) committed by a sane adult male with a woman with whom he is not married and does not \u201csuspect\u201d himself to be married; (b) committed by a sane adult female with a man with whom she is not married and does not \u201csuspect\u201d herself to be married.

Various provisions of the PPC have been amended from time to time to reflect modification to the offences and the punishments prescribed; with the amendment to the provisions pertaining to Rape having been amended by the controversial Hudood Ordinance and subsequently by the Protection of Women Act. 1.3.2 Section 375 of the PPC defines Rape as the commission of sexual intercourse by a man with a woman in any of the following circumstances: (a) against her will; (b) without her consent; (c) with consent but when such consent has been obtained by putting her in fear of death or hurt; (d) with consent but when the man knows he is not married to her and the consent has been given she believes him to be another person to whom the she is or believes herself to be validly married; or (e) with or without her consent when she is under the age of 16. 1.3.3 The punishment for Rape as prescribed by Section 376 of the PPC is death or imprisonment of either description for a term which shall not be less than ten (10) years or more than twenty-five (25) years and the accused shall be liable to fine. In case the Rape has been committed by two (2) or more person in furtherance of common intention than each of such persons shall be punished by death or life imprisonment. 2 ABORTION 2.1.1 Abortion is a criminal act under the laws of Pakistan, with its punishment having been prescribed by the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860. 86 WOMEN AND LAW 2.1.1 The provisions of PPC pertain to abortion at two different stages of development of the fetus and the punishments also differ for the same: (a) Section 338 of the PPC pertains to abortion, when the organs of the fetus have not formed and defines the same as \u201cIsqat-i-Hamal \u201d; and (b) Section 338B of the PPC pertains to abortion, when some limbs or organs of the fetus have formed and defines it as \u201cIsqat-i-Janin\u201d. Both these sections also apply to women who cause themselves to abort. 2 2 Isqat-i-Hamal and Isqat-i-Janin 2.2.1 In case of Isqat-i-Hamal, i.e. if the organs of the fetus have not been formed, it would not constitute an offence under Section 338, if it has been \u201ccaused in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of the woman or providing necessary treatment to her\u201d. 2.2.2 Under Section 338B, it would not constitute Isqat-i-Janin, i.e. abortion of a fetus whose limbs or organs have formed, when the same been \u201ccaused in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of the woman\u201d. 2.2.3 The differences in Section 338 and Section 338B of the PPC also provide interesting parallels with regard to the situations and the time limit upto which abortion does not constitute an offence. To illustrate; if the limbs and organs of the fetus have not formed; abortion in the following situations would not constitute an offence (a) for the purpose of saving the life of the woman; or (b) providing necessary treatment; and if the limbs and organs have been formed than abortion only for the purpose of saving the woman\u2019s life would be permissible and not constitute an offence; with the underlying expectation of each instance of abortion having occurred in good faith and without malafide intent.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a98221ee-706b-4c6b-abea-b8c93a185695": {"__data__": {"id_": "a98221ee-706b-4c6b-abea-b8c93a185695", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Scan of Law and Policies Affecting Human Rights, Discrimination and Access to HIV and Health Services by Key Populations in Pakistan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2f3d984da409b5779d35e2030dddaabb7c4709f87898309cab086717f92a9434"}, "2": {"node_id": "c1fd9dd5-88d2-4359-9deb-2d6e23599da0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0fb950911e81580d9bcac5d3714d3a60041c08686aea08efffe01ef8725791de"}}, "hash": "999bd5ad9b0e6c1d7f5869e88fcedb79f819c2b6fad784bbebb53e520c397836", "text": "The difference in the exceptions in Section 338 and 338B would also be relevant in cases where abortions are necessarily required for medical reasons subsequent to formation of limbs and organs of the fetus; yet would constitute an offence under Section 338B of the PPC; and hence would be denied.

Once the Reproductive Rights Bill is passed by the Senate, it shall be presented to the President for his assent whereafter it shall become an act of the Parliament. 2.3.2 It may be noted that the Reproductive Rights Bill was originally tabled in the National Assembly in 2012 and was turned down by a female legislator on the grounds that it was not in conformity with the injunctions of Islam.

When viewed from the legislative perspective, the utility and role of Section 4(1) in the Reproductive Rights Bill remains an enigma, since it is only listing the manner in which reproductive healthcare can and is being provided. It does not state who is responsible for providing such information and who has the right to receive such information. It also does not elaborate on the mean of providing and / or seeking such information; in fact it is silent on all essential matters relevant to reproductive healthcare information. 2.4.8 It is pertinent to note that the Original Bill also contained a similar Section however, the same created a right and was titled \u201cRight to Reproductive Health Information\u201d; and although even the Section in the Original Bill did not clearly state as to who has the Right to Reproductive Health Care Information and whose obligation it is to provide such information yet it did use the word \u201cRight\u201d while any reference to \u201cright\u201d is missing in the Section appearing in the Reproductive Rights Bill. Furthermore, while sub-clauses (a) and (b) in both the Sections are same, but sub-clause (c) is different and in the Original Bill sub-clause (c) stated \u201cthe reproductive health information and communication activities take into consideration the social milieu and given cultural environment\u201d and it appears that this sub-clause (c) has been replaced by the reference to \u201creligious norms\u201d. 2.4.9 Section 4(2) titled \u201cThe right to gender neutral information can be promoted\u201d lists the following: (a) By access to information related to reproductive rights and responsibilities within a gender perspective, which is free from stereotypes, discriminatory and obscurantist customs, and is presented in an objective and pluralistic manner; (b) By recognition that all couples have the right to information to ensure reproductive life decisions are made with informed consent; and (c) By public awareness on the prevalence and impact of morbidity and mortality and availability of medical science to prevent this suffering.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ab637f08-a013-4d4a-b9a7-32a74c0ace17": {"__data__": {"id_": "ab637f08-a013-4d4a-b9a7-32a74c0ace17", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Scan of Law and Policies Affecting Human Rights, Discrimination and Access to HIV and Health Services by Key Populations in Pakistan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "136c78c0f89e9fbaa4f1bc887d80cf32c325005c148d0700609cf55f0f2fcf25"}, "2": {"node_id": "97e1a407-43e5-4f64-9afa-6a13263b9323", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scan-law-and-policies-affecting-human-rights-discrimination-and-access-hiv-and-health-services-key-populations-pakistan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c54d9536a61892c280732d617e61736d2b336c76e607c7b5f9b50113198398d6"}}, "hash": "4ecee72457cb0034bf6cd847b56909ebc002d7f78934b5da3baeb184b3c7d2c7", "text": "2.4.10 As in Section 4(1), Section 4(2) also does not cast or create any responsibilities on the State or any state organ to ensure that gender neutral information is disseminated nor does it create an obligation on any third party to ensure that only gender neutral information is to be disseminated;

The most important difference between Section 4(2) of the Original Bill and the Reproductive Rights Bill lies in sub-clause (b) where the word \u201cadults\u201d has been replaced by \u201ccouples\u201d in the Reproductive Rights Bill.
