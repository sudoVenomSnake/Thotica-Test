T here is quite a difference in the freshwater biodiversity found in the distinct investigated sites. Consequently, the necessary measures to conserve the threatened biodiversity can be quite different between regions. An overview of identified threats can be found here: \u2022 Agricultural and forestry effluents: Eutrophication happening as a consequence of agricultural activities. \u2022 Droughts: mainly occurring in the tributaries in the middle part of the drainages (upper part in Portugal). \u2022 Dams and water management/use: several dams have been built to regulate the water flow, generate hydroelectric power, and allow navigation through locks. \u2022 Non-native species: several non-native fishes have invaded this river basin (Lepomis gibbosus, Gambusia holbrooki, Ameiurus melas, Sander lucioperca, Alburnus alburnus, Phoxinus bigerri and Barbatula barbatula). \u2022 Housing and urban areas. \u2022 Annual and perennial non-timber crops: the Spanish River Douro valley has great relevance from the point of view of agriculture with important cereal crops (wheat and barley), legumes, vineyards, sugar beets and alfalfa. \u2022 Livestock farming and ranching: in the Spanish River Douro valley, livestock is an important resource. It includes the exploitation of extensive sheep, pigs and cows. \u2022 Shipping lanes: the main Douro River in the Portuguese part, has a series of navigable locks, that impairs the river connectivity and has a severe impact on the migratory species populations (Petromyzon marinus, Alosa sp., Anguilla anguilla, Salmo trutta). \u2022 Hunting terrestrial animals: Hunting is an important activity in the region of Castilla. 5 Threats 37 | Finally, the southern KBA site Sierra de Gredos y Candelario and the southern potential KBA sites of R\u00edo Yeltes, R\u00edo Adaja, R\u00edo Corneja and R\u00edo Eresma exhibited high numbers of threatened species, with a relatively lower number of non-native species, except for some invertebrate species. Trigger species were found in all of the potential KBA sites. This part of the Douro river basin regions seem to be more affected by water shortage and sediment inputs from agriculture activities. Special attention should be given to the potential KBA site R\u00edo Adaja, that is mostly dry during the summer months, but the few permanent pools that remain, concentrate large abundances of fish. The pool numbers seem to be decreasing and the river will possibly dry completely over the course of the following years. The eastern part of the Douro river basin is equally alarming, not solely for the presence of non-native species but particularly for the high occurrence of freshwater threatened species. The northeastern KBA sites Serras de Montesinho e Nogueira and Sierra de la Cabrera are mostly threatened by the physical barriers that were built along the Spanish-Portuguese border, isolating freshwater species populations and making them more prone to genetic erosion and exposure to local extinction. In the southeastern KBA sites El Rebollar and Malcata, increased water usage and climate change have caused water shortage and droughts, and sedimentation caused by summer fires is negatively affecting the freshwater diversity in these sites. \u00a9 Manuel Lopes-Lima BIOPOLIS-CIBIO/InBIO 38 | of Salamanca.

A water management plan is needed to avoid part of river Ulcero within the KBA site Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del R\u00edo Lobos to dry out in the summer. This study provided an overview of the status of freshwater biodiversity in the Douro river basin, and on the effectiveness of KBA sites in conserving the trigger species and other threatened freshwater species. In the majority of sampling sites the freshwater trigger species were not recorded, and in half of the KBA sites the freshwater trigger species were not detected at all. In contrast, trigger species were detected in all four potential KBA sites (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017). A more detailed and comprehensive survey on trigger species is needed to detect and assess the abundance of these species for each KBA site. An update of the status of the KBA sites is necessary if the results show an absence or low abundance of the trigger species or any other threatened species. Furthermore, the investigated sites that were delineated as potential KBA (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017) should be nominated as KBA sites to conserve the high number of threatened freshwater species present. Other threatened species found in the KBA sites should be added as additional trigger species during the updating. Additionally, the area for some KBA sites (Babia-Somiedo, Malcata, Serras de Motesinho e Nogueira) has to be extended to include locations where trigger species occur. Further recognition of the high conservation importance of freshwater KBA sites is needed to strengthen the measures to preserve the freshwater biodiversity in the KBA sites. An intial step should be to include the KBA trigger species in the management plans of existing protected areas (Ramsar Sites, Natura 2000 sites, other national or regional protection schemes). It would be good to analyse the feasibility and convenience of including their monitoring as an indicator of conservation status of the site. KBA sites should also be included in the River Basin Management Plans, either as water bodies or as protected areas, to ensure that an appropriate planning of the basin is done and to ensure that enough water is allocated for the conservation of these sites and that no other measures in the plan harm these sites. One project in the Douro river basin already started with the protection and the recovery of native endemic fish populations: the Project Cipriver in the southwest 6 Conservation guidance 39 | No trigger species were found in 43% of all investigated sites. Especially, the situation of the KBA sites in the northwestern part of the Douro river basin is alarming and a further investigation is needed to assess trigger species abundance and to re-evaluate their status as KBA site. The southwestern part of the Douro basin is characterized by a high number of trigger and threatened species, and several investigated regions in this part of the Douro basin should be recognized as KBA site to protect the existing freshwater biodiversity. Freshwater KBA sites have a high conservation importance, but clear distribution data for the trigger species is necessary and active monitoring and coordination are needed to better conserve the present biodiversity. This study assessed the status of freshwater biodiversity in ten Key Biodiverisity Areas of the Douro river basin and four potential Key Biodiversity Areas (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017). The findings paint a somber picture of the situation in the Douro river basin. The native and endemic species are being outcompeted by non-native species, and suffering from habitat eutrophication and sedimentation due to agricultural and forestry activities. High water consumption and climate change have caused water shortage and droughts, leaving several streams and pools dry during the summer months. Physical barriers and dams are blocking the migration of many endemic species, isolating freshwater species populations and making them more prone to genetic erosion and local extinction. 7 Conclusions Sampling along the Douro river \u00a9 Ronaldo Sousa 40 | References Instituto da \u00c1gua (INAG), I.P.

It provides public, private and non-governmental organisations with the knowledge and tools that enable human progress, economic development and nature conservation to take place together. Created in 1948, IUCN is now the world\u2019s largest and most diverse environmental network, harnessing the knowledge, resources and reach of 1,400 Member organisations and some 15,000 experts. It is a leading provider of conservation data, assessments and analysis. Its broad membership enables IUCN to fill the role of incubator and trusted repository of best practices, tools and international standards. IUCN provides a neutral space in which diverse stakeholders including governments, NGOs, scientists, businesses, local communities, indigenous peoples\u2019 organisations and others can work together to forge and implement solutions to environmental challenges and achieve sustainable development. Working with many partners and supporters, IUCN implements a large and diverse portfolio of conservation projects worldwide. Combining the latest science with the traditional knowledge of local communities, these projects work to reverse habitat loss, restore ecosystems and improve people\u2019s well-being. www.iucn.org https://twitter.com/IUCN/ IUCN Species Survival Commission With over 10,500 Members, the Species Survival Commission (SSC) is the largest of the six expert Commissions of IUCN and enables IUCN to influence, encourage and assist societies to conserve biodiversity by building knowledge on the status and threats to species, providing advice, developing policies and guidelines, facilitating conservation planning, and catalysing conservation action. Members of SSC belong to one or more of the 160+ Specialist Groups, Red List Authorities, Task Forces and Conservation Committees, each focusing on a taxonomic group (plants, fungi, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fishes and invertebrates), or a disciplinary issue, such as sustainable use and livelihoods, reintroduction of species, wildlife health, climate change and conservation planning. https://www.iucn.org/our-union/commissions/species-survival-commission https://twitter.com/iucnssc IUCN Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation The IUCN Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation (IUCN-Med) opened in Malaga (Spain) in October 2001 with the core support of the Spanish Ministry of Environment and the regional Government of Junta de Andaluc\u00eda. The Centre\u2019s mission is to influence, encourage and assist Mediterranean societies to conserve and use sustainably the natural resources of the region and work with IUCN Members and cooperate with all other agencies that share the objectives of IUCN. www.iucn.org/mediterranean The conservation status of freshwater species and habitats in Key Biodiversity Areas at the Douro river basin The designation of geographical entities in this report, and the presentation of the material do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of IUCN or other participating organisations concerning the legal status of any country, territory, or area, or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries.

These sites, either identified as Key Biodiversity Areas1 (KBA) or potential KBA (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017) were assessed on their effectiveness in containing important populations of KBA trigger species2 and threatened species. For this, biodiversity surveys of the taxa used to identify freshwater KBA sites (fishes, molluscs, odonates, and aquatic plants) were undertaken in selected sampling sites. A total of 122 species were recorded in 43 sampling sites, including 82 aquatic plant species, 15 fish species, 12 dragonflies and damselflies species, 2 crayfish species, 5 bivalve species, and 6 gastropod species. Eleven of these species (8 fish, 1 bivalve, 1 odonate and 1 aquatic plant) are classified as threatened with extinction on the IUCN Red List of Threatened SpeciesTM. A total of 7 non-native species were also recorded. Among the 14 investigated sites, the KBA sites Malcata and Montesinho e Nogueira were the sites with the highest total species richness (45 and 42 species, respectively). Taking out the aquatic plant species richness (observed only in a few KBA sites) the highest total species richness was still found in KBA sites Malcata and Serras de Montesinho e Nogueira, but also in the potential KBA R\u00edo Yeltes and the KBA Sierra de Gredos y Candelario. Five investigated sites sheltered the highest number of threatened species: potential KBA R\u00edo Yeltes and the 4 KBA sites Malcata, El Rebollar, Sierra de Gredos y Candelario and Sierra de la Cabrera. The highest number of non-native species were found in the KBA sites Fuentes Carrionas and Sierras de Pe\u00f1a Labra", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "25ce4ecb-83c2-47ad-b320-f55eeefaf419": {"__data__": {"id_": "25ce4ecb-83c2-47ad-b320-f55eeefaf419", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-outcomes-report-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "MARPLASTICCs Outcomes Report 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-outcomes-report-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "453ece8d7fe39bfa5d4b57e1dab1601d22c484dd617c538ed83cd56fa0d427bf"}, "3": {"node_id": "b518efa9-718b-4fd9-acef-211c2b9c6dc2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-outcomes-report-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "80841371dc1dee2faab000f3994be33a74b0987dd2b2628f213ea4ef909bc889"}}, "hash": "0e3f1b2cd76a087f2ab7cf249f3760bd43914f7ad011391532383dc7e4fe165e", "text": "y del Cordel, with KBA Fuentes Carrionas having a higher number of non-native than native species. Concerning Habitat Quality (HQA) from the River Habitat Survey (RHS), the KBA El Rebollar and the potential KBA R\u00edo Yeltes recorded the highest habitat quality. However, these investigated sites (El Rebollar and R\u00edo Yeltes) did also show high scores of Habitat Modification (HMI), only being outnumbered by the KBAs Malcata and Sierras de Pe\u00f1a Labra y del Cordel. Lowest Habitat Modification scores (HMI) were found in KBAs Sierras de Urbi\u00f3n, Cebollera y Neila and Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del R\u00edo Lobos. The study shows worrying results on the status of freshwater biodiversity. No trigger species was found in 43% of all investigated sites surveyed in the Douro river basin. Recognizing that freshwater KBAs have high conservation importance, we identify the shortcomings, which mainly relate to either flawed or lack of distribution data for the trigger species. Trigger species were found in all four investigated sites that were considered as potential KBA (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017), but that are not included as such in the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas. The results of this study support the need for the incorporation of these sites as KBA to help focus conservation efforts and promote management actions that allow the persistence of the biodiversity elements present. On the other hand, no trigger species were detected in several KBA sites, particularly in the northern part of the Douro river basin. In two KBAs (Sierra de Gredos y Candelario and Malcata), the trigger species were not recorded because the habitat where the species normally occurs was not sampled. In 5 KBA sites (Babia-Somiedo, Fuentes Carrionas, Sierras de Pe\u00f1a Labra y del Cordel, Sierras de Urbi\u00f3n, Cebollera y Neila and Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del R\u00edo Lobos) no trigger species was found even after intensive sampling.

V | V | V | other threatened species were detected, which should be added as biodiversity elements in the KBA profiles. A total of 11 threatened species were found in the investigated sites, including 8 fish species: Achondrostoma arcasii (VU), Achondrostoma salmantinum (EN), Anguilla anguilla (CR), Cobitis calderoni (EN), Cobitis paludica (VU), Cobitis vettonica (EN), Pseudochondrostoma duriense (VU), Squalius alburnoides (VU), 1 bivalve species Margaritifera Margaritifera (EN), 1 odonate species Macromia splendens (VU) and 1 aquatic plant species Eryngium viviparum (EN). Besides the ones that were already identified as trigger species for the freshwater KBA sites, including the gastropod species Iberhoratia aurorae (DD), there were 3 threatened species that could qualify as trigger species: 2 fish species Anguilla anguilla (CR), Squalius alburnoides (VU) and 1 odonate species Macromia splendens (VU). The presence of the Critically Endangered european eel (Anguilla anguilla) is however puzzling since two specimens were detected in one of the KBA sites (Serras de Montesinho e Nogueira). Possible explanations are that it is either specimens introduced by man or some eels were able to pass all the dams in the Douro river basin and travel until the Sanabria lake. Further investigation is needed to better understand the current distribution of the european eel in the Douro river basin.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b518efa9-718b-4fd9-acef-211c2b9c6dc2": {"__data__": {"id_": "b518efa9-718b-4fd9-acef-211c2b9c6dc2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-outcomes-report-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "MARPLASTICCs Outcomes Report 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-outcomes-report-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "453ece8d7fe39bfa5d4b57e1dab1601d22c484dd617c538ed83cd56fa0d427bf"}, "2": {"node_id": "25ce4ecb-83c2-47ad-b320-f55eeefaf419", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-outcomes-report-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0e3f1b2cd76a087f2ab7cf249f3760bd43914f7ad011391532383dc7e4fe165e"}}, "hash": "80841371dc1dee2faab000f3994be33a74b0987dd2b2628f213ea4ef909bc889", "text": "The highest number of threatened species was found in the southwestern part of the Douro river basin, including in one potential KBA (R\u00edo Yeltes).

The rivers and streams of the southern and eastern part of the Douro river basin suffer mostly from water shortage. In potential KBA R\u00edo Adaja, where a high number of the 2 trigger species was found, the rivers are completely dry in the summer. Since these potential KBAs form no part of other protective zones, incentives are necessary to safeguard the survival of the freshwater biodiversity that is crucial for the rest of the Douro river basin. On the other side, the western part of the Douro river basin suffers greatly from the large dams along the border between Spain and Portugal. Many of the populations of fish are isolated from the middle and lower sections of the Douro river basin, with an especially large impact on potamodromous migratory fish (species whose entire migration takes place in freshwater). KBA sites have high conservation importance but additional measures are necessary in order to preserve the freshwater biodiversity. Steps should be taken for the inclusion of KBA trigger species in the management plans of existing protected areas (Ramsar Sites, Natura 2000 sites, other national or regional protection figures) and the inclusion of KBA sites in river basin management plans. This will ensure more appropriate planning and correct allocation of funds for nature conservation. Furthermore, management plans to control or even eradicate non-native species should be designed promplty and implemented. Finally, obsolete dams and barriers should be selected for decommissioning, and building fish passages on barriers impermeable to fish should be promoted.

The river also forms the natural border line between Spain and Portugal for 112 kilometers, and many important cities have been built along its river banks, including Valladolid, Zamora, Vila Nova de Gaia and Porto (Bordalo et al., 2006). Once a wild river bursting with wildlife, the Douro has been undergoing quite a change due to human intervention. Fifteen hydrodams have been built to regulate the water flow, generate hydroelectric power, and allow navigation through locks. Consequently, river connectivity was highly impaired (Cortes et al., 2019). The lower part of the Portuguese drainage is influenced by the Atlantic climate. The upper-middle part of the Portuguese and Spanish section is used for agriculture (mainly vineyards) with some tributaries subject to a semi-arid (Mediterranean climate) while others in mountain areas have more water availability (Andresen et al., 2004).

As for the disappearance of the trigger species, the many dams and barriers that are hindering their migratory seasonal patterns and the many stresses on the middle and lower sections of the R\u00edo Pisuerga should be the main impacts. Sedimentation caused by agriculture activities is probably also one of the main threats to the freshwater diversity. Conservation guidance This KBA site needs to be revaluated and surveyed in more detail seasonally for the presence of P. duriense. Trigger species should include A. arcasii, another threatened fish detected here. The management of non-native species, such as the fish Phoxinus bigerri and Gobio lozanoi, and the crayfish P. leniusculus; as well as the increase of the riparian buffer to avoid sedimentation in streams should be pursued as the main conservation measures.

Most of the fish communities of the remaining river sub-basins are declining fast and being replaced by non-native species. Here, we did not find any non-native species, but prevention measures should be developed given the presence of non-native species in the lower section of the river Tormes and the Douro watershed. Conservation guidance Although the site with the trigger species population was not visited, we contacted the authors that had described the species in 2007 and got confirmation about the population status. Therefore, the KBA site seems to be well evaluated but should include other fish trigger species such as Pseudochondrostoma duriense and Squalius alburnoides, both rarely found in other Douro KBA sites in Spain. Management plans for non- native crayfish and fish species should be implemented.

The recent introduction of the signal crayfish might also have an important impact on the future of aquatic species in these basins. Conservation guidance The site is already protected. However a recent study mentions that the park should be extended downstream to include areas richer in diversity and abundance of threatened fish species. Therefore, ideally the KBA site should be extended 10-15 km downstream.

However, barriers in the lower Tera and Esla basin are now isolating freshwater species populations, making them more prone to genetic erosion and exposure to local extinction. Additionally, non-native species such as the signal crayfish P. leniusculus and the fish species P. bigerri and B. barbatula are already in other upper catchments of the Douro river basin and should arrive to this area shortly. Conservation guidance Management plans for potential non-native crayfish and fish should be implemented. An effort should be made to increase the connectivity of the River Tera to the River Douro, by selecting obsolete dams and barriers for decommissioning and building fish passages on barriers impermeable to fish.

T here is quite a difference in the freshwater biodiversity found in the distinct investigated sites. Consequently, the necessary measures to conserve the threatened biodiversity can be quite different between regions. An overview of identified threats can be found here: \u2022 Agricultural and forestry effluents: Eutrophication happening as a consequence of agricultural activities. \u2022 Droughts: mainly occurring in the tributaries in the middle part of the drainages (upper part in Portugal). \u2022 Dams and water management/use: several dams have been built to regulate the water flow, generate hydroelectric power, and allow navigation through locks. \u2022 Non-native species: several non-native fishes have invaded this river basin (Lepomis gibbosus, Gambusia holbrooki, Ameiurus melas, Sander lucioperca, Alburnus alburnus, Phoxinus bigerri and Barbatula barbatula). \u2022 Housing and urban areas. \u2022 Annual and perennial non-timber crops: the Spanish River Douro valley has great relevance from the point of view of agriculture with important cereal crops (wheat and barley), legumes, vineyards, sugar beets and alfalfa. \u2022 Livestock farming and ranching: in the Spanish River Douro valley, livestock is an important resource. It includes the exploitation of extensive sheep, pigs and cows. \u2022 Shipping lanes: the main Douro River in the Portuguese part, has a series of navigable locks, that impairs the river connectivity and has a severe impact on the migratory species populations (Petromyzon marinus, Alosa sp., Anguilla anguilla, Salmo trutta). \u2022 Hunting terrestrial animals: Hunting is an important activity in the region of Castilla. 5 Threats 37 | Finally, the southern KBA site Sierra de Gredos y Candelario and the southern potential KBA sites of R\u00edo Yeltes, R\u00edo Adaja, R\u00edo Corneja and R\u00edo Eresma exhibited high numbers of threatened species, with a relatively lower number of non-native species, except for some invertebrate species. Trigger species were found in all of the potential KBA sites. This part of the Douro river basin regions seem to be more affected by water shortage and sediment inputs from agriculture activities. Special attention should be given to the potential KBA site R\u00edo Adaja, that is mostly dry during the summer months, but the few permanent pools that remain, concentrate large abundances of fish. The pool numbers seem to be decreasing and the river will possibly dry completely over the course of the following years. The eastern part of the Douro river basin is equally alarming, not solely for the presence of non-native species but particularly for the high occurrence of freshwater threatened species. The northeastern KBA sites Serras de Montesinho e Nogueira and Sierra de la Cabrera are mostly threatened by the physical barriers that were built along the Spanish-Portuguese border, isolating freshwater species populations and making them more prone to genetic erosion and exposure to local extinction. In the southeastern KBA sites El Rebollar and Malcata, increased water usage and climate change have caused water shortage and droughts, and sedimentation caused by summer fires is negatively affecting the freshwater diversity in these sites. \u00a9 Manuel Lopes-Lima BIOPOLIS-CIBIO/InBIO 38 | of Salamanca. By captive breeding and adaptation of the riverine habitat conditions, they aim to restore the natural populations of native endemic fish species. Several conservation measures can be taken to improve the conditions of the freshwater biodiversity in the Douro river basin.

A water management plan is needed to avoid part of river Ulcero within the KBA site Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del R\u00edo Lobos to dry out in the summer. This study provided an overview of the status of freshwater biodiversity in the Douro river basin, and on the effectiveness of KBA sites in conserving the trigger species and other threatened freshwater species. In the majority of sampling sites the freshwater trigger species were not recorded, and in half of the KBA sites the freshwater trigger species were not detected at all. In contrast, trigger species were detected in all four potential KBA sites (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017). A more detailed and comprehensive survey on trigger species is needed to detect and assess the abundance of these species for each KBA site. An update of the status of the KBA sites is necessary if the results show an absence or low abundance of the trigger species or any other threatened species. Furthermore, the investigated sites that were delineated as potential KBA (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017) should be nominated as KBA sites to conserve the high number of threatened freshwater species present. Other threatened species found in the KBA sites should be added as additional trigger species during the updating. Additionally, the area for some KBA sites (Babia-Somiedo, Malcata, Serras de Motesinho e Nogueira) has to be extended to include locations where trigger species occur. Further recognition of the high conservation importance of freshwater KBA sites is needed to strengthen the measures to preserve the freshwater biodiversity in the KBA sites. An intial step should be to include the KBA trigger species in the management plans of existing protected areas (Ramsar Sites, Natura 2000 sites, other national or regional protection schemes). It would be good to analyse the feasibility and convenience of including their monitoring as an indicator of conservation status of the site. KBA sites should also be included in the River Basin Management Plans, either as water bodies or as protected areas, to ensure that an appropriate planning of the basin is done and to ensure that enough water is allocated for the conservation of these sites and that no other measures in the plan harm these sites. One project in the Douro river basin already started with the protection and the recovery of native endemic fish populations: the Project Cipriver in the southwest 6 Conservation guidance 39 | No trigger species were found in 43% of all investigated sites. Especially, the situation of the KBA sites in the northwestern part of the Douro river basin is alarming and a further investigation is needed to assess trigger species abundance and to re-evaluate their status as KBA site. The southwestern part of the Douro basin is characterized by a high number of trigger and threatened species, and several investigated regions in this part of the Douro basin should be recognized as KBA site to protect the existing freshwater biodiversity. Freshwater KBA sites have a high conservation importance, but clear distribution data for the trigger species is necessary and active monitoring and coordination are needed to better conserve the present biodiversity. This study assessed the status of freshwater biodiversity in ten Key Biodiverisity Areas of the Douro river basin and four potential Key Biodiversity Areas (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017). The findings paint a somber picture of the situation in the Douro river basin. The native and endemic species are being outcompeted by non-native species, and suffering from habitat eutrophication and sedimentation due to agricultural and forestry activities. High water consumption and climate change have caused water shortage and droughts, leaving several streams and pools dry during the summer months. Physical barriers and dams are blocking the migration of many endemic species, isolating freshwater species populations and making them more prone to genetic erosion and local extinction. 7 Conclusions Sampling along the Douro river \u00a9 Ronaldo Sousa 40 | References Instituto da \u00c1gua (INAG), I.P.

It provides public, private and non-governmental organisations with the knowledge and tools that enable human progress, economic development and nature conservation to take place together. Created in 1948, IUCN is now the world\u2019s largest and most diverse environmental network, harnessing the knowledge, resources and reach of 1,400 Member organisations and some 15,000 experts. It is a leading provider of conservation data, assessments and analysis. Its broad membership enables IUCN to fill the role of incubator and trusted repository of best practices, tools and international standards. IUCN provides a neutral space in which diverse stakeholders including governments, NGOs, scientists, businesses, local communities, indigenous peoples\u2019 organisations and others can work together to forge and implement solutions to environmental challenges and achieve sustainable development. Working with many partners and supporters, IUCN implements a large and diverse portfolio of conservation projects worldwide. Combining the latest science with the traditional knowledge of local communities, these projects work to reverse habitat loss, restore ecosystems and improve people\u2019s well-being. www.iucn.org https://twitter.com/IUCN/ IUCN Species Survival Commission With over 10,500 Members, the Species Survival Commission (SSC) is the largest of the six expert Commissions of IUCN and enables IUCN to influence, encourage and assist societies to conserve biodiversity by building knowledge on the status and threats to species, providing advice, developing policies and guidelines, facilitating conservation planning, and catalysing conservation action. Members of SSC belong to one or more of the 160+ Specialist Groups, Red List Authorities, Task Forces and Conservation Committees, each focusing on a taxonomic group (plants, fungi, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fishes and invertebrates), or a disciplinary issue, such as sustainable use and livelihoods, reintroduction of species, wildlife health, climate change and conservation planning. https://www.iucn.org/our-union/commissions/species-survival-commission https://twitter.com/iucnssc IUCN Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation The IUCN Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation (IUCN-Med) opened in Malaga (Spain) in October 2001 with the core support of the Spanish Ministry of Environment and the regional Government of Junta de Andaluc\u00eda. The Centre\u2019s mission is to influence, encourage and assist Mediterranean societies to conserve and use sustainably the natural resources of the region and work with IUCN Members and cooperate with all other agencies that share the objectives of IUCN. www.iucn.org/mediterranean The conservation status of freshwater species and habitats in Key Biodiversity Areas at the Douro river basin The designation of geographical entities in this report, and the presentation of the material do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of IUCN or other participating organisations concerning the legal status of any country, territory, or area, or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries.

These sites, either identified as Key Biodiversity Areas1 (KBA) or potential KBA (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017) were assessed on their effectiveness in containing important populations of KBA trigger species2 and threatened species. For this, biodiversity surveys of the taxa used to identify freshwater KBA sites (fishes, molluscs, odonates, and aquatic plants) were undertaken in selected sampling sites. A total of 122 species were recorded in 43 sampling sites, including 82 aquatic plant species, 15 fish species, 12 dragonflies and damselflies species, 2 crayfish species, 5 bivalve species, and 6 gastropod species. Eleven of these species (8 fish, 1 bivalve, 1 odonate and 1 aquatic plant) are classified as threatened with extinction on the IUCN Red List of Threatened SpeciesTM. A total of 7 non-native species were also recorded. Among the 14 investigated sites, the KBA sites Malcata and Montesinho e Nogueira were the sites with the highest total species richness (45 and 42 species, respectively). Taking out the aquatic plant species richness (observed only in a few KBA sites) the highest total species richness was still found in KBA sites Malcata and Serras de Montesinho e Nogueira, but also in the potential KBA R\u00edo Yeltes and the KBA Sierra de Gredos y Candelario. Five investigated sites sheltered the highest number of threatened species: potential KBA R\u00edo Yeltes and the 4 KBA sites Malcata, El Rebollar, Sierra de Gredos y Candelario and Sierra de la Cabrera. The highest number of non-native species were found in the KBA sites Fuentes Carrionas and Sierras de Pe\u00f1a Labra", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "26c2bc50-75eb-4f07-a268-cdd7eb2ecb10": {"__data__": {"id_": "26c2bc50-75eb-4f07-a268-cdd7eb2ecb10", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-outcomes-reports-2020", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "MARPLASTICCs Outcomes Reports 2020", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-outcomes-reports-2020", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "57cdb92c7fef56acc8a37788ad24366babf93e03ab72d426d7bf382f3dfee046"}, "3": {"node_id": "719cefc9-5786-4482-8bee-2e250bbf60f7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-outcomes-reports-2020", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ec037af8cd50d89bc9c5e6e63b52f5c1c9e84c0059816c3aac05737f20acf561"}}, "hash": "be899cde92d1b845a78e4ad5d7c55bfa2fca1f0c616dcf76a39d4f264ba94a63", "text": "y del Cordel, with KBA Fuentes Carrionas having a higher number of non-native than native species. Concerning Habitat Quality (HQA) from the River Habitat Survey (RHS), the KBA El Rebollar and the potential KBA R\u00edo Yeltes recorded the highest habitat quality. However, these investigated sites (El Rebollar and R\u00edo Yeltes) did also show high scores of Habitat Modification (HMI), only being outnumbered by the KBAs Malcata and Sierras de Pe\u00f1a Labra y del Cordel. Lowest Habitat Modification scores (HMI) were found in KBAs Sierras de Urbi\u00f3n, Cebollera y Neila and Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del R\u00edo Lobos. The study shows worrying results on the status of freshwater biodiversity. No trigger species was found in 43% of all investigated sites surveyed in the Douro river basin. Recognizing that freshwater KBAs have high conservation importance, we identify the shortcomings, which mainly relate to either flawed or lack of distribution data for the trigger species. Trigger species were found in all four investigated sites that were considered as potential KBA (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017), but that are not included as such in the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas. The results of this study support the need for the incorporation of these sites as KBA to help focus conservation efforts and promote management actions that allow the persistence of the biodiversity elements present. On the other hand, no trigger species were detected in several KBA sites, particularly in the northern part of the Douro river basin. In two KBAs (Sierra de Gredos y Candelario and Malcata), the trigger species were not recorded because the habitat where the species normally occurs was not sampled. In 5 KBA sites (Babia-Somiedo, Fuentes Carrionas, Sierras de Pe\u00f1a Labra y del Cordel, Sierras de Urbi\u00f3n, Cebollera y Neila and Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del R\u00edo Lobos) no trigger species was found even after intensive sampling. In 3 of these KBA sites (Babia-Somiedo, Fuentes Carrionas, Sierras de Pe\u00f1a Labra y del Cordel) \u2014 1 Sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity. https://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/ 2 Trigger species are the species that trigger the criteria for threatened, geographically restricted, biological processes or irreplaceability and thus identify a site as a KBA (IUCN, 2016). V | V | V | other threatened species were detected, which should be added as biodiversity elements in the KBA profiles. A total of 11 threatened species were found in the investigated sites, including 8 fish species: Achondrostoma arcasii (VU), Achondrostoma salmantinum (EN), Anguilla anguilla (CR), Cobitis calderoni (EN), Cobitis paludica (VU), Cobitis vettonica (EN), Pseudochondrostoma duriense (VU), Squalius alburnoides (VU), 1 bivalve species Margaritifera Margaritifera (EN), 1 odonate species Macromia splendens (VU) and 1 aquatic plant species Eryngium viviparum (EN). Besides the ones that were already identified as trigger species for the freshwater KBA sites, including the gastropod species Iberhoratia aurorae (DD), there were 3 threatened species that could qualify as trigger species: 2 fish species Anguilla anguilla (CR), Squalius alburnoides (VU) and 1 odonate species Macromia splendens (VU). The presence of the Critically Endangered european eel (Anguilla anguilla) is however puzzling since two specimens were detected in one of the KBA sites (Serras de Montesinho e Nogueira). Possible explanations are that it is either specimens introduced by man or some eels were able to pass all the dams in the Douro river basin and travel until the Sanabria lake. Further investigation is needed to better understand the current distribution of the european eel in the Douro river basin. The highest number of threatened species was found in the southwestern part of the Douro river basin, including in one potential KBA (R\u00edo Yeltes).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "719cefc9-5786-4482-8bee-2e250bbf60f7": {"__data__": {"id_": "719cefc9-5786-4482-8bee-2e250bbf60f7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-outcomes-reports-2020", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "MARPLASTICCs Outcomes Reports 2020", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-outcomes-reports-2020", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "57cdb92c7fef56acc8a37788ad24366babf93e03ab72d426d7bf382f3dfee046"}, "2": {"node_id": "26c2bc50-75eb-4f07-a268-cdd7eb2ecb10", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-outcomes-reports-2020", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "be899cde92d1b845a78e4ad5d7c55bfa2fca1f0c616dcf76a39d4f264ba94a63"}}, "hash": "ec037af8cd50d89bc9c5e6e63b52f5c1c9e84c0059816c3aac05737f20acf561", "text": "At 2 KBA sites in the far northeastern part of the Douro river basin (Sierras de Urbi\u00f3n, Cebollera y Neila and Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del R\u00edo Lobos) no threatened species were recorded. Non-native species were identified as an important threat for the native freshwater biodiversity. A total of 7 non-native species were found during this study in the Douro river basin: 2 crayfish species (Pacifastacus leniusculus and Procambarus clarkii), 1 bivalve species (Corbicula fluminea) and 4 fish species (Barbatula barbatula, Gambusia holbrooki, Gobio lozanoi and Phoxinus bigerri). Non-native species were found in all but 3 investigated sites (potential KBA R\u00edo Corneja, KBA Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del R\u00edo Lobos, KBA Sierra de Gredos y Candelario). These findings suggest that some of the endemic species remaining in sub-basins are being replaced by non-native species.

The rivers and streams of the southern and eastern part of the Douro river basin suffer mostly from water shortage. In potential KBA R\u00edo Adaja, where a high number of the 2 trigger species was found, the rivers are completely dry in the summer. Since these potential KBAs form no part of other protective zones, incentives are necessary to safeguard the survival of the freshwater biodiversity that is crucial for the rest of the Douro river basin. On the other side, the western part of the Douro river basin suffers greatly from the large dams along the border between Spain and Portugal. Many of the populations of fish are isolated from the middle and lower sections of the Douro river basin, with an especially large impact on potamodromous migratory fish (species whose entire migration takes place in freshwater). KBA sites have high conservation importance but additional measures are necessary in order to preserve the freshwater biodiversity. Steps should be taken for the inclusion of KBA trigger species in the management plans of existing protected areas (Ramsar Sites, Natura 2000 sites, other national or regional protection figures) and the inclusion of KBA sites in river basin management plans. This will ensure more appropriate planning and correct allocation of funds for nature conservation. Furthermore, management plans to control or even eradicate non-native species should be designed promplty and implemented. Finally, obsolete dams and barriers should be selected for decommissioning, and building fish passages on barriers impermeable to fish should be promoted.

The river also forms the natural border line between Spain and Portugal for 112 kilometers, and many important cities have been built along its river banks, including Valladolid, Zamora, Vila Nova de Gaia and Porto (Bordalo et al., 2006). Once a wild river bursting with wildlife, the Douro has been undergoing quite a change due to human intervention. Fifteen hydrodams have been built to regulate the water flow, generate hydroelectric power, and allow navigation through locks. Consequently, river connectivity was highly impaired (Cortes et al., 2019). The lower part of the Portuguese drainage is influenced by the Atlantic climate. The upper-middle part of the Portuguese and Spanish section is used for agriculture (mainly vineyards) with some tributaries subject to a semi-arid (Mediterranean climate) while others in mountain areas have more water availability (Andresen et al., 2004). The main threats are posed by big urban areas and severe pollution. 1 Introduction \u00a9 Manuel Lopes-Lima BIOPOLIS-CIBIO/InBIO 2 | Figure 1.

As for the disappearance of the trigger species, the many dams and barriers that are hindering their migratory seasonal patterns and the many stresses on the middle and lower sections of the R\u00edo Pisuerga should be the main impacts. Sedimentation caused by agriculture activities is probably also one of the main threats to the freshwater diversity. Conservation guidance This KBA site needs to be revaluated and surveyed in more detail seasonally for the presence of P. duriense. Trigger species should include A. arcasii, another threatened fish detected here. The management of non-native species, such as the fish Phoxinus bigerri and Gobio lozanoi, and the crayfish P. leniusculus; as well as the increase of the riparian buffer to avoid sedimentation in streams should be pursued as the main conservation measures.

Most of the fish communities of the remaining river sub-basins are declining fast and being replaced by non-native species. Here, we did not find any non-native species, but prevention measures should be developed given the presence of non-native species in the lower section of the river Tormes and the Douro watershed. Conservation guidance Although the site with the trigger species population was not visited, we contacted the authors that had described the species in 2007 and got confirmation about the population status. Therefore, the KBA site seems to be well evaluated but should include other fish trigger species such as Pseudochondrostoma duriense and Squalius alburnoides, both rarely found in other Douro KBA sites in Spain. Management plans for non- native crayfish and fish species should be implemented.

These dams might be disruptive for potamodromous migratory fish such as P. duriense or L. bocagei. The recent introduction of the signal crayfish might also have an important impact on the future of aquatic species in these basins. Conservation guidance The site is already protected. However a recent study mentions that the park should be extended downstream to include areas richer in diversity and abundance of threatened fish species. Therefore, ideally the KBA site should be extended 10-15 km downstream. The KBA should also include the Iberian Nase P. duriense as a trigger species, which has dramatically declined in the whole basin.

T here is quite a difference in the freshwater biodiversity found in the distinct investigated sites. Consequently, the necessary measures to conserve the threatened biodiversity can be quite different between regions. An overview of identified threats can be found here: \u2022 Agricultural and forestry effluents: Eutrophication happening as a consequence of agricultural activities. \u2022 Droughts: mainly occurring in the tributaries in the middle part of the drainages (upper part in Portugal). \u2022 Dams and water management/use: several dams have been built to regulate the water flow, generate hydroelectric power, and allow navigation through locks. \u2022 Non-native species: several non-native fishes have invaded this river basin (Lepomis gibbosus, Gambusia holbrooki, Ameiurus melas, Sander lucioperca, Alburnus alburnus, Phoxinus bigerri and Barbatula barbatula). \u2022 Housing and urban areas. \u2022 Annual and perennial non-timber crops: the Spanish River Douro valley has great relevance from the point of view of agriculture with important cereal crops (wheat and barley), legumes, vineyards, sugar beets and alfalfa. \u2022 Livestock farming and ranching: in the Spanish River Douro valley, livestock is an important resource. It includes the exploitation of extensive sheep, pigs and cows. \u2022 Shipping lanes: the main Douro River in the Portuguese part, has a series of navigable locks, that impairs the river connectivity and has a severe impact on the migratory species populations (Petromyzon marinus, Alosa sp., Anguilla anguilla, Salmo trutta). \u2022 Hunting terrestrial animals: Hunting is an important activity in the region of Castilla. 5 Threats 37 | Finally, the southern KBA site Sierra de Gredos y Candelario and the southern potential KBA sites of R\u00edo Yeltes, R\u00edo Adaja, R\u00edo Corneja and R\u00edo Eresma exhibited high numbers of threatened species, with a relatively lower number of non-native species, except for some invertebrate species. Trigger species were found in all of the potential KBA sites. This part of the Douro river basin regions seem to be more affected by water shortage and sediment inputs from agriculture activities. Special attention should be given to the potential KBA site R\u00edo Adaja, that is mostly dry during the summer months, but the few permanent pools that remain, concentrate large abundances of fish. The pool numbers seem to be decreasing and the river will possibly dry completely over the course of the following years. The eastern part of the Douro river basin is equally alarming, not solely for the presence of non-native species but particularly for the high occurrence of freshwater threatened species. The northeastern KBA sites Serras de Montesinho e Nogueira and Sierra de la Cabrera are mostly threatened by the physical barriers that were built along the Spanish-Portuguese border, isolating freshwater species populations and making them more prone to genetic erosion and exposure to local extinction. In the southeastern KBA sites El Rebollar and Malcata, increased water usage and climate change have caused water shortage and droughts, and sedimentation caused by summer fires is negatively affecting the freshwater diversity in these sites. \u00a9 Manuel Lopes-Lima BIOPOLIS-CIBIO/InBIO 38 | of Salamanca.

A water management plan is needed to avoid part of river Ulcero within the KBA site Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del R\u00edo Lobos to dry out in the summer. This study provided an overview of the status of freshwater biodiversity in the Douro river basin, and on the effectiveness of KBA sites in conserving the trigger species and other threatened freshwater species. In the majority of sampling sites the freshwater trigger species were not recorded, and in half of the KBA sites the freshwater trigger species were not detected at all. In contrast, trigger species were detected in all four potential KBA sites (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017). A more detailed and comprehensive survey on trigger species is needed to detect and assess the abundance of these species for each KBA site. An update of the status of the KBA sites is necessary if the results show an absence or low abundance of the trigger species or any other threatened species. Furthermore, the investigated sites that were delineated as potential KBA (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017) should be nominated as KBA sites to conserve the high number of threatened freshwater species present. Other threatened species found in the KBA sites should be added as additional trigger species during the updating. Additionally, the area for some KBA sites (Babia-Somiedo, Malcata, Serras de Motesinho e Nogueira) has to be extended to include locations where trigger species occur. Further recognition of the high conservation importance of freshwater KBA sites is needed to strengthen the measures to preserve the freshwater biodiversity in the KBA sites. An intial step should be to include the KBA trigger species in the management plans of existing protected areas (Ramsar Sites, Natura 2000 sites, other national or regional protection schemes). It would be good to analyse the feasibility and convenience of including their monitoring as an indicator of conservation status of the site. KBA sites should also be included in the River Basin Management Plans, either as water bodies or as protected areas, to ensure that an appropriate planning of the basin is done and to ensure that enough water is allocated for the conservation of these sites and that no other measures in the plan harm these sites. One project in the Douro river basin already started with the protection and the recovery of native endemic fish populations: the Project Cipriver in the southwest 6 Conservation guidance 39 | No trigger species were found in 43% of all investigated sites. Especially, the situation of the KBA sites in the northwestern part of the Douro river basin is alarming and a further investigation is needed to assess trigger species abundance and to re-evaluate their status as KBA site. The southwestern part of the Douro basin is characterized by a high number of trigger and threatened species, and several investigated regions in this part of the Douro basin should be recognized as KBA site to protect the existing freshwater biodiversity. Freshwater KBA sites have a high conservation importance, but clear distribution data for the trigger species is necessary and active monitoring and coordination are needed to better conserve the present biodiversity. This study assessed the status of freshwater biodiversity in ten Key Biodiverisity Areas of the Douro river basin and four potential Key Biodiversity Areas (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017). The findings paint a somber picture of the situation in the Douro river basin. The native and endemic species are being outcompeted by non-native species, and suffering from habitat eutrophication and sedimentation due to agricultural and forestry activities. High water consumption and climate change have caused water shortage and droughts, leaving several streams and pools dry during the summer months. Physical barriers and dams are blocking the migration of many endemic species, isolating freshwater species populations and making them more prone to genetic erosion and local extinction. 7 Conclusions Sampling along the Douro river \u00a9 Ronaldo Sousa 40 | References Instituto da \u00c1gua (INAG), I.P.

It provides public, private and non-governmental organisations with the knowledge and tools that enable human progress, economic development and nature conservation to take place together. Created in 1948, IUCN is now the world\u2019s largest and most diverse environmental network, harnessing the knowledge, resources and reach of 1,400 Member organisations and some 15,000 experts. It is a leading provider of conservation data, assessments and analysis. Its broad membership enables IUCN to fill the role of incubator and trusted repository of best practices, tools and international standards. IUCN provides a neutral space in which diverse stakeholders including governments, NGOs, scientists, businesses, local communities, indigenous peoples\u2019 organisations and others can work together to forge and implement solutions to environmental challenges and achieve sustainable development. Working with many partners and supporters, IUCN implements a large and diverse portfolio of conservation projects worldwide. Combining the latest science with the traditional knowledge of local communities, these projects work to reverse habitat loss, restore ecosystems and improve people\u2019s well-being. www.iucn.org https://twitter.com/IUCN/ IUCN Species Survival Commission With over 10,500 Members, the Species Survival Commission (SSC) is the largest of the six expert Commissions of IUCN and enables IUCN to influence, encourage and assist societies to conserve biodiversity by building knowledge on the status and threats to species, providing advice, developing policies and guidelines, facilitating conservation planning, and catalysing conservation action. Members of SSC belong to one or more of the 160+ Specialist Groups, Red List Authorities, Task Forces and Conservation Committees, each focusing on a taxonomic group (plants, fungi, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fishes and invertebrates), or a disciplinary issue, such as sustainable use and livelihoods, reintroduction of species, wildlife health, climate change and conservation planning. https://www.iucn.org/our-union/commissions/species-survival-commission https://twitter.com/iucnssc IUCN Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation The IUCN Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation (IUCN-Med) opened in Malaga (Spain) in October 2001 with the core support of the Spanish Ministry of Environment and the regional Government of Junta de Andaluc\u00eda. The Centre\u2019s mission is to influence, encourage and assist Mediterranean societies to conserve and use sustainably the natural resources of the region and work with IUCN Members and cooperate with all other agencies that share the objectives of IUCN. www.iucn.org/mediterranean The conservation status of freshwater species and habitats in Key Biodiversity Areas at the Douro river basin The designation of geographical entities in this report, and the presentation of the material do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of IUCN or other participating organisations concerning the legal status of any country, territory, or area, or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries.

These sites, either identified as Key Biodiversity Areas1 (KBA) or potential KBA (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017) were assessed on their effectiveness in containing important populations of KBA trigger species2 and threatened species. For this, biodiversity surveys of the taxa used to identify freshwater KBA sites (fishes, molluscs, odonates, and aquatic plants) were undertaken in selected sampling sites. A total of 122 species were recorded in 43 sampling sites, including 82 aquatic plant species, 15 fish species, 12 dragonflies and damselflies species, 2 crayfish species, 5 bivalve species, and 6 gastropod species. Eleven of these species (8 fish, 1 bivalve, 1 odonate and 1 aquatic plant) are classified as threatened with extinction on the IUCN Red List of Threatened SpeciesTM. A total of 7 non-native species were also recorded. Among the 14 investigated sites, the KBA sites Malcata and Montesinho e Nogueira were the sites with the highest total species richness (45 and 42 species, respectively). Taking out the aquatic plant species richness (observed only in a few KBA sites) the highest total species richness was still found in KBA sites Malcata and Serras de Montesinho e Nogueira, but also in the potential KBA R\u00edo Yeltes and the KBA Sierra de Gredos y Candelario. Five investigated sites sheltered the highest number of threatened species: potential KBA R\u00edo Yeltes and the 4 KBA sites Malcata, El Rebollar, Sierra de Gredos y Candelario and Sierra de la Cabrera. The highest number of non-native species were found in the KBA sites Fuentes Carrionas and Sierras de Pe\u00f1a Labra", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "927c1b3d-1e51-49a8-bd4b-878c86eb9297": {"__data__": {"id_": "927c1b3d-1e51-49a8-bd4b-878c86eb9297", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-economic-briefs-viet-nam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "MARPLASTICCs Economic Briefs - Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-economic-briefs-viet-nam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "03d4adba521c49c2e5cd927470c6091f0ff3994d102d9fdbde7818e08466dfa9"}, "3": {"node_id": "f99100f4-63d6-441b-bb3f-5a83fb17ae3e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-economic-briefs-viet-nam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f36a4f26efb61b04adda9a1d720d51eacbf2b4d10f5e266d904e73e4e47dd774"}}, "hash": "70dfb0458e902d9f5e5c0bc32c3241f04bb04f45238cfbb051ad0dc9906e30dd", "text": "y del Cordel, with KBA Fuentes Carrionas having a higher number of non-native than native species. Concerning Habitat Quality (HQA) from the River Habitat Survey (RHS), the KBA El Rebollar and the potential KBA R\u00edo Yeltes recorded the highest habitat quality. However, these investigated sites (El Rebollar and R\u00edo Yeltes) did also show high scores of Habitat Modification (HMI), only being outnumbered by the KBAs Malcata and Sierras de Pe\u00f1a Labra y del Cordel. Lowest Habitat Modification scores (HMI) were found in KBAs Sierras de Urbi\u00f3n, Cebollera y Neila and Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del R\u00edo Lobos. The study shows worrying results on the status of freshwater biodiversity. No trigger species was found in 43% of all investigated sites surveyed in the Douro river basin. Recognizing that freshwater KBAs have high conservation importance, we identify the shortcomings, which mainly relate to either flawed or lack of distribution data for the trigger species. Trigger species were found in all four investigated sites that were considered as potential KBA (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017), but that are not included as such in the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas. The results of this study support the need for the incorporation of these sites as KBA to help focus conservation efforts and promote management actions that allow the persistence of the biodiversity elements present. On the other hand, no trigger species were detected in several KBA sites, particularly in the northern part of the Douro river basin. In two KBAs (Sierra de Gredos y Candelario and Malcata), the trigger species were not recorded because the habitat where the species normally occurs was not sampled. In 5 KBA sites (Babia-Somiedo, Fuentes Carrionas, Sierras de Pe\u00f1a Labra y del Cordel, Sierras de Urbi\u00f3n, Cebollera y Neila and Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del R\u00edo Lobos) no trigger species was found even after intensive sampling.

V | V | V | other threatened species were detected, which should be added as biodiversity elements in the KBA profiles. A total of 11 threatened species were found in the investigated sites, including 8 fish species: Achondrostoma arcasii (VU), Achondrostoma salmantinum (EN), Anguilla anguilla (CR), Cobitis calderoni (EN), Cobitis paludica (VU), Cobitis vettonica (EN), Pseudochondrostoma duriense (VU), Squalius alburnoides (VU), 1 bivalve species Margaritifera Margaritifera (EN), 1 odonate species Macromia splendens (VU) and 1 aquatic plant species Eryngium viviparum (EN). Besides the ones that were already identified as trigger species for the freshwater KBA sites, including the gastropod species Iberhoratia aurorae (DD), there were 3 threatened species that could qualify as trigger species: 2 fish species Anguilla anguilla (CR), Squalius alburnoides (VU) and 1 odonate species Macromia splendens (VU). The presence of the Critically Endangered european eel (Anguilla anguilla) is however puzzling since two specimens were detected in one of the KBA sites (Serras de Montesinho e Nogueira). Possible explanations are that it is either specimens introduced by man or some eels were able to pass all the dams in the Douro river basin and travel until the Sanabria lake. Further investigation is needed to better understand the current distribution of the european eel in the Douro river basin.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f99100f4-63d6-441b-bb3f-5a83fb17ae3e": {"__data__": {"id_": "f99100f4-63d6-441b-bb3f-5a83fb17ae3e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-economic-briefs-viet-nam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "MARPLASTICCs Economic Briefs - Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-economic-briefs-viet-nam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "03d4adba521c49c2e5cd927470c6091f0ff3994d102d9fdbde7818e08466dfa9"}, "2": {"node_id": "927c1b3d-1e51-49a8-bd4b-878c86eb9297", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-economic-briefs-viet-nam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "70dfb0458e902d9f5e5c0bc32c3241f04bb04f45238cfbb051ad0dc9906e30dd"}}, "hash": "f36a4f26efb61b04adda9a1d720d51eacbf2b4d10f5e266d904e73e4e47dd774", "text": "The highest number of threatened species was found in the southwestern part of the Douro river basin, including in one potential KBA (R\u00edo Yeltes).

The rivers and streams of the southern and eastern part of the Douro river basin suffer mostly from water shortage. In potential KBA R\u00edo Adaja, where a high number of the 2 trigger species was found, the rivers are completely dry in the summer. Since these potential KBAs form no part of other protective zones, incentives are necessary to safeguard the survival of the freshwater biodiversity that is crucial for the rest of the Douro river basin. On the other side, the western part of the Douro river basin suffers greatly from the large dams along the border between Spain and Portugal. Many of the populations of fish are isolated from the middle and lower sections of the Douro river basin, with an especially large impact on potamodromous migratory fish (species whose entire migration takes place in freshwater). KBA sites have high conservation importance but additional measures are necessary in order to preserve the freshwater biodiversity. Steps should be taken for the inclusion of KBA trigger species in the management plans of existing protected areas (Ramsar Sites, Natura 2000 sites, other national or regional protection figures) and the inclusion of KBA sites in river basin management plans. This will ensure more appropriate planning and correct allocation of funds for nature conservation. Furthermore, management plans to control or even eradicate non-native species should be designed promplty and implemented. Finally, obsolete dams and barriers should be selected for decommissioning, and building fish passages on barriers impermeable to fish should be promoted.

The river also forms the natural border line between Spain and Portugal for 112 kilometers, and many important cities have been built along its river banks, including Valladolid, Zamora, Vila Nova de Gaia and Porto (Bordalo et al., 2006). Once a wild river bursting with wildlife, the Douro has been undergoing quite a change due to human intervention. Fifteen hydrodams have been built to regulate the water flow, generate hydroelectric power, and allow navigation through locks. Consequently, river connectivity was highly impaired (Cortes et al., 2019). The lower part of the Portuguese drainage is influenced by the Atlantic climate. The upper-middle part of the Portuguese and Spanish section is used for agriculture (mainly vineyards) with some tributaries subject to a semi-arid (Mediterranean climate) while others in mountain areas have more water availability (Andresen et al., 2004).

As for the disappearance of the trigger species, the many dams and barriers that are hindering their migratory seasonal patterns and the many stresses on the middle and lower sections of the R\u00edo Pisuerga should be the main impacts. Sedimentation caused by agriculture activities is probably also one of the main threats to the freshwater diversity. Conservation guidance This KBA site needs to be revaluated and surveyed in more detail seasonally for the presence of P. duriense. Trigger species should include A. arcasii, another threatened fish detected here. The management of non-native species, such as the fish Phoxinus bigerri and Gobio lozanoi, and the crayfish P. leniusculus; as well as the increase of the riparian buffer to avoid sedimentation in streams should be pursued as the main conservation measures.

Most of the fish communities of the remaining river sub-basins are declining fast and being replaced by non-native species. Here, we did not find any non-native species, but prevention measures should be developed given the presence of non-native species in the lower section of the river Tormes and the Douro watershed. Conservation guidance Although the site with the trigger species population was not visited, we contacted the authors that had described the species in 2007 and got confirmation about the population status. Therefore, the KBA site seems to be well evaluated but should include other fish trigger species such as Pseudochondrostoma duriense and Squalius alburnoides, both rarely found in other Douro KBA sites in Spain. Management plans for non- native crayfish and fish species should be implemented.

T here is quite a difference in the freshwater biodiversity found in the distinct investigated sites. Consequently, the necessary measures to conserve the threatened biodiversity can be quite different between regions. An overview of identified threats can be found here: \u2022 Agricultural and forestry effluents: Eutrophication happening as a consequence of agricultural activities. \u2022 Droughts: mainly occurring in the tributaries in the middle part of the drainages (upper part in Portugal). \u2022 Dams and water management/use: several dams have been built to regulate the water flow, generate hydroelectric power, and allow navigation through locks. \u2022 Non-native species: several non-native fishes have invaded this river basin (Lepomis gibbosus, Gambusia holbrooki, Ameiurus melas, Sander lucioperca, Alburnus alburnus, Phoxinus bigerri and Barbatula barbatula). \u2022 Housing and urban areas. \u2022 Annual and perennial non-timber crops: the Spanish River Douro valley has great relevance from the point of view of agriculture with important cereal crops (wheat and barley), legumes, vineyards, sugar beets and alfalfa. \u2022 Livestock farming and ranching: in the Spanish River Douro valley, livestock is an important resource. It includes the exploitation of extensive sheep, pigs and cows. \u2022 Shipping lanes: the main Douro River in the Portuguese part, has a series of navigable locks, that impairs the river connectivity and has a severe impact on the migratory species populations (Petromyzon marinus, Alosa sp., Anguilla anguilla, Salmo trutta). \u2022 Hunting terrestrial animals: Hunting is an important activity in the region of Castilla. 5 Threats 37 | Finally, the southern KBA site Sierra de Gredos y Candelario and the southern potential KBA sites of R\u00edo Yeltes, R\u00edo Adaja, R\u00edo Corneja and R\u00edo Eresma exhibited high numbers of threatened species, with a relatively lower number of non-native species, except for some invertebrate species. Trigger species were found in all of the potential KBA sites. This part of the Douro river basin regions seem to be more affected by water shortage and sediment inputs from agriculture activities. Special attention should be given to the potential KBA site R\u00edo Adaja, that is mostly dry during the summer months, but the few permanent pools that remain, concentrate large abundances of fish. The pool numbers seem to be decreasing and the river will possibly dry completely over the course of the following years. The eastern part of the Douro river basin is equally alarming, not solely for the presence of non-native species but particularly for the high occurrence of freshwater threatened species. The northeastern KBA sites Serras de Montesinho e Nogueira and Sierra de la Cabrera are mostly threatened by the physical barriers that were built along the Spanish-Portuguese border, isolating freshwater species populations and making them more prone to genetic erosion and exposure to local extinction. In the southeastern KBA sites El Rebollar and Malcata, increased water usage and climate change have caused water shortage and droughts, and sedimentation caused by summer fires is negatively affecting the freshwater diversity in these sites. \u00a9 Manuel Lopes-Lima BIOPOLIS-CIBIO/InBIO 38 | of Salamanca. By captive breeding and adaptation of the riverine habitat conditions, they aim to restore the natural populations of native endemic fish species. Several conservation measures can be taken to improve the conditions of the freshwater biodiversity in the Douro river basin.

A water management plan is needed to avoid part of river Ulcero within the KBA site Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del R\u00edo Lobos to dry out in the summer. This study provided an overview of the status of freshwater biodiversity in the Douro river basin, and on the effectiveness of KBA sites in conserving the trigger species and other threatened freshwater species. In the majority of sampling sites the freshwater trigger species were not recorded, and in half of the KBA sites the freshwater trigger species were not detected at all. In contrast, trigger species were detected in all four potential KBA sites (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017). A more detailed and comprehensive survey on trigger species is needed to detect and assess the abundance of these species for each KBA site. An update of the status of the KBA sites is necessary if the results show an absence or low abundance of the trigger species or any other threatened species. Furthermore, the investigated sites that were delineated as potential KBA (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017) should be nominated as KBA sites to conserve the high number of threatened freshwater species present. Other threatened species found in the KBA sites should be added as additional trigger species during the updating. Additionally, the area for some KBA sites (Babia-Somiedo, Malcata, Serras de Motesinho e Nogueira) has to be extended to include locations where trigger species occur. Further recognition of the high conservation importance of freshwater KBA sites is needed to strengthen the measures to preserve the freshwater biodiversity in the KBA sites. An intial step should be to include the KBA trigger species in the management plans of existing protected areas (Ramsar Sites, Natura 2000 sites, other national or regional protection schemes). It would be good to analyse the feasibility and convenience of including their monitoring as an indicator of conservation status of the site. KBA sites should also be included in the River Basin Management Plans, either as water bodies or as protected areas, to ensure that an appropriate planning of the basin is done and to ensure that enough water is allocated for the conservation of these sites and that no other measures in the plan harm these sites. One project in the Douro river basin already started with the protection and the recovery of native endemic fish populations: the Project Cipriver in the southwest 6 Conservation guidance 39 | No trigger species were found in 43% of all investigated sites. Especially, the situation of the KBA sites in the northwestern part of the Douro river basin is alarming and a further investigation is needed to assess trigger species abundance and to re-evaluate their status as KBA site. The southwestern part of the Douro basin is characterized by a high number of trigger and threatened species, and several investigated regions in this part of the Douro basin should be recognized as KBA site to protect the existing freshwater biodiversity. Freshwater KBA sites have a high conservation importance, but clear distribution data for the trigger species is necessary and active monitoring and coordination are needed to better conserve the present biodiversity. This study assessed the status of freshwater biodiversity in ten Key Biodiverisity Areas of the Douro river basin and four potential Key Biodiversity Areas (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017). The findings paint a somber picture of the situation in the Douro river basin. The native and endemic species are being outcompeted by non-native species, and suffering from habitat eutrophication and sedimentation due to agricultural and forestry activities. High water consumption and climate change have caused water shortage and droughts, leaving several streams and pools dry during the summer months. Physical barriers and dams are blocking the migration of many endemic species, isolating freshwater species populations and making them more prone to genetic erosion and local extinction. 7 Conclusions Sampling along the Douro river \u00a9 Ronaldo Sousa 40 | References Instituto da \u00c1gua (INAG), I.P.

It provides public, private and non-governmental organisations with the knowledge and tools that enable human progress, economic development and nature conservation to take place together. Created in 1948, IUCN is now the world\u2019s largest and most diverse environmental network, harnessing the knowledge, resources and reach of 1,400 Member organisations and some 15,000 experts. It is a leading provider of conservation data, assessments and analysis. Its broad membership enables IUCN to fill the role of incubator and trusted repository of best practices, tools and international standards. IUCN provides a neutral space in which diverse stakeholders including governments, NGOs, scientists, businesses, local communities, indigenous peoples\u2019 organisations and others can work together to forge and implement solutions to environmental challenges and achieve sustainable development. Working with many partners and supporters, IUCN implements a large and diverse portfolio of conservation projects worldwide. Combining the latest science with the traditional knowledge of local communities, these projects work to reverse habitat loss, restore ecosystems and improve people\u2019s well-being. www.iucn.org https://twitter.com/IUCN/ IUCN Species Survival Commission With over 10,500 Members, the Species Survival Commission (SSC) is the largest of the six expert Commissions of IUCN and enables IUCN to influence, encourage and assist societies to conserve biodiversity by building knowledge on the status and threats to species, providing advice, developing policies and guidelines, facilitating conservation planning, and catalysing conservation action. Members of SSC belong to one or more of the 160+ Specialist Groups, Red List Authorities, Task Forces and Conservation Committees, each focusing on a taxonomic group (plants, fungi, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fishes and invertebrates), or a disciplinary issue, such as sustainable use and livelihoods, reintroduction of species, wildlife health, climate change and conservation planning. https://www.iucn.org/our-union/commissions/species-survival-commission https://twitter.com/iucnssc IUCN Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation The IUCN Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation (IUCN-Med) opened in Malaga (Spain) in October 2001 with the core support of the Spanish Ministry of Environment and the regional Government of Junta de Andaluc\u00eda.

These sites, either identified as Key Biodiversity Areas1 (KBA) or potential KBA (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017) were assessed on their effectiveness in containing important populations of KBA trigger species2 and threatened species. For this, biodiversity surveys of the taxa used to identify freshwater KBA sites (fishes, molluscs, odonates, and aquatic plants) were undertaken in selected sampling sites. A total of 122 species were recorded in 43 sampling sites, including 82 aquatic plant species, 15 fish species, 12 dragonflies and damselflies species, 2 crayfish species, 5 bivalve species, and 6 gastropod species. Eleven of these species (8 fish, 1 bivalve, 1 odonate and 1 aquatic plant) are classified as threatened with extinction on the IUCN Red List of Threatened SpeciesTM. A total of 7 non-native species were also recorded. Among the 14 investigated sites, the KBA sites Malcata and Montesinho e Nogueira were the sites with the highest total species richness (45 and 42 species, respectively). Taking out the aquatic plant species richness (observed only in a few KBA sites) the highest total species richness was still found in KBA sites Malcata and Serras de Montesinho e Nogueira, but also in the potential KBA R\u00edo Yeltes and the KBA Sierra de Gredos y Candelario. Five investigated sites sheltered the highest number of threatened species: potential KBA R\u00edo Yeltes and the 4 KBA sites Malcata, El Rebollar, Sierra de Gredos y Candelario and Sierra de la Cabrera. The highest number of non-native species were found in the KBA sites Fuentes Carrionas and Sierras de Pe\u00f1a Labra", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cbab2d24-5033-45db-b492-008374f5b97a": {"__data__": {"id_": "cbab2d24-5033-45db-b492-008374f5b97a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-economic-briefs-south-africa-efficiency-beach-clean-ups-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "MARPLASTICCs Economic Briefs - South Africa - Efficiency of beach clean-ups and deposit refund schemes", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-economic-briefs-south-africa-efficiency-beach-clean-ups-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ba16ce75e9dc88650913dc0d12cb8c85e2fce6659394917c7ea5a1bdba08100a"}, "3": {"node_id": "2ac2a5ed-6990-4170-b841-afb4e5911392", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-economic-briefs-south-africa-efficiency-beach-clean-ups-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1172d0f1dd7a67cdb5fecb4c7a043909cdb5c83a7ef8a0f57f27b3f5c2b8f128"}}, "hash": "462c0607ff42f5f3fc60e3c08b52a965db5757ee79efc9dfba0f547adb77888b", "text": "y del Cordel, with KBA Fuentes Carrionas having a higher number of non-native than native species. Concerning Habitat Quality (HQA) from the River Habitat Survey (RHS), the KBA El Rebollar and the potential KBA R\u00edo Yeltes recorded the highest habitat quality. However, these investigated sites (El Rebollar and R\u00edo Yeltes) did also show high scores of Habitat Modification (HMI), only being outnumbered by the KBAs Malcata and Sierras de Pe\u00f1a Labra y del Cordel. Lowest Habitat Modification scores (HMI) were found in KBAs Sierras de Urbi\u00f3n, Cebollera y Neila and Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del R\u00edo Lobos. The study shows worrying results on the status of freshwater biodiversity. No trigger species was found in 43% of all investigated sites surveyed in the Douro river basin. Recognizing that freshwater KBAs have high conservation importance, we identify the shortcomings, which mainly relate to either flawed or lack of distribution data for the trigger species. Trigger species were found in all four investigated sites that were considered as potential KBA (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017), but that are not included as such in the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas. The results of this study support the need for the incorporation of these sites as KBA to help focus conservation efforts and promote management actions that allow the persistence of the biodiversity elements present. On the other hand, no trigger species were detected in several KBA sites, particularly in the northern part of the Douro river basin. In two KBAs (Sierra de Gredos y Candelario and Malcata), the trigger species were not recorded because the habitat where the species normally occurs was not sampled. In 5 KBA sites (Babia-Somiedo, Fuentes Carrionas, Sierras de Pe\u00f1a Labra y del Cordel, Sierras de Urbi\u00f3n, Cebollera y Neila and Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del R\u00edo Lobos) no trigger species was found even after intensive sampling.

V | V | V | other threatened species were detected, which should be added as biodiversity elements in the KBA profiles. A total of 11 threatened species were found in the investigated sites, including 8 fish species: Achondrostoma arcasii (VU), Achondrostoma salmantinum (EN), Anguilla anguilla (CR), Cobitis calderoni (EN), Cobitis paludica (VU), Cobitis vettonica (EN), Pseudochondrostoma duriense (VU), Squalius alburnoides (VU), 1 bivalve species Margaritifera Margaritifera (EN), 1 odonate species Macromia splendens (VU) and 1 aquatic plant species Eryngium viviparum (EN). Besides the ones that were already identified as trigger species for the freshwater KBA sites, including the gastropod species Iberhoratia aurorae (DD), there were 3 threatened species that could qualify as trigger species: 2 fish species Anguilla anguilla (CR), Squalius alburnoides (VU) and 1 odonate species Macromia splendens (VU). The presence of the Critically Endangered european eel (Anguilla anguilla) is however puzzling since two specimens were detected in one of the KBA sites (Serras de Montesinho e Nogueira). Possible explanations are that it is either specimens introduced by man or some eels were able to pass all the dams in the Douro river basin and travel until the Sanabria lake. Further investigation is needed to better understand the current distribution of the european eel in the Douro river basin.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ac2a5ed-6990-4170-b841-afb4e5911392": {"__data__": {"id_": "2ac2a5ed-6990-4170-b841-afb4e5911392", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-economic-briefs-south-africa-efficiency-beach-clean-ups-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "MARPLASTICCs Economic Briefs - South Africa - Efficiency of beach clean-ups and deposit refund schemes", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-economic-briefs-south-africa-efficiency-beach-clean-ups-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ba16ce75e9dc88650913dc0d12cb8c85e2fce6659394917c7ea5a1bdba08100a"}, "2": {"node_id": "cbab2d24-5033-45db-b492-008374f5b97a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-economic-briefs-south-africa-efficiency-beach-clean-ups-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "462c0607ff42f5f3fc60e3c08b52a965db5757ee79efc9dfba0f547adb77888b"}}, "hash": "1172d0f1dd7a67cdb5fecb4c7a043909cdb5c83a7ef8a0f57f27b3f5c2b8f128", "text": "The highest number of threatened species was found in the southwestern part of the Douro river basin, including in one potential KBA (R\u00edo Yeltes). At 2 KBA sites in the far northeastern part of the Douro river basin (Sierras de Urbi\u00f3n, Cebollera y Neila and Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del R\u00edo Lobos) no threatened species were recorded. Non-native species were identified as an important threat for the native freshwater biodiversity. A total of 7 non-native species were found during this study in the Douro river basin: 2 crayfish species (Pacifastacus leniusculus and Procambarus clarkii), 1 bivalve species (Corbicula fluminea) and 4 fish species (Barbatula barbatula, Gambusia holbrooki, Gobio lozanoi and Phoxinus bigerri). Non-native species were found in all but 3 investigated sites (potential KBA R\u00edo Corneja, KBA Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del R\u00edo Lobos, KBA Sierra de Gredos y Candelario). These findings suggest that some of the endemic species remaining in sub-basins are being replaced by non-native species.

The rivers and streams of the southern and eastern part of the Douro river basin suffer mostly from water shortage. In potential KBA R\u00edo Adaja, where a high number of the 2 trigger species was found, the rivers are completely dry in the summer. Since these potential KBAs form no part of other protective zones, incentives are necessary to safeguard the survival of the freshwater biodiversity that is crucial for the rest of the Douro river basin. On the other side, the western part of the Douro river basin suffers greatly from the large dams along the border between Spain and Portugal. Many of the populations of fish are isolated from the middle and lower sections of the Douro river basin, with an especially large impact on potamodromous migratory fish (species whose entire migration takes place in freshwater). KBA sites have high conservation importance but additional measures are necessary in order to preserve the freshwater biodiversity. Steps should be taken for the inclusion of KBA trigger species in the management plans of existing protected areas (Ramsar Sites, Natura 2000 sites, other national or regional protection figures) and the inclusion of KBA sites in river basin management plans. This will ensure more appropriate planning and correct allocation of funds for nature conservation. Furthermore, management plans to control or even eradicate non-native species should be designed promplty and implemented. Finally, obsolete dams and barriers should be selected for decommissioning, and building fish passages on barriers impermeable to fish should be promoted.

Of these sites, only 2 have been identified as freshwater KBA with a focus on the conservation of freshwater biodiversity (BirdLife International, 2021). During the years 2018 and 2019, a team of experts on freshwater biodiversity surveyed several sampling sites in the entire Douro river basin to assess the status of freshwater biodiversity (Figure 1). The aim was to understand the current situation of the freshwater biodiversity in 10 Key Biodiversity Areas and 4 sites identified as potential KBAs (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017). These experts assessed the presence of freshwater trigger species, recorded the occurrence of fish, odonates, bivalves, crayfish and aquatic plants and determined the potential threats for these species (Table 1). Finally, they assessed the status of each site and gave recommendations on possible measures to better conserve freshwater biodiversity.

The microclimate allow for the cultivation of olives, almonds and grapes, the latter being used for the production of the famous Ribera del Duero and port wines (Louren\u00e7o-Gomes et al., 2015). The river also forms the natural border line between Spain and Portugal for 112 kilometers, and many important cities have been built along its river banks, including Valladolid, Zamora, Vila Nova de Gaia and Porto (Bordalo et al., 2006). Once a wild river bursting with wildlife, the Douro has been undergoing quite a change due to human intervention. Fifteen hydrodams have been built to regulate the water flow, generate hydroelectric power, and allow navigation through locks. Consequently, river connectivity was highly impaired (Cortes et al., 2019). The lower part of the Portuguese drainage is influenced by the Atlantic climate. The upper-middle part of the Portuguese and Spanish section is used for agriculture (mainly vineyards) with some tributaries subject to a semi-arid (Mediterranean climate) while others in mountain areas have more water availability (Andresen et al., 2004).

As for the disappearance of the trigger species, the many dams and barriers that are hindering their migratory seasonal patterns and the many stresses on the middle and lower sections of the R\u00edo Pisuerga should be the main impacts. Sedimentation caused by agriculture activities is probably also one of the main threats to the freshwater diversity. Conservation guidance This KBA site needs to be revaluated and surveyed in more detail seasonally for the presence of P. duriense. Trigger species should include A. arcasii, another threatened fish detected here. The management of non-native species, such as the fish Phoxinus bigerri and Gobio lozanoi, and the crayfish P. leniusculus; as well as the increase of the riparian buffer to avoid sedimentation in streams should be pursued as the main conservation measures.

Most of the fish communities of the remaining river sub-basins are declining fast and being replaced by non-native species. Here, we did not find any non-native species, but prevention measures should be developed given the presence of non-native species in the lower section of the river Tormes and the Douro watershed. Conservation guidance Although the site with the trigger species population was not visited, we contacted the authors that had described the species in 2007 and got confirmation about the population status. Therefore, the KBA site seems to be well evaluated but should include other fish trigger species such as Pseudochondrostoma duriense and Squalius alburnoides, both rarely found in other Douro KBA sites in Spain. Management plans for non- native crayfish and fish species should be implemented.

These dams might be disruptive for potamodromous migratory fish such as P. duriense or L. bocagei. The recent introduction of the signal crayfish might also have an important impact on the future of aquatic species in these basins. Conservation guidance The site is already protected. However a recent study mentions that the park should be extended downstream to include areas richer in diversity and abundance of threatened fish species. Therefore, ideally the KBA site should be extended 10-15 km downstream. The KBA should also include the Iberian Nase P. duriense as a trigger species, which has dramatically declined in the whole basin.

However, barriers in the lower Tera and Esla basin are now isolating freshwater species populations, making them more prone to genetic erosion and exposure to local extinction. Additionally, non-native species such as the signal crayfish P. leniusculus and the fish species P. bigerri and B. barbatula are already in other upper catchments of the Douro river basin and should arrive to this area shortly. Conservation guidance Management plans for potential non-native crayfish and fish should be implemented. An effort should be made to increase the connectivity of the River Tera to the River Douro, by selecting obsolete dams and barriers for decommissioning and building fish passages on barriers impermeable to fish.

T here is quite a difference in the freshwater biodiversity found in the distinct investigated sites. Consequently, the necessary measures to conserve the threatened biodiversity can be quite different between regions. An overview of identified threats can be found here: \u2022 Agricultural and forestry effluents: Eutrophication happening as a consequence of agricultural activities. \u2022 Droughts: mainly occurring in the tributaries in the middle part of the drainages (upper part in Portugal). \u2022 Dams and water management/use: several dams have been built to regulate the water flow, generate hydroelectric power, and allow navigation through locks. \u2022 Non-native species: several non-native fishes have invaded this river basin (Lepomis gibbosus, Gambusia holbrooki, Ameiurus melas, Sander lucioperca, Alburnus alburnus, Phoxinus bigerri and Barbatula barbatula). \u2022 Housing and urban areas. \u2022 Annual and perennial non-timber crops: the Spanish River Douro valley has great relevance from the point of view of agriculture with important cereal crops (wheat and barley), legumes, vineyards, sugar beets and alfalfa. \u2022 Livestock farming and ranching: in the Spanish River Douro valley, livestock is an important resource. It includes the exploitation of extensive sheep, pigs and cows. \u2022 Shipping lanes: the main Douro River in the Portuguese part, has a series of navigable locks, that impairs the river connectivity and has a severe impact on the migratory species populations (Petromyzon marinus, Alosa sp., Anguilla anguilla, Salmo trutta). \u2022 Hunting terrestrial animals: Hunting is an important activity in the region of Castilla. 5 Threats 37 | Finally, the southern KBA site Sierra de Gredos y Candelario and the southern potential KBA sites of R\u00edo Yeltes, R\u00edo Adaja, R\u00edo Corneja and R\u00edo Eresma exhibited high numbers of threatened species, with a relatively lower number of non-native species, except for some invertebrate species. Trigger species were found in all of the potential KBA sites. This part of the Douro river basin regions seem to be more affected by water shortage and sediment inputs from agriculture activities. Special attention should be given to the potential KBA site R\u00edo Adaja, that is mostly dry during the summer months, but the few permanent pools that remain, concentrate large abundances of fish. The pool numbers seem to be decreasing and the river will possibly dry completely over the course of the following years. The eastern part of the Douro river basin is equally alarming, not solely for the presence of non-native species but particularly for the high occurrence of freshwater threatened species. The northeastern KBA sites Serras de Montesinho e Nogueira and Sierra de la Cabrera are mostly threatened by the physical barriers that were built along the Spanish-Portuguese border, isolating freshwater species populations and making them more prone to genetic erosion and exposure to local extinction. In the southeastern KBA sites El Rebollar and Malcata, increased water usage and climate change have caused water shortage and droughts, and sedimentation caused by summer fires is negatively affecting the freshwater diversity in these sites. \u00a9 Manuel Lopes-Lima BIOPOLIS-CIBIO/InBIO 38 | of Salamanca.

A water management plan is needed to avoid part of river Ulcero within the KBA site Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del R\u00edo Lobos to dry out in the summer. This study provided an overview of the status of freshwater biodiversity in the Douro river basin, and on the effectiveness of KBA sites in conserving the trigger species and other threatened freshwater species. In the majority of sampling sites the freshwater trigger species were not recorded, and in half of the KBA sites the freshwater trigger species were not detected at all. In contrast, trigger species were detected in all four potential KBA sites (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017). A more detailed and comprehensive survey on trigger species is needed to detect and assess the abundance of these species for each KBA site. An update of the status of the KBA sites is necessary if the results show an absence or low abundance of the trigger species or any other threatened species. Furthermore, the investigated sites that were delineated as potential KBA (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017) should be nominated as KBA sites to conserve the high number of threatened freshwater species present. Other threatened species found in the KBA sites should be added as additional trigger species during the updating. Additionally, the area for some KBA sites (Babia-Somiedo, Malcata, Serras de Motesinho e Nogueira) has to be extended to include locations where trigger species occur. Further recognition of the high conservation importance of freshwater KBA sites is needed to strengthen the measures to preserve the freshwater biodiversity in the KBA sites. An intial step should be to include the KBA trigger species in the management plans of existing protected areas (Ramsar Sites, Natura 2000 sites, other national or regional protection schemes). It would be good to analyse the feasibility and convenience of including their monitoring as an indicator of conservation status of the site. KBA sites should also be included in the River Basin Management Plans, either as water bodies or as protected areas, to ensure that an appropriate planning of the basin is done and to ensure that enough water is allocated for the conservation of these sites and that no other measures in the plan harm these sites. One project in the Douro river basin already started with the protection and the recovery of native endemic fish populations: the Project Cipriver in the southwest 6 Conservation guidance 39 | No trigger species were found in 43% of all investigated sites. Especially, the situation of the KBA sites in the northwestern part of the Douro river basin is alarming and a further investigation is needed to assess trigger species abundance and to re-evaluate their status as KBA site. The southwestern part of the Douro basin is characterized by a high number of trigger and threatened species, and several investigated regions in this part of the Douro basin should be recognized as KBA site to protect the existing freshwater biodiversity. Freshwater KBA sites have a high conservation importance, but clear distribution data for the trigger species is necessary and active monitoring and coordination are needed to better conserve the present biodiversity. This study assessed the status of freshwater biodiversity in ten Key Biodiverisity Areas of the Douro river basin and four potential Key Biodiversity Areas (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017). The findings paint a somber picture of the situation in the Douro river basin. The native and endemic species are being outcompeted by non-native species, and suffering from habitat eutrophication and sedimentation due to agricultural and forestry activities. High water consumption and climate change have caused water shortage and droughts, leaving several streams and pools dry during the summer months. Physical barriers and dams are blocking the migration of many endemic species, isolating freshwater species populations and making them more prone to genetic erosion and local extinction. 7 Conclusions Sampling along the Douro river \u00a9 Ronaldo Sousa 40 | References Instituto da \u00c1gua (INAG), I.P.

It provides public, private and non-governmental organisations with the knowledge and tools that enable human progress, economic development and nature conservation to take place together. Created in 1948, IUCN is now the world\u2019s largest and most diverse environmental network, harnessing the knowledge, resources and reach of 1,400 Member organisations and some 15,000 experts. It is a leading provider of conservation data, assessments and analysis. Its broad membership enables IUCN to fill the role of incubator and trusted repository of best practices, tools and international standards. IUCN provides a neutral space in which diverse stakeholders including governments, NGOs, scientists, businesses, local communities, indigenous peoples\u2019 organisations and others can work together to forge and implement solutions to environmental challenges and achieve sustainable development. Working with many partners and supporters, IUCN implements a large and diverse portfolio of conservation projects worldwide. Combining the latest science with the traditional knowledge of local communities, these projects work to reverse habitat loss, restore ecosystems and improve people\u2019s well-being. www.iucn.org https://twitter.com/IUCN/ IUCN Species Survival Commission With over 10,500 Members, the Species Survival Commission (SSC) is the largest of the six expert Commissions of IUCN and enables IUCN to influence, encourage and assist societies to conserve biodiversity by building knowledge on the status and threats to species, providing advice, developing policies and guidelines, facilitating conservation planning, and catalysing conservation action. Members of SSC belong to one or more of the 160+ Specialist Groups, Red List Authorities, Task Forces and Conservation Committees, each focusing on a taxonomic group (plants, fungi, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fishes and invertebrates), or a disciplinary issue, such as sustainable use and livelihoods, reintroduction of species, wildlife health, climate change and conservation planning. https://www.iucn.org/our-union/commissions/species-survival-commission https://twitter.com/iucnssc IUCN Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation The IUCN Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation (IUCN-Med) opened in Malaga (Spain) in October 2001 with the core support of the Spanish Ministry of Environment and the regional Government of Junta de Andaluc\u00eda. The Centre\u2019s mission is to influence, encourage and assist Mediterranean societies to conserve and use sustainably the natural resources of the region and work with IUCN Members and cooperate with all other agencies that share the objectives of IUCN. www.iucn.org/mediterranean The conservation status of freshwater species and habitats in Key Biodiversity Areas at the Douro river basin The designation of geographical entities in this report, and the presentation of the material do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of IUCN or other participating organisations concerning the legal status of any country, territory, or area, or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries.

These sites, either identified as Key Biodiversity Areas1 (KBA) or potential KBA (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017) were assessed on their effectiveness in containing important populations of KBA trigger species2 and threatened species. For this, biodiversity surveys of the taxa used to identify freshwater KBA sites (fishes, molluscs, odonates, and aquatic plants) were undertaken in selected sampling sites. A total of 122 species were recorded in 43 sampling sites, including 82 aquatic plant species, 15 fish species, 12 dragonflies and damselflies species, 2 crayfish species, 5 bivalve species, and 6 gastropod species. Eleven of these species (8 fish, 1 bivalve, 1 odonate and 1 aquatic plant) are classified as threatened with extinction on the IUCN Red List of Threatened SpeciesTM. A total of 7 non-native species were also recorded. Among the 14 investigated sites, the KBA sites Malcata and Montesinho e Nogueira were the sites with the highest total species richness (45 and 42 species, respectively). Taking out the aquatic plant species richness (observed only in a few KBA sites) the highest total species richness was still found in KBA sites Malcata and Serras de Montesinho e Nogueira, but also in the potential KBA R\u00edo Yeltes and the KBA Sierra de Gredos y Candelario. Five investigated sites sheltered the highest number of threatened species: potential KBA R\u00edo Yeltes and the 4 KBA sites Malcata, El Rebollar, Sierra de Gredos y Candelario and Sierra de la Cabrera. The highest number of non-native species were found in the KBA sites Fuentes Carrionas and Sierras de Pe\u00f1a Labra", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "48ed668b-8da1-4e9f-b3b5-e5d054138e7e": {"__data__": {"id_": "48ed668b-8da1-4e9f-b3b5-e5d054138e7e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-economic-briefs-mozambique-marine-plastics-fisheries-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "MARPLASTICCs Economic Briefs - Mozambique - Marine plastics, fisheries and livelihoods", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-economic-briefs-mozambique-marine-plastics-fisheries-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "544814439ac91a1093944b27837520ce7f9638d5aa16cf0692442d8afc61cf12"}, "3": {"node_id": "7ba115fd-d4f9-4c16-abe1-b6f50156ac86", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-economic-briefs-mozambique-marine-plastics-fisheries-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7f8b3341d089377c2e9e9534aa1e8a382cd83c65f4847fc9c11d045be0f74fed"}}, "hash": "56a7532e0a643dc2c7676bcc0ed47cdf07689fae54d4a719602a05d04434e75a", "text": "y del Cordel, with KBA Fuentes Carrionas having a higher number of non-native than native species. Concerning Habitat Quality (HQA) from the River Habitat Survey (RHS), the KBA El Rebollar and the potential KBA R\u00edo Yeltes recorded the highest habitat quality. However, these investigated sites (El Rebollar and R\u00edo Yeltes) did also show high scores of Habitat Modification (HMI), only being outnumbered by the KBAs Malcata and Sierras de Pe\u00f1a Labra y del Cordel. Lowest Habitat Modification scores (HMI) were found in KBAs Sierras de Urbi\u00f3n, Cebollera y Neila and Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del R\u00edo Lobos. The study shows worrying results on the status of freshwater biodiversity. No trigger species was found in 43% of all investigated sites surveyed in the Douro river basin. Recognizing that freshwater KBAs have high conservation importance, we identify the shortcomings, which mainly relate to either flawed or lack of distribution data for the trigger species. Trigger species were found in all four investigated sites that were considered as potential KBA (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017), but that are not included as such in the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas. The results of this study support the need for the incorporation of these sites as KBA to help focus conservation efforts and promote management actions that allow the persistence of the biodiversity elements present. On the other hand, no trigger species were detected in several KBA sites, particularly in the northern part of the Douro river basin. In two KBAs (Sierra de Gredos y Candelario and Malcata), the trigger species were not recorded because the habitat where the species normally occurs was not sampled. In 5 KBA sites (Babia-Somiedo, Fuentes Carrionas, Sierras de Pe\u00f1a Labra y del Cordel, Sierras de Urbi\u00f3n, Cebollera y Neila and Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del R\u00edo Lobos) no trigger species was found even after intensive sampling.

V | V | V | other threatened species were detected, which should be added as biodiversity elements in the KBA profiles. A total of 11 threatened species were found in the investigated sites, including 8 fish species: Achondrostoma arcasii (VU), Achondrostoma salmantinum (EN), Anguilla anguilla (CR), Cobitis calderoni (EN), Cobitis paludica (VU), Cobitis vettonica (EN), Pseudochondrostoma duriense (VU), Squalius alburnoides (VU), 1 bivalve species Margaritifera Margaritifera (EN), 1 odonate species Macromia splendens (VU) and 1 aquatic plant species Eryngium viviparum (EN). Besides the ones that were already identified as trigger species for the freshwater KBA sites, including the gastropod species Iberhoratia aurorae (DD), there were 3 threatened species that could qualify as trigger species: 2 fish species Anguilla anguilla (CR), Squalius alburnoides (VU) and 1 odonate species Macromia splendens (VU). The presence of the Critically Endangered european eel (Anguilla anguilla) is however puzzling since two specimens were detected in one of the KBA sites (Serras de Montesinho e Nogueira). Possible explanations are that it is either specimens introduced by man or some eels were able to pass all the dams in the Douro river basin and travel until the Sanabria lake. Further investigation is needed to better understand the current distribution of the european eel in the Douro river basin.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7ba115fd-d4f9-4c16-abe1-b6f50156ac86": {"__data__": {"id_": "7ba115fd-d4f9-4c16-abe1-b6f50156ac86", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-economic-briefs-mozambique-marine-plastics-fisheries-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "MARPLASTICCs Economic Briefs - Mozambique - Marine plastics, fisheries and livelihoods", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-economic-briefs-mozambique-marine-plastics-fisheries-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "544814439ac91a1093944b27837520ce7f9638d5aa16cf0692442d8afc61cf12"}, "2": {"node_id": "48ed668b-8da1-4e9f-b3b5-e5d054138e7e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/marplasticcs-economic-briefs-mozambique-marine-plastics-fisheries-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "56a7532e0a643dc2c7676bcc0ed47cdf07689fae54d4a719602a05d04434e75a"}}, "hash": "7f8b3341d089377c2e9e9534aa1e8a382cd83c65f4847fc9c11d045be0f74fed", "text": "The highest number of threatened species was found in the southwestern part of the Douro river basin, including in one potential KBA (R\u00edo Yeltes).

Non-native species were identified as an important threat for the native freshwater biodiversity. A total of 7 non-native species were found during this study in the Douro river basin: 2 crayfish species (Pacifastacus leniusculus and Procambarus clarkii), 1 bivalve species (Corbicula fluminea) and 4 fish species (Barbatula barbatula, Gambusia holbrooki, Gobio lozanoi and Phoxinus bigerri).

These findings suggest that some of the endemic species remaining in sub-basins are being replaced by non-native species. The situation is especially alarming in the northern part of the Douro river basin.

The rivers and streams of the southern and eastern part of the Douro river basin suffer mostly from water shortage. In potential KBA R\u00edo Adaja, where a high number of the 2 trigger species was found, the rivers are completely dry in the summer. Since these potential KBAs form no part of other protective zones, incentives are necessary to safeguard the survival of the freshwater biodiversity that is crucial for the rest of the Douro river basin. On the other side, the western part of the Douro river basin suffers greatly from the large dams along the border between Spain and Portugal. Many of the populations of fish are isolated from the middle and lower sections of the Douro river basin, with an especially large impact on potamodromous migratory fish (species whose entire migration takes place in freshwater). KBA sites have high conservation importance but additional measures are necessary in order to preserve the freshwater biodiversity. Steps should be taken for the inclusion of KBA trigger species in the management plans of existing protected areas (Ramsar Sites, Natura 2000 sites, other national or regional protection figures) and the inclusion of KBA sites in river basin management plans. This will ensure more appropriate planning and correct allocation of funds for nature conservation. Furthermore, management plans to control or even eradicate non-native species should be designed promplty and implemented. Finally, obsolete dams and barriers should be selected for decommissioning, and building fish passages on barriers impermeable to fish should be promoted.

Finally, 64 Key Biodiversity Areas have been delineated in the Douro river basin, 9 are located in Portugal and 55 in Spain. Of these sites, only 2 have been identified as freshwater KBA with a focus on the conservation of freshwater biodiversity (BirdLife International, 2021). During the years 2018 and 2019, a team of experts on freshwater biodiversity surveyed several sampling sites in the entire Douro river basin to assess the status of freshwater biodiversity (Figure 1). The aim was to understand the current situation of the freshwater biodiversity in 10 Key Biodiversity Areas and 4 sites identified as potential KBAs (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017). These experts assessed the presence of freshwater trigger species, recorded the occurrence of fish, odonates, bivalves, crayfish and aquatic plants and determined the potential threats for these species (Table 1). Finally, they assessed the status of each site and gave recommendations on possible measures to better conserve freshwater biodiversity.

The microclimate allow for the cultivation of olives, almonds and grapes, the latter being used for the production of the famous Ribera del Duero and port wines (Louren\u00e7o-Gomes et al., 2015). The river also forms the natural border line between Spain and Portugal for 112 kilometers, and many important cities have been built along its river banks, including Valladolid, Zamora, Vila Nova de Gaia and Porto (Bordalo et al., 2006). Once a wild river bursting with wildlife, the Douro has been undergoing quite a change due to human intervention. Fifteen hydrodams have been built to regulate the water flow, generate hydroelectric power, and allow navigation through locks. Consequently, river connectivity was highly impaired (Cortes et al., 2019). The lower part of the Portuguese drainage is influenced by the Atlantic climate. The upper-middle part of the Portuguese and Spanish section is used for agriculture (mainly vineyards) with some tributaries subject to a semi-arid (Mediterranean climate) while others in mountain areas have more water availability (Andresen et al., 2004). The main threats are posed by big urban areas and severe pollution. 1 Introduction \u00a9 Manuel Lopes-Lima BIOPOLIS-CIBIO/InBIO 2 | Figure 1.

As for the disappearance of the trigger species, the many dams and barriers that are hindering their migratory seasonal patterns and the many stresses on the middle and lower sections of the R\u00edo Pisuerga should be the main impacts. Sedimentation caused by agriculture activities is probably also one of the main threats to the freshwater diversity. Conservation guidance This KBA site needs to be revaluated and surveyed in more detail seasonally for the presence of P. duriense. Trigger species should include A. arcasii, another threatened fish detected here. The management of non-native species, such as the fish Phoxinus bigerri and Gobio lozanoi, and the crayfish P. leniusculus; as well as the increase of the riparian buffer to avoid sedimentation in streams should be pursued as the main conservation measures.

Most of the fish communities of the remaining river sub-basins are declining fast and being replaced by non-native species. Here, we did not find any non-native species, but prevention measures should be developed given the presence of non-native species in the lower section of the river Tormes and the Douro watershed. Conservation guidance Although the site with the trigger species population was not visited, we contacted the authors that had described the species in 2007 and got confirmation about the population status. Therefore, the KBA site seems to be well evaluated but should include other fish trigger species such as Pseudochondrostoma duriense and Squalius alburnoides, both rarely found in other Douro KBA sites in Spain. Management plans for non- native crayfish and fish species should be implemented.

These dams might be disruptive for potamodromous migratory fish such as P. duriense or L. bocagei. The recent introduction of the signal crayfish might also have an important impact on the future of aquatic species in these basins. Conservation guidance The site is already protected. However a recent study mentions that the park should be extended downstream to include areas richer in diversity and abundance of threatened fish species. Therefore, ideally the KBA site should be extended 10-15 km downstream. The KBA should also include the Iberian Nase P. duriense as a trigger species, which has dramatically declined in the whole basin.

However, barriers in the lower Tera and Esla basin are now isolating freshwater species populations, making them more prone to genetic erosion and exposure to local extinction. Additionally, non-native species such as the signal crayfish P. leniusculus and the fish species P. bigerri and B. barbatula are already in other upper catchments of the Douro river basin and should arrive to this area shortly. Conservation guidance Management plans for potential non-native crayfish and fish should be implemented. An effort should be made to increase the connectivity of the River Tera to the River Douro, by selecting obsolete dams and barriers for decommissioning and building fish passages on barriers impermeable to fish.

Furthermore, these KBA sites suffer from siltation and increased conductivity caused by eutrophication due to nutrients and sediment loads from agriculture practices. T here is quite a difference in the freshwater biodiversity found in the distinct investigated sites. Consequently, the necessary measures to conserve the threatened biodiversity can be quite different between regions. An overview of identified threats can be found here: \u2022 Agricultural and forestry effluents: Eutrophication happening as a consequence of agricultural activities. \u2022 Droughts: mainly occurring in the tributaries in the middle part of the drainages (upper part in Portugal). \u2022 Dams and water management/use: several dams have been built to regulate the water flow, generate hydroelectric power, and allow navigation through locks. \u2022 Non-native species: several non-native fishes have invaded this river basin (Lepomis gibbosus, Gambusia holbrooki, Ameiurus melas, Sander lucioperca, Alburnus alburnus, Phoxinus bigerri and Barbatula barbatula). \u2022 Housing and urban areas. \u2022 Annual and perennial non-timber crops: the Spanish River Douro valley has great relevance from the point of view of agriculture with important cereal crops (wheat and barley), legumes, vineyards, sugar beets and alfalfa. \u2022 Livestock farming and ranching: in the Spanish River Douro valley, livestock is an important resource. It includes the exploitation of extensive sheep, pigs and cows. \u2022 Shipping lanes: the main Douro River in the Portuguese part, has a series of navigable locks, that impairs the river connectivity and has a severe impact on the migratory species populations (Petromyzon marinus, Alosa sp., Anguilla anguilla, Salmo trutta). \u2022 Hunting terrestrial animals: Hunting is an important activity in the region of Castilla. 5 Threats 37 | Finally, the southern KBA site Sierra de Gredos y Candelario and the southern potential KBA sites of R\u00edo Yeltes, R\u00edo Adaja, R\u00edo Corneja and R\u00edo Eresma exhibited high numbers of threatened species, with a relatively lower number of non-native species, except for some invertebrate species. Trigger species were found in all of the potential KBA sites. This part of the Douro river basin regions seem to be more affected by water shortage and sediment inputs from agriculture activities. Special attention should be given to the potential KBA site R\u00edo Adaja, that is mostly dry during the summer months, but the few permanent pools that remain, concentrate large abundances of fish. The pool numbers seem to be decreasing and the river will possibly dry completely over the course of the following years. The eastern part of the Douro river basin is equally alarming, not solely for the presence of non-native species but particularly for the high occurrence of freshwater threatened species. The northeastern KBA sites Serras de Montesinho e Nogueira and Sierra de la Cabrera are mostly threatened by the physical barriers that were built along the Spanish-Portuguese border, isolating freshwater species populations and making them more prone to genetic erosion and exposure to local extinction. In the southeastern KBA sites El Rebollar and Malcata, increased water usage and climate change have caused water shortage and droughts, and sedimentation caused by summer fires is negatively affecting the freshwater diversity in these sites. \u00a9 Manuel Lopes-Lima BIOPOLIS-CIBIO/InBIO 38 | of Salamanca.

A water management plan is needed to avoid part of river Ulcero within the KBA site Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del R\u00edo Lobos to dry out in the summer. This study provided an overview of the status of freshwater biodiversity in the Douro river basin, and on the effectiveness of KBA sites in conserving the trigger species and other threatened freshwater species. In the majority of sampling sites the freshwater trigger species were not recorded, and in half of the KBA sites the freshwater trigger species were not detected at all. In contrast, trigger species were detected in all four potential KBA sites (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017). A more detailed and comprehensive survey on trigger species is needed to detect and assess the abundance of these species for each KBA site. An update of the status of the KBA sites is necessary if the results show an absence or low abundance of the trigger species or any other threatened species. Furthermore, the investigated sites that were delineated as potential KBA (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017) should be nominated as KBA sites to conserve the high number of threatened freshwater species present. Other threatened species found in the KBA sites should be added as additional trigger species during the updating. Additionally, the area for some KBA sites (Babia-Somiedo, Malcata, Serras de Motesinho e Nogueira) has to be extended to include locations where trigger species occur. Further recognition of the high conservation importance of freshwater KBA sites is needed to strengthen the measures to preserve the freshwater biodiversity in the KBA sites. An intial step should be to include the KBA trigger species in the management plans of existing protected areas (Ramsar Sites, Natura 2000 sites, other national or regional protection schemes). It would be good to analyse the feasibility and convenience of including their monitoring as an indicator of conservation status of the site. KBA sites should also be included in the River Basin Management Plans, either as water bodies or as protected areas, to ensure that an appropriate planning of the basin is done and to ensure that enough water is allocated for the conservation of these sites and that no other measures in the plan harm these sites. One project in the Douro river basin already started with the protection and the recovery of native endemic fish populations: the Project Cipriver in the southwest 6 Conservation guidance 39 | No trigger species were found in 43% of all investigated sites. Especially, the situation of the KBA sites in the northwestern part of the Douro river basin is alarming and a further investigation is needed to assess trigger species abundance and to re-evaluate their status as KBA site. The southwestern part of the Douro basin is characterized by a high number of trigger and threatened species, and several investigated regions in this part of the Douro basin should be recognized as KBA site to protect the existing freshwater biodiversity. Freshwater KBA sites have a high conservation importance, but clear distribution data for the trigger species is necessary and active monitoring and coordination are needed to better conserve the present biodiversity. This study assessed the status of freshwater biodiversity in ten Key Biodiverisity Areas of the Douro river basin and four potential Key Biodiversity Areas (M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017). The findings paint a somber picture of the situation in the Douro river basin. The native and endemic species are being outcompeted by non-native species, and suffering from habitat eutrophication and sedimentation due to agricultural and forestry activities. High water consumption and climate change have caused water shortage and droughts, leaving several streams and pools dry during the summer months. Physical barriers and dams are blocking the migration of many endemic species, isolating freshwater species populations and making them more prone to genetic erosion and local extinction. 7 Conclusions Sampling along the Douro river \u00a9 Ronaldo Sousa 40 | References Instituto da \u00c1gua (INAG), I.P.
